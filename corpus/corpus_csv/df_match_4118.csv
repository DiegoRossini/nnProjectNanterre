1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was a game I enjoyed playing on an iPhone app that I thought was just too great and had to save it here for review.  A little background:  This was my 4th game against this particular opponent from Atlanta.  He played well and provided good competition each game, which is hard to find in some of the cell phone apps.  I had won the first two games where we played traditional offensives and defenses.  On the third game, my opponent started off the game playing only with his pawns and locked up the middle of the board and we each had control of different colored squares.  This threw me off since I haven't played this way much, and it cost me the game.  What you'll see here is the 4th game, and he tried the same technique.  This game ends with a beautiful mate combo."
