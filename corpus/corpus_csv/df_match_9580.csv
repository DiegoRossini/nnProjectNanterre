14,c6,c7c6,rn1q1rk1/pp2ppbp/2pp1np1/8/2PP1Bb1/2N1PN2/PP2BPPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 8,I'm not exactly sure what that was for other than perhaps to solidify the space that he had left. The move prevents the queens knight from going to c6 but in this position it was doubtful for me that it was going there in the first place.
15,O-O,e1g1,rn1q1rk1/pp2ppbp/2pp1np1/8/2PP1Bb1/2N1PN2/PP2BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 8,Castle

17,Qd2,d1d2,r2q1rk1/pp1nppbp/2pp1np1/8/2PP1Bb1/2N1PN2/PP1QBPPP/R4RK1 b - - 3 9,Idea is that perhaps form a battery with my bishop. Also it links up the rooks
18,e5,e7e5,r2q1rk1/pp1n1pbp/2pp1np1/4p3/2PP1Bb1/2N1PN2/PP1QBPPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 10,attacks pawn and bishop
19,dxe5,d4e5,r2q1rk1/pp1n1pbp/2pp1np1/4P3/2P2Bb1/2N1PN2/PP1QBPPP/R4RK1 b - - 0 10,Removes the threat on my bishop. The d file is opening up. this could be useful in the middle to end game.
20,dxe5,d6e5,r2q1rk1/pp1n1pbp/2p2np1/4p3/2P2Bb1/2N1PN2/PP1QBPPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 11,Bishop attacked again.
21,Bg3,f4g3,r2q1rk1/pp1n1pbp/2p2np1/4p3/2P3b1/2N1PNB1/PP1QBPPP/R4RK1 b - - 1 11,Looking back Bg5 seems slightly better.
22,Re8,f8e8,r2qr1k1/pp1n1pbp/2p2np1/4p3/2P3b1/2N1PNB1/PP1QBPPP/R4RK1 w - - 2 12,lining the rook up with a central file.

24,Bxf3,g4f3,r2qr1k1/pp1n1pbp/2p2np1/4p3/2P5/2N1PbBP/PP1QBPP1/R4RK1 w - - 0 13,Surprised me? I didn't think he would take the knight. My bishops are now lined up adjacently but they are not attacking the enemy king. Never the less I was happy to see the move.
25,Bxf3,e2f3,r2qr1k1/pp1n1pbp/2p2np1/4p3/2P5/2N1PBBP/PP1Q1PP1/R4RK1 b - - 0 13,Taking back material even
26,a5,a7a5,r2qr1k1/1p1n1pbp/2p2np1/p3p3/2P5/2N1PBBP/PP1Q1PP1/R4RK1 w - - 0 14,I can't understand that one. perhaps he is trying to get his rook out. A better move might have been Qe7.
27,Rad1,a1d1,r2qr1k1/1p1n1pbp/2p2np1/p3p3/2P5/2N1PBBP/PP1Q1PP1/3R1RK1 b - - 1 14,Forms a battery. Helps control the d file a little more.
