4,e6,e7e6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n1p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"A horrible move. Black should play Nxd4. I don't know what I was thinking, but I just felt like attacking."

Moving the knight loses a tempo and allows black to exchange queens. I would prefer the bishop on f4 or g5, but those squares are currently unavailable, so this move lets me defend and develop and now threatens the c7 pawn."
