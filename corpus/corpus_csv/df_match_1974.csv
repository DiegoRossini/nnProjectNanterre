4,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/8/2p1p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Mini-Tournament with fixed opening: KGD Mafia Defence. This is the initial position for the games.
5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/8/2p1p3/2B1PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 3,"I think than 3 Bc4 is the best option. This move puts pressure over a2-g8 diagonal (d5 and f7, specially) 3 ... Qh4+ is answered with Kf1 and the queen can take f4 with check (and e4, too), but I believe than that capture gives to the white tempos and attack by the open lanes. Obviously, 3 Nf3 is a good alternative (I played this move in several games in this mini-tournament, and I comment my game with jimmysaylor with this move). May be 3 Qf3, adding pressure in d5 and f7, is a playable move."
6,Qf6,d8f6,rnb1kbnr/pp1p1ppp/5q2/2p1p3/2B1PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 4,"Black attacks the f-pawn, but it's so early for move the queen and now, the black queen can be a good target for the white pieces. I offer now a pawn for development, but, for example, white can play without fear 4 fxe5 Qh5+ 5 Kf1 Qxe4 6 d3 Qxe5 7 Nf3 and, now, the e-column is open and white has big advantage in development. Of course, black has another alternatives for her fifth move. Black must create a plan with the move d5, freeing the bishops!"
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1kbnr/pp1p1ppp/5q2/2p1p3/2B1PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 3 4,"I prefer this development, attacking the weak square d5. I see, in several games of the tournament, the move f5; but 4 ... Qh4+ 5 Kf1 Qxe4 is threating bishop and f-pawn."
8,Qxf4,f6f4,rnb1kbnr/pp1p1ppp/8/2p1p3/2B1Pq2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,"This move is risky. Now, white can threat the queen with d3, but Qh4+ and Qd8. With 5. d4 the situation isn't equal, white looks better. But, I choice the next move for castle quickly and attack f7, where I seek the Achilles' foot."
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnb1kbnr/pp1p1ppp/8/2p1p3/2B1Pq2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,"Again, white had alternatives with d3 and d4. I choice protect h4, castle and, later, play in the center. May be, this plan isn't the better, but is sure."
10,Be7,f8e7,rnb1k1nr/pp1pbppp/8/2p1p3/2B1Pq2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 6,"Better is 5.... Nf6, acting over d5."
