And if 22. Ne7 , I simply play Kd7, while 22. f3 loses the queen.

It appears as if, even if white has a move, he can't use it to save the game. 

The only choice seems to be 22. Ke2, since after Qxf2 , 23. Kd1, QxQ, 24.QxQ, e6xf5, and despite the quality, black pawns should win but the game is still playable. 

But meybe black has an even better choice: after 22. Ke2, Nxf7... what? The threat is to win the white queen with the knight after the discovered check. 
So let's take a look at the possible moves for white.

A) 23. Rh1 doesn't help after Nxh1 , and now white have to choose between 
1) 24. Kd1, Qg1 , 25. Qe1, QxQ, 26. KxQ, and after RxN black wins, or 25. Ke2, and QxRa1 or even 25. ..., Qg4 , 26. Ke6, RxN and white cannot take the Nh1 because of Rf5 , Ke2 and Qg2 , winning the rook, or 
2) 24. Kd6, Qh3 , and now white again have to choose between 25. Ne3, Nf2 , 26. Ke2, Qf3 , 27. Ke1, QxRa1, winning, or 25. Qe3, QxN , 26. Kd2, Qf2 , 27. QxQ, and black wins because can save the h1 knight both with RxQ or NxQ (28. Rf1, Rf6!). 

Last chance for white: B) 23. Qb4, threatening the rook... but, while the simple RxN balances the material, Ne4  or Ng4  require more work (23. ..., Ng4 , 24. Kd3, RxN, 25. Rxe6, Rf3 , 26. Kc4, Ne3 , 27. RxN (Kc5, Rf5  and mate...).
