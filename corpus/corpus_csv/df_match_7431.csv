1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,The Classic of Classical openings:  The Giuoco Piano.  It is probably the most 'natural' opening of them all.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,The Classic of Classical openings:  The Giuoco Piano.  It is probably the most 'natural' opening of them all.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,The Classic of Classical openings:  The Giuoco Piano.  It is probably the most 'natural' opening of them all.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,The Classic of Classical openings:  The Giuoco Piano.  It is probably the most 'natural' opening of them all.
5,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,The Classic of Classical openings:  The Giuoco Piano.  It is probably the most 'natural' opening of them all.
6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,"The Two Knights' Defence - a most exciting, if risky, response to White's opening.  It practically guarantees a fun game for both sides."
7,Ng5,f3g5,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p1N1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 5 4,"(!?) For a long time this move was the subject of a fierce debate.  GM S. Tarrasch thought it a 'beginner's move', yet the thing packs a powerful punch.  The main alternative was considered to be 4.d4, but in more recent years, 4.d3 has been preferred, transposing into the Bishop's Opening.  I have an uneasy feeling some of the fun might have been taken out of the Two Knights' thereby."
8,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p1N1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 6 5,"(!?) This crazy-looking response is the signature move of the Traxler (Wilkes-Barre) Variation.  Black flatly ignores the threats against f7.  More usual is 4...d5, but 4...Nxe4 is an old move that might be worth a try sometime.  Of course, the move played was compulsory for this thematic tournament."
9,Bxf7+,c4f7,r1bqk2r/pppp1Bpp/2n2n2/2b1p1N1/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"White has three choices here: to take with the bishop, take with the knight, or temporise and hope for a more favorable moment to take on f7.  Less ambitious than taking with the Knight, the Bishop capture is considered safer, as the White King doesn't come under quite the vicious attack as in the other line.  Rather unambitious is the general verdict upon 5.d4."
10,Kf8,e8f8,r1bq1k1r/pppp1Bpp/2n2n2/2b1p1N1/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 1 6,"For me, an unexpected move - so unexpected, I didn't even notice that he had played it for a couple of moves.  As a result I'm not sure my response was the best.  The fact is, I've never encountered any theory on this move at all.  Yet it does make some kind of sense.  Instead of using the f-file, Black opts to free the Queen's diagonal to h4."
11,Bb3,f7b3,r1bq1k1r/pppp2pp/2n2n2/2b1p1N1/4P3/1B6/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQ - 2 6,"Although it isn't often played against 5...Ke7, 6.Bc4 might be OK in this line."
12,Qe7,d8e7,r1b2k1r/ppppq1pp/2n2n2/2b1p1N1/4P3/1B6/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 3 7,"White was still 'threatening' 7.Nf7, but this Q move seems the logical follow-up to Black's 5th."
13,d3,d2d3,r1b2k1r/ppppq1pp/2n2n2/2b1p1N1/4P3/1B1P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQ - 0 7,Bolstering the e-pawn against the likely retreat of the g5-knight.  Also opens a line for the c1-bishop.
14,Nd4,c6d4,r1b2k1r/ppppq1pp/5n2/2b1p1N1/3nP3/1B1P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 1 8,Black has plans that involve White's bishop at b3...
15,Nc3,b1c3,r1b2k1r/ppppq1pp/5n2/2b1p1N1/3nP3/1BNP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 2 8,"(?!)  Developing, yet I was almost at once dissatisfied with this move.  I even commented to Freddy that this move seemed misplaced, theough he allowed he might well have played it himself.  Shortly after this I felt that I really needed the c-pawn free to strike at the centre.  Preferable, then, seems the move I seriously considered playing instead: 8.Nd2."
16,a5,a7a5,r1b2k1r/1pppq1pp/5n2/p1b1p1N1/3nP3/1BNP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 9,Part of Black's plan.  Also good was 8...d6.
17,O-O,e1g1,r1b2k1r/1pppq1pp/5n2/p1b1p1N1/3nP3/1BNP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 9,"Worth a look might have been 9.Bc4, but it isn't the sort of move that leaps to the eye exactly, having moved it 3 times to its present location.  I didn't like advancing the a-pawn, either,  on account of having to recapture 'away from the centre' after 9.a3 Nxb3."
18,d6,d7d6,r1b2k1r/1pp1q1pp/3p1n2/p1b1p1N1/3nP3/1BNP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 10,Freeing up the c8-bishop.  Black is developing a very lively game.
19,Be3,c1e3,r1b2k1r/1pp1q1pp/3p1n2/p1b1p1N1/3nP3/1BNPB3/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 10,"(!?) A developing move to strike at Black's imposing centre.  Yet maybe 10.Nd5 ought to have been preferred, to keep up the pressure on f7: 10.Nd5 Nxd5 11.Bxd5 c6 12.c3 cxd5 13.cxd4 Bxd4 14.exd5 and White's game is looking good.  Such a line would seem to vindicate White's 8th move."
20,Bg4,c8g4,r4k1r/1pp1q1pp/3p1n2/p1b1p1N1/3nP1b1/1BNPB3/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 2 11,"(!) Inducing the advanced knight to retreat.  Very annoying, but not unexpected.  Black has about an even game despite the pawn minus."
21,Nf3,g5f3,r4k1r/1pp1q1pp/3p1n2/p1b1p3/3nP1b1/1BNPBN2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 3 11,"I could find nothing better than this.  I didn't like the thought of 11...Bxf3 12.gxf3 Qd7 or 11...Nxf3+ 12.gxf3 Bh3, even though such situations sometimes turn out rather well for the open g-file.  I just didn't fancy it at all.  As it turned out, Black had something else altogether in mind."
22,Qe8,e7e8,r3qk1r/1pp3pp/3p1n2/p1b1p3/3nP1b1/1BNPBN2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 4 12,(!?) Quite unexpected.  What dastardly scheme had Black in mind?  You can rely on it that the was some malice aforethought in this retrograde step.
23,Bxd4,e3d4,r3qk1r/1pp3pp/3p1n2/p1b1p3/3BP1b1/1BNP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 12,Deciding to relieve some of the tension in the centre.  At least now the K-side pawns won't be weakened.  All this rather worried me though.  What made Black decline to capture at f3?
24,exd4,e5d4,r3qk1r/1pp3pp/3p1n2/p1b5/3pP1b1/1BNP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 13,"All of a sudden I didn't like my game at all.  That bishop at b3 was becoming something of a problem - standing like the condemned, in front of a wall with the firing squad loading their rifles."
