1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,In my opinion the best first move for white. White takes control of the central square d5 and opens the diagonal a4-d1. As we will see in this game 1. c4 ... not necessarily turns into an English Opening.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,White strengthens the control of the centre.
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 2,White strengthens the control of the centre.
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Probably black wants to play 3. ... d5 -  Queens Gambit style. If white wants to avoid this he can play 3. e4 ... . That would be the sharp Mikenas-Carls-attack.
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2P5/2N2N2/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,Queens Gambit style as I supposed. Now 4. d4 ... would have turned the game into a real Queens Gambit. But as an English Opening fan I wanted to remain in my prefered structures.
6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2P5/2N2N2/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,Queens Gambit style as I supposed. Now 4. d4 ... would have turned the game into a real Queens Gambit. But as an English Opening fan I wanted to remain in my prefered structures.
7,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3P4/8/2N2N2/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,I think 4. ... exd5 would have been better because this allows white to develop while attacking the black knight.
8,Nxd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4p3/3n4/8/2N2N2/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,I think 4. ... exd5 would have been better because this allows white to develop while attacking the black knight.
9,e4,e2e4,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4p3/3n4/4P3/2N2N2/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,As an English Opening fan I prefer the white bishops fianchetto. But now the diagonal a8-h1 is blocked by my own pawn e4. So I decided to take more control of the centre by 7. d4 ... and then to develop the white bishop on the diagonal a6-f1.
10,Nxc3,d5c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/4P3/2n2N2/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,As an English Opening fan I prefer the white bishops fianchetto. But now the diagonal a8-h1 is blocked by my own pawn e4.

13,d4,d2d4,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4p3/8/3PP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,The best square for the bishop in this case because now the bishop directly aims at the black kings fortress. Very important in this game as we will see.
14,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4p3/8/3PP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 1 8,The best square for the bishop in this case because now the bishop directly aims at the black kings fortress. Very important in this game as we will see.

16,b6,b7b6,rnbq1rk1/p1p1bppp/1p2p3/8/3PP3/2PB1N2/P4PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 9,Now I could have developed slowly by 9. 0-0 ... and so on. But in positions like this there is a tactical trick basing on h2-h4. So I decided to chance my luck...
17,e5,e4e5,rnbq1rk1/p1p1bppp/1p2p3/4P3/3P4/2PB1N2/P4PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 9,In general not really a good move because the pawn moves for the second time in the opening and white loses control of the white squares d5 and f5. But in this special case this move is a preparation of h2-h4 because it opens the diagonal b1-h7.
18,Bb7,c8b7,rn1q1rk1/pbp1bppp/1p2p3/4P3/3P4/2PB1N2/P4PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 1 10,The thematic move! Aronian style.:-) The positon is absolutely malicious because now only 10. ... h6 would have been enough to prevent black from a tactical disaster.

21,Bxh7+,d3h7,r2q1rk1/pbpnbppB/1p2p3/4P3/3P3P/2P2N2/P4PP1/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 11,I wonder if my opponent was only surprised or shocked.
22,Kxh7,g8h7,r2q1r2/pbpnbppk/1p2p3/4P3/3P3P/2P2N2/P4PP1/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 12,11. ... Kh8 12. Bc2 ... with the idea 13. h5 ...

27,hxg5,h4g5,r2q1rk1/pbpn1pp1/1p2p3/4P1PQ/3P4/2P5/P4PP1/R1B1K2R b KQ - 0 14,Or 14. ... f5 15. g6 ...
28,f6,f7f6,r2q1rk1/pbpn2p1/1p2pp2/4P1PQ/3P4/2P5/P4PP1/R1B1K2R w KQ - 0 15,Or 14. ... f5 15. g6 ...
