1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Two years ago, when my rating was in the 1500s I dreamed of getting at the very least an Expert Draw and possibly a win against an Expert.  Ion was the first Expert I played against and boy how green I was!  My very first game against him was Battle of the Wings in which we fought a close rook and pawn ending with Ion's kingside pawn majority closer to promotion than my queenside majority.  I therefore lost that game.  Since then it has been heartache, heartache and more heartache with me making some very silly mistakes in my games against him and there were a couple of games I could have drawn but I blew it big time.  Soon Ion was leading me by a mighty 13 points to ZILCH!  I repeat ZILCH!  Well, it is Zilch no longer and not even Ion can take that half point away from me.  This is happiness!  This game was a brevity (terminated in less than 20 moves but it was a forced draw by perpetual check).  Anyhow, I will start further commentary on move 7 when I played Nc3 in response to Ion's Rf8."

Hmm, if Ion had played that I had Nxh7 then if Nxh7 then Qh5+ pocketing the knight next move.  A similar thing happened to me in my game against Nuntar, viz:- http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=12791594&fb=1&rnd=0.08891115575838959 so I thought that would be a good way to learn my lesson - lump it on the Coach.  But he crosses my plan with Nxd5."

I can see why he thought I might have a good game.  I decide on Nxh7 after all because I can see Ion's King and the Wicked Witch of the West lined up nicely on that h5-d8 diagonal for a possible skewer.

However I now condemn Ion to a Low Draw by Perpetual Check as follows:- Variation A 17. Qf5+ Ke8 18. Qe6+ Kf8 19. Qf5+ Kg8 20. Qe6+ Kh7 21. Qf5+ Kh8 22. Qh3+ Kg8 23. Qe6+ If he tries to duck it here is:- Variation B 17. Qf5+ Kg8 18. Qe6+ Kh7 19. Qf5+ g6 20. Qf7+ Kh8 21. Bf6#.  Commiserations and bad luck Ion.  Do you the Inquest Jury suggest a better alternative to Qa5 - I suggested Qc7 - do you the Jury agree?  I now play Ion as black and I think I will need to play out of my skin to avoid a backlash!  Anyhow, time for some sweet dreams.  Bye for now - Joanne"
