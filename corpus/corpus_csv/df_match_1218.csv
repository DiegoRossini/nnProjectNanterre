1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"My usual, as always."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,And we have a Sicilian for the match.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"This is the Open Variation, the most commonly leading into the Dragon, Najdorf or Classical lines."
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,This leads into the Dragon-Najdorf lines.
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"I'm most comfortable with this. Lately I've been wondering about another varation called the Canal-Sokolsky Attack, where White plays Bb5+ here, usually met by Bd7, Bxd7+, Qxd7, with White having a few options for development on his 5th... But that is an annotation for another time."
6,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,This is common.
7,Nxd4,f3d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"And of course, why would you not take the pawn?"
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"Development, and forces White to defend the pawn."
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,Which I do here. White rarely has to worry about a Bb4 pin in the Sicilian anyway.
10,a6,a7a6,rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"And here we begin the Najdorf variation. The Dragon Variation is more of a defensive line, responding with 5... g6, planning to fianchetto his DSB and to O-O right away. The Najdorf is a lot more aggressive, planning to berate White's knight via e5, but plays a6 in order to stop any of White's pieces from hitting b5..."
11,Be3,c1e3,rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"My reply is the English Attack. This is my favorite response to the Sicilian (particularly Najdorf), because I find it preserves White's ability to counter any aggressive moves from Black, while still being able to advance on ground of his own. It also stops Black from moving the Queen to b6 (Qb6? Nb3!), so White's dark bishop becomes particularly powerful in these lines."
12,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"This move frees Black's dark bishop, and allows ...d5 to be a possible move."
13,f3,f2f3,rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,And this prevents an annoying Ng4! after Black plays e5.
14,b5,b7b5,rnbqkb1r/5ppp/p2ppn2/1p6/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,Black decides to start a pawn storm on my knights.
15,Qd2,d1d2,rnbqkb1r/5ppp/p2ppn2/1p6/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 1 8,"I'm not overly worried about it, so I just continue with my development."
16,b4,b5b4,rnbqkb1r/5ppp/p2ppn2/8/1p1NP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 9,And he hits my knight.
17,Na4,c3a4,rnbqkb1r/5ppp/p2ppn2/8/Np1NP3/4BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 1 9,"Opening theory normally scolds us for putting knights up against a wall, but this is a good square for the knight, allowing White to contest much of the queenside, and Black must defend carefully."
18,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bqkb1r/3n1ppp/p2ppn2/8/Np1NP3/4BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 2 10,"Likewise, this move allows development, countering the influence of my Na4, and also allows defense of b4 via Rb8."
19,O-O-O,e1c1,r1bqkb1r/3n1ppp/p2ppn2/8/Np1NP3/4BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR1B1R b kq - 3 10,I decide now is a good time to castle.
20,Qa5,d8a5,r1b1kb1r/3n1ppp/p2ppn2/q7/Np1NP3/4BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR1B1R w kq - 4 11,"This freezes the Na4 in place, and threatens Qxa2. White cannot play Nc3, and the b4 pawn is further defended from a3 and c3. Now it's White's turn to defend carefully."
