1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I believe this game shows the importance of holding on to the initiative.

e4 - my standard opening, usually leading to some variation of the scotch game, which I prefer as it leads to an open game"
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"opens with the Sicilian, one of the most popular black responses"
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"At this point I normally play d4, leading to a position similar to Scotch opening so familiar to me, but I decided to do something more attacking and initiative grabbing, I opted for the more active Bb5, challenging the knight's desire to dominate d4."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"At this point I normally play d4, leading to a position similar to Scotch opening so familiar to me, but I decided to do something more attacking and initiative grabbing, I opted for the more active Bb5, challenging the knight's desire to dominate d4."
5,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,"At this point I normally play d4, leading to a position similar to Scotch opening so familiar to me, but I decided to do something more attacking and initiative grabbing, I opted for the more active Bb5, challenging the knight's desire to dominate d4."
6,Qb6,d8b6,r1b1kbnr/pp1ppppp/1qn5/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,"Black played Qb6, possibly to keep the pressure on d4, and also on the bishop which had no support."
7,Bxc6,b5c6,r1b1kbnr/pp1ppppp/1qB5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,"I could have tried Nc3 supporting the bishop and developing another piece, but opted instead to exchange as I liked the idea of black having to tie up a major piece like a queen to bolster d4. Also, after the exchange, I would have had one knight out as opposed to his having an exposed queen out."
8,Qxc6,b6c6,r1b1kbnr/pp1ppppp/2q5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"A bit surprised with the queens move, as this makes it blocked behind the c pawn, and losing control of the black diagonals. Also doubled c file pawns is not that bad, as they can exert influence on d5, and help with the eventual pawn break. Perhaps he was hoping to take out e4 for an easy kill."
9,Nc3,b1c3,r1b1kbnr/pp1ppppp/2q5/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,"Out comes another knight. Now I have two minor pieces out, as opposed to zero for him. Plus, the option to castle quickly as needed, giving me a lead in development."
10,Nf6,g8f6,r1b1kb1r/pp1ppppp/2q2n2/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 6,"Continues the attack on e4, and preparing to castle himself"
11,d3,d2d3,r1b1kb1r/pp1ppppp/2q2n2/2p5/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"easy enough to defend with the d pawn, strengthening the center and also opening my DSbishop."
12,d6,d7d6,r1b1kb1r/pp2pppp/2qp1n2/2p5/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"Opening the LSB to possibly pin my knight on f3, and also bringing a minor piece to support c5."
13,h3,h2h3,r1b1kb1r/pp2pppp/2qp1n2/2p5/4P3/2NP1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,"stopping the bishop pin, at the expense of weakening the castled king in the future. But I like my knight where it was, and did not like to exchange with bishop as this was going to be a closed game, and as they say, knights are better than bishops in closed games."
14,e5,e7e5,r1b1kb1r/pp3ppp/2qp1n2/2p1p3/4P3/2NP1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"Asserting himself on d4, BUT 

1. Created a backward pawn on d6, and more importantly
2. Created a juicy hole on d5 for my knight."
15,Bg5,c1g5,r1b1kb1r/pp3ppp/2qp1n2/2p1p1B1/4P3/2NP1N1P/PPP2PP1/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 8,Preparing to embed my c3 knight on d5 by taking out the knight on f6 with the bishop (closed game - knights better)
16,Be7,f8e7,r1b1k2r/pp2bppp/2qp1n2/2p1p1B1/4P3/2NP1N1P/PPP2PP1/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 9,"Does not want to exchange with g7, hence the bishop. But this move does not stop my obvious plan."

23,c4,c2c4,r2bk2r/pp3ppp/2qpb3/2pNp3/2P1P3/3P1N1P/PP3PP1/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 12,"I want the knight there, and also further strengthen the center."
24,O-O,e8g8,r2b1rk1/pp3ppp/2qpb3/2pNp3/2P1P3/3P1N1P/PP3PP1/R2Q1RK1 w - - 1 13,"connecting the rooks, I could have chosen e2 as I was preparing to play on the king side, but I thought the queen could have a more active role on the dark diagonals in the meantime until black commits his black bishop to the queen side. This way the queen could go easily to either queen or king side depending on how black moves."
