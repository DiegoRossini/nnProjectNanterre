1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Here's a game I played in the first round of the Casual section in the 35th Tournament.

8,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/1pp2pp1/4p2p/p2p4/2BPP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,! White necessarily loses tempo. This opening principle is valid in this situation : one should develop Knights before Bishops. This move would have lost his power with Nc3.
