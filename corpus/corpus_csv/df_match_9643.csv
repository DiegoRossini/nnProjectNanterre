1. The e-pawn can no longer be protected by playing ...Nc6.
2. If you play the natural ...d6, the bishop on f8 is blocked in.

The move you have selected means that the other bishop is now blocked in and more time-consuming pawn moves will be required to free it. On the plus side, you are threatening to win a pawn."
