1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,With an unknown opponent I usually play e4. Must be the influence of Fischer...
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I am happy he avoids the Sicilian, as I don't see it very often, and don't feel as comfortable in it as I do ...e5."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,The almost-required move.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,And the most common reply.
5,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"Here white has a myriad of choices, but I like to play the Scotch, if given the chance."
6,Bd6,f8d6,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2nb4/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,"3...exd4 is the only move that keeps black equal, so this is a poor choice. Why is it bad? Although it does develop a piece, the bishop is misplaced on d6, and will have to move again to free the d-pawn. Black is already seriously cramped."
7,d5,d4d5,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2nb4/3Pp3/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"Black was probably hoping for dxe5 when the exchanges relieve his cramped space. Of course, I don't want to solve his problems for him, so I push rather than take. Not only does this avoid the exchanges, but it gains space in the center with tempo against the knight."
8,Nce7,c6e7,r1bqk1nr/ppppnppp/3b4/3Pp3/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"And black's lack of space continues. Now there is no place for the queen to develop to, except maybe c7."
9,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqk1nr/ppppnppp/3b4/3Pp3/4P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,Simply continuing with development: knights before bishops.
10,a6,a7a6,r1bqk1nr/1pppnppp/p2b4/3Pp3/4P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"A wasted move. The c3-knight is never going to b5 anyway, and this flank move ignores the center where the game is normally played."
11,Be2,f1e2,r1bqk1nr/1pppnppp/p2b4/3Pp3/4P3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"Preparing to castle short, as the center pawns point to the black queenside. It is normal to attack in the direction one's center pawns point."
12,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/1pppnppp/p2b1n2/3Pp3/4P3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 7,"Black also prepares to castle short, as it will take too much time to get all the pieces out of the way to castle long."
13,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqk2r/1pppnppp/p2b1n2/3Pp1B1/4P3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 3 7,"And I change my mind. Or at least, open my mind to the thought of castling long and pawn storming his kingside. I have a big advantage in both time and space, so an attack seems warranted."
14,Ng6,e7g6,r1bqk2r/1ppp1ppp/p2b1nn1/3Pp1B1/4P3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 4 8,"And instead of developing a new piece, he moves the same piece for the third time in the opening. That is a violation of opening principles that will be punished."
15,g3,g2g3,r1bqk2r/1ppp1ppp/p2b1nn1/3Pp1B1/4P3/2N2NP1/PPP1BP1P/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 8,"Of course I avoid the exchange on f6, as trading pieces reduces the influence of my space advantage. The side with more space should only trade in order to gain some other type of advantage instead. The text move does three things. First, it commits me to castling long and attacking his kingside with pawns. Second, it takes squares away from the g6-knight. Third, it prepares h4, as the pawn storm begins."
16,h6,h7h6,r1bqk2r/1ppp1pp1/p2b1nnp/3Pp1B1/4P3/2N2NP1/PPP1BP1P/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 9,"Putting the question to the bishop: what are your intentions? But in light of the coming pawn storm, this move is actually a weakening, as it gives me a target to shoot for."
17,Be3,g5e3,r1bqk2r/1ppp1pp1/p2b1nnp/3Pp3/4P3/2N1BNP1/PPP1BP1P/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 9,"And of course I don't trade on f6. This is a great square for the bishop, as he will support the pawns moving down the board."
18,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/1ppp1pp1/p2b1nnp/3Pp3/4P3/2N1BNP1/PPP1BP1P/R2QK2R w KQ - 2 10,"Castling ""into it"". But what choice did he have?"
19,Qd2,d1d2,r1bq1rk1/1ppp1pp1/p2b1nnp/3Pp3/4P3/2N1BNP1/PPPQBP1P/R3K2R b KQ - 3 10,The final preparation for castling. I still have the lead in development and an advantage in space. Only 10 moves into the game and black is in serious trouble.
20,Be7,d6e7,r1bq1rk1/1pppbpp1/p4nnp/3Pp3/4P3/2N1BNP1/PPPQBP1P/R3K2R w KQ - 4 11,"And he continues to ignore development of his queenside pieces. Maybe he thought this was a valuable defensive move to help protect his kingside, but getting his last two pieces into the game would have been more valuable."
