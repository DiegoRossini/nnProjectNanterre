1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

In the middlegame I won a pawn and my mating attack fizzled out.  It looked as if I would make no headway whatsoever.  Then John made a pawn move and allowed a rook incursion onto h7.  John tried to save his pawn but it lead to a rook fork on his king and knight.  He tried to save his knight by protecting it with his king only for him to lose his king, oops!  As before I attach a Computer Analysis Link to this annotation:- http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=13875778&rnd=0.42159364684212413"

11,Be3,c1e3,rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,6. Be3 - now Fou Lenoir comes out - black's last move to a6 was the Naijdorf (Kasparov liked that move).

At least this move connects my two rooks and with the queens off the board Henry is relatively safe on e2.

This would create another set of targets for black to defend.

Even I could see that move was bad although I had to analyse carefully before playing my rook to h7.  The rook move to h7 is very strong because it results in another pawn drop for black.
