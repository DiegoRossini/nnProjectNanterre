I think black's idea is unsound, but with near a 100 point difference between players (and in real strength there is a good chance that I have more than a 100 points on him because I have been rated as high as 1730 on that site), I thought it was a good time to try the idea.. White threatens to win material: d5xc6"
14,e5,e7e5,r1bq1rk1/ppp2pbp/2np1np1/3Pp3/2P2B2/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ e6 0 8,"Black's idea is to allow white to open up the game as black does the same. Once attacking lanes open up, the white king will be exposed in the center; Black threatens to win material: e5xf4"
15,dxc6,d5c6,r1bq1rk1/ppp2pbp/2Pp1np1/4p3/2P2B2/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 8,"I actually think that accepting the black idea can be done, but it offers black quite a bit. Probably safer is allowing the flipside to black's idea to come alive, the quick transfer of the c6-N to e7.  (8. Bg5 seems to be the best option White has: 8...Nb8 9. Be2 +/=)"

Also white cannot hope to control the b file with the queen, and castling kingside seems out of the question for white.  (Fritz says: 10... Rb8 ends the debate with 11. Qa3 Re8 -+)"

It's a fair amount of caveats, but interesting enough to be worth a try once.  (11... fxe3 12. fxe3 Qe7 13. Kd2 -+)"

I do not think this is good or bad. It is good as far as the black plan is disrupted, but it may be bad, as the new black plan can come rather quickly."
