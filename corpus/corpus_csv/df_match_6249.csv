1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Caro-Kann Defence. I've become familiar with this.

3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Advance Variation. I like this as Black because I need to worry less about tricky manoeuvring and more about the c5-d4 battle (my pawn will move to c5 soon). On ho!

6,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pPb2/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"(?!) I was a bit surprised by this. It's very interesting what he's done and I wasn't sure how to react. 5. ... f6 seemed to weaken my kingside more than needed, and I didn't want to play 5. ... Ne7 or 5. ... Be7 because I wanted my Bishop to be able to take at c5 once I pushed my c-pawn. So I played my favourite move of this opening."

10,Qb6,d8b6,rn2kbnr/pp3ppp/1qp1p3/3pPbB1/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,"I very much like the Qb6-Bc5 barrage aiming at f2. It cripples White if he can't castle fast enough. However, castling doesn't take much effort."
11,b3,b2b3,rn2kbnr/pp3ppp/1qp1p3/3pPbB1/3P4/1P3N2/P1P2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"I thought this move weakened important squares, however I later realised it was one of White's better options. 6. Qc1 is quite immobilising, and 6. Bc1 just wastes time developing the Bg5. He wants to keep that pawn."
12,Bb4+,f8b4,rn2k1nr/pp3ppp/1qp1p3/3pPbB1/1b1P4/1P3N2/P1P2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,(?!) Perhaps better is 6. ... c5.
13,Nfd2,f3d2,rn2k1nr/pp3ppp/1qp1p3/3pPbB1/1b1P4/1P6/P1PN1PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 2 7,"(?) Better is 7.c3, cleanly shunting off the Bb4 and strengthening d4. If 7. ... Bxb1 8. cxb4 Qxb4+ 9. Bd2 ... 10. Rxb1."

16,Bxc5,b4c5,rn2k1nr/pp3ppp/1q2p3/2bpPbB1/8/1P6/P1PN1PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 9,But now he has to worry about f2.

This queen may prove deadly in future, however, this pins the Nd2 to its spot, for if it moves, ... d2+ is a discovered attack on white's Queen. However, if it so happens that 16. Nc4 d2+ 17.
