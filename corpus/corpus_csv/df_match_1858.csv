1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This was a return match in the Walking the Walk & Learning to Run Welcome MT 11 see - http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/walking-the-walk-learning-to-run-welcome-mt-11?gm=54112. I was hoping that in this match I would last a few more moves.
