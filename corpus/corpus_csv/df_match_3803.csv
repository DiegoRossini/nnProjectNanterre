1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Sometimes there is no reason to lose a game other than perhaps we are playing more games than we are able to manage, or we are moving later at night or early in the morning. I lost this one for who knows what reason. The game was fairly even and I basically gave it away by not paying attention and noticing a really obvious threat. I do a d4 as I can handle a queen game better these days."
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,This usually means black is going to push his king bishop down and check me. It is annoying really. Not sure if I do the best thing but I do...
3,a3,a2a3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3P4/P7/1PP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"a3, and that matter is closed, though I would have preferred to move my knight out or move my pawn to c4. CAn't always get what we want in this game."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n1p3/8/3P4/P7/1PP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"He is doing well, with both his knights out. I have only moved out three pawns. Need to start developing some minor pieces."

7,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n1pn2/8/2PP4/P4N2/1P2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,He is going for a quick castle.
8,Bd6,f8d6,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2nbpn2/8/2PP4/P4N2/1P2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 3 5,He is going for a quick castle.

10,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2nbpn2/8/2PP4/P1N2N2/1P2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 5 6,He castles.

12,a6,a7a6,r1bq1rk1/1ppp1ppp/p1nbpn2/8/2PP4/P1N1PN2/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 0 7,"Not sure if he had to do that as I usually am not too aggressive with my knights, but it is a common move. I might have thought pawn to b6 and set up a fianchetto but this works too."
13,Bd3,f1d3,r1bq1rk1/1ppp1ppp/p1nbpn2/8/2PP4/P1NBPN2/1P3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 1 7,set up a castle and develop white bishop a bit.

I am not sure if this is a good or bad play on his part. Seems he has an covered minor piece a bit far down the board from his side."

I know the feeling and I used to be the same way, especially when the center of the board is all congested. Just trying to chip away at something. Mame something happen. These days I tend to find it is not the end of the world to let a congested board hang around for a while."

Things are even in material and I seem to be in a slightly better position and his king has become exposed. Maybe I get impatient and lax at the same time.
