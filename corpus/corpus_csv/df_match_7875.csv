1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Yesterday I got my 11th point out of 14 games in this Mini-Tournament.  I was playing black against Nuntar (Michael).   In this tournament there has been a minefield of tactics, especially forks to look out for.  Now, for all who know Glenda, you wouldn't believe she could be up to nasty tricks such as deadly forks would you?  Well read on.  We start the action on move 9 where I choose to play 9....... e6."
