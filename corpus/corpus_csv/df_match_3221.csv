1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The Queen game from my opponent, Blitzkov."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,I always do nf3 in a Queen Game.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,I can go Nimzo Attack or King's Indian.  It depends upon my mood at the time. Either work.
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,I felt at this day and time I needed to do the King's Indian Defense.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,Usual for the d4 development.
6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Usual line to prevent losing control over the center of the board.
7,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3P4/3P4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,Expected.
8,Nxd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/6p1/3n4/3P4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,It blocks and attacks (my knight).
9,g3,g2g3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/6p1/3n4/3P4/2N3P1/PP2PP1P/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,Perhaps Blitzkov is a fianchetto person here on his king side.  It takes time to develop a fianchetto.
10,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/6p1/3n4/3P4/2N3P1/PP2PP1P/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,The King's Indian is designed to use the fianchetto. I was later than earlier to start it.
11,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/6p1/3n4/3P4/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 2 6,So he does the fianchetto.
12,Nxc3,d5c3,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/6p1/8/3P4/2n3P1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 7,"I have pressure on his d4 pawn while making a trade to isolate his ""a"" rank pawn. Why not?"
13,bxc3,b2c3,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/6p1/8/3P4/2P3P1/P3PPBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 7,"So now his ""a"" rank pawn is isolated in a trade. I am happy so far."
14,e5,e7e5,rnbqk2r/ppp2pbp/6p1/4p3/3P4/2P3P1/P3PPBP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 8,With this move I make him trade queens at the outset before he can castle. He should not take my e5 pawn unless he wants to risk a centrally fixed king without shelter.
15,e3,e2e3,rnbqk2r/ppp2pbp/6p1/4p3/3P4/2P1P1P1/P4PBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 8,So he is ahead of my thinking and knows the fault there....
16,exd4,e5d4,rnbqk2r/ppp2pbp/6p1/8/3p4/2P1P1P1/P4PBP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 9,"I am playing a 14 year old. And is he smart!  When he came into GK I thought he was just an ego that needed an ego beating. 
So I do get a trade to open up my own fianchetto (the only time, usually, I ever employ the fianchetto is in the King's Indian Defense. It is a solid defense against d4 to date)."
17,cxd4,c3d4,rnbqk2r/ppp2pbp/6p1/8/3P4/4P1P1/P4PBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 9,He had to go this way. If he had done e3xd4 then his pawns (and pawn skeleton) would be compromised.
18,c5,c7c5,rnbqk2r/pp3pbp/6p1/2p5/3P4/4P1P1/P4PBP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 10,I do this to engage but mostly to allow my queen to move about the d8-a5 diagonal. At the same time I am still ready to do QxQ if d4 takes c5. In the latter case White can't really castle. In the former case ????
19,Bb2,c1b2,rnbqk2r/pp3pbp/6p1/2p5/3P4/4P1P1/PB3PBP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 1 10,"Another fianchetto move by blitzkov! Well, it is time to put him into check..."
20,Qa5+,d8a5,rnb1k2r/pp3pbp/6p1/q1p5/3P4/4P1P1/PB3PBP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 2 11,He can only do qd2 or just sit back for an onslaught.  By this time I know my 14 year old opponent is going for qd2.
