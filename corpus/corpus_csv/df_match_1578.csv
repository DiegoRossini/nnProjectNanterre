1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I am annotating this game for Zhanna - Zhannetka-84. This opening move, 1. d4 is fine. I usually play it myself!"
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"2. e3 is a bit passive. I would play 2. c4, and enter the Queen's Gambit. There are opening databases on Gameknot which can help you play the openings without making any major mistake."
3,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"2. e3 is a bit passive. I would play 2. c4, and enter the Queen's Gambit. There are opening databases on Gameknot which can help you play the openings without making any major mistake."
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"3. c3 is often played in this system, although I prefer to play Bd3 or Nf3, to develop a piece, or 3. f4 is more aggressive."
5,c3,c2c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3P4/2P1P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"3. c3 is often played in this system, although I prefer to play Bd3 or Nf3, to develop a piece, or 3. f4 is more aggressive."
6,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3p4/3P4/2P1P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Black seems to be playing follow my leader!
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3p4/3P4/2P1PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"4. Nf3 is good, developing a piece. However it does block the f pawn. I quite like the idea of playing f2-f4, Nf3, Bd3, 0-0 and then the Bc1 can come into play Bc1-d2-e1-h4. If black wasn't careful white would build up a good attacking position. In this game white's bishop on c1 is not very well placed."
8,Bd6,f8d6,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/2pbp3/3p4/3P4/2P1PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,Black breaks the symmetry!
9,Nbd2,b1d2,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/2pbp3/3p4/3P4/2P1PN2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 5,"5. Nb1-d2 is another sound developing move, but doesn't help the problem of what to do about this bishop on c1. b3 followed by Bc1-a3 was another option, but by moving the knight from b1 this is no longer an option as the knight defended a3."
10,f6,f7f6,rnbqk1nr/pp4pp/2pbpp2/3p4/3P4/2P1PN2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Nh4 is a bad move, just wasting time. Bd3 or Be2 was better."
11,Nh4,f3h4,rnbqk1nr/pp4pp/2pbpp2/3p4/3P3N/2P1P3/PP1N1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"Nh4 is a bad move, just wasting time. Bd3 or Be2 was better."

13,Nhf3,h4f3,rnbqk1nr/pp5p/2pbpp2/3p2p1/3P4/2P1PN2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 7,7. Nhf3 is a good move. It was the only square the knight could move to.

Generally it is better to open up the position after developing pieces and castling. f3 allows black to open up the position."
