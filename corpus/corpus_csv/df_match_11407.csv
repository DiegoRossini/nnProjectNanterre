15,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2Pp4/3P1NP1/PP3PBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 3 8,A typical benoni move pressurring e5.

22,Rc8,a8c8,2rq1rk1/pp2bppp/2n2n2/4p1B1/2Pp2b1/3P1NP1/PP1N1PBP/R2QR1K1 w - - 10 12,Developing his rook but probably not correct as this doesn't pressure white and white can develop his plan at ease. One try is h6 when at least black has the two bishops and he can try to bust open the center.
23,a3,a2a3,2rq1rk1/pp2bppp/2n2n2/4p1B1/2Pp2b1/P2P1NP1/1P1N1PBP/R2QR1K1 b - - 0 12,Preparing b4.

32,Rc7,c8c7,3qr1k1/1pr2pp1/p1n2b1p/4p3/1PPpN1b1/PQ1P1NP1/5PBP/R3R1K1 w - - 2 17,"Defending all the weaknesses but black plays passively, still it's hard to find a plan for black. Maybe Bxf3 giveing up the two bishops because the f3 knight will go to c4."
33,Nfd2,f3d2,3qr1k1/1pr2pp1/p1n2b1p/4p3/1PPpN1b1/PQ1P2P1/3N1PBP/R3R1K1 b - - 3 17,Heading to c4.

35,c5,c4c5,3qr1k1/2r2pp1/ppn2b1p/2P1p3/1P1pN1b1/PQ1P2P1/3N1PBP/R3R1K1 b - - 0 18,Clearing the c4 square.
