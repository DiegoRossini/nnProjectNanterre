It's mostly a conservative defense to e4, though I often try to spice it up a little."

3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,White achieves his goal of dominating the center with two pawns.
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"And Black says no way, you can't have the whole center like that.
But the reason I like the Caro-Kann more than the French (which would look the same except the back pawn is on e6 instead of c6) is that it doesn't block Black's bishops as badly."
5,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"Almost everyone either plays e5 or Nc3 against me. Less often, White trades the pawns.
What made me laugh is I just started a practice game with a team member where I'm giving him advice/lessons while we play, and this is the variation he chose, too."
6,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pPb2/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,I get my bishop developed before I play e6 and block it.

In this game, White plays the most common move. You've got to develop your pieces! And White puts his knight on its natural and best square."
8,e6,e7e6,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3pPb2/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"There's a new and unexpected move. I really don't mind trading away that bishop -- it's kind of in the way, but I don't want to have to capture back exf5 and mess up my pawn center. So my choices seem to be Ne7, Bg6, and Be4. 
I like that Ne7 develops a piece, but I'm not ready to block in my bishop yet and get in the way of my c5 plans."

If he plays Na2, I'm happy to trade bishops. I'm curious if he'll threaten my other bishop with Nh4 again. I don't think he would, because I'll just recapture with the knight. In this closed position, the knights are probably stronger than the bishops. But I'm not sure what other threat he's going to work on.
Maybe I can start looking at some counter-attacks. I'd like to play c5. It's guarded three times. I'd probably recapture with the bishop so it is attacking f2 and so my knight on d7 then attacks the pawn on e5. That's if he trades. But before I can do that I'll want to play a6 so his knight can't come up to b5. I like it that his knight doesn't have any strong squares to move to right now."

He's attacking the queen and the knight. The only place i can put the queen without losting the bishop is a5, but after he takes the bishop and I play Qxb4, he gets to play Nc7+ and wins the rook. 
 
So I have to take the knight. When you play, don't get caught up trying to always figure out what your opponent's plan is -- what you need to do is find your best move."
