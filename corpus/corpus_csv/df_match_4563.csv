1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"white produced an interesting novelty, I just disagree with playing g3 weakening the king's win pawns and then playing the bishop to b5... but Bb5+ was nice to avoid the main lines after the exchange of pawns at d4, then Be3 was dubious, to say the least, allowing me to harm white's pawn structure, also 15.Nf4 might have been better for white, this being said several inaccuracies sealed the fate of white's game, and allowed some basic tactics to add small advantages, the game ended soon after being simplified to Q + 2 extra paws vs R endgame"
