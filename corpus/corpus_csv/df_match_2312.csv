Qh4 seemed to keep the defense on Qd4, but would give him an opportunity to develop the knight and prepare a castle. Qh5 forces a pawn advance. I still have the dark square bishop, he may not want to castle short. Analysis shows Qd1 (a move I really didn't consider) as the best one. I still think maybe Qg3 may have been better. Would value opinions on Qg3 versus Qd1."

My thought was to defend d4 first, then move Qg3 to defend the fork. At this point, I realize I should have moved to Qg3 earlier."

Black now seems pretty well formed, while I have not determined how to diffuse the c3 pressure point. I noticed I don't really have a consistent strategy. I started out attacking king side, but the knight pin fractured that concept."
