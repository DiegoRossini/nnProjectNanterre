But this is a matter of preference. I like closed positions as much as open ones - so long as I have good knights and plenty of space.

And perhaps a Queen on h5 and the knight on f5. He'll especially be in trouble if his pawn on d6 captures on e5 or c5 for some reason. In short, if white can get a bit ahead in development and bring her knight on a2 back into action, perhaps a rook on c6 black will be in a lot of trouble. Watch out for Nc5 though.  I don't see the sequence of moves that make all these possible both in a closed position like this all you can do is improve your position in small bits until something pays off."
