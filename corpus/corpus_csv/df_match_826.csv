11,Bd2,c1d2,rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPPB1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"[?!]  A very strange choice of move, that (as far as I know) has almost never seen the light of day in top flight chess.  The bishop is just too unhandily placed here, and will have to move again fairly shortly.  Any of the following moves are much more popular: 6.Be3; 6.Bg5; 6.Be2; 6.Bc4; 6.f4; 6.f3; 6.g3 and 6.h3.  The last of these, Weaver Adams's 'attack' was played by Bobby Fischer in 1962 against none other than Miguel Najdorf himself.  Fischer won.  Why was 6.Bd2 played here?  I suspect White wanted to avoid known lines."

At the moment ...Nbd7 is not playable owing to the nasty response, f4-f5.  But Black has reason to believe that the knight will be required on that square to recapture on f6, after White brings his dark-square bishop to g5.  I am inclined to think, though, that ...Nc6, now or very shortly, would have been a playable option."

After exchanges on d5, Black's weaknesses there will be masked, and practically unassailable.  That indicates White has other plans."

But that tends to accelerate Black's development: 14.Qxd5?! Bb7  15.Qd3 ... (to protect e4 and c2) 15...Nd7, with ...Rfc8 to come.  So the pawn recapture has taken the preference."

As will become clear, White's main focus is on the K-side, and this seems to be a distraction.  It does threaten to win a pawn by 17.cxb5, and the White bishops are effectively raking the Black Q-side right now."

Qxb2 Rb1.  It is not clear that it would have led to anything better than the text does.
