1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Gibaud, against his fellow Frenchman Lazard, opens with a move that usually leads to a long, slow game... not this time!"
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,Lazard responds with a Hypermodern move.
3,Nd2,b1d2,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPPNPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 2,I fail to see the merits of this move... it seems to impede White's development...
4,e5,e7e5,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/3P4/8/PPPNPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Lazard plays to open up the game and exploit White's loss of time.
5,dxe5,d4e5,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4P3/8/8/PPPNPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,Gibaud lunges at the Pawn...

7,h3,h2h3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/6n1/7P/PPPNPPP1/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,This horrific blunder ends things before they start!
8,Ne3,g4e3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/8/4n2P/PPPNPPP1/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,Lazard doesn't miss the opportunity. If Gibaud tries to save his Queen with 5 PxN??? he runs into 5... Q-R5ch 6 P-N3 QxP mate. Gibaud resigns. This is the shortest master game on record!
