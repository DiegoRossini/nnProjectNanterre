1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Just before my big win over gocall1 (Ger) bumped my rating back into the 1800s I got this victory.  It was in the Traxler MT.  I think I have done shedloads better with the white pieces than with the black ones.  Anyhow, it looked as if Julia, my Team Captain had a very strong attack going down the kingside.  She then sacrificed the exchange.  This turned out to be a bad move.  I needed to be very patient though and the main theatre of the battle turned out to be the h column.  Eventually I managed to control the h column with Glenda and my rook.  Lastly, my knight, which for the best part of the game was doing not a lot, came into f6 and had the last word before my opponent waved the white flag.  I will start further commentary on move 6."
