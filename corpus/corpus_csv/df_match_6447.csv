Also, I know Freddy has a way of pulling off nasty surprises, and I didn't want that. I chose the knight capture over the bishop capture because if I captured with the bishop, the knight would have no good place to go!"

Besides, this move looks right on account of the b2-e5 pawn chain."

This move targets the b2 pawn, and White needs to do something about it (I've noticed that Black gets more space queenside than White does kingside... I'm undecided as to which side I would prefer with a Stonewall)"

An unexpected move for me, which I had given no thought to whatsoever - though the plan is simple - Freddy wants his rook in the action, and there's no way for White to stop that. Also, it allows the c4 pawn to be passed (a3 wouldn't stop this because it would then get pinned to the a1 rook) I had a good long think about this move... and i could see nothing but passivity. Where can my bishops go, for one - they are a lot worse off than Freddy's! I had considered Bxe4 here, but I'll end up more than a pawn down; 19.Bxe4? dxe4 20.Qxe4 axb4 21.cxb4 Ra4!; and the b-pawn falls (if Rb1, Rxa2... and a3 doesn't work as the pawn is still pinned to the rook)"
