1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

My opponent, Master Chrisobee kindly invited me to take part in his MT called Amor Vincit Omnia ( Love conquers all).  Sadly here, the only thing that got conquered was Henry!  I expect you are wondering what the title of this annotation means.  Well, it means accept your opponent's undefended material with caution, especially when you are playing against an Expert or a Master.  It is true that even GMs blunder (remember, Messrs Nigel Short and Victor Korchnoi both blundered into mate in one - this was covered into Amatzia Avni's Danger in Chess) but it is RARE!  Nine times out of 10, if you take the offering, your opponent will either regain the sacrificed material with interest or, like me, you could cop Old Matey!  How did this happen?  Well, here is the Gameknot Analysis version: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=16902121&rnd=0.25633523027782023."

It is called The Bishop's Opening because the bishop comes out before the knight.  It can transpose into several openings, The Vienna, Guicco Piano and even, as in our game, the Ruy Lopez."
