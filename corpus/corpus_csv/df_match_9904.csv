9,Nd5,c3d5,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/6q1/3N4/8/8/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 5 5,I was little surprised here as I was expecting 5.Nf3 Qxg2 6.Rg1 Qh3 or 5.Bf3 that has been played quite often too in the internet. 5.Nd5 and white is after Nd5xc7.
10,Na6,b8a6,r1b1kbnr/ppp1pppp/n5q1/3N4/8/8/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 6 6,Nd5xc7 threat has to be proctected.

15,Be3,c1e3,r1b1kb1r/ppp2ppp/n4nq1/3Np3/8/3PBB2/PPP2PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 2 8,8...Ng4 9.Qd2 is better than 8...Bd6
16,Bd6,f8d6,r1b1k2r/ppp2ppp/n2b1nq1/3Np3/8/3PBB2/PPP2PPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 3 9,8...Ng4 9.Qd2 is better than 8...Bd6
