1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I don't make any inaccuracies in this opening, but slowly my first-move advantage slips away and Black gets quite a lead. And then messes it up - or does he?"
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Unusually passive reply from my opponent! It does stop my Knight getting ideas about going to g5, as if it would!"
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Unusually passive reply from my opponent! It does stop my Knight getting ideas about going to g5, as if it would!"

7,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk1nr/ppppbppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 5 4,Perhaps 5.Nc3 was better? I didn't fancy the tactical complications should Black take the e-pawn and then play d5.
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 6 5,Perhaps 5.Nc3 was better? I didn't fancy the tactical complications should Black take the e-pawn and then play d5.
