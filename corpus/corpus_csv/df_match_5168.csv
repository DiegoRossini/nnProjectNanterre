Qc1 (0-1), Qd3 (1-0), a3 (1-0)...

Somehow, I didn't like any of this move... and since I think that chess must be a fun game, I was trying the following experiment:"
21,dxc6,d5c6,2kr1b1r/1pp1pppp/p1P2n2/q7/6b1/2N1BNP1/PPP2PBP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 11,"?!... according to the analyzer, this is an inaccuracy that changes the rating to -0.99 (best would have been Qe1: -0.45)...

From here on, everything until move 16 went exactely the way as I planned it (with help of the board analyzer). I sacrificed my queen to have a dangerous attack on his king."

Analyzer doesn't critisize this move, but after some more thinking, I guess Bxc5 might have been the better choice... that way, blacks queen can become quite dangerous... furthermore, I would have kept my bishop pair and I didn't see any threath for my knight, so I think this move was not good."
