1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Here is an unrated game as black against my buddy Michael which finished today.  Sadly I ended up copping Old Matey.  Before that, however, Glenda played a game of Chase Me Charlie with Michael's king who unfortunately found a safe niche in my position and I ran out of checks.  I lost the game due to failure to develop Fou Leblanc in a timely manner.  When Fou Leblanc eventually came out on MOVE THIRTY, he met an inglorious death to the white rook.  The end came 3 moves later.  Anyway, on with the show.  We have a double king pawn opening with e4 and e5."

4,exf4,e5f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"5. Ne5 - this bold move to e5 by white's steed is called the Kiezeritzky Gambit.  The knight sometimes goes to g5 which is called the Allgaier Gambit in which a knight is sacrificed for a pawn on f7.  The black king must capture to avoid dropping a rook and he becomes mighty exposed, but this is the calmer, saner Kiezeritzky and I respond with a sane developing move such as Nf6."
