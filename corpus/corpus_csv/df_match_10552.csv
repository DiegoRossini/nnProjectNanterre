2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,An unusual reply to the Spanish opening. Quite playable.  Attacks the e4 pawn.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,An unusual reply to the Spanish opening. Quite playable.  Attacks the e4 pawn.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,An unusual reply to the Spanish opening. Quite playable.  Attacks the e4 pawn.
5,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,An unusual reply to the Spanish opening. Quite playable.  Attacks the e4 pawn.
6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,An unusual reply to the Spanish opening. Quite playable.  Attacks the e4 pawn.
7,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 5 4,Not worrying about that pawn. Nxp would be followed by Re1 and white regains the pawn with the initiative.
8,d6,d7d6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 5,Protects the e5 pawn and might threaten to take at e4. But the knight at c6 is pinned.
9,d4,d2d4,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/1B2p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 5,"Naturally. Since white is ahead in terms of king safety, he must try action in the center and open up the play."
10,Bd7,c8d7,r2qkb1r/pppb1ppp/2np1n2/1B2p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 6,"A good move, unpinning the knight. But Be7 was possible (d5 being met with a6 - white wins a pawn but it may be difficult to protect)."
11,Re1,f1e1,r2qkb1r/pppb1ppp/2np1n2/1B2p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq - 2 6,"Finally black plays this, the natural move (at move 3)."
12,a6,a7a6,r2qkb1r/1ppb1ppp/p1np1n2/1B2p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq - 0 7,"Finally black plays this, the natural move (at move 3)."
13,Bxc6,b5c6,r2qkb1r/1ppb1ppp/p1Bp1n2/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq - 0 7,White goes for the simple plan of winning a pawn.
14,Bxc6,d7c6,r2qkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1bp1n2/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq - 0 8,A dangerous decision. pxp was much safer.
15,dxe5,d4e5,r2qkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1bp1n2/4P3/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq - 0 8,A dangerous decision. pxp was much safer.
16,Nxe4,f6e4,r2qkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1bp4/4P3/4n3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq - 0 9,A dangerous decision. pxp was much safer.
17,exd6,e5d6,r2qkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1bP4/8/4n3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq - 0 9,Because now the black knight is pinned.
18,Bxd6,f8d6,r2qk2r/1pp2ppp/p1bb4/8/4n3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq - 0 10,"Excellent. Black is now closer to being able to castle and the black bishops are very well placed. Black has managed the opening rather well, except for this pinned knight."
19,Nc3,b1c3,r2qk2r/1pp2ppp/p1bb4/8/4n3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq - 1 10,"A mistake that turns out right. But first consider the (bad) alternative :      10 Ng5 to take advantage of the pinned knight and capture it. After black plays pawn to f5, if now white plays f3 which seems to win the knight, black has Bc5  (Kh1 is answered by QxQ...RxQ...Nf2 and black wins, while Kf1 is answered by Bb5 ).     But the best move was probably 10 Qd4. I underestimated the best reply white could have made..."
20,Qe7,d8e7,r3k2r/1pp1qppp/p1bb4/8/4n3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w kq - 2 11,"...which was Bb4, as my opponent pointed out. But he made the wrong choice."
21,Nxe4,c3e4,r3k2r/1pp1qppp/p1bb4/8/4N3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq - 0 11,"Now after black recaptures, we have the same manoeuvre as before, but this time white will be able to capture the Bishop at e4 without any complications."
22,O-O-O,e8c8,2kr3r/1pp1qppp/p1bb4/8/4N3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 1 12,"Here black seems to have lost the thread of the game. He should have recaptured the knight.  After all, a piece is a piece. But, there is a trap involved here. White must be careful."
23,Nxd6+,e4d6,2kr3r/1pp1qppp/p1bN4/8/8/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - - 0 12,"On a careless move such as b3 for instance, black would have played Bh2  and won the white Queen!"
24,Qxd6,e7d6,2kr3r/1pp2ppp/p1bq4/8/8/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 0 13,Here black could have tried RxB. It would be easy for white to go wrong with RxQ (followed by RxQ  for black and if Re1 black plays BxN! with a dead draw in perspective (an ending with bishops of opposite colors is very difficult to win).
25,Qxd6,d1d6,2kr3r/1pp2ppp/p1bQ4/8/8/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1R1K1 b - - 0 13,"Not taking any chances. When you're ahead in material, exchange pieces and you'll wind up with an easy win. Of course, one must be confident on his ability to win a won game in the ending."
26,Rxd6,d8d6,2k4r/1pp2ppp/p1br4/8/8/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1R1K1 w - - 0 14,White must still follow the right track. This is the natural move as it attacks the rook while developing the bishop (and freeing the rook at a1).
27,Bf4,c1f4,2k4r/1pp2ppp/p1br4/8/5B2/5N2/PPP2PPP/R3R1K1 b - - 1 14,White must still follow the right track. This is the natural move as it attacks the rook while developing the bishop (and freeing the rook at a1).
28,Rdd8,d6d8,2kr3r/1pp2ppp/p1b5/8/5B2/5N2/PPP2PPP/R3R1K1 w - - 2 15,Rd7 was better : Protecting the second rank (the natural place for white's rooks) while preparing for a possible doubling of black's rooks on the d file.
