17,Be3,c1e3,r1bqkb1r/p2pppnp/2p3p1/4P3/8/2N1B3/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 4 9,"As black's pawn structure is weak on the queenside, white plans to castle long."
18,Nf5,g7f5,r1bqkb1r/p2ppp1p/2p3p1/4Pn2/8/2N1B3/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 5 10,"Not a very efficient move, for it permits white to carry on developing and the knight will be forced to drawback if white plays g4"
