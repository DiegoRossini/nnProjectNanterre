1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"In this game, I received a lesson from a lower-than-me player. It testifies that my current life is not suitable for serious chess. I am a ""talker"", but not a ""walker"". Anyway, the game is interesting and may teach something to someone. Due to time limitations, I won't be able to properly annotate move's numbers, and to set diagrams (as I usually do). Sorry for this!"

3,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Most usual response. e5 is another good option. Nc3 is not good because of d4...

8,Qe4+,d5e4,rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/8/2PPq3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,A Q's retreat would have been just a failure of the entire plan. I have to go on and see where it leads.
9,Be3,c1e3,rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/8/2PPq3/4B3/PP3PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 2 5,"White need precise sequence to safely develop: Nf3, Bd3. This gives me two tempoes to open my lines."

11,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1kb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/4p3/2PPq3/2N1B3/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 1 6,", but my reply is..."
12,Bb4,f8b4,rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/4p3/1bPPq3/2N1B3/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 2 7,"And this sets a very dangerous game, because it allows Qa4+. The only way for black not to lose Bb4 is Nc6, but this N is pinned to the king, so d5, apparently, wins the Nc6 and threatens c6xb7+.
Nevertheless, that is not so, because black will reply Nxd5, and white can't retake c4xd5 because the Qa4 is hanging (being Nc3 pinned by the Bb5). 
More than that: black has BxNc3+ at any moment, and exd5 which establish a counter-pin on the Be3. So the situation is already very, very complex."
13,Bd3,f1d3,rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/4p3/1bPPq3/2NBB3/PP3PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 3 7,"This move only adds to the previous lines the extra-possibility for black to play Qxg2, threatening the trapped Ra1. At the same time, this opens another completely different attack's way for white, based on dxe5 (instead of d5). This forces Nf6 to leave, allowing Be4, that protects the Ra1 and kicks black's Q away with tempo. But white misses a tempo and I could have defended against d5, even at the cost of Nc6, if I had a R (and, potentially, Ng1), as free targets leading to his King."
14,Qxg2,e4g2,rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/4p3/1bPP4/2NBB3/PP3PqP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 0 8,"I accepted the risk. The game is highly enjoyable and tactic. Here, a good move by white is Qf3, which saves white's rook, but for the tactical shot: BxNc3+, bxB, QxQ, NxQ, e4!, forking both pieces, and avoiding dxe5. All this is mind-blowing. A lot of themes simultaneously present at the same board..."
15,Qa4+,d1a4,rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/4p3/QbPP4/2NBB3/PP3PqP/R3K1NR b KQkq - 1 8,"White goes for the ""pin-plan"". Ok. Now it's very hard calculation: who'll be first, and which will be the real damage for me and my opponent?"
16,Nc6,b8c6,r1b1k2r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/4p3/QbPP4/2NBB3/PP3PqP/R3K1NR w KQkq - 2 9,"Ok, now let's recapitulate: white has: 1) d5, going for Nc6. Not good because after QxRa1, the WQ covers c6, and it would be Qxc6 after interposing BxNc3+. 2) The more subtle dxe5, threatening to occupy Be5, with strong threats on c6. This plan is a move too slow, even in case white wants to block the diagonal for the BQ with f3, since QxNg1+, Ke2, Qg4+(better than QxRa1), BxNc3+, bxN, followed by Q or Bd7, defending against dxN, bxc6. 3) Another more scaring way to proceed would be Nd5 or Nb5, but it's pinned. It will threaten the c7+ fork... but white finds the righ move:"

It frees Nc3, eliminates the check after BxN, and it defend Ng1 so after QxR, f3 can be played and it is possible dxe5, threatening the N but also conquering Be4, pressing Nc6. I saw all this, and I thought I will be a step smarter, with..."
18,Bxc3,b4c3,r1b1k2r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/4p3/Q1PP4/2bBB3/PP3PqP/2KR2NR w kq - 0 10,"Bd6, even if sad retirement, was very indicated here. It defends c7, and ensures dxe5 is not a threat anymore. White will try to cash the N with d5, QxR, f3!, and I will have had e4!, closing to white the possibility to have a B on e4 (if Bxe4, NxB)."
19,Ne2,g1e2,r1b1k2r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/4p3/Q1PP4/2bBB3/PP2NPqP/2KR3R b kq - 1 10,"White sacs a piece, apparently. He trusts in the fact that if I take a tempo to retreat the B, it will be lost or threatened after d5, dxNc6. On the other side, white saved his Rh1, and now, Rd-g1 will be very strong, opening a new weakness in black's field. The obvious answer would have been Bxb2+, KxB, but then I had only one tempo to parry all the threats, so I thought it was better to exchange some pieces and eliminate some threats. (Sagely, GK's engine gives this move as ok for white, preferring it over bxc3 - which allows QxRa1)."
