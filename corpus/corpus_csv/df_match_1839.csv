1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The King's Gambit is an aggressive opening for white, where sharp tactics and sacrifices tend to dominate play.  White weakens his own king's position with the idea of gaining a lead in development, a central pawn majority, and control of a half open f-file. The King's Gambit is an opening that will train your eye for tactics, and give you a feel for what can be accomplished with a material sacrifice.  Since these are probably the most important thing for beginning players to work on, the opening is well worth playing."

5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 3,"Typically, I respond with Nf3 as white, preventing Qh4+. Though this is still a decent response in terms of development."
6,Qh4+,d8h4,rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1Pp1q/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 4,"As dangerous as this is for white, black has to play this position carefully. If black is not careful, he can lose his precious queen and be at a huge disadvantage."
7,Kf1,e1f1,rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1Pp1q/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1KNR b kq - 3 4,!? - An interesting idea. Black gives a pawn to try and claim the center for himself.

10,Nf6,g8f6,rnb1kb1r/p1pp1ppp/5n2/1B6/4Pp1q/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1KNR w kq - 1 6,"! - A nice example of an important philosophy chess players need to advance: offense is the best defense. Yes the pawn on e4 is weak, but instead of worrying about this right away, white decides to chase away the black queen and in the process develop his knight."

14,Nh5,f6h5,rnb1kb1r/p1pp1ppp/7q/1B5n/4Pp2/3P1N2/PPP3PP/RNBQ1K1R w kq - 1 8,"Defending f4, but remember, the longer black tries to defend this position, the longer it will take him to develop."
15,Nh4,f3h4,rnb1kb1r/p1pp1ppp/7q/1B5n/4Pp1N/3P4/PPP3PP/RNBQ1K1R b kq - 2 8,"Attacking the knight and preparing to advance to black's territory. Since black still has a long way to go, attacking the weak kingside is a great idea"

I like this move though. Attacks an undefended piece in his territory. Though d6 and g7 are going to be big weaknesses for black to defend"

20,Nf6,h5f6,rnb1kb1r/p2p1ppp/2p2n2/1B3Nq1/4PpP1/3P4/PPP4P/RNBQ1K1R w kq - 1 11,Responds to the attack with one of his own. g4 is now vulnerable unless...
