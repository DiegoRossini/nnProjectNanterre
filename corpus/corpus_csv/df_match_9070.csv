4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,I have a feeling that wasn't a common move either. But I was planning to fianchetto my light-squared bishop and this move seemed fine.

18,h6,h7h6,r1bq1rk1/ppp1bpp1/4pn1p/6N1/3PN3/3B4/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 10,I can see that this isn't looking OK for Black any more. But I am still confident.

One was to blunt the queen's attack line with 12...g6, and after 13.Nxf6 Qxf6 White has no attack left.
