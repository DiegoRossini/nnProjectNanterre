1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

In my penultimate annotated game against untateve I was talking about regaining some of the lost points from the low draw because I had some favourable games in my active games list which I was hoping to convert.  Here is one of them.  After yesterday's ""nightmare"" against the Master Mater (although let it be said, from all your kind comments the reason I lost that game was because although I had the right ideas I wasted a tempo early on by forking Freddy's Q + R on c7 and it was enough to cost me the game - so it seemed my performance was FAR FROM BEING HORSE DUNG!) it was nice to wake up to a white flag.   In this game I find myself in a closed Ruy Lopez and become passive and find myself facing a mating attack.  My opponent once had a rating in the 1600s before he suffered from some timeouts and for a long time in the game he played to that level.  But in pressing his mating attack he made a big oversight.  Here is how the story unfolds.  My opponent kicks off with 1.e4."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,3. Bb5 - this is the move which characterises the Ruy Lopez.  Kasparov calls it the Spanish Torture.

The Witch will come down to g7 and I will cop Old Matey.  The knight must be driven from f5.  How do I do it?  I know but it will take several moves to accomplish.

37,dxe4,d3e4,r4r1k/1bpn1qpp/p4p2/1p2pN2/1P2P1Q1/8/1PPB1PPP/R3R1K1 b - - 0 19,19. ....... Nb6 - stage 2.  Clears the way for Fou Leblanc.

Re3?? - natural, this rook lift is planning to put pressure on my g7 pawn, but this little footman is to become a little blighter as far as white is concerned.  My position has been like a hedgehog, spikes with a soft underbelly.  Here the spikes prevail as the pawn moves to g6 piling up on the pinned knight on f5.  So my opponent is well and truly spiked on the hedgehog."

This will result in a queen trade and after the knight takes Glenda on f7 my rook will snaffle it and white will be relieved of a piece.  It makes me look like The Artful Doger here!
