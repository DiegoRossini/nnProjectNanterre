3,Qh5,d1h5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p2Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"...but that's not to say we're going to play a normal game! This is the Patzer opening, usually associated with beginner play. There is a thematic trap here that I have fallen for a few times in the past [2...g6?? 3.Qxe5+!] Though the opening is considered weak [actually, using GK analysis this isn't too horrible an opening], I don't get my hopes up - he played an even weaker opening against Joanne [jstevens1] and disposed of her in just 30 moves - and that was against a player 400 rating points above my own! Here's the annotation of that game; http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/when-or-where-is-it-safe-to-castle?gm=31623"
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p2Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 2 3,"The best move in the position, developing while protecting the e5 pawn."
5,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p2Q/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 3 3,"As well as developing the bishop, this move also threatens the cheap Scholar's Mate."
6,g6,g7g6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1p1p/2n3p1/4p2Q/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 0 4,"Once again, the threat is easily parried"
7,Qd1,h5d1,r1bqkbnr/pppp1p1p/2n3p1/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 4,"The queen returns to the d1 square - counter-intuitive, to be sure, but I'm guessing that this was played to let me have a bit of an advantage to compensate for the huge difference in rating"
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1p1p/2n2np1/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 5,"The normal move seen, Qf3, would have provoked this move to ward off Scholar's Mate once again. There's no reason not to play this move here anyway."
9,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/pppp1p1p/2n2np1/4p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 3 5,Natual - development while saving the e4 pawn at the same time
10,Bg7,f8g7,r1bqk2r/pppp1pbp/2n2np1/4p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 4 6,"Natural again - though the diagonal is partially closed, it makes sense to fianchetto the bishop"
11,d3,d2d3,r1bqk2r/pppp1pbp/2n2np1/4p3/2B1P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 6,Both sides open up lines for their undeveloped bishops
12,d6,d7d6,r1bqk2r/ppp2pbp/2np1np1/4p3/2B1P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 7,Both sides open up lines for their undeveloped bishops
13,a4,a2a4,r1bqk2r/ppp2pbp/2np1np1/4p3/P1B1P3/2NP4/1PP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 7,What this? queenside action?
14,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/ppp2pbp/2np1np1/4p3/P1B1P3/2NP4/1PP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQ - 1 8,"After seeing that move, I castled immediately kingside - any ideas for queenside castling is out of the question if there is any possibility of a queenside pawn storm. Plus, Freddy is most likely looking to castle kingside himself. However, sometime after this move, I started to get just a little bit worried - what if there was something in 8.a5? [normal question mark, by the way] Possibly that was paranoid thinking there lol"
15,Nge2,g1e2,r1bq1rk1/ppp2pbp/2np1np1/4p3/P1B1P3/2NP4/1PP1NPPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 2 8,hmmm... guess there isn't immediate plans for the pawn after all...
16,a5,a7a5,r1bq1rk1/1pp2pbp/2np1np1/p3p3/P1B1P3/2NP4/1PP1NPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 9,...so I take the opportunity to halt it now to prevent unpleasant tactics later on
17,O-O,e1g1,r1bq1rk1/1pp2pbp/2np1np1/p3p3/P1B1P3/2NP4/1PP1NPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 9,"Bishop development - this was the only logical place for the bishop. the f5 and h3 squares are prohibited for obvious reasons, Bd7 is too inactive and Be6 allows Bxe6, weakening my pawn structure"
18,Bg4,c8g4,r2q1rk1/1pp2pbp/2np1np1/p3p3/P1B1P1b1/2NP4/1PP1NPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 2 10,"Bishop development - this was the only logical place for the bishop. the f5 and h3 squares are prohibited for obvious reasons, Bd7 is too inactive and Be6 allows Bxe6, weakening my pawn structure"
19,Be3,c1e3,r2q1rk1/1pp2pbp/2np1np1/p3p3/P1B1P1b1/2NPB3/1PP1NPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 3 10,"For Freddy, the e3 square is where the bishop has the most scope, though Bg5 is also playable"
20,Nb4,c6b4,r2q1rk1/1pp2pbp/3p1np1/p3p3/PnB1P1b1/2NPB3/1PP1NPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 4 11,"!? I considered Qd7 here, but I also had plans to push my d6 pawn forward at an attempt at a centre break. This knight move targets d5 for that break [it also targets c2, but that's irrelevant; the White queen is naturally guarding it anyway]"
21,f3,f2f3,r2q1rk1/1pp2pbp/3p1np1/p3p3/PnB1P1b1/2NPBP2/1PP1N1PP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 11,"! The centre break will have to wait - this move made me regret playing Nb4 instead of Qd7, as Qd7 would have allowed Be6. Bh5, of course, is met with g4..."
22,Bd7,g4d7,r2q1rk1/1ppb1pbp/3p1np1/p3p3/PnB1P3/2NPBP2/1PP1N1PP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 1 12,"...so this is the only viable alternative, and as I've said before, this isn't a very active posting for the bishop. It also delays my desired pawn break because the bishop blocks the queen."
23,d4,d3d4,r2q1rk1/1ppb1pbp/3p1np1/p3p3/PnBPP3/2N1BP2/1PP1N1PP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 12,"!? Looks like Freddy has similar ideas! his d-pawn pushes forward first, and after the exchange of pawns..."
