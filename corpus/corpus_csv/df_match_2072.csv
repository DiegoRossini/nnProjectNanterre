1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

There seems to be quite a lot of interest in K & P endings lately, both in Ion's Mentoring Group I and in an unrated consultation game in a Club which Bigpeta is running, which I, Joanne Stevens and a few other sub-2000 players have been gathering ideas on how to deal with such endings.  Our opponent is Coach Ion!  So, I have just played out this ending against an Expert and come off worse and ended up getting a lesson in how not to play K & P endings.  The first lesson I was given was in this game, many years ago on gameknot: http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/an-expert-lesson-in-how-to-play-k-amp-p-endings?gm=15275.  At least I did not have doubled pawns on one side of the board and a pawn minority on the other like I did in that game, but a really strange quirk led to Natalia crowning a pawn two moves before I did and eventually I copped Old Matey.  So, how did all this happen?  Well, read on ......"
