7,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,NxN seemed like it would only be a good idea if you like to play from a bad position. I already had a plan in case he decided to NxN

10,Qf6,d8f6,r1b1k1nr/pppp1ppp/2N2q2/2b5/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,"I planned this move because I didn't want to bxc double my pawns in the c column, or worse dxc to have doubled pawns and no castling option after a queen exchange. I know there is no safe retreat for his knight. The early mate threat seemed too good to resist too..."
