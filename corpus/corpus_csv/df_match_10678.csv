1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Another game from a mini-tournament dedicated to the Sicilian defense. During this game (playing with the black pieces), I alternately thought I might loose, draw or win, and finally I've won the game. Feel free to correct my annotations, as I always miss a lot of good moves for both sides and I dont use a computer for the analysis. Nevertheless I hope that these annotations might be interesting especially for lower rated players."
