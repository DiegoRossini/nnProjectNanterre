1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This game is included because of a possibility which came up. What I want you to do is to play through this and tell me what you would have done if White had played a differently on move 14.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,My usual Sicilian
3,d3,d2d3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"This is not too bad, although not very common, as it is not very aggressive."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"And this is bad, developing the knight to a bad square. The knight belongs on c3 or d2 where it has move influence on the centre."
5,Na3,b1a3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/N2P4/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 3,"And this is bad, developing the knight to a bad square. The knight belongs on c3 or d2 where it has move influence on the centre."
6,d5,d7d5,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/2pp4/4P3/N2P4/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"I would not normally play this, as normally Black can just exchange pawns and play Nc3, but with the knight on a3 this is good."
7,f3,f2f3,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/2pp4/4P3/N2P1P2/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"I don't like this move either, Bd2 perhaps is better?"
8,e5,e7e5,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n5/2ppp3/4P3/N2P1P2/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,Black now has a strong centre.
9,exd5,e4d5,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n5/2pPp3/8/N2P1P2/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,This is inconsistent with the previous move.
10,Qxd5,d8d5,r1b1kbnr/pp3ppp/2n5/2pqp3/8/N2P1P2/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"A good move, threatening Nc7 check."

12,Qd8,d5d8,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n5/1Np1p3/8/3P1P2/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 7,The knight should drop back to c3
13,f4,f3f4,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n5/1Np1p3/5P2/3P4/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 7,The knight should drop back to c3
