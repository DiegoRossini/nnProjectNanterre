I like and dislike this move by my comrades. I like it because it gains valuable initiative on the E3-bishop. On the other hand black invests considerable king side weaknesses to gain that initiative."

A critical moment in the game. Black has committed himself for boom or bust on the king side. Meanwhile, white still temporarily has his centre and a slight lead in development. All and all though the game is dynamically level.

Black has to play this double edged move if he hopes to get in ...f5. Reason being is that they have to deflect my f-knight away from contesting g5 so that ...f5 can be played without worrying about the weakness created on g5. Even so, the holes on black's king side begin to show signs of fatigue."

A very awkward moment for me. I am forced to retreat the knight back to c3 and allow black greater share of the centre. Not to mention deflecting a piece away from the defense of f2. As you can see f2 becomes the focal point for sometime. Meanwhile the pawn on h6 lays quietly just waiting to be picked off."

I give this a brilliance because the reason for it is obvious and subtle. The king is taking matters of his own safety into his hands by walking himself to g1. Castling is out because then black would be able to take on h6 with a guaranteed draw.  I would say that black is doing OK but the picture is starting to become very complex for him. Even the chess engine suggests 18.0-0 but I was felt that the rook had better chances of getting action via the h-file. I also felt that I had to keep the h6-pawn because it was controlling the critical mating square of g7."

The knight returns! This move is what makes 18.Kf1 work. Black does not have a discover check because of fork on his queen. Thus black will have to retreat the queen and allow white to regain the material. Still the wide open f-file dominated by the black rook keeps black in the game."

It is hard to discredit such a naturally good looking move but this is problematic for black. #1 It temporarily lessens the pressure on f2 long enough for me to better position my DSB. #2 I really do think that 22...Qg6 followed ...Be6 or ...Bd7 is the only way out for black. 
Alternative variation: 22... Be6 23. Rg5+ Kh8 24. Qd2 Rf6 25. Rf1 is roughly equal"
