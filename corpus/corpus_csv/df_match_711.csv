Since this exercise, in part, is about getting Joe to beat that darn Jack and also, if Jack chooses it, it must be a halfway decent move, especially in the opening, it makes sense for good ol Tips to choose options Jack would likely go with. Hence 3. Bc5. (Incidentally, though I wouldn't be so foolish as to let an opponent play the R-L, if I had to, I'd probably go with 3....Nf6 for the Berlin Defence methinks. I know Janet certainly rates the Berlin!"

Qh5 at any time in the immediate future could prove to become a thorn in Black's endgame plans. If they want to push up the queenside, they don't want their own king being harried all the way on the other side of the board. This distracts White, offering an out for the White lcb that seems stuck out in front of its own pawns."

White may have been better with 16. c4, opening up an avenue of retreat for the lcb and eventually allowing it to get either in front or behind the Q on the h5-d1 diagonal. One more supporting piece for that a4 pawn has also been removed, moving White closer to feeling pressured into axb5 and the generation of a dangerous passed pawn on the a file for Black. A very, very, minor positional win here, then, for Black, perhaps, but, in the spirit of Euwe's little threats, Black is building tiny threats and also shutting down White's potential to do the same."

White perhaps decides that it will babysit the b pawn instead and let the b pawn in turn stand sentry over the a3 square. Or, perhaps White wants to tempt Black into exchanging the a pawn, with 19....a3 20 bxa3 Rxa3 giving Black a rook on the 3rd rank, yet tossing in it's valuable passed a pawn in the process. 
 
Instead, Black can simply take c3 and generate a pair of connected passed pawns in the exchange. Though on this occasion, that would give the White rook a bead on the b pawn. White might also be trying to load up Q and rook on the b file: placing tanks solidly in the way of the Black's planned infantry charge up the queenside flank. 

White, then, seems congnisant of Black's gameplan and is responding accordingly. Of course, under Euwe's theory of the middlegame, naturally one's opponent responds to the first, second, third little threat. But as they keep responding they are not generating any threats of their own and must, eventually, be overwhelmed. The next few moves will prove telling."

As mentioned earlier, White may have decided to move Rb1 in order to get a bead on the b pawn. Black is going to hand White that pawn and in the process turn up the pressure on the a1 square, possibly even saccing it's Q depending on the line. If White falters (example line with the Q sac 20.	bxc3	a3

) 

The purpose here is less about winning the game (in that case I would probably choose the strategy of keeping the b and a pawns connected and effect their movement up the qside with solid tactical play) and more about setting a puzzle. The initial purpose of this game: to demonstrate the virtues of castling to complete development rather than as part of development in the R-L has been achieved. Joe acknowledges the possibilities and will keep it as a tool in his belt to be used if and when he sees fit. 

Now, in his games I've noticed that he can be occasionally king-hit in middle games by a tempting exchange or even seeming error by the opponent, only to find himself suddenly losing a major piece or worse due to a lack of simple tactical calculation, being too concerned with strategic concerns or what happened in a GM game from a similar position. What he fails to realise is that high level players won't bother with cheap tricks (like constructing a mating net with plenty big holes in it but with a nice, juicy, morsel as the bait) against high level players since they know their opponent won't fall for such nonsense. Against poor Joe, though, players of all abilities have no such scruples! ;)"

Now, this problem is double-pronged. Joe is clever enough to see my intention but, 21...c4 sacs the rook. Qc4 is lead move but 22 b4 asks further questions. Pressure is ramping queenside in a dashing but, ultimately, flawed fashion. There are devastating outs for Black. Can you spot them?"
