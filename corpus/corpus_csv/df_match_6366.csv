1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I must say, this is the best correspondence game I've ever played so far. Though my opponent made a gross error at the end, the outcome would have been in my favour anyway, it seems. So hope you enjoy."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,Before chasing away the g5 bishop I reinforce the f6 knight so I can take back with a knight. But this is a mistake or at least makes it possible to force the exchange of dark-squarded bishops with 6. Qd2.

10,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bqk2r/pppnppbp/3p1np1/6B1/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 2 6,Before chasing away the g5 bishop I reinforce the f6 knight so I can take back with a knight. But this is a mistake or at least makes it possible to force the exchange of dark-squarded bishops with 6. Qd2.
11,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqk2r/pppnppbp/3p1np1/6B1/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 3 6,I felt relieved because now I have time to play h6 and castle without being harassed along the c1/h6-diagonal with the queen on d2.
12,h6,h7h6,r1bqk2r/pppnppb1/3p1npp/6B1/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,It's uncertain whether white wants to castle longside or shortside. So I refrain from making a decision in the center. Since the dark-squared bishop is off the c1/h6-diagonal the c3 knight is vulnerable making a queenside pawn storm less likely at this point. So I opted for a6 instead of a5.
13,Bh4,g5h4,r1bqk2r/pppnppb1/3p1npp/8/2PPP2B/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 7,It's uncertain whether white wants to castle longside or shortside. So I refrain from making a decision in the center. Since the dark-squared bishop is off the c1/h6-diagonal the c3 knight is vulnerable making a queenside pawn storm less likely at this point. So I opted for a6 instead of a5.
14,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pppnppb1/3p1npp/8/2PPP2B/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 2 8,It's uncertain whether white wants to castle longside or shortside. So I refrain from making a decision in the center. Since the dark-squared bishop is off the c1/h6-diagonal the c3 knight is vulnerable making a queenside pawn storm less likely at this point. So I opted for a6 instead of a5.
15,Bd3,f1d3,r1bq1rk1/pppnppb1/3p1npp/8/2PPP2B/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 3 8,It's uncertain whether white wants to castle longside or shortside. So I refrain from making a decision in the center.

16,a6,a7a6,r1bq1rk1/1ppnppb1/p2p1npp/8/2PPP2B/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 9,It's uncertain whether white wants to castle longside or shortside. So I refrain from making a decision in the center.

17,Qc2,d1c2,r1bq1rk1/1ppnppb1/p2p1npp/8/2PPP2B/2NB1N2/PPQ2PPP/R3K2R b KQ - 1 9,"White keeps the option of castling either side. Good move. Plus he wants to exert pressure along my g6 pawn. At this point I hoped he'd castle longside, since the black pawn moves ...e5 and ...f5 are very hard to accomplish."
18,c6,c7c6,r1bq1rk1/1p1nppb1/p1pp1npp/8/2PPP2B/2NB1N2/PPQ2PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 10,I stick to my wait and prepare strategy.
19,O-O-O,e1c1,r1bq1rk1/1p1nppb1/p1pp1npp/8/2PPP2B/2NB1N2/PPQ2PPP/2KR3R b - - 1 10,"This means the game would be way more tactical instead of a gruesome positional grip he could have exerted when castling shortside. In fact from studying my opponents games I just expected this, since he is more into tactical play and often sacrifices pawns and material in general. A positional approach with 10. 0-0 would have been harder to come by."
20,Qa5,d8a5,r1b2rk1/1p1nppb1/p1pp1npp/q7/2PPP2B/2NB1N2/PPQ2PPP/2KR3R w - - 2 11,Before attacking his impressive center with ...c5 I saw that I can keep back his center push e5 by one more move by bringing my queen aggressively to the a-file.
21,Rhe1,h1e1,r1b2rk1/1p1nppb1/p1pp1npp/q7/2PPP2B/2NB1N2/PPQ2PPP/2KRR3 b - - 3 11,So he reinforces the e-file in order to make his push.

23,h3,h2h3,r1b2rk1/1p1n1pb1/p1pp1npp/q3p3/2PPP2B/2NB1N1P/PPQ2PP1/2KRR3 b - - 0 12,He decides to retain the pressure in the center and prepares a kingside pawn storm. I welcome this. It keeps all options regarding center development on the table.
24,b5,b7b5,r1b2rk1/3n1pb1/p1pp1npp/qp2p3/2PPP2B/2NB1N1P/PPQ2PP1/2KRR3 w - - 0 13,Fortunately my strike comes first.

27,Nxd4,f3d4,r1b2rk1/3n1pb1/p1pp1npp/qp6/2PNP2B/1PNB3P/P1Q2PP1/2KRR3 b - - 0 14,Naturally bringing the knight into the game thereby attacking the d3 bishop and defending the c6 pawn.

29,Nde2,d4e2,r1b2rk1/5pb1/p1pp1npp/qp2n3/2P1P2B/1PNB3P/P1Q1NPP1/2KRR3 b - - 2 15,"I was astounded by this mistake. Retreating the knight wasn't necessary at all. I guess, my opponent didn't feel comfortable and wanted to overly secure things. Taming the feeling of unease by a quick ""save"" move that is abandoning rational, cool calculation is what I see often. I actually prepared for:
15. f5, Nxd3+
16. Rxd3, bxc4 (opening up the king's position)
17. bxc4, Qc7 (defening the c6 pawn)
with a roughly equal game."
30,Nxd3+,e5d3,r1b2rk1/5pb1/p1pp1npp/qp6/2P1P2B/1PNn3P/P1Q1NPP1/2KRR3 w - - 0 16,"Now I simply win the a-pawn, because I can chase away the defending knight on c3 by the pawn push b4."
31,Qxd3,c2d3,r1b2rk1/5pb1/p1pp1npp/qp6/2P1P2B/1PNQ3P/P3NPP1/2KRR3 b - - 0 16,"If white tries to keep the a-pawn doubly defended by 
16. Rxd3, I snap the e4 pawn by 
16. ... Nxe4 which cannot be taken since that would loose the exchange:
17. Nc3xe4, Qxe1+"
32,Qa3+,a5a3,r1b2rk1/5pb1/p1pp1npp/1p6/2P1P2B/qPNQ3P/P3NPP1/2KRR3 w - - 1 17,"Of course it's mandatory to check the king first, since 16. ...b4 leads to the blocking move 17. Na4"
33,Kd2,c1d2,r1b2rk1/5pb1/p1pp1npp/1p6/2P1P2B/qPNQ3P/P2KNPP1/3RR3 b - - 2 17,"Kb1 would loose the e4 pawn. But that would have been way better than moving towards the center.
17. Kb1, Nxe4. 
And it's impossible to take with the knight:
18. Nc3xe4 leads to Qb2 checkmate and
18. Qxe4 allows skewering the queen with Bf5."
