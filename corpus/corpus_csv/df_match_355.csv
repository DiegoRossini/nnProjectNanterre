The reason for this is because a check can possibly be made (Re8+) if white doesn't close up the hole. This also means white can't castle until it leaves check, stalling a good defensive position for at least a turn."

White can't castle out of check, his only moves being Ne5, Ne3/Ne7+, Qe2, or Be3; most of which either wastes a piece, a turn, or both.
