7,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/1B2p3/3NP3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,Blacks Idea in this defense is to eliminate the traditional struggle that takes place for the center and the d4 square by simply occupying it with his pawn after recapturing the knight.  This hinders whites immediate advancements in the center but at a price.  Black has lost a tempo (move of development) by moving his Knight twice in the opening and has given white a pawn majority to work with on the king side.

The type of pawn move that black just played is typically referred to in chess as a leaver (a sacrificed pawn that leaves the opponent with severe weakness) note the lack of hope that whites Bishop on c1 and Rook on a1 have in getting into the game. The pawn move also clears the deadly g1 a7 diagonal for blacks dark squared bishop.
