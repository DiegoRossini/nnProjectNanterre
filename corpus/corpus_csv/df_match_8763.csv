1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"An unrated game against a friend. I try something I never do. I play the English Opening. In some ways, it's basically like playing the Sicilian, but as white. With an extra tempo, since white goes first. Truth is, I don't really know this opening at all. I hope he appreciates the title - it's mean to be fun."
