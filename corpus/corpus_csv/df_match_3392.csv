1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Ahh, the kings pawn. This is the most common first move that I see by white."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,...Followed by the second most common response I see.(The most common being the sicillian.)
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"This develops the knight, as well as attacks the e5 pawn. This is sound."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"Develops, while defending the e5 pawn."
5,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,"Develops, attacks the weak f7 square, as well as allows castling. I am growing to dislike this move though, since after Nf6, ..., Na5 the white bishop must die or move to a less-active square."
6,Qf6,d8f6,r1b1kbnr/pppp1ppp/2n2q2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,"It is said that moving your queen out early is bad. It ironically enough costs the game, although not immidiately. It should be noted that this move also prevents Nf6."
7,O-O,e1g1,r1b1kbnr/pppp1ppp/2n2q2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 5 4,Why not?
8,Bc5,f8c5,r1b1k1nr/pppp1ppp/2n2q2/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 6 5,"A good move. Adds a fourth attacker to d4, as well as puts presure to f2, and indirectly attacks the white king."
9,c3,c2c3,r1b1k1nr/pppp1ppp/2n2q2/2b1p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 5,"Prepares a queen-side pawn storm, and prevents the knight and bishop advancing to b4 and d4."
10,d6,d7d6,r1b1k1nr/ppp2ppp/2np1q2/2b1p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 6,"This allows Bg4, and adds a defender to the knight and pawn."
11,a4,a2a4,r1b1k1nr/ppp2ppp/2np1q2/2b1p3/P1B1P3/2P2N2/1P1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 6,"This threatens b4, winning blacks DSB in the long run, unless black responds immediately."
12,Bg4,c8g4,r3k1nr/ppp2ppp/2np1q2/2b1p3/P1B1P1b1/2P2N2/1P1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 7,"Develops, while pinning the knight. However, this loses his brother,(or would it be sister?) in the process."
13,b4,b2b4,r3k1nr/ppp2ppp/2np1q2/2b1p3/PPB1P1b1/2P2N2/3P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,The bishop is dead.
14,Bb6,c5b6,r3k1nr/ppp2ppp/1bnp1q2/4p3/PPB1P1b1/2P2N2/3P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 8,"I don't like this. It allows the attacker to gain a tempo, and the piece is dead anyway."
15,a5,a4a5,r3k1nr/ppp2ppp/1bnp1q2/P3p3/1PB1P1b1/2P2N2/3P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,I press the pawn.
16,Bd4,b6d4,r3k1nr/ppp2ppp/2np1q2/P3p3/1PBbP1b1/2P2N2/3P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 9,"...! This is actually a brilliant move, if black played correctly. I'll explain what I mean when black moves again."
17,cxd4,c3d4,r3k1nr/ppp2ppp/2np1q2/P3p3/1PBPP1b1/5N2/3P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 9,"I take. ""It's a won Bishop"" --I thought. This move is a mistake. Maybe even a blunder."
18,exd4,e5d4,r3k1nr/ppp2ppp/2np1q2/P7/1PBpP1b1/5N2/3P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 10,"And this is where black could have turned things around. If he would have taken with the knight, then my king would be put under heavy fire."
19,d3,d2d3,r3k1nr/ppp2ppp/2np1q2/P7/1PBpP1b1/3P1N2/5PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 10,"This defends the pawn and bishop, as well as prevents d3, following Nd4."
20,a6,a7a6,r3k1nr/1pp2ppp/p1np1q2/P7/1PBpP1b1/3P1N2/5PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 11,"...? Black needs to develop. Also, one thing I was wondering, should black castle? If he castles queen-side, he's meet by a pawn storm. If he castles king-side, He's meet by Qb3. What do you think is best here?"
