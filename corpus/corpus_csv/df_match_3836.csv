1,b3,b2b3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"White opens with Larsen's Opening (sometimes known as the Nimzovitch-Larsen Attack, especially when played 1.Nf3 2.b3), seeking to control the center from the flanks and pressure the Black kingside with control of the long diagonal."
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"A nonstandard response, this move shows thoughts of transposing into a Caro-Kann variant after ...d5."
3,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/8/1P2P3/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"White continues his slow play, setting his Bishops free but refraining from placing them just yet, until Black has committed more to his pawn structure. Keene recommends 2.e4 instead."
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/8/1P2P3/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Seeing that White does not obviously intend to fight over d5 at the moment, Black takes the opportunity to grab a stake in the center."
5,Bb2,c1b2,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/8/1P2P3/PBPP1PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"The Bishop quickly reaches its post, preventing Black from following up with ...e5."
6,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p1b2/8/1P2P3/PBPP1PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"With no Knights in play yet to drive it off, this seems like a comfortable spot for a Black Bishop, outside any potential pawn wall and leaving room for a Knight on d7."
7,f4,f2f4,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p1b2/5P2/1P2P3/PBPP2PP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"White gives himself significantly more control of e5, strengthening his Bishop's diagonal considerably. The purpose of his second move is now clear, and Black is in no position to make any aggressive moves against the momentarily-weakened White kingside."
8,Nf6,g8f6,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p1b2/5P2/1P2P3/PBPP2PP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,Both players continue their development logically.
9,Nf3,g1f3,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p1b2/5P2/1P2PN2/PBPP2PP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,Both players continue their development logically.
10,Nbd7,b8d7,r2qkb1r/pp1npppp/2p2n2/3p1b2/5P2/1P2PN2/PBPP2PP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 3 6,Both players continue their development logically.
11,Bd3,f1d3,r2qkb1r/pp1npppp/2p2n2/3p1b2/5P2/1P1BPN2/PBPP2PP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 4 6,"?! White offers an exchange of Bishops, as White's DSB is much more powerful than Black's is likely to be anytime soon. However, an exchange on d3 will introduce a serious, potentially-exploitable weakness into White's pawn structure."
12,Bxd3,f5d3,r2qkb1r/pp1npppp/2p2n2/3p4/5P2/1P1bPN2/PBPP2PP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"White now has a half-open c-file, but no clear way to use it, and a pawn on d3 that looks difficult to defend. On the other side of the board, Black's position is a little cramped, but solid."
13,cxd3,c2d3,r2qkb1r/pp1npppp/2p2n2/3p4/5P2/1P1PPN2/PB1P2PP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 0 7,"White now has a half-open c-file, but no clear way to use it, and a pawn on d3 that looks difficult to defend. On the other side of the board, Black's position is a little cramped, but solid."
14,e6,e7e6,r2qkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/5P2/1P1PPN2/PB1P2PP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"White has e5 in a deathgrip, so this seems like the best way to develop the Bishop."
15,a3,a2a3,r2qkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/5P2/PP1PPN2/1B1P2PP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 0 8,"White looks to restrict the range of Black's remaining Bishop, preparing b4 to claw out yet more space for himself."
16,Nc5,d7c5,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/2np4/5P2/PP1PPN2/1B1P2PP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 1 9,"Seeing the impending pawn move that would prevent this attack, Black strikes quickly at the weak e3 pawn and his Knight begins a short journey with the intent of enticing White into additional weakening pawn moves."
17,d4,d3d4,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/2np4/3P1P2/PP2PN2/1B1P2PP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 0 9,White really could use a light-square Bishop to cover these holes in his center.
18,Nce4,c5e4,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/3PnP2/PP2PN2/1B1P2PP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 1 10,"9...Nd3 looks somewhat tempting, but it is hard to support so far advanced and has nowhere to retreat to after 10.Bc3 Qb6 11.Qc2 Qa6."
19,d3,d2d3,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/3PnP2/PP1PPN2/1B4PP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 0 10,"Logical, but now White's e3 and d3 pawns cannot be defended by other pawns, and are likely to come under fire."
20,Nd6,e4d6,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/2pnpn2/3p4/3P1P2/PP1PPN2/1B4PP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 1 11,"Seeing Black's cramped position, White seeks to prevent any further expansion by the Black pieces."
21,h3,h2h3,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/2pnpn2/3p4/3P1P2/PP1PPN1P/1B4P1/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 0 11,"Seeing Black's cramped position, White seeks to prevent any further expansion by the Black pieces."
22,Be7,f8e7,r2qk2r/pp2bppp/2pnpn2/3p4/3P1P2/PP1PPN1P/1B4P1/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 1 12,"Black prepares to castle and aligns his Queen and Bishop, appraising the h4 square, potentially after the Knight moves ...Nh5-g3, taking advantage of the latest hole in the White pawns."
23,Nc3,b1c3,r2qk2r/pp2bppp/2pnpn2/3p4/3P1P2/PPNPPN1P/1B4P1/R2QK2R b KQkq - 2 12,"Now White can back up g3 with Ne2, if needed, and this Knight also helps support an advance to e4."
24,Qb6,d8b6,r3k2r/pp2bppp/1qpnpn2/3p4/3P1P2/PPNPPN1P/1B4P1/R2QK2R w KQkq - 3 13,"Black's play is simple: if White wants to advance his e-pawn, that will leave d4 difficult to defend. The Queen also pressures b3, tying the WQ down to its defense."
