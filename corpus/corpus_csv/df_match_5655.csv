1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was my final game in freddy's AP-III tourney and one in which I had been looking forward.  I always enjoy my games against joanne and this game was to decide second place in the tourney--somehow, freddy had managed to eek out first place ;)  The thematic moves end around move 9."

Every other game as White I have moved (as has most everyone else) 10. Nc3.  I could provide a number of excuses why I didn't do so but the fact was I was simply not paying attention and moved d3 one turn early.  As I told joanne, at least this will insure we have few, if any, games to rely upon for study."

Ncxe4 Black can move Nf6, forcing an exchange of Ns, which must be good for Black.  Another line that seems good for Black is 12...Nf6  13. Be3+	  c5 14.Nxc5  Bxc5  15.Bxc5+ Kxc5  Although the Black King is exposed, it's not clear how White can immediately take advantage of this."

White must also be careful not to move Ng5 until the K has castled otherwise Qh4+ could lose the Bishop.

Nf7 and fork the Q/R as I didn't want to trade a somewhat active N for an inactive R.  At this point, Black is not really developed and I'm hoping to keep it that way."

17.	Nxd7+	Rxd7
18.	Bxd7	 and White is winning.  Another line might be 	Qg6
17.	Nxd7+	Ka6
18.	Re6	Qxe6
19.	Bxe6 which was also bad for Black."
