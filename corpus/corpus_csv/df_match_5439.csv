2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,The traditional response.
3,c3,c2c3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"A nontraditional second move, preparing for P-Q4."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"The amateur, logically, attacks the unguarded KP."
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/3PP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,Morphy proceeds with his plan.

8,Bc5,f8c5,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/8/2b1P3/4n3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"Seemingly preparing to castle. However, he never does get a chance to and ends up paying the price."
9,Qg4,d1g4,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/8/2b1P3/4n1Q1/2P5/PP3PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 2 5,"Normally a Queen move this early is bad, but this one has a disorganizing effect on Black's position. He now must move or defend his Knight, and because of White's KP, he has few options."
10,Nxf2,e4f2,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/8/2b1P3/6Q1/2P5/PP3nPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 0 6,The only safe square.

15,exf6,e5f6,rnbqkr2/pppp2Qp/5P2/2b3B1/8/2P5/PP3nPP/RN2KBNR b KQq - 0 8,"Threatening a number of nasty things. 8... NxR, freeing the B to defend the threatened K-side, may well be the best move of a bad lot for Black."
16,Rxf6,f8f6,rnbqk3/pppp2Qp/5r2/2b3B1/8/2P5/PP3nPP/RN2KBNR w KQq - 0 9,"Desperate, Black gives up his Rook in an attempt to break the attack."
17,Bxf6,g5f6,rnbqk3/pppp2Qp/5B2/2b5/8/2P5/PP3nPP/RN2KBNR b KQq - 0 9,Morphy's attack loses none of its force.
