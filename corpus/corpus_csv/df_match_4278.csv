1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Most of my chess playing was done in my younger years. I started playing with my dad at a very young age and played my first rated tournament when I was about 12. I peaked my senior year in high school, and then started to lose interest until when I was in my early twenties I hardly played at all. A few years ago I started playing again, and found that my temperament has changed quite a bit. I'm not sure I ever answered 1. e4 with e5 in my whole tournament career!"
