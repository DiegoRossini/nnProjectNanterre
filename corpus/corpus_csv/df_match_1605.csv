8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/6B1/3Q4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R3KBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"I didn't like this move, since I don't want to block the c pawn, and in fact I thought strongly about c5 at once. But Qe5+ was very annoying, so I opted for this, knowing that I will be struggle against the white knight's jumps on the 5th rank."
9,Qe3+,d4e3,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/6B1/8/2N1Q3/PPP1PPPP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 2 5,"Well, I have to get out of this, and swapping queens will help me to develop the bishop f7 to e7, defending the knight. BUT white can of course play BxN, and now I have to QxQ, fxQ will leave him with weak doubled pawns. But white has Nd5... Provoking QxQ but retaking with the kinght, then o-o-o..."

I have to catch up in developement, and he just left me the chance to to that. I should have provoked it with h6, but Bf4 opens a new treat on c7, and besides Nd5 is still a possibility for white."
12,Qxe3+,e7e3,r1b1kb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/6B1/8/2N1q3/PPP1PPPP/2KR1BNR w kq - 0 7,"...and now, this is nastier than it seems. It threats to double white's central pawns (they are weak because black has the two bishops and the semi open column in front of them."

16,Nxf2,g4f2,r1b1kb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/5B2/2N5/PPP1PnPP/2KR1BNR w kq - 0 9,...which is more than a fork: white can't save the h1 rook.
17,Rd4,d1d4,r1b1kb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3R1B2/2N5/PPP1PnPP/2K2BNR b kq - 1 9,"On the contrary, he thinks in activating its other rook. A good idea, but overlooks..."

19,e3,e2e3,r1b1kb1r/pppp1ppp/8/8/3n1B2/2N1P3/PPP2nPP/2K2BNR b kq - 0 10,"White could have taken the c7 pawn. Black can move some pawns trying to block it, and white will lose some developement advantage, but still it left the d pawn isolated, and that is good for white."
