1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"So I started with my usual. I should perhaps add that I am annotating the game on the morning after. I am pretty sure of all the moves, but I may have got them in the wrong order! Wine was served with the lunch, which may explain the poor quality of this game! We were also moving quite fast - just like we used to have a quick game after lunch when we were students together!"
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,He replies in kind.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,I go into the Queen's Gambit.
4,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"He replies with the Albin's Counter Gambit! He always played this as a child, but it had slipped my mind."
5,dxe5,d4e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pP3/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,So I take.
6,d4,d5d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/2Pp4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,He advances. The careless move 4.e3? can lead to the Lasker Trap. After 4...Bb4+ 5.Bd2 dxe3 6.Bxb4?? is a blunderâ€”6...exf2+ 7.Ke2 fxg1=N+! and Black wins. The Lasker Trap is notable because it is rare to see an underpromotion in practical play.
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/2Pp4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,So I played this.
8,Bb4+,f8b4,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/1bPp4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,"This is unusual. Black normally plays c5 or Nc6. Michael aims for c5, but he wants to exchange black square bishops first, rather than be left with a bishop on f8 restricted by the pawn on c5."
9,Bd2,c1d2,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/1bPp4/5N2/PP1BPPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 3 5,I figure that exchanges help me as I am a pawn up.
10,Bxd2+,b4d2,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/2Pp4/5N2/PP1bPPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,He takes.
11,Nbxd2,b1d2,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/2Pp4/5N2/PP1NPPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,I develop my knight.
12,c5,c7c5,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/8/2p1P3/2Pp4/5N2/PP1NPPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,He continues with his plan.
13,g3,g2g3,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/8/2p1P3/2Pp4/5NP1/PP1NPP1P/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,Development of the Bf1 to g2 is very common in this opening.
14,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk1nr/pp3ppp/2n5/2p1P3/2Pp4/5NP1/PP1NPP1P/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,Michael develops.
15,Bg2,f1g2,r1bqk1nr/pp3ppp/2n5/2p1P3/2Pp4/5NP1/PP1NPPBP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 2 8,So do I.
16,f6,f7f6,r1bqk1nr/pp4pp/2n2p2/2p1P3/2Pp4/5NP1/PP1NPPBP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 9,"Black turns it into a proper gambit, rather than try to regain the pawn."
17,exf6,e5f6,r1bqk1nr/pp4pp/2n2P2/2p5/2Pp4/5NP1/PP1NPPBP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 9,So I take.
18,Nxf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/pp4pp/2n2n2/2p5/2Pp4/5NP1/PP1NPPBP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 10,He takes back.
19,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk2r/pp4pp/2n2n2/2p5/2Pp4/5NP1/PP1NPPBP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 1 10,I castle.
20,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp4pp/2n2n2/2p5/2Pp4/5NP1/PP1NPPBP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 2 11,So does he.
