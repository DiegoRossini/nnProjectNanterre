1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is an old game I played when I was still a 1st category player, but it remains to this day one of my favourite (and best) games. I am posting it on Gameknot because it is a pretty typical Sicilian game, where Black counterattack is triggered basically by White's inactivity and lack of consistency. It is also a good representation of my playing style from that time - I was then a counterattacker, usually defending and waiting for the opponent to weaken his position before I charged in for the ""kill"". The Sicilian is simply perfect for this style of play."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Another important thing to mention is that in this game I felt that I was completely overmatched, as the rating difference clearly shows. My opponent was a strong and experienced master candidate in good form, while I started playing tournament chess in 1996., so I was still pretty inexperienced. My chances to ""survive"" were objectively minimal, but I played with a sence of desperation, determined not to go down without a fight. At that time I was literaly obsessed with development tempi (and still am I suppose), especially since I knew how important they are in such a sharp opening as the Sicilian. This factor will play a very big role in this game."

I never saw it before, so after some thought I decided to ""take advantage from it"" and remove the d4 Knight as I usually did, but without bringing the unpleasant Bd4 (after Be3) to the centre. This is actually not a bad decision, but today I would also consider playing 6...e6 and allowing the English attack (Be3, Qd2, 0-0-0, g4 etc.)."

The answer is simple: every move Black made was a straightforward and active developing move, except for 6...Nd4 - but that evened out with Qd4-Qd2 from White. On the other hand, White additionally played defensive 11.Kb1, and his Bg5 Bishop is somewhat badly placed - it doesn't really pressure Black position (B:f6 would be a bad exchange), while it can't block Bg7 at all (if it was on e3 then Bd4 would be a possibility). All Black pieces are in aggressive positions and are ready to attack. So obviously White has to neutralize the pressure on his position before he starts to play actively. There were two ways to do this: 12.Be3 (another loss of tempi) or 12.Nb5, a6; 13.Nd4 - both variations with equal game and a comfortable/happy Black player. The last straw is that 12.g4 actually creates another weakness on g4, as it will soon become apparent."

I played this move after only 5 minutes of thinking, but I was so excited that I couldn't make myself think any more :) actually this move is correct and the best available. The interesting thing is that after only 12 moves Black has a brutal attack on White's position, without any obvious blunder on White's part. But a small loss of tempi (Qd4-Qd2), a misplaced piece (Bg5), a consolidating move (Kb1) and an untimely (unprepared) display of activity (g4) together have tipped the scale in Black's favour."

Black is a Rook down but all remaining pieces are concentrating unopposed fire on the queenside. White now started to play seriously, but it is too late - the underdog Black had nothing to lose, and has sensed the golden opportunity. The plan is clear and everthing ""goes with music""."
