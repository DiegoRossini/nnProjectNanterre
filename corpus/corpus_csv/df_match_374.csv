14,d6,d7d6,rn1q1rk1/pbp1bppp/1p1ppn2/8/2PP4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 8,I went with d5-d6 which allows my b knight to access d7.
15,Bg5,c1g5,rn1q1rk1/pbp1bppp/1p1ppn2/6B1/2PP4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 8,White attacks my f knight with his DB to g5.
16,Nbd7,b8d7,r2q1rk1/pbpnbppp/1p1ppn2/6B1/2PP4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 2 9,I now develop my b knight to d7 which is now protecting my f knight.
17,e4,e2e4,r2q1rk1/pbpnbppp/1p1ppn2/6B1/2PPP3/2N2NP1/PP3PBP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 9,White takes further control of the centre with pawn to e4.
18,d5,d6d5,r2q1rk1/pbpnbppp/1p2pn2/3p2B1/2PPP3/2N2NP1/PP3PBP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 10,I attack the centre with d6 to e5.  This is protected by my LB at b7.
19,e5,e4e5,r2q1rk1/pbpnbppp/1p2pn2/3pP1B1/2PP4/2N2NP1/PP3PBP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 10,As expected white pushes his pawn to e5 which further attacks my knight at f6.
20,a6,a7a6,r2q1rk1/1bpnbppp/pp2pn2/3pP1B1/2PP4/2N2NP1/PP3PBP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 11,I move pawn a7 to a6.  Not sure why I did not move my f6 knight maybe I should have.
21,h3,h2h3,r2q1rk1/1bpnbppp/pp2pn2/3pP1B1/2PP4/2N2NPP/PP3PB1/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 11,White was keeping the tension and did not take my knight but went with pawn to h3.  I presume this was to prevent my now moving my knight to g4 which would have been the square if I decided to move it.
22,Re8,f8e8,r2qr1k1/1bpnbppp/pp2pn2/3pP1B1/2PP4/2N2NPP/PP3PB1/R2Q1RK1 w - - 1 12,I decide to move my rook across to e8 I believe I was intending to move my knight to f8.  I also am aware that white's DB could move to h6 and I do not want my rook in the firing line.
23,g4,g3g4,r2qr1k1/1bpnbppp/pp2pn2/3pP1B1/2PP2P1/2N2N1P/PP3PB1/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 12,White is pushing on the g file now with pawn to g4.
24,Nf8,d7f8,r2qrnk1/1bp1bppp/pp2pn2/3pP1B1/2PP2P1/2N2N1P/PP3PB1/R2Q1RK1 w - - 1 13,I move my knight to f8 and I expect my opponent is aware I intend to move my knight to g6.
25,exf6,e5f6,r2qrnk1/1bp1bppp/pp2pP2/3p2B1/2PP2P1/2N2N1P/PP3PB1/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 13,White now takes my f6 knight with his e5 pawn.
26,gxf6,g7f6,r2qrnk1/1bp1bp1p/pp2pp2/3p2B1/2PP2P1/2N2N1P/PP3PB1/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 14,I capture with my pawn which may not have been the best move as I had my queen at d8 and if I had taken with my DB and white had captured this then I could have recaptured white's DB with my queen.  I may have not felt I wanted to exchange my DB at this point and I would normally try to keep my DB when I am black.
27,Bh6,g5h6,r2qrnk1/1bp1bp1p/pp2pp1B/3p4/2PP2P1/2N2N1P/PP3PB1/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 14,As I thought white's DB moves to h6 and is now facing my knight at f8.  My king is now on an open file following my capture of white's pawn at f6.
28,Ng6,f8g6,r2qr1k1/1bp1bp1p/pp2ppnB/3p4/2PP2P1/2N2N1P/PP3PB1/R2Q1RK1 w - - 2 15,I move my knight to g6 and I was planning to move up to h4 to inhibit white's pawns from any further advance.
29,h4,h3h4,r2qr1k1/1bp1bp1p/pp2ppnB/3p4/2PP2PP/2N2N2/PP3PB1/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 15,Of course white must have seen my thoughts and pushes h3 pawn to h4.
30,e5,e6e5,r2qr1k1/1bp1bp1p/pp3pnB/3pp3/2PP2PP/2N2N2/PP3PB1/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 16,I maintain my knight at g6 as it is protected by the pawns and is a good position for present time.  So I push my e6 pawn to e5 attacking the centre again.
31,dxe5,d4e5,r2qr1k1/1bp1bp1p/pp3pnB/3pP3/2P3PP/2N2N2/PP3PB1/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 16,White captures my e5 pawn with his d4 pawn.
32,f5,f6f5,r2qr1k1/1bp1bp1p/pp4nB/3pPp2/2P3PP/2N2N2/PP3PB1/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 17,I push one of my doubled pawns on the f file to f5 attacking the pawn at g4.
