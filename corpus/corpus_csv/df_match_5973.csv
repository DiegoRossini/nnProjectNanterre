1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,The Traxler Counter-Attack - one of the sharpest openings in chess. The variations are still 'unclear' in many lines - despite all the software available nowadays for analysis. It is a particularly dangerous weapon in over-the-board tournament games; provided Black is prepared to specialize in its use. I've included the game here so that I can link to it in my blog.

18,d5,d7d5,r1b1k2N/ppp3pp/2n5/3pp3/2B4q/6n1/PPPP3P/RNBQ2KR w q - 0 10,Again - tempo: Black wants to 'clear the decks' of any driftwood. He need the c8 bishop and the remaining rook to join the attack without further delay - absolutely nothing else matters. If he dithers for even a single move - then White will consolidate - perhaps giving back a little of the material - but will definitely win.
