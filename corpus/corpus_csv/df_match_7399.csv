1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Quite an interesting game from the tournament I most recently participated in, ending in my first victory against a 1700+ rated player. In this game I had the Black pieces."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Four Knights Opening (so named for fairly obvious reasons). This tends to lead to fairly quiet play.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Four Knights Opening (so named for fairly obvious reasons). This tends to lead to fairly quiet play.
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,Four Knights Opening (so named for fairly obvious reasons). This tends to lead to fairly quiet play.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 3,Four Knights Opening (so named for fairly obvious reasons). This tends to lead to fairly quiet play.
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 4 4,Four Knights Opening (so named for fairly obvious reasons). This tends to lead to fairly quiet play.
7,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1B2p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 5 4,The most common move at higher levels. Beginners often play 4. Bc4 but this can be answered by 4... Nxe4! leading to a good position for Black.
8,Nd4,c6d4,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/1B2p3/3nP3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 6 5,"This is Rubinstein's Variation, more aggressive than the symmetrical 4... Bb4. Note that White cannot win a pawn by 5. Nxe5 as Black regains it after 5... Qe7."
9,Bc4,b5c4,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2BnP3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 7 5,Less common than 5. Ba4 or 5. Nxd4. Note that 5... Nxe4 is less good now with e5 undefended; one possible continuation is the wild 6. Bxf7+ Kxf7 7. Nxe5+ and now watch what happens if Black gets too greedy: 7... Ke6 8. Nxe4 Kxe5 9. Qh5+ Kxe4 10. d3#!!

11,d3,d2d3,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/2b1p3/2BnP3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,The database gives 6. Nxe5 as the most common here; this leads to 6... Qe7 7. Nxf7 Rf8 8. Ng5 d5 9. Be2 dxe4 with an unclear position.
