1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game is intended to teach an amateur player why not to overexpose their queen in the opening.  

1. c4 is known as the English Opening, and is one of my favorites, because though it often draws at the elite level, among amateurs, it simply produces positions that are not suceptable to common tricks and traps that amateurs learn from more skilled players."

4,Qxd5,d8d5,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,?? This is not how to play this gambit correctly!  Exposing the queen this early is nearly always a mistake.  Better would have been Nf6.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"? Another mistake, this allows white to continue to harass the queen while building an insurmountable lead in development and center control."

White is now winning handily."
