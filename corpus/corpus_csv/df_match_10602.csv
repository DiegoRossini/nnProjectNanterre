12,Nxe5,c6e5,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/5n2/1Bb1n3/4P3/1P3N2/P1PP1PPP/RN1QK2R w KQ - 0 7,"Just a trick to start my combination. White might have expected this, but if he did, then he didn't deeply explore move. Or he didn't thing that I would sacrifice the Bishop. The best move now in my opinion is now D4. You can't let the Bishop get access to F2 if you still haven't castled."
