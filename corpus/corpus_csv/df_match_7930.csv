1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"1.d4 is my standard opening move with white, so my repertoire mostly contains openings like Queens Gambit, Slav or semi-slav, King's-Queens or Nimzo Indian, Grunfeld, Benko Gambit and Modern Defence systems. With black I only play the Sicilian (Najdorf) against 1.e4."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"D06: Queens Gambit. Of course black can play 2...c6, entering the Slav defence."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"D06: Queens Gambit. Of course black can play 2...c6, entering the Slav defence."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"? But this is not the strongest continuation. Of course its playable, but white usually gets a good position."
5,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/3P4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,The best move of course. Black can't avoid losing a tempo.
6,Nxd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3n4/3P4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,If 3...Qxd5? then ofcourse 4.Nc3.
7,e4,e2e4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3n4/3PP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"But now white can play e4 straightaway, which is often the goal in these kind of positions."
8,Nb6,d5b6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/1n6/8/3PP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,last bookmove.
9,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/1n6/8/3PP3/3B4/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 5,"?! I decided to set up a cheap trick, but at the same time develop my bishop."
10,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/1n2p3/8/3PP3/3B4/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,"Of course the d4 is poisoned, due to Bb5+, but here black missed a chance to equalise with 5... e5! followed by something like 6. dxe5 Nc6."
11,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/1n2p3/8/3PP3/2NB4/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 6,Black is somewhat behind in development.
12,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/1n2p3/8/1b1PP3/2NB4/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 2 7,I think 6... Be7 is slightly better.
13,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/1n2p3/8/1b1PP3/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 7,"? Black is already behind in development, so 7... Nc6 was the most logical continuation."
14,Bxc3+,b4c3,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/1n2p3/8/3PP3/2bB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"? Black is already behind in development, so 7... Nc6 was the most logical continuation."
15,bxc3,b2c3,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/1n2p3/8/3PP3/2PB1N2/P4PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,"White is already 'winning' here. Control of the centre, lead in development, space on the king side and let's not forget the Bishop pair."
16,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/1nn1p3/8/3PP3/2PB1N2/P4PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 9,Finally the knight comes into play.
17,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/1nn1p3/8/3PP3/2PB1N2/P4PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 2 9,? I don't like this move. He should have played 9... O-O while he still had the chance.
18,Bd7,c8d7,r2qk2r/pppb1ppp/1nn1p3/8/3PP3/2PB1N2/P4PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 3 10,? I don't like this move. He should have played 9... O-O while he still had the chance.
19,Ba3,c1a3,r2qk2r/pppb1ppp/1nn1p3/8/3PP3/B1PB1N2/P4PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 4 10,But now dark clouds are gathering in the sky. From this square the bishop prevents black from castling.
20,h6,h7h6,r2qk2r/pppb1pp1/1nn1p2p/8/3PP3/B1PB1N2/P4PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 11,"?? Best was 10... Qf6 and then castling queen side, but this move allows white to come up with a nice tactical blow, so try to find the best move for white now."
21,d5,d4d5,r2qk2r/pppb1pp1/1nn1p2p/3P4/4P3/B1PB1N2/P4PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 11,! Did you find it?
22,exd5,e6d5,r2qk2r/pppb1pp1/1nn4p/3p4/4P3/B1PB1N2/P4PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 12,? I was expecting 11... Ne7 and then 12. c4. But black apparently just goes along with the ride.
23,exd5,e4d5,r2qk2r/pppb1pp1/1nn4p/3P4/8/B1PB1N2/P4PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 12,Now the e-file is opened up of course.
