1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi! this game only my recent victory against a tough opponent. He gave me a lot of pressure before I managed to outplayed him. I'm playing black so I'm preparing my fave Sicilian Defense once he opened e4. So let me hear all of your criticisms and suggestion, because my annotation was based on my logical perception and evaluations.

My opponent played e4.."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Most of the time I replied c5, It's very rare I used e5. But e5 is the most logical and solid  reply from black"
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"My opponent continued his development according to widely accepted opening theory. Nf6 control the e5 and influenced the d4 square, and as well the normal development of of one of his minor pieces for the purpose of  king castle."
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"I played my favorite Najdorf variation, the fave of Fischer and Kasparov. This move gives black queen bishop free development and to restrict white pawn advance in e5 square."
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"d4 the most common reply from white. Danish GM Bent Larsen heavily criticized the exchange of  center pawn with the plank pawns. He developed and popularized one opening,  the Larsen Opening which begin with b3."
6,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,the normal reply from black
7,Bb5+,f1b5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/1B6/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,white was too aggressive with this move.
8,Bd7,c8d7,rn1qkbnr/pp1bpppp/3p4/1B6/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,I can play Nc6 which is the usual reply from black. But  I want to try other possible variations.
9,Bxd7+,b5d7,rn1qkbnr/pp1Bpppp/3p4/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"Maybe his first objective is to remove my queen bishop, since no one will pin his knight in f3 and as well his light square are much more defined and objective than my position."
10,Nxd7,b8d7,r2qkbnr/pp1npppp/3p4/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"I think 5..Nc6 are much good than this move, but I want to try other variations and the next couple of moves out of bookline."
11,Qxd4,d1d4,r2qkbnr/pp1npppp/3p4/8/3QP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 6,"centralizing his queen and also restrict the advance of my g pawn, most of the players agree 6. Nxd4 is the logical move"
12,Ngf6,g8f6,r2qkb1r/pp1npppp/3p1n2/8/3QP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 1 7,"White other good continuation are: 7. 0-0 e5, 8. Qe3 Be7, 9. Nc3 0-0, 10. h3 Qc7 11. Bd2 Qc6, and white has a small advantage"
13,Nc3,b1c3,r2qkb1r/pp1npppp/3p1n2/8/3QP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 2 7,"White other good continuation are: 7. 0-0 e5, 8. Qe3 Be7, 9. Nc3 0-0, 10. h3 Qc7 11. Bd2 Qc6, and white has a small advantage"
14,g6,g7g6,r2qkb1r/pp1npp1p/3p1np1/8/3QP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 0 8,"I'm worry to play 7..e6 here because white is still postponing his castling in kingside. I think he want a long castling, The purpose of this castling, his queen rook supporting his queen attacking my d6 pawn and as well preparing for kingside attack. atleast my pawn at this moment it is supported by e7 pawn, so I decided to fianchetto my bishop and then king castle."
15,Be3,c1e3,r2qkb1r/pp1npp1p/3p1np1/8/3QP3/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 1 8,Just what I feel...
16,Bg7,f8g7,r2qk2r/pp1nppbp/3p1np1/8/3QP3/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 2 9,I'm looking the safety of my king before white break the center.
17,O-O-O,e1c1,r2qk2r/pp1nppbp/3p1np1/8/3QP3/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b kq - 3 9,"White start to break the center, which in my opinion was to premature. I think the most accurate plan for white is start to advance his h pawn and preparing to exchange his bishop against my bishop in g7 or vice versa, and then shift his forces in kingside"
18,O-O,e8g8,r2q1rk1/pp1nppbp/3p1np1/8/3QP3/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/2KR3R w - - 4 10,"White start to break the center, which in my opinion was to premature.

20,Nh5,f6h5,r2q1rk1/pp1nppbp/3p2p1/4P2n/3Q4/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/2KR3R w - - 1 11,"just intended to pin the pawn and the white queen, but with loss of my two minor pieces in exchange of a rook. If 10.. Ne8, white continue 11. Bf4 then 12. Rhe1. Either my move white still has slight edge 10.. Nh5 I admit is too risky to exchange my two minor pieces against rook!!"
21,g4,g2g4,r2q1rk1/pp1nppbp/3p2p1/4P2n/3Q2P1/2N1BN2/PPP2P1P/2KR3R b - - 0 11,"Before I played 10..Nf5, I already anticipate white will make this committal move."
