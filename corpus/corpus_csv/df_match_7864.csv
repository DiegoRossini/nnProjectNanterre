1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Here's a lucky escape which shows the value of not automatically resigning in the face of overwhelming odds.  I owe some virtual flowers to my opponent.  Hopefully this draw may save me from demotion from D1 in the immediate future.  White starts with the English Opening, a very sound one that suits a strategically minded player."
