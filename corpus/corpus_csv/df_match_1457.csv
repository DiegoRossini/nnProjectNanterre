2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The Icelandic. At higher levels it won't be safe, but for fun and as a test for myself, it's a good ""battlefield"" for training. It forces me to find the ""best"" move at any moment. The try is more valuable because my opponent didn't play the usual (and bad) c4. Now I'll have a real ""test""."

7,dxe6,d5e6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4Pn2/8/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,Good.
8,Bxe6,c8e6,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4bn2/8/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,As the manual says.
9,Nf3,g1f3,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4bn2/8/8/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"This moves enables for black the plan Qe7, wanting to use the discovered check (Bg4+) to follow on with BxN, forcing white to retake with the g2 pawn. This just scrambles and isolates white's pawns. Of course, this plan implies the longside castling."
10,Qe7,d8e7,rn2kb1r/ppp1qppp/4bn2/8/8/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,"I go for it. I'm not worried for blocking myself the Bf8. I have to find a way to develop it in the near future, right, and is one of the opening's downsides."
11,Be2,f1e2,rn2kb1r/ppp1qppp/4bn2/8/8/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 6,"White is almos forced to play this. Note that Bb5+ is a blunder, since after c6 (black has this move in the agenda, too, but better is to keep it to prevent white's check and not to waste a tempo in doing it prematurely), white's bishop has to retreat to e7."
12,Bg4,e6g4,rn2kb1r/ppp1qppp/5n2/8/6b1/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 4 7,"This was a bad move, since now white can castle, and the open e column will revert on black."
13,O-O,e1g1,rn2kb1r/ppp1qppp/5n2/8/6b1/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 5 7,"I have to ensure the queenside castling the next move, but in doing so, I am neglecting the dsb's developement. Now my queen would struggle to find a place. All this because of Bg4?"
14,Nbd7,b8d7,r3kb1r/pppnqppp/5n2/8/6b1/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 6 8,"I have to ensure the queenside castling the next move, but in doing so, I am neglecting the dsb's developement. Now my queen would struggle to find a place. All this because of Bg4?"

17,Nd4,f3d4,r3kb1r/pppnqppp/5n2/7b/3N4/2N4P/PPPPBPP1/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 2 9,"...and here, it came a hard decision. I can exchange, for a boring game. Or I can try something else. Inmediately after I played the following move, it seemed to me very unwise. Nb5 is a very strong move, and I should have used the exchange to play c6 and stop it for a while. But I didn't see it at the moment."
18,Bg6,h5g6,r3kb1r/pppnqppp/5nb1/8/3N4/2N4P/PPPPBPP1/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 3 10,"My B and N block the advance of my own pawns, further imprisioning my dsb. Still, I like the way I am controlling a lot of center squares, and how white has to resolve his developement, too. Sure, no weak points in his position, and my queenside is weak."
19,d3,d2d3,r3kb1r/pppnqppp/5nb1/8/3N4/2NP3P/PPP1BPP1/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 10,"He didn't play a N to b5. Incredible. This was his first ""blunder"". This move frees his dsb, true, but he also gives me tempos to coordinate."
20,c6,c7c6,r3kb1r/pp1nqppp/2p2nb1/8/3N4/2NP3P/PPP1BPP1/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 11,"AAAAAhhhhh.... I feel a lot better, now! The sac (Nb5, threatening the fork), is not effective anymore without the bishop looking at b5."
21,Re1,f1e1,r3kb1r/pp1nqppp/2p2nb1/8/3N4/2NP3P/PPP1BPP1/R1BQR1K1 b kq - 1 11,"Enabling the dangerous pin. Note that when I decided to keep the bishop in b6 (""it looked such a nice spot!""), I gave up the Be6 ""shield"" that could have been useful. But it is a defensive move, and I know how most ""purely defensive"" plans end..."

I couldn't see where did it lead, so I preferred to take advantage on the unprotected Nd4 and free my dsb in the meantime. That will prove to be very ""expensive"", in terms of queen's hunt. Can you figure out?"
