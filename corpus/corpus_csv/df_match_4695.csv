This is the moment I decide a crazy attack

game analysis tells me that the way to go would be: â€¦ Qe8 16. f4 Bxf4 17. gxf4 axb5 18. Qxb5 Qxb5 19. Bxb5 Rxa3 20. O-O Nxe4 21. Rd7 Nc3 22. Bc4 b5 23. Bd3"

the idea with this ladder games is to be bold on the approach to the game. 

In Team games and Tournaments I would never would try this"
