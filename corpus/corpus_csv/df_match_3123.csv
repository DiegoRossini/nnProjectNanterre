1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,So here I was up against the highest rated player in the tournament
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,So I reply with my usual
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,He follows the main line
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,and so do I
5,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,He continues with the Open Sicilian
6,cxd4,c5d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,So I take
7,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,He takes back
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,I hit the e pawn
9,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,He defends
10,d6,d7d6,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,I stop ideas such as Nd4xNc6 followed by e5. All this is very standard
11,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"And this is the most popular too, the Richterâ€“Rauzer Attack. The move 6.Bg5 was Kurt Richter's invention, threatening to double Black's pawns after Bxf6 and forestalling the Dragon by rendering 6...g6 unplayable, as g6 is simply met by BxNf6 and after exf6 Black's pawns are a mess, the d6 pawn in particular being isolated and backward on a semi-open file and the d5 square is open for White's pieces."
12,Bd7,c8d7,r2qkb1r/pp1bpppp/2np1n2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 7,I follow a suggestion by Barden
13,f4,f2f4,r2qkb1r/pp1bpppp/2np1n2/6B1/3NPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,He continues to develop
14,a6,a7a6,r2qkb1r/1p1bpppp/p1np1n2/6B1/3NPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,"I start queen side operations. Qb6 is probably stronger, taking advantage of the fact this his Bg5 can't defend dark squares in the centre."
15,Qd2,d1d2,r2qkb1r/1p1bpppp/p1np1n2/6B1/3NPP2/2N5/PPPQ2PP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 1 8,He prepares to castle
16,b5,b7b5,r2qkb1r/3bpppp/p1np1n2/1p4B1/3NPP2/2N5/PPPQ2PP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 9,I continue to expand on the queen side
17,O-O-O,e1c1,r2qkb1r/3bpppp/p1np1n2/1p4B1/3NPP2/2N5/PPPQ2PP/2KR1B1R b kq - 1 9,He castles
18,b4,b5b4,r2qkb1r/3bpppp/p1np1n2/6B1/1p1NPP2/2N5/PPPQ2PP/2KR1B1R w kq - 0 10,"So I hit his knight. Now he can play 10. Bg5xNf6 as after bxNc3, hitting the white queen, White can play 11. Qd2xc3 and after gxBf6 play 12. Nd4xNc6, winning a pawn. However Black can reply with Qc7 and after White retreats his knight, exchange queens on c3 and the position is about level. Black has compensation for being a pawn down, as White's queen side pawns are smashed. This was better for White compared to what happened, where White ends up a pawn down AND a broken pawn formation."
19,Nd5,c3d5,r2qkb1r/3bpppp/p1np1n2/3N2B1/1p1NPP2/8/PPPQ2PP/2KR1B1R b kq - 1 10,So he keeps his knight
20,Nxe4,f6e4,r2qkb1r/3bpppp/p1np4/3N2B1/1p1NnP2/8/PPPQ2PP/2KR1B1R w kq - 0 11,"But loses a pawn, and his queen and bishop are forked"
