2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"This move is the single most striking of the game. With Black having what is clearly a bad bishop, obstructed by its own pawns, Petrosian actually exchanges it off! It might seem as though he has taken leave of his senses, but in fact, of course, it is an exceptionally deep decision. The most obvious way for White to play this position is to exchange rooks, and bishop for knight, and so aim to reach an ending with knight versus the ""bad bishop"". Let us assume that Black cooperates fully in allowing this: 18. Rxd8 Rxd8 19. Rd1 lRxd1+ 20. Kxd1 h6 (Black could of course move his knight to c8, to avoid the further exchange,
but we will assume he ""comes quietly"") 21. Bxb6+ Kxb6 22. g4. 
White has achieved his ""dream"" position. Black has the bad bishop, and White's pieces have great squares on e4 and f5. So why did Petrosian not go in for this? The reason is because he considered that White has few, if any, chances of winning from here, the main problem being that bad bishops are very good defenders of weak pawns, whilst White has no way to break through. Black sticks his king on e6 and waits. Even if White gets his knight to fs and king to e4, Black just drops his bishop back to f8 and marks time with his king. In Petrosian's own words, ""winning such a position would be very, very difficult, if not impossible Instead, Petrosian chooses another plan entirely. Recognizing that Black's formally bad bishop is actually an effective defender of his  weaknesses on f6 and h6, he exchanges it, so as to increase the vulnerability of these targets."
