1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Easily the best first move for white, though some people prefer the dubious 1. d4?."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"An unorthodox move for white. I did this to throw off my opponent, since he probably knows the sicilian better than I do. As we'll see, my suspicions were correct, and once we leave the main-line sicilian, this guy has no idea what to do. Classic sign of a guy who memorizes openings but doesn't actually know how to play them."
