5,c4,c2c4,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2P3b1/8/PP1PPPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 3,"... white offers another poisoned pawn. Having studied this opening in a 19th century game, I know not to take the second pawn. If I do, the white bishop takes b7 and then takes a8 one move later. For the gain of two pawns, black loses a pawn and a rook."
6,Be6,g4e6,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/4b3/3p4/2P5/8/PP1PPPBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 4,I pull the bishop back to protect my own pawn. This move block's the king's pawn and hence makes it harder for my dark square bishop to get out and join the fight.
7,Qa4+,d1a4,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/4b3/3p4/Q1P5/8/PP1PPPBP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 2 4,"I guessed white would bring the queen out early to put me in check. Possible responses are to bring back the bishop to d7 and threaten the queen, move the knight to c6 to block the queen's attack, block with my own queen, or use a lowly pawn. Regardless of black's move, I suspect white will move the queen to b4 and threaten the unprotected b7 pawn."

10,b6,b7b6,rn1qkbnr/p3pppp/1pp1b3/3p4/1QP5/8/PP1PPPBP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 0 6,"White decides to take out black's bishop, take control over the center, and have a momentary advantage in material. Here, I can retake white's bishop with the pawn and be 1 pawn up, but that advantage is too momentary since white can go Qb5+ Nd7, Qxd5 followed by either e6 or Nf6."
