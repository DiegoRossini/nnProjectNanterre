9,c3,c2c3,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/1bB1P3/2P2N2/P2P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,This is the point of the Evans gambit.
10,Ba5,b4a5,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/b3p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/P2P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 6,"Retreating the DSB while keeping the pressure on c3. Matter of fact, this is the only black move that prevents white from getting a keepable pawn center with d4."
11,d4,d2d4,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/b3p3/2BPP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,Anderssen plays 6 d4 anyway. Notice that the c3 pawn is pinned.

Black effectively prevented the strong pawn center, but lost lots of time, and now the attack will begin. Better was 7 ... dxc3."
15,Qb3,d1b3,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/b7/2B1P3/1QPp1N2/P4PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 1 8,Attacking the weak pawn. Usually the fast attacks in the opening when black is slow castling come on f7. Notice white does not defend the hanging d pawn...white will have plenty of chances to take this pawn later. It cannot be defended easily by black.
16,Qf6,d8f6,r1b1k1nr/pppp1ppp/2n2q2/b7/2B1P3/1QPp1N2/P4PPP/RNB2RK1 w kq - 2 9,Defends f7 while double-attacking c3.

Although the e file is not yet open, white puts tremendous pressure on the center. For example, black cannot play 10 ... d6 11 exd6+, and white is poised to play the battering ram pawn push e6. The e5 pawn is a thorn in black's side."
