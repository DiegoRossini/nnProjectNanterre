The first game was titled ""A Little Less Careless"" and is annotated on 4/09/2009. This time I'm black and play the Indian system against 1. d4. This game consumes 33 moves in a 45-day span and felt gruelingly slow. And when all the dust settled, this was the final game of the team match and the teams tied, 3-3."
