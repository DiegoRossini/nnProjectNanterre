1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"hello everyone, today I will annotate I game I just finished against a lower rated player. Unfortunately for me, I challenged this player when I was still 1200, but the game was finished when I was 1700, so I lost rating points for winning. However, I will try to illustrate some points about my opponent's play: HE played pretty well for a 1200.

So, my opponent plays e4. Here, I was going to try and play an open sicilian. I would not do this against a more experienced player, because I play open sicilians badly(theory, theory, theory) and prefer closed or alapin variations."
