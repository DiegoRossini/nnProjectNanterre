1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone, I have the first of a set of 3 recent games where my opponents have fallen to a Snap Mate.  Two were against the same opponent - in fact this match was in the Barmy Army Mini-Tournament and in the return challenge which will be part 2, this opponent met the same fate!  The third game was an unrated game against a 1500  player.  Note the ratings.  These 2 players are intermediate players so this fate can befall anyone - usually this happens when you are so wrapped up in your own plans you overlook your opponent's and you find yourself down a king, yikes!  I hope you have a good read.  Cheers - Joanne"
