I don't know. Don't ask why. I think I was sleepy. I was brushing up on the French, reading about how white plays c3 in response to c5 from black. After I was done reading about the French, I came back and led off with 3. c3 for no good reason other than I guess it was stuck in my head. So, since it's not in the ECO, and I can't find any reference to it, I guess it's mine now, hence the Utah Gambit variation of the French Defense. At least I know I won't be leaning on the GK DB for this opening now... :)"
