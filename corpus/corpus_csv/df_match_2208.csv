1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"(Notes by GM Ray Keene.) Kramnik, the defending world champion, scored a brilliant victory in the 14th and final game; Peter Leko resigned after 41 moves when faced with checkmate. This is only the third time in the entire history of the World Championship that the defending champion has saved his title by winning in the final game. The game itself was a jewel of controlled aggression. Despite consistent exchanges throughout the game, Kramnik maintained an iron grip on the position and ultimately blasted his way into the black camp via the dark squares. Taking no account of material sacrifices it was Kramnik’s king that dealt the fatal blow when it marched right into the heart of the opposing position. This outstanding game, the best of the match, recalled the classic fifth game won by Petrosian against Botvinnik in 1963 when a similarly epic king march in an endgame brought White a classic victory. ""I had to give everything, especially at the end, to win against such an opponent. Peter Leko is an incredible defender. For me it was more difficult than my match against Kasparov in the year 2000"", said Kramnik after the game. Leko said in conclusion: ""It was a very hard fight. In the end, it was not enough for me to win the title. I'm disappointed, but I'm looking forward to the future. I'm 25 years old, and I hope to get a new chance to become world champion.""
