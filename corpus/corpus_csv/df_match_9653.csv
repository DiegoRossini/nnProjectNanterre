The idea of the King's Gambit is to temporarily sacrifice a pawn for good development and to decoy the black pawn from the centre.  White will get this here, sure as you are born!  In fact, as you will see, my opponent is a MASTER!! Given the circumstances, (I try to hold on to the pawn at the expense of my development and I will pay, pay pay!!) I bet you will think it is a wonder that I last 27 moves!!"

5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,3. ........ d6 - I am thinking about a couple of KGA games I had with dmaestro in which he played this move against me and I got really tied up.  I never regained the pawn and I lost both games - maybe it is worth trying this out on Master Chrisobee.

7,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/3PPp2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"4. d4! - Master Chrisobee finds an improvement to my previous efforts against dmaestro which are as follows:-
d3 0-1  jstevens1 (1675) vs. dmaestro (1600) 
d4 0-1  jstevens1 (1675) vs. dmaestro (1600) 

This move strikes at the centre and causes problems for me later on."
