1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,My standard opening with white
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Bremen variation
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,Bremen variation
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,Bremen variation
5,g3,g2g3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2P5/2N3P1/PP1PPP1P/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,Bremen variation
6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3pp3/2P5/2N3P1/PP1PPP1P/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,This is almost a reflex move as the English opening allows black to build a centre before destroying it.  So this is the most direct application of that idea
7,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3Pp3/8/2N3P1/PP1PPP1P/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,This is almost a reflex move as the English opening allows black to build a centre before destroying it.  So this is the most direct application of that idea
8,Nxd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3np3/8/2N3P1/PP1PPP1P/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,and black has effectively exchanged his centre pawn for my b-pawn.  Not a great idea in my opinion
9,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3np3/8/2N3P1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 5,and black has effectively exchanged his centre pawn for my b-pawn.  Not a great idea in my opinion
10,Nxc3,d5c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/4p3/8/2n3P1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,and black has effectively exchanged his centre pawn for my b-pawn.  Not a great idea in my opinion
11,bxc3,b2c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/4p3/8/2P3P1/P2PPPBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 6,and black has effectively exchanged his centre pawn for my b-pawn.  Not a great idea in my opinion
12,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/4p3/8/2P3P1/P2PPPBP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 1 7,much better was Bc5
13,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/4p3/8/2P2NP1/P2PPPBP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 7,much better was Bc5
14,e4,e5e4,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/8/4p3/2P2NP1/P2PPPBP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,much better was Bc5
15,Ng1,f3g1,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/8/4p3/2P3P1/P2PPPBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 8,opening the diagonal for the B and allowing the N to find a safer home
16,f5,f7f5,r1bqkb1r/ppp3pp/2n5/5p2/4p3/2P3P1/P2PPPBP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 9,much better would have been d3 to further open the diagonal  Or 0-0 and get the K to safety
17,Nh3,g1h3,r1bqkb1r/ppp3pp/2n5/5p2/4p3/2P3PN/P2PPPBP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 9,much better would have been d3 to further open the diagonal  Or 0-0 and get the K to safety
18,Be6,c8e6,r2qkb1r/ppp3pp/2n1b3/5p2/4p3/2P3PN/P2PPPBP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 10,much better would have been d3 to further open the diagonal  Or 0-0 and get the K to safety
19,Rb1,a1b1,r2qkb1r/ppp3pp/2n1b3/5p2/4p3/2P3PN/P2PPPBP/1RBQK2R b Kkq - 3 10,much better would have been d3 to further open the diagonal  Or 0-0 and get the K to safety
20,Rb8,a8b8,1r1qkb1r/ppp3pp/2n1b3/5p2/4p3/2P3PN/P2PPPBP/1RBQK2R w Kk - 4 11,slightly better was Qd7 giving teh chance of 0-0-0 getting the K to safety and making a much more complex game
21,d3,d2d3,1r1qkb1r/ppp3pp/2n1b3/5p2/4p3/2PP2PN/P3PPBP/1RBQK2R b Kk - 0 11,should have played Rb5 hitting a target that could not just move away
22,Bxa2,e6a2,1r1qkb1r/ppp3pp/2n5/5p2/4p3/2PP2PN/b3PPBP/1RBQK2R w Kk - 0 12,should have played Rb5 hitting a target that could not just move away
23,Rb2,b1b2,1r1qkb1r/ppp3pp/2n5/5p2/4p3/2PP2PN/bR2PPBP/2BQK2R b Kk - 1 12,should have played Rb5 hitting a target that could not just move away
24,Bf7,a2f7,1r1qkb1r/ppp2bpp/2n5/5p2/4p3/2PP2PN/1R2PPBP/2BQK2R w Kk - 2 13,Qa4 temporarily dissuades black from exd which would break up my centre pawns and expose the K before it castled
25,Qa4,d1a4,1r1qkb1r/ppp2bpp/2n5/5p2/Q3p3/2PP2PN/1R2PPBP/2B1K2R b Kk - 3 13,Qa4 temporarily dissuades black from exd which would break up my centre pawns and expose the K before it castled
26,Qf6,d8f6,1r2kb1r/ppp2bpp/2n2q2/5p2/Q3p3/2PP2PN/1R2PPBP/2B1K2R w Kk - 4 14,Alittle late but now i can relax and plan
27,O-O,e1g1,1r2kb1r/ppp2bpp/2n2q2/5p2/Q3p3/2PP2PN/1R2PPBP/2B2RK1 b k - 5 14,Alittle late but now i can relax and plan
28,Qxc3,f6c3,1r2kb1r/ppp2bpp/2n5/5p2/Q3p3/2qP2PN/1R2PPBP/2B2RK1 w k - 0 15,i commented to my opponent about pawn pinching and he said 'what have i got to lose?'  well as we shall see with the Q isolated out of place - quite a lot
29,Ng5,h3g5,1r2kb1r/ppp2bpp/2n5/5pN1/Q3p3/2qP2P1/1R2PPBP/2B2RK1 b k - 1 15,why guard a pawn that is well protected?  Qa5 would have forced the issue and prevented the moves that follow
30,Bg8,f7g8,1r2kbbr/ppp3pp/2n5/5pN1/Q3p3/2qP2P1/1R2PPBP/2B2RK1 w k - 2 16,why guard a pawn that is well protected?  Qa5 would have forced the issue and prevented the moves that follow
31,dxe4,d3e4,1r2kbbr/ppp3pp/2n5/5pN1/Q3P3/2q3P1/1R2PPBP/2B2RK1 b k - 0 16,offering the exchange
32,Qc4,c3c4,1r2kbbr/ppp3pp/2n5/5pN1/Q1q1P3/6P1/1R2PPBP/2B2RK1 w k - 1 17,offering the exchange
33,Qa1,a4a1,1r2kbbr/ppp3pp/2n5/5pN1/2q1P3/6P1/1R2PPBP/Q1B2RK1 b k - 2 17,but i prefer to keep my Q on the a-file as part of my attack
34,h6,h7h6,1r2kbbr/ppp3p1/2n4p/5pN1/2q1P3/6P1/1R2PPBP/Q1B2RK1 w k - 0 18,attacking a piece that is not even involved in the action.  Qa6 would have prevented the threatened carnage
35,exf5,e4f5,1r2kbbr/ppp3p1/2n4p/5PN1/2q5/6P1/1R2PPBP/Q1B2RK1 b k - 0 18,and realising the size of the attack black resigns.
