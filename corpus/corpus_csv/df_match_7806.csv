7,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3p4/1pP5/4P3/PB1P1PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"Playing to activate and mobilize pieces, and saving c4."
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p4/1pP5/4P3/PB1P1PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"Controls e4 and g4, important squares, double protects d5. If (5.Bxf6 exf6) then black can activate a bishop. Prepares 0-0."

10,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p4/1pP3b1/4PN2/PB1P1PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 3 6,A strong pin is applied.
11,h3,h2h3,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p4/1pP3b1/4PN1P/PB1P1PP1/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,Forcing a decision for the bishop.

13,Nd4,f3d4,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p1b2/1pPN4/4P2P/PB1P1PP1/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 2 7,"Forcing more positional choices for the bishop. This may not have been the best move, but maybe not quite dubious as it fights for central control."
14,Bd7,f5d7,rn1qkb1r/pp1bpppp/5n2/3p4/1pPN4/4P2P/PB1P1PP1/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 3 8,"?! Releases central control, Bg6 is better."
15,Bd3,f1d3,rn1qkb1r/pp1bpppp/5n2/3p4/1pPN4/3BP2P/PB1P1PP1/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 4 8,"?! Adding to control of central squares. The bishop is hanging and a little akward here, but it is fighting for central control. My mental ply was set a little low though because black can lock up the bishop with a good set of attacking pawn moves, as will be seen in the game continuation, which had I been more focused I would have noticed and may have played differently."
