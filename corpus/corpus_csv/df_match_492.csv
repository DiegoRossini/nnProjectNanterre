1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"My team captain suggested me to annotate some games,that is a good exercise.She suggested to annotate a lost game,to learn from my mistakes.But since this is my first annotation,I wanted to make a gift to myself,annotating a won game.Anyway I will learn a lot,since in this game made many mistakes,the worse one has been to miss a mate in 6!:(
My opponent is more or less at my level,so the game has been difficult to both,and one of the more long I played here in Gameknot.
I open as my usual."
