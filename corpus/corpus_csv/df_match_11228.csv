1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Standard attack and development
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Standard attack and development
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Standard attack and development
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,I personally don't like to play this defence as I feel it hinders development.  I prefer to defend with 2...Nc6 or counterattack with ...Nf6 then bring out the f-bishop before playing d6 or d5
5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 3,"Again, my standard response to this kind of defence, opens up a number of possibilities"
6,h6,h7h6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/3p3p/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,"far too early to play this move, there is no danger of me playing Bg5 yet anyway.  A waste of a move which would be better used developing a piece"
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/3p3p/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,White is now well developed and completely controls d5
8,a6,a7a6,rnbqkbnr/1pp2pp1/p2p3p/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,I can't think of any reason why black has moved four pawns before moving any pieces.  He should have at least developed a knight by now.  There is no likelihood of me playing Bb5  anytime soon as I have already moved my bishop.
9,O-O,e1g1,rnbqkbnr/1pp2pp1/p2p3p/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 5,"White is well dug in, ready to launch an attack soon"
10,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkbnr/1pp2pp1/p2p3p/4p3/2B1P1b1/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 6,"eventually develops a piece, however he should develop a knight first"
11,Nxe5,f3e5,rn1qkbnr/1pp2pp1/p2p3p/4N3/2B1P1b1/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 6,"looks like a daft move, its actually not a bad start to an attack, the offer of the queen is often hard to resist and so acts as a good decoy"
12,Bxd1,g4d1,rn1qkbnr/1pp2pp1/p2p3p/4N3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1Bb1RK1 w kq - 0 7,"Black falls for the trap, mate in two can now be forced by white. Always be suspicious if someone is giving away a free queen"
13,Bxf7+,c4f7,rn1qkbnr/1pp2Bp1/p2p3p/4N3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1Bb1RK1 b kq - 0 7,only possible move
14,Ke7,e8e7,rn1q1bnr/1pp1kBp1/p2p3p/4N3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1Bb1RK1 w - - 1 8,only possible move
15,Nd5#,c3d5,rn1q1bnr/1pp1kBp1/p2p3p/3NN3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/R1Bb1RK1 b - - 2 8,"Checkmate.  That's one way of sacrificing a queen to win a game, but be careful, if black refuses the offer of the queen then white may be in trouble.  Also this attack will not work if black has a knight on f6"
