1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I played Black in this tournament game.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I believe this is the most logical defense against e4, since White wants to create a strong centre with d4. My move and e5 both control d4 to stop the central expansion, but c5 creates less weaknesses than e5."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Playing Nf3 against Sicilian usually indicates White wants to open the position with d4. Although White doesn't have to play d4, so Nf3 doesn't really indicate a clear plan, it's just a simple developing move."
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"I believe this is best, since it prepares to develop with Nf6."
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,Open Sicilian
6,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"This is a classic Sicilian position where White opens the centre to get faster and easier development, while Black is more cramped, but has a solid position."
7,Nxd4,f3d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"This is a classic Sicilian position where White opens the centre to get faster and easier development, while Black is more cramped, but has a solid position."
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"This is classic Najdorf Sicilian, but I thought maybe I should've played e6 in this position since a6 isn't needed right now."
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,"This is classic Najdorf Sicilian, but I thought maybe I should've played e6 in this position since a6 isn't needed right now."
10,a6,a7a6,rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"This is classic Najdorf Sicilian, but I thought maybe I should've played e6 in this position since a6 isn't needed right now."
11,f4,f2f4,rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"White grabs a huge chunk of the centre, but I am not worried since he is creating a lot of weaknesses."
12,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/8/3NPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"Since I have an extra pawn in the centre, I can establish a small central fortress White cannot penetrate without giving me an advantage. I prefer my position here since I am better structured and have no major weaknesses. White's weakened squares around the king may be a problem for him later."
13,Be2,f1e2,rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/8/3NPP2/2N5/PPP1B1PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,This is a normal move for White in Sicilian positions. There really isn't a better square for the bishop.
14,Qc7,d8c7,rnb1kb1r/1pq2ppp/p2ppn2/8/3NPP2/2N5/PPP1B1PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 8,"Since I usually try for a Qc7 setup, I guess playing a6 early wasn't that bad, since I almost always play a6 anyway to control b5 so my queen cannot be harassed by a knight."
15,Be3,c1e3,rnb1kb1r/1pq2ppp/p2ppn2/8/3NPP2/2N1B3/PPP1B1PP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 3 8,"This move invites the poisoned pawn variation, where I play Qb6 and White sacrifices the pawn to misplace my queen. But there is just too much studying to play into that, when simple moves should give me an advantage due to my inpenetrable central fortress."
16,b5,b7b5,rnb1kb1r/2q2ppp/p2ppn2/1p6/3NPP2/2N1B3/PPP1B1PP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 9,"This I think was a blunder since it overextends my position. I think b6 was better and more solid. I only played b5 because it threatens to win a pawn and gives me an initiative for a few moves, but White has a simple defense."
17,a3,a2a3,rnb1kb1r/2q2ppp/p2ppn2/1p6/3NPP2/P1N1B3/1PP1B1PP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 9,"This is necessary in defending the weak e-pawn, since the defender of a weakness should always be defended from attack."
18,Bb7,c8b7,rn2kb1r/1bq2ppp/p2ppn2/1p6/3NPP2/P1N1B3/1PP1B1PP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 1 10,Hitting the weak e-pawn again
19,Bf3,e2f3,rn2kb1r/1bq2ppp/p2ppn2/1p6/3NPP2/P1N1BB2/1PP3PP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 2 10,"Notice how I haven't played Be7 O-O yet? If I did, then White would storm my kingside starting with g4. My king is much more safe in the centre behind my small fortress where I can try to attack White's weak pawn with moves like Nc5."
20,Nbd7,b8d7,r3kb1r/1bqn1ppp/p2ppn2/1p6/3NPP2/P1N1BB2/1PP3PP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 3 11,"Notice how I haven't played Be7 O-O yet? If I did, then White would storm my kingside starting with g4. My king is much more safe in the centre behind my small fortress where I can try to attack White's weak pawn with moves like Nc5."
21,O-O,e1g1,r3kb1r/1bqn1ppp/p2ppn2/1p6/3NPP2/P1N1BB2/1PP3PP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 4 11,"It's hard to attack White's king in Open Sicilians where White castles kingside, which is why I don't like castling as Black. Whenever White castles kingside in this opening, I attack White's king with my h and g-pawns while my king's central fortress is untouched."
22,Nc5,d7c5,r3kb1r/1bq2ppp/p2ppn2/1pn5/3NPP2/P1N1BB2/1PP3PP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 5 12,"I thought I had successfully taken advantage of White's weakness by piling enough forces on it, but I missed his next move."
23,e5,e4e5,r3kb1r/1bq2ppp/p2ppn2/1pn1P3/3N1P2/P1N1BB2/1PP3PP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 12,"Now, White's not just going to hand me a free pawn, so I knew there had to be something up. After dxe5 fxe5 Qxe5, White has Bf4!! which actually traps my queen because Qxf4 is still losing to Bc6  with discovered attack on my queen."
24,Nfe4,f6e4,r3kb1r/1bq2ppp/p2pp3/1pn1P3/3NnP2/P1N1BB2/1PP3PP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 1 13,"I was considering this and Nfd7, but Nfd7 allows Bxb7 Qxb7 exd6 with many offensively tactical ideas for White."
