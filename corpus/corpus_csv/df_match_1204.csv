Black usually can't afford to get aggressive early on but the answer 1...e5 is in my experience the best try to keep a dynamic flavour to the game."

3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,The usual White setup. The White bishop fianchetto is a strong weapon.

In fact, changing the Knight on c3 only strenghtens White's centre, while defending the Knight on d5 with 5...Be6 or 5. ..c6 allows White to strike in the centre with d2-d4. Now the Black Queen controls the d4 square, and at least Black has a bit more space than White."

White has given the d4 square to the Black pieces, but he wants to prepare the d2-d4 advance and obtain a strong position in the centre. Black must react in the correct way and not allow White to push on d4. To do so, he has to keep control of the d4 square as much as he can."

Black wants to chase the white Knight away from the control of d4, and the horse will be able only to retreat in the ugly square e1, because otherwihe the backward d3 pawn would fall. This g7-g5 isn't of course a new idea. Similar moves exist in the main line of this opening, but with the centre closed (pawns on e4 and e5) it is much stronger. I also had the pattern in mind because i had recently looked at a Carlsen-Nakamura game in a Sicilian Defence with more or less the same structure with 
1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Be2 e5 7. Nb3 Be7 8. Be3
8. g4 etc. and it inspired me."

So I stopped f2-f4 once and for all. 

 The other source of counterplay is the one that my opponent actually adopted, but since it involved material investment, I didn't consider it particularly dangerous..."
