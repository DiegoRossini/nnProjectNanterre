1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Thomas always plays 1. d4 as white...
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,And what will black choose?  The Bogo-Indian (Bb4 )?  The QGD (d5)?
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,And what will black choose?  The Bogo-Indian (Bb4 )?  The QGD (d5)?
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,And what will black choose?  The Bogo-Indian (Bb4 )?  The QGD (d5)?
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,And what will black choose?  The Bogo-Indian (Bb4 )?  The QGD (d5)?
6,b6,b7b6,rnbqkb1r/p1pp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"No, it's the Queen's Indian Defense.  I'm pretty sure Thomas is unfamiliar with this, but he played some solid developing moves over the next few."
7,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/p1pp1ppp/1p2pn2/6B1/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"Sound and aggressive, pinning the knight and trying to force the bishop to develop weakly to e7."
8,Bb7,c8b7,rn1qkb1r/pbpp1ppp/1p2pn2/6B1/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,"I like this better than Ba6, which is also playable."
9,e3,e2e3,rn1qkb1r/pbpp1ppp/1p2pn2/6B1/2PP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"Since this is white's ""bad bishop"" (all his pawns on the same color), Thomas is happy to give it up for the knight."
10,h6,h7h6,rn1qkb1r/pbpp1pp1/1p2pn1p/6B1/2PP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Since this is white's ""bad bishop"" (all his pawns on the same color), Thomas is happy to give it up for the knight."
11,Bxf6,g5f6,rn1qkb1r/pbpp1pp1/1p2pB1p/8/2PP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"Much better than recapturing with the pawn.  White must be careful, as black now has the two bishops and has some pressure against the white kingside."
12,Qxf6,d8f6,rn2kb1r/pbpp1pp1/1p2pq1p/8/2PP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"Much better than recapturing with the pawn.  White must be careful, as black now has the two bishops and has some pressure against the white kingside."
13,Be2,f1e2,rn2kb1r/pbpp1pp1/1p2pq1p/8/2PP4/4PN2/PP2BPPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 1 7,I think this is the best move.
14,d6,d7d6,rn2kb1r/pbp2pp1/1p1ppq1p/8/2PP4/4PN2/PP2BPPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"Preparing to develop the knight to d7, but this makes his hard for black to use his dark-squared bishop.  I would prefer d5 in this position, I think, challenging the center and opening a line for my dark bishop as well."
15,O-O,e1g1,rn2kb1r/pbp2pp1/1p1ppq1p/8/2PP4/4PN2/PP2BPPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 1 8,Solid.
16,Nd7,b8d7,r3kb1r/pbpn1pp1/1p1ppq1p/8/2PP4/4PN2/PP2BPPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 2 9,"I first thought Nc3 would have been stronger (supporting a d5 push -- if black won't take it, why not white?), but I like this square for the knight, as it helps defend the kingside."
17,Nbd2,b1d2,r3kb1r/pbpn1pp1/1p1ppq1p/8/2PP4/4PN2/PP1NBPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 3 9,"I first thought Nc3 would have been stronger (supporting a d5 push -- if black won't take it, why not white?), but I like this square for the knight, as it helps defend the kingside."
18,c5,c7c5,r3kb1r/pb1n1pp1/1p1ppq1p/2p5/2PP4/4PN2/PP1NBPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 10,"Having been stymied on the kingside, black tries to make something happen on the queenside."
19,Qc2,d1c2,r3kb1r/pb1n1pp1/1p1ppq1p/2p5/2PP4/4PN2/PPQNBPPP/R4RK1 b kq - 1 10,"I didn't see the point of this move initially, but at least this puts the queen on an active diagonal and connects the rooks.  In a closed position, tempi aren't as important as on an open board."
20,Be7,f8e7,r3k2r/pb1nbpp1/1p1ppq1p/2p5/2PP4/4PN2/PPQNBPPP/R4RK1 w kq - 2 11,"There really is no better square for this bishop at this point, and black is ready to get his king out of the center.  It looks like the lines are drawn, and the battle will take place on the queenside."
21,Rfd1,f1d1,r3k2r/pb1nbpp1/1p1ppq1p/2p5/2PP4/4PN2/PPQNBPPP/R2R2K1 b kq - 3 11,"!  The d-file will be at least half-opened at white's leisure, and white assesses (correctly) that a second rook will be better placed on c1 than e1."
22,O-O,e8g8,r4rk1/pb1nbpp1/1p1ppq1p/2p5/2PP4/4PN2/PPQNBPPP/R2R2K1 w - - 4 12,Now the point of Qc2 is clear -- it defends the b2 pawn.
23,dxc5,d4c5,r4rk1/pb1nbpp1/1p1ppq1p/2P5/2P5/4PN2/PPQNBPPP/R2R2K1 b - - 0 12,Now the point of Qc2 is clear -- it defends the b2 pawn.
24,Nxc5,d7c5,r4rk1/pb2bpp1/1p1ppq1p/2n5/2P5/4PN2/PPQNBPPP/R2R2K1 w - - 0 13,10. Qc2 also prevents the knight from infiltrating at e4 on this move.  I have to wonder if white saw all this when playing his 10th?
25,b4,b2b4,r4rk1/pb2bpp1/1p1ppq1p/2n5/1PP5/4PN2/P1QNBPPP/R2R2K1 b - - 0 13,10. Qc2 also prevents the knight from infiltrating at e4 on this move.  I have to wonder if white saw all this when playing his 10th?
26,Na6,c5a6,r4rk1/pb2bpp1/np1ppq1p/8/1PP5/4PN2/P1QNBPPP/R2R2K1 w - - 1 14,"?!  I'm not sure about this, as, while it forces white to defend b4, it takes the knight away from the action.  I think black may be better served by retreating to d7, where he can fight for the center with Ne5."
27,a3,a2a3,r4rk1/pb2bpp1/np1ppq1p/8/1PP5/P3PN2/2QNBPPP/R2R2K1 b - - 0 14,Black loads up on the half-open c-file...
28,Rfc8,f8c8,r1r3k1/pb2bpp1/np1ppq1p/8/1PP5/P3PN2/2QNBPPP/R2R2K1 w - - 1 15,Black loads up on the half-open c-file...
29,Rac1,a1c1,r1r3k1/pb2bpp1/np1ppq1p/8/1PP5/P3PN2/2QNBPPP/2RR2K1 b - - 2 15,"As does white.  But notice how white's second rook is much better placed than black's.  Still, white has to be careful about the possibility of a d5 break..."
