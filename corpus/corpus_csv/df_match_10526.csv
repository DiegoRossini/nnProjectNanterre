1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I'm playing black in this game, and, of course i play sicilian"
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,c5! is the most popular reply to e4. i just play it because it looks cool but technically speaking...this move takes initiative in fighting for center.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Nf3, Nc3, Bf4 are all playable. All of them contribute to fight for the center"
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,Sicilian!! this move stops the advancing of the White's e pawn and looks cool
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,these all are book moves so far. cxd4 Nxd4 give white a better control of the center.
6,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"I stick with the book and play cxd4 and temporarily give White that ""edge"" over me."
7,Nxd4,f3d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,of course
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,Nc6 challenges the White knight's position and also helps me develop looking cool at the same time :P
9,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,hmm this move isn't necessary at this stage..maybe Bb5 to pin my knight??
10,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 3 6,White still has a better center but i have a solid cool looking defense.
11,f3,f2f3,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/8/3NP3/2N2P2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,premature? Bc4 or Bb5 were still playable
12,e6,e7e6,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2nppn2/8/3NP3/2N2P2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"The ultimate cool move!!!!!! This is my version of Sicilian Scheveningen variation. see even the name sounds cool...i recommend it to all the players who want to make their fortress and pieces look ""cool"". This is my favorite Sicilian variation by far!!"
13,Be3,c1e3,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2nppn2/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 7,White makes a good development getting ready to exploit my king side.
14,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2nppn2/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 8,"This is the Scheveningen. Welcome to sicilianunleash's world and eat Scheveningen all day. Ok enough of retardedness, techinically speaking this move adds to my defense and also allows me to castle without fianchettoeing the bishop that takes time"
15,g4,g2g4,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2nppn2/8/3NP1P1/2N1BP2/PPP4P/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,a king side pawnstorm...not good not good should i castle or should i come up with some other plan?
16,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2nppn2/8/3NP1P1/2N1BP2/PPP4P/R2QKB1R w KQ - 1 9,Heck...i don't wanna kill my brain trying to think of plans. Chess is not about thinking or planning it's all about making your pieces look cool no?
17,Qd2,d1d2,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2nppn2/8/3NP1P1/2N1BP2/PPPQ3P/R3KB1R b KQ - 2 9,ok here it comes. white is ready to launch a fierce attack on me and make sure he's king is safe at same time! and i was worrying if my pieces look cool or not...man..i suck

19,O-O-O,e1c1,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/3p4/3NP1P1/2N1BP2/PPPQ3P/2KR1B1R b - - 1 10,Now white's setup is complete..and it looks cooler than mine
20,Bb4,e7b4,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/3p4/1b1NP1P1/2N1BP2/PPPQ3P/2KR1B1R w - - 2 11,i try to break through the coolness...technically speaking...i was trying to win a pawn by 1)Bxc3 Qxc3 2)dxe4 fxe4 3) Nxe4..giving my knight a good post
