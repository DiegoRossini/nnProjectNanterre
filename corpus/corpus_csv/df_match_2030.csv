1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Going for the Caro-Kann defence (B10).
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Going for the Caro-Kann defence (B10).
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Now white has several options.. The most popular (according to GK Game DB) is 3. Nc3, which is leading to the Classical Variation. Second popular is 3. e5, the Advance Variation. Third is 3. exd5, the Exchange Variation."
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Now white has several options.. The most popular (according to GK Game DB) is 3. Nc3, which is leading to the Classical Variation. Second popular is 3. e5, the Advance Variation. Third is 3. exd5, the Exchange Variation."
5,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"Caro-Kann (B12), advance variation. White is choosing for a lead in space.."
6,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pPb2/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"Caro-Kann (B12), advance, Short variation. Since white hasn't made an open c-file in black's ranks, it's safe to play 3. ... Bf5."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pPb2/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,"Good developing.. White is wanting to play Nh4 sometime, to exchange his knight for my lsb."
8,e6,e7e6,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3pPb2/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"""Closing"" the pawn-formation. This is a very good set-up for the pawns; hard to break through for white !"
9,Be2,f1e2,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3pPb2/3P4/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,"In my opinion one of the best moves to do for white. Some players like to exchange bishops by 5. Bd3 Bxd3 6. Qxd3, but you have to keep in mind that most of black's pawns are on white squares.. So why trade the light-squared-bishop ?? He can be useful in the endgame !"
10,Nd7,b8d7,r2qkbnr/pp1n1ppp/2p1p3/3pPb2/3P4/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 6,"Giving some support to c5, when it's time to advance that pawn.. Also, an idea for white is to play c4 sometime. So we have to be cautious on the queenside !"
11,O-O,e1g1,r2qkbnr/pp1n1ppp/2p1p3/3pPb2/3P4/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 3 6,"Safety first ! After doing this, white is almost ready to attack.."
12,Ne7,g8e7,r2qkb1r/pp1nnppp/2p1p3/3pPb2/3P4/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 4 7,"Also 6. ... h6 was an option. But I left the options open: 7. Nh4 Bg6 8. Nxg6 Nxg6 and no problems at all. And if needed, my knight could still do a manoeuvre like Nc8 - Ncb6."
13,Nbd2,b1d2,r2qkb1r/pp1nnppp/2p1p3/3pPb2/3P4/5N2/PPPNBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 5 7,"Ok, I'm thinking he's heading for a c4-attack within a few moves.."
14,h6,h7h6,r2qkb1r/pp1nnpp1/2p1p2p/3pPb2/3P4/5N2/PPPNBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,"White certainly masters the majority of space on the board, so I need to develop some more pieces. The idea behind 7. ... h6 is to play Bh7, followed by Ng6, so my dsb can take care of the f8-a3-diagonal."
15,Nb3,d2b3,r2qkb1r/pp1nnpp1/2p1p2p/3pPb2/3P4/1N3N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 8,As said before..

21,Bxc4,e2c4,r2qkb1r/pp1n1ppb/2p1p1np/4P3/2BP4/1N3N2/PP1B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 11,"Challenging the lsb, and giving some breathing space for my cramped king's position.."
