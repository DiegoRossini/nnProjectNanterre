1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Already unusual.  A Modern defence to the King Pawn Opening has been transformed into an English Opening: The Great Snake Variation.
2,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Already unusual.  A Modern defence to the King Pawn Opening has been transformed into an English Opening: The Great Snake Variation.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/2P1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Already unusual.  A Modern defence to the King Pawn Opening has been transformed into an English Opening: The Great Snake Variation.
4,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/6p1/4p3/2P1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Adorjan's Defence.  Permitted to do so, Black grabs e5, with a grip on the d4-square."
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/6p1/4p3/2P1P3/5N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,Simple development can't be bad.  Yet there is something to be said for striking at once in the centre by 3.d4! exd4 4.Qxd4.
6,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk1nr/pppp1pbp/6p1/4p3/2P1P3/5N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,"Why not 3...Nc6?  The reason one usually develops knights first is that one usually knows more about where the knight wants to go early in the game than the best place for the bishop.  Here, the reverse is true.  The bishop is clearly destined for g7, and Black will want to castle soon.  Meanwhile we aren't yet sure whether the b8-N will want to go to c6 or d7."
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk1nr/pppp1pbp/6p1/4p3/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 4,Inhibits the advance of White's d-pawn to d4.
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk1nr/pppp1pbp/2n3p1/4p3/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 4 5,Inhibits the advance of White's d-pawn to d4.
9,Be2,f1e2,r1bqk1nr/pppp1pbp/2n3p1/4p3/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP1PBPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 5 5,White obviously likes to develop quickly.  An alternative was 5.g3 with the idea of Bg2 and setting up a Botvinnik-like position.
10,d6,d7d6,r1bqk1nr/ppp2pbp/2np2p1/4p3/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP1PBPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"6...Nf6 is probably OK, but the move played keeps the f-pawn free to advance, and renders harmless any possible pin by Bc1-g5."
11,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk1nr/ppp2pbp/2np2p1/4p3/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP1PBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 6,"6...Nf6 is probably OK, but the move played keeps the f-pawn free to advance, and renders harmless any possible pin by Bc1-g5."
12,Nge7,g8e7,r1bqk2r/ppp1npbp/2np2p1/4p3/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP1PBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 7,"6...Nf6 is probably OK, but the move played keeps the f-pawn free to advance, and renders harmless any possible pin by Bc1-g5."
13,d3,d2d3,r1bqk2r/ppp1npbp/2np2p1/4p3/2P1P3/2NP1N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,(!?) Possibly anticipating an opening of the e-file?
14,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/ppp1npbp/2np2p1/4p3/2P1P3/2NP1N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 8,(!?) Possibly anticipating an opening of the e-file?

19,Bd2,c1d2,r1bq1rk1/ppp1n1bp/2np2p1/3Np3/2P1Pp2/3P1N2/PP1BBPPP/R2QR1K1 b - - 1 10,To prepare ...g5 and a pawn storm on the K-side.
20,h6,h7h6,r1bq1rk1/ppp1n1b1/2np2pp/3Np3/2P1Pp2/3P1N2/PP1BBPPP/R2QR1K1 w - - 0 11,To prepare ...g5 and a pawn storm on the K-side.
21,Rc1,a1c1,r1bq1rk1/ppp1n1b1/2np2pp/3Np3/2P1Pp2/3P1N2/PP1BBPPP/2RQR1K1 b - - 1 11,"White calmly builds up in the centre, confident that the best counter to a flank action is a central counteraction.  White is preparing the pawn-break c4-c5."
22,g5,g6g5,r1bq1rk1/ppp1n1b1/2np3p/3Np1p1/2P1Pp2/3P1N2/PP1BBPPP/2RQR1K1 w - - 0 12,"Forestalling ...g5-g4.  Black must spend more time building up his attack, time that White puts to good use."
23,h3,h2h3,r1bq1rk1/ppp1n1b1/2np3p/3Np1p1/2P1Pp2/3P1N1P/PP1BBPP1/2RQR1K1 b - - 0 12,"Forestalling ...g5-g4.  Black must spend more time building up his attack, time that White puts to good use."

25,Qb3,d1b3,r1bq1rk1/ppp3b1/2np2np/3Np1p1/2P1Pp2/1Q1P1N1P/PP1BBPP1/2R1R1K1 b - - 2 13,"(!) Indirectly attacking the BK down the a2-g8 diagonal, as well as placing pressure on b7.  The major difference between this game and a King's Indian Defence, say, is that the latter usually features a closed centre.  Here the centre remains semi-open, which helps White's active defence."
26,Rb8,a8b8,1rbq1rk1/ppp3b1/2np2np/3Np1p1/2P1Pp2/1Q1P1N1P/PP1BBPP1/2R1R1K1 w - - 3 14,"Relieving the c8-B's guard duties at b7, and hence renewing the threat to advance on the K-side."
27,c5,c4c5,1rbq1rk1/ppp3b1/2np2np/2PNp1p1/4Pp2/1Q1P1N1P/PP1BBPP1/2R1R1K1 b - - 0 14,(!)

Both sides are being circumspect at this stage, combining attack and defence.  The game is very finely balanced hereabouts."
29,Qa3,b3a3,1r1q1rk1/ppp3b1/2npb1np/2PNp1p1/4Pp2/Q2P1N1P/PP1BBPP1/2R1R1K1 b - - 2 15,Increasing the pressure on d6.  The WQ also eyes a7.
30,dxc5,d6c5,1r1q1rk1/ppp3b1/2n1b1np/2pNp1p1/4Pp2/Q2P1N1P/PP1BBPP1/2R1R1K1 w - - 0 16,"By capturing, Black hopes to create counterpressure down the d-file.  The situation is very murky it this point."
