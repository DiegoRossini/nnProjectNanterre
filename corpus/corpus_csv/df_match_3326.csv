1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

I am getting to the end of Master Chrisobee's Amor Vincit Omnia (Love conquers all) mini-tournament and I was paired with an Expert called Ningshih.  It was a very closed game and Ningshi had a big task breaking through it.  She did manage to breach the walls slightly by launching a combo which won a pawn.  This directly resulted in a single rook and pawn ending.  However, Henry and my rook managed to hold the fort and Ningshih could not make any further headway whatsoever and accepted my draw offer on move 54.  After my difficult game and loss against Coach Ion, I was really thrilled to have this boost and give my fellow Walk The Walkers hope for the future.  So, how did this happen?  Here is the gameknot analysis: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17636006&rnd=0.8220917387966657"
