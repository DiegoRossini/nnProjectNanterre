1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Here is my 4th OTB game and my first win. There are mistakes from both sides, but is worthy of a second look. Please feel free to give feedback."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,I like to use Alekhine's defence for e4 openings and tend towards KID or Gruenfeld for d4.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Claiming the uncontested centre.
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Entering the Gruenfeld
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,Entering the Gruenfeld
6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Entering the Gruenfeld
7,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3P4/3P4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,White chooses the exchange variation. Nf3 is also quite popular.
8,Nxd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/6p1/3n4/3P4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"White now has an impressive looking centre, which black will attempt to undermine."
9,e4,e2e4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/6p1/3n4/3PP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"White now has an impressive looking centre, which black will attempt to undermine."

12,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/2P5/P4PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 7,Looking through the centre at the dark squares and preparing to castle. ...c5 is another way to attack the centre.
13,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/6p1/8/2BPP3/2P5/P4PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 2 7,"I'm still quite green with this opening, so from about this point on I was playing moves that felt natural. The GK database doesn't disagree with me yet."
14,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/6p1/8/2BPP3/2P5/P4PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQ - 3 8,"I'm still quite green with this opening, so from about this point on I was playing moves that felt natural. The GK database doesn't disagree with me yet."
15,Ne2,g1e2,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/6p1/8/2BPP3/2P5/P3NPPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 4 8,Reinforcing the White pawn centre and preparing for castling.
16,c6,c7c6,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/8/2BPP3/2P5/P3NPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 9,"...c5 was probably better (certainly more popular) but this seems playable. My idea behind this move was to shift the white bishop off its nice diagonal with ...b5 (if Bb3, then ...a5,a6) and gain some space on the queen-side. It provides some more options for the queen too."
17,O-O,e1g1,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/8/2BPP3/2P5/P3NPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 9,I'm not sure why White played this move. It doesn't seem like the most useful diagonal.
18,Re8,f8e8,rnbqr1k1/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/8/2BPP3/2P5/P3NPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 2 10,I'm not sure why White played this move. It doesn't seem like the most useful diagonal.
19,Ba3,c1a3,rnbqr1k1/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/8/2BPP3/B1P5/P3NPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 3 10,I'm not sure why White played this move. It doesn't seem like the most useful diagonal.
20,e5,e7e5,rnbqr1k1/pp3pbp/2p3p1/4p3/2BPP3/B1P5/P3NPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 11,"Probably not the best move. I played this with the idea that if White were to exchange pawns there would be 2 isolated pawns to try to defend. if White advances then I gain some free space on the queen-side with ...b5, and load the a8-h1 diagonal with a bishop (this is an option that was already there, but I hadn't considered...)"
