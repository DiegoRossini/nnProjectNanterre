1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"Simple development so far, though I do find White's approach slightly unorthadox. He has gone for a hypermodern approach with the double fianchetto, yet Black has played a passive sort of opening himself! Here, however, he invokes tension with this pawn advance which also weakens the light-square bishop on g2."

34,Ne3,g4e3,rn3rk1/pp2pp2/6pb/1PRp1q1p/8/P2PnNPb/1B1NPP1P/3QR1KB w - - 3 18,"! Now it becomes clear just how much control Black has over White's position! Not content with a retreating or weakening move (Nf6, e6) Black attacks White's queen with his knight knowing that fxe3 leads to Bxf3# This move also inhibits the advancement of e2."

37,Rc7,c5c7,r4rk1/ppRnpp2/6pb/1P1p1q1p/8/PQ1PnNPb/1B1NPP1P/4R1KB b - - 6 19,Rook to the 7th rank and now Black's b7 pawn is threatened - but Black still asks questions of White...

39,Qc3,b3c3,r4rk1/ppRn1p2/6pb/1P1ppq1p/8/P1QPnNPb/1B1NPP1P/4R1KB b - - 1 20,The only counterplay that White may have lies on the long diagonal and suddenly he has a real threat on his hands! Depending on what Black's next move is he can try an exchange sac - Rxd7 - followed by Nxe5 and the influence that White would have on the a1-h8 diagonal would more than make up for the lost point in material!
