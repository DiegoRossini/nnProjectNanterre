I guess most of my advice ended up being for white.  Not my original intention.  But if you do this, what is your opponent's best response?  It is wise to look at least one move ahead.

Bc5 shows some promise.  Black retains the knight, but white could follow with Qd4.  White is down two pawns so trading is best avoided.  Maybe instead of Qd4, Pa4.  Trading pawns lets white attack black's c6 with rook and bishop.  Black saves the knight, but the game lasts longer."
