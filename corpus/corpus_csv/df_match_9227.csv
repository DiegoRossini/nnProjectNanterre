1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!  This game was even right up to the early middlegame when a tactical shot won me a pawn.  Somehow I managed to increase my lead in material until, a king move on black's part finally managed to wrap things up.  You would think that with the queens off the board you are safe from Old Matey - well, just remember, a rook is also mating material and it is quite possible to crawl into what is known as a mating net.  This game provides an example of this."
