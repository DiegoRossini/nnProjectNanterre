7,Nxd4,f3d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"An interesting fact about this move is that in GK's database, after this move white wins most games continued from this opening.  Must say something about it."
8,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk1nr/ppp1bppp/3p4/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,Black is the first to break main line in this opening. On move 4! Maybe he should have learned his opening better if he wished to not get in trouble.
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk1nr/ppp1bppp/3p4/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,"Another strange move out of an unusual defense.  What is the point of c6? White appears to have an advantage here with more development and space.  He has also created a backwards pawn on d6 unless he plans to push with d5, but this wastes time."

14,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qk2r/pp2bppp/2pp1n2/8/3NP1b1/1BN5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 4 8,This is a pointless move as f3 is already part of white's development in Philidor's Defense and this gives white tempo.
15,f3,f2f3,rn1qk2r/pp2bppp/2pp1n2/8/3NP1b1/1BN2P2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,"I thought that black's plan was to hit my bishop on b3 with his knight so I provided an escape square, but a better plan for black is 10...Nc7 with ...d5 to remove his weakness."
