Maybe d5 is better enabling black to fight for the center and giving white's LSB less room to maneuver. I completely missed white's responding tactic.

21,Rd1,f1d1,rn1q1rk1/p2pbp1p/bp2pnp1/6B1/7Q/2PBPN2/PP3PPP/RN1R2K1 b - - 3 11,I didn't trade because I saw a combination for white that I can't currently find. I thought that the rook would be active and would cause me trouble but I think I should've and saved d6 or d5 for later. d6 prevents Ne5 and allows black to add another defender to the knight on f6. Also possible is a future Nc5 attacking the bishop but that never happens.

My pieces are all either stuck doing nothing or defending. Any suggestions? I'm not sure if Nbd7 was a blunder in the end because it freed up my king-side and allowed my pieces to be freer but it made me down 2 points in material. Was it? What should I have done instead?

Qxc4 Nxe3 22. Qxb5 also seems okay for white or 21... Qxc4 22. bc Bxe4 which also seems okay for white.
