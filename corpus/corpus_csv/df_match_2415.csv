On a good streak at the moment thats all. And forget that notion about second best. You're rated 250 points below me and kept pace with me, just that final bit that let you down."

It supports your hanging pawn on e4 and threatens the c5 pawn(check). A couple of things to always try and rem. Firstly in endgame a pawn advantage is massive, try not to let your opponent pick up free pawns, secondly you want to be dictating the tempo of the game. Force your opponent to respond to your moves rather than vica versa."
