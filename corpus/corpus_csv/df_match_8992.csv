1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"If you want the details, this game was a ""rated game"" played against Fritz's lowest rated game level - which is still quite formidable. I have heard that a good way of beating Fritz is to play a completely positional, tactic-free game."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I have had bad experiences playing my favourite French Defence against Fritz, and Alekhine's Defence gives me a hard time against anyone, let alone Fritz! These are the only two responses to 1.e4 I have had any significant experience with (and for the record I gave up Alekhine's Defence in June) so I played 1...e5, of which you do not really need so much experience to play competently."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,The Ruy Lopez or Spanish Opening. This is by far the most common 1.e4 e5 opening at grandmaster levels. Obviously White is putting pressure on Black's e-pawn.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,The Ruy Lopez or Spanish Opening. This is by far the most common 1.e4 e5 opening at grandmaster levels. Obviously White is putting pressure on Black's e-pawn.
5,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,The Ruy Lopez or Spanish Opening. This is by far the most common 1.e4 e5 opening at grandmaster levels. Obviously White is putting pressure on Black's e-pawn.
6,d6,d7d6,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,"The oldest response, the Steinitz Defence. I play the Cozio Defence (3...Nge7) more often, but this temporarily compromises Black's dark-squared bishop, giving White a dynamic advantage. I tend to prefer more sedate positions while playing Fritz. The problem with the Steinitz Defence is that it pins Black's developed knight."
7,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/1B2p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,Taking advantage of the pinned knight to bring the queen out.
8,exd4,e5d4,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/1B6/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,Taking advantage of the pinned knight to bring the queen out.

11,Bxc6,b5c6,r2qkbnr/pppb1ppp/2Bp4/8/3QP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 6,"Disconcertingly, Fritz was playing these moves without a second's hesitation, not a single beep of discomfort. My opponent in Game 1, those of you who looked at it will remember, was a rather battered handheld chess device, Star Chess by name - I could easily see when it was uncomfortable with a position by the fact that a little red light started blinking on its side. But what went on in Fritz's silicon chips was unknown to me."
12,Bxc6,d7c6,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2bp4/8/3QP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 7,"Immediately the pin is broken. I have had bad experiences in tournaments when a minor-looking pin festers and eventually causes the collapse of my position, so I usually instinctively break pins as soon as possible."
