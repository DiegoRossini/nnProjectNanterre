1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

I feel I need to give myself a bit of a lift after losing a game to an Expert that I should have won, albeit I lost because I adopted the wrong plan in the endgame.  Many thanks to Coach Ion btw for annotating that game.  At least I can take some heart that I learned a lesson from GM Cyrano (annotated game here http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/cyrano?gm=38055) about the value of connected passed central pawns.  In this game I did manage to get one of those pawns one square away from Glendadom before my opponent waved the white flag on the grounds of ruinous loss of material.
