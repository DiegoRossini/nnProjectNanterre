1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This is an interesting game of attrition where there were ebs and flows with the momentum shifting one way then the other before the game came to its natural conclusion. For much of the end-game it looked like a draw when Black made a critical mistake that decided the game.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,the opening was fairly typical with each of us jockying for control of the board as the opening developed
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,I offered the Queens pawn in an exchange
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,but the offer was declined forcing me to defend the Kings pawn
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 3,This presented black with a  chance to pin the Knight against the King
6,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/1b1PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 3 4,which he did!
7,a3,a2a3,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/1b1PP3/P1N5/1PP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"so I hit back, but"
8,Bxc3+,b4c3,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/3PP3/P1b5/1PP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,black forced the exchange which is fine with me since I like my Bishops for later in the game and don't mind surrendering a Knight for a Bishop exchange
9,bxc3,b2c3,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/3PP3/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,The problem this presents for me is the double pawn in the C rank
10,exd4,e5d4,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/8/3pP3/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,But black gave me an immediate opportunity to solve that problem
11,Qxd4,d1d4,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/8/3QP3/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 0 6,But I decline the offer choosing instead to bring my Queen into the game.
12,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/5n2/8/3QP3/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQ - 1 7,"causing black to resort to Castling, a good defensive manouver under the circumstances"
13,e5,e4e5,rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/5n2/4P3/3Q4/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQ - 0 7,but it allows me to advance my Pawn into black territory and threaten the Knight
14,Re8,f8e8,rnbqr1k1/pppp1ppp/5n2/4P3/3Q4/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQ - 1 8,"Moving the Castle to the open rank is a good move, and I am prevented from capturing his Knight by the check that would result."
15,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqr1k1/pppp1ppp/5n2/4P3/3Q4/P1P2N2/2P2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQ - 2 8,So I continue my development toward Castling
16,d6,d7d6,rnbqr1k1/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4P3/3Q4/P1P2N2/2P2PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ - 0 9,this presents a situation where a Queen exchange might be in the offing
17,Bf4,c1f4,rnbqr1k1/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4P3/3Q1B2/P1P2N2/2P2PPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 1 9,But I am also able to advance my development by bringing my black Bishop into the game
18,dxe5,d6e5,rnbqr1k1/ppp2ppp/5n2/4p3/3Q1B2/P1P2N2/2P2PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 0 10,allowing this Pawn attack.
19,Nxe5,f3e5,rnbqr1k1/ppp2ppp/5n2/4N3/3Q1B2/P1P5/2P2PPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 0 10,But a pawn will never overcome a well positioned Queen protected by her Knight! And still the Queen exchange looms
20,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqr1k1/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/4N3/3Q1B2/P1P5/2P2PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 1 11,"The game is starting to open up now and this Knight attack returns balance to the board, even though I think I still have the advantage by being on the front foot and challenging more of the black side of the board."
