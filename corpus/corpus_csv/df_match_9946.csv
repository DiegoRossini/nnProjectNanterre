1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,1. e4 is the most popular first move in chess.  It siezes space in the center and opens lines for the queen and bishop.  Space and Development are two of the primary elements of chess.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The Sicilian defense.  1. ...c5 seeks to prevent White from establishing a center pawn duo (on d4 and e4), while avoiding the symmetry established after 1. ...e5."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Developing and centralizing.  The knight benefits more than any other piece from centralization.
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,The hyper accelerated dragon.  Black intends to fight for control over the dark center squares.  The bishop on f1 will take up its perch on g7 and fight from a distance.
5,c3,c2c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/2p5/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,A straitforward way to counter act Black's plan.
6,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk1nr/pp1pppbp/6p1/2p5/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,Continuing to develop.
7,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqk1nr/pp1pppbp/6p1/2p5/2B1P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 4,4. d4 cxd4 5. cxd4 d5 is another way to continue.
8,e6,e7e6,rnbqk1nr/pp1p1pbp/4p1p1/2p5/2B1P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"Now, black wants to play d5 and force the bishop to move again.  Notice that while 3. c3 helps to fight for the d4 square, it hampers white's ability to control d5, by denying the night on b1 access to c3."
9,O-O,e1g1,rnbqk1nr/pp1p1pbp/4p1p1/2p5/2B1P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 5,Quickly completing the king side development.  White is now ready for action in the center.
10,Ne7,g8e7,rnbqk2r/pp1pnpbp/4p1p1/2p5/2B1P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 6,"Reinforcing the thruust d7-d5, and preparing to castle."
11,d3,d2d3,rnbqk2r/pp1pnpbp/4p1p1/2p5/2B1P3/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 6,6. d4 is still the principled continuation.
12,d5,d7d5,rnbqk2r/pp2npbp/4p1p1/2pp4/2B1P3/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,Black is ready with a center advance that also hits the bishop on c4.
13,exd5,e4d5,rnbqk2r/pp2npbp/4p1p1/2pP4/2B5/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,This will leave black with an advantage in space.  7. Bb5  is another alternative.
14,exd5,e6d5,rnbqk2r/pp2npbp/6p1/2pp4/2B5/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,Recapturing and forcing the bishop's hand.
15,Bb3,c4b3,rnbqk2r/pp2npbp/6p1/2pp4/8/1BPP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 8,"8. Bb5  Nbc6 does not stop black's development, but after 8. Bb3 black catches up in development and retains a spatial advantage.  This is too much to allow after so few moves.  If white had played 6. d4 instead of 6. d3, the game would be level."
16,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp2npbp/6p1/2pp4/8/1BPP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 2 9,"Both sides have completed their kingside development, but the pawns on c5 and d5 compared to the ones on c3 and d3 confer a spatial advantage to black."
17,Re1,f1e1,rnbq1rk1/pp2npbp/6p1/2pp4/8/1BPP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQR1K1 b - - 3 9,Moving the rook to the only open file.
18,Nbc6,b8c6,r1bq1rk1/pp2npbp/2n3p1/2pp4/8/1BPP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQR1K1 w - - 4 10,Black seeks to complete his development.
19,Bg5,c1g5,r1bq1rk1/pp2npbp/2n3p1/2pp2B1/8/1BPP1N2/PP3PPP/RN1QR1K1 b - - 5 10,"If the pin could be maintained it would be very annoying, but it is not hard for black to neutalize it."
20,h6,h7h6,r1bq1rk1/pp2npb1/2n3pp/2pp2B1/8/1BPP1N2/PP3PPP/RN1QR1K1 w - - 0 11,Putting the question to the bishop.  Retreat or exchange?
