1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"A rollicking good game, particularly for the psychological see-saw the game took me and my opponent (Matsumoto) into. We were both under great time pressure at the end of the game. The moves we made are sometimes not the best and we both missed our chances, but Hell ! what a rollicking good game that was !"
2,a6,a7a6,rnbqkbnr/1ppppppp/p7/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The St. George defense.
When an opponent plays something unusual , I ussually try to transpose the game into the openings i know. So, This move made me think .I thought for about 15 seconds and decided to avoid any plans that would involve a pin of black's Knight at c6 , also I couldn't use c4 for my bishop due to the threat of b5.
Moreover I ussually prefer to castle on the queenside with white, Now I should avoid that."

4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/1ppppp1p/p5p1/8/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Now black's plan is getting clearer. He wants to play on the dark central squares and He would castle on the Kingside.

10,Nd7,b8d7,r1bqk1nr/1ppnppbp/p2p2p1/8/3PPP2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 3 6,"Black's options here are
e6
f5
b5 (Book move - Robatsch defence)

However he deviated from the book with this Knight move. I don't think it is a bad move though as it 
a.Hits the central dark square e5
b.Keeps the option of c5 if needed"
11,Be3,c1e3,r1bqk1nr/1ppnppbp/p2p2p1/8/3PPP2/2N1BN2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 4 6,I prevent c5 and I plan to exchange this bishop with the fianchettoed one by Qd2 and Bh6

This move also allows me to start a pawnstorm to attack the black King after he castles. 

Chess engines rate any move available to my white Bishop at f1 better than this, but this was a blitz game and I loved the idea of a kingside pawn storm."

But now I reflexively decided to do it  and have a go at the black king with a pawnstorm. I thought my pawns would bite faster than his.

I think black should have played either simply cxd4 (which would give his knight the option of coming to c4) or simply b5"

Question for the reader : What do you think is the best move here ? (do not read further till you've answered)
Answer : I should have occupied more space by 11.Nd5 ! driving the queen back. (work out the variations if you want to be convinced)

But this is not what I did.
I played _____________"

Before I played this move Fritz gives me an advantage of 2.03, but after this move it gives me -0.09.
So now I(white) is losing !

because 11...cxd4 12.Bxd4 dxe5 13.Nd5 Qd6 14.Be3 gxf5 15.Bc4 Nc5. 

Better was Nd5, leading to 11...Qd8 12.dxc5 dxc5 13.Bxc5 Nxc5 14.Nf6+ Nxf6 15.Qxd8 Rxd8 16.Rxd8+ Bf8 17.exf6 exf6 18.Bc4. This line would have kept the 2.03 I had."

Now I reach new depths with a score of -0.94 from Fritz. Gosh I lost 3 points from +2.03 to -0.94 in just two moves.
