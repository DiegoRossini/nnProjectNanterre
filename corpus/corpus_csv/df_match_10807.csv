1,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is a game I played recently OTB. The opponent is a young 2nd category player on the rise. 

I decided to put the game on Gameknot because it has some interesting moments and can be somewhat educational. I will focus on my thinking during the game and not necessarily on computer analysis for ""absolutely best moves"". 

First move is actually transpositional, as I play e6 very often as Black. I wanted to see how he will react, hopefully with 1...e5 so I can play the reversed Sicilian with extra move."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Pretty good reply, straightforward occupation of centre."
3,b3,b2b3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/1P2P3/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"With this move I am showing my intent to play 1.b3 system, where e3 is a natural part of White's development."
4,b6,b7b6,rnbqkbnr/p1p1pppp/1p6/3p4/8/1P2P3/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Black decides to counter in the same manner. This is on the surface not entirely natural due to closed diagonal (d5 is played), but it is hard to stop d5 from moving forward later with tactical possibilities. The only good way is with d4 by White, which means that both Bishops will be closed behind their pawns."
5,Bb2,c1b2,rnbqkbnr/p1p1pppp/1p6/3p4/8/1P2P3/PBPP1PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,Classic strategy. White takes control of the black diagonal.
6,Bb7,c8b7,rn1qkbnr/pbp1pppp/1p6/3p4/8/1P2P3/PBPP1PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,Classic strategy. White takes control of the black diagonal.
7,f4,f2f4,rn1qkbnr/pbp1pppp/1p6/3p4/5P2/1P2P3/PBPP2PP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,Classic strategy. White takes control of the black diagonal.
8,c5,c7c5,rn1qkbnr/pb2pppp/1p6/2pp4/5P2/1P2P3/PBPP2PP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,Black improves control of center and is not afraid of Bb5  due to sufficient defensive forces. Game is equal.
9,Nf3,g1f3,rn1qkbnr/pb2pppp/1p6/2pp4/5P2/1P2PN2/PBPP2PP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,This is necessary sooner or later. White will NOT take on d7 unless forced to do so. Beginners sometimes make that capture unprovoked but it is a loss of tempi - it is better to wait until Black has spent a move forcing the exchange.
10,Nf6,g8f6,rn1qkb1r/pb2pppp/1p3n2/2pp4/5P2/1P2PN2/PBPP2PP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,This is necessary sooner or later. White will NOT take on d7 unless forced to do so. Beginners sometimes make that capture unprovoked but it is a loss of tempi - it is better to wait until Black has spent a move forcing the exchange.
11,Bb5+,f1b5,rn1qkb1r/pb2pppp/1p3n2/1Bpp4/5P2/1P2PN2/PBPP2PP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 3 6,This is necessary sooner or later. White will NOT take on d7 unless forced to do so. Beginners sometimes make that capture unprovoked but it is a loss of tempi - it is better to wait until Black has spent a move forcing the exchange.
12,Nbd7,b8d7,r2qkb1r/pb1npppp/1p3n2/1Bpp4/5P2/1P2PN2/PBPP2PP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 4 7,This is necessary sooner or later. White will NOT take on d7 unless forced to do so.

15,Bxd7+,b5d7,r2qkb1r/1b1Bpppp/pp3n2/2ppN3/5P2/1P2P3/PBPP2PP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 0 8,"8.Bc6 is also possible, but I decided to play normally and just take the Knight."
16,Nxd7,f6d7,r2qkb1r/1b1npppp/pp6/2ppN3/5P2/1P2P3/PBPP2PP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 9,"I decided that there is no need to waste a tempi on Nd7. At this point I was just playing quickly and without much care, which almost backfired!"
17,O-O,e1g1,r2qkb1r/1b1npppp/pp6/2ppN3/5P2/1P2P3/PBPP2PP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 1 9,"I decided that there is no need to waste a tempi on Nd7. At this point I was just playing quickly and without much care, which almost backfired!"
18,Nxe5,d7e5,r2qkb1r/1b2pppp/pp6/2ppn3/5P2/1P2P3/PBPP2PP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 0 10,"Black wants to simplify the position and is preparing a nice trap, which unfortunately does not entirely work."
19,Bxe5,b2e5,r2qkb1r/1b2pppp/pp6/2ppB3/5P2/1P2P3/P1PP2PP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 0 10,I wanted to keep the diagonal open. 10.fe5 is safer and better.
20,d4,d5d4,r2qkb1r/1b2pppp/pp6/2p1B3/3p1P2/1P2P3/P1PP2PP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 0 11,Very good shot! Now the Bishop is trapped and it looks like it will be captured.
21,f5,f4f5,r2qkb1r/1b2pppp/pp6/2p1BP2/3p4/1P2P3/P1PP2PP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 0 11,Only move - White opens an escape route for the Be5.
22,Qd5,d8d5,r3kb1r/1b2pppp/pp6/2pqBP2/3p4/1P2P3/P1PP2PP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 1 12,And here comes the main point. Double threat of Qe5 and Qg2# seems unstoppable.
23,Qf3,d1f3,r3kb1r/1b2pppp/pp6/2pqBP2/3p4/1P2PQ2/P1PP2PP/RN3RK1 b kq - 2 12,The only move and a good counterpoint. Now best is 12... Qf3; 13.gf3 with approximate equality (Black for preference though). 12...0-0-0 is another good option.
24,Qxe5,d5e5,r3kb1r/1b2pppp/pp6/2p1qP2/3p4/1P2PQ2/P1PP2PP/RN3RK1 w kq - 0 13,"?! Unfortunately, Black did not want to exchange Queens and captured the Bishop instead as he originally intended. After this White is better, due to better development (already castled)."
25,Qxb7,f3b7,r3kb1r/1Q2pppp/pp6/2p1qP2/3p4/1P2P3/P1PP2PP/RN3RK1 b kq - 0 13,"Black threat of d:e3 is only optical, because Ra8 is hanging."
26,Rb8,a8b8,1r2kb1r/1Q2pppp/pp6/2p1qP2/3p4/1P2P3/P1PP2PP/RN3RK1 w k - 1 14,"13...Rd8 is probably better, but White has the upper hand in any case."
27,Qc6+,b7c6,1r2kb1r/4pppp/ppQ5/2p1qP2/3p4/1P2P3/P1PP2PP/RN3RK1 b k - 2 14,Depriving Black of castling rights. 13...Rd8 would allow 14...Rd7 here so that's why it is likely a better move than 13...Rb8.
28,Kd8,e8d8,1r1k1b1r/4pppp/ppQ5/2p1qP2/3p4/1P2P3/P1PP2PP/RN3RK1 w - - 3 15,"Very good move. Ra1 is now defended, and the Knight will go to c4 and then either b6 or e5 (-> f3)."
29,Na3,b1a3,1r1k1b1r/4pppp/ppQ5/2p1qP2/3p4/NP2P3/P1PP2PP/R4RK1 b - - 4 15,"Very good move. Ra1 is now defended, and the Knight will go to c4 and then either b6 or e5 (-> f3)."
