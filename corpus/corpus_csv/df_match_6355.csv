2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"I haven't played too many queen pawn games in my life so to keep it sharp I opted for a gambit, the Gibbens Gambit, played often by Clyde Nakamura to make the game a tad more tactical"
3,g4,g2g4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P2P1/8/PPP1PP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,deflecting the knight from the center and opening up a strong g-file for my rooks. Already it is clear I must castle long
