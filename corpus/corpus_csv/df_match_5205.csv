While I've gotten rolled up by very strong players who sally this opening against me, the move itself has never impressed me as a particularly strong one; and of course I'd expect a very strong player to roll me up anyway, now matter whether they play this move or not, and no matter what my reply to 2.

5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/6B1/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"Six of one, half a dozen of the other... The alternatives here are numerous. Stereotypical would be 3. c4, but Bf6, Nf3, g3, or e3 are also all quite playable. The attractive point of the text move is that it looks to begin an attack immediately. Of course that's usually a course frought with risk no matter who initiates it; but on the other hand such games are almost always fun to play over and analyze."

But this is unrated skittles: and who wants to play ""prudently"" against a C-player when there's exciting chess to be had? Black thumbs his nose at White for the second time in as many moves, saying, ""Show me what you've got!"""
