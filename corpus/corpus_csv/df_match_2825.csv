1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I should also clarify, as we begin, that the title is not meant to imply that my opponent or I are Masters--just that the game itself is worthy of serious consideration because of the complexities involved! Personally, I don't think either of us were equipped to deal with the positions we created!"
2,b6,b7b6,rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/1p6/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Black immediately pulls me out of my opening repertoire with this move, transposing from the English Opening to the English Defense..."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/1p6/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"...usually reached from 1.d4 e6 2.c4 b6. I've never encountered this before, but I can infer from basic principles that Black will try to attack the center from the wings, especially the light squares d5 and maybe e4."
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/p1pp1ppp/1p2p3/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"...usually reached from 1.d4 e6 2.c4 b6. I've never encountered this before, but I can infer from basic principles that Black will try to attack the center from the wings, especially the light squares d5 and maybe e4."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/p1pp1ppp/1p2p3/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"That in mind, I contest those squares. Also possible was 3.e4 but I was worried about creating an overadvanced, undersupported pawn center."
6,Bb7,c8b7,rn1qkbnr/pbpp1ppp/1p2p3/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"Essentially adding a little support to d5, by preventing ...Bb4."
7,a3,a2a3,rn1qkbnr/pbpp1ppp/1p2p3/8/2PP4/P1N5/1P2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"Essentially adding a little support to d5, by preventing ...Bb4."
8,d5,d7d5,rn1qkbnr/pbp2ppp/1p2p3/3p4/2PP4/P1N5/1P2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,Of course Black can simply occupy d5 directly.
9,Nf3,g1f3,rn1qkbnr/pbp2ppp/1p2p3/3p4/2PP4/P1N2N2/1P2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,Black continues to hold the his own in the center just fine.
10,Nf6,g8f6,rn1qkb1r/pbp2ppp/1p2pn2/3p4/2PP4/P1N2N2/1P2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,Black continues to hold the his own in the center just fine.
11,cxd5,c4d5,rn1qkb1r/pbp2ppp/1p2pn2/3P4/3P4/P1N2N2/1P2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,Black continues to hold the his own in the center just fine.
12,Nxd5,f6d5,rn1qkb1r/pbp2ppp/1p2p3/3n4/3P4/P1N2N2/1P2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,Black continues to hold the his own in the center just fine.
13,e4,e2e4,rn1qkb1r/pbp2ppp/1p2p3/3n4/3PP3/P1N2N2/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"?! My idea was to gain time to develop my light-squared Bishop by giving up a pawn, and to bolster d4 at the same time (after ...Nxc3 bxc3). This works, but I don't know if the compensation is actually worth it."
14,Nxc3,d5c3,rn1qkb1r/pbp2ppp/1p2p3/8/3PP3/P1n2N2/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,Black gains his extra pawn.
15,bxc3,b2c3,rn1qkb1r/pbp2ppp/1p2p3/8/3PP3/P1P2N2/5PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,Black gains his extra pawn.
16,Bxe4,b7e4,rn1qkb1r/p1p2ppp/1p2p3/8/3Pb3/P1P2N2/5PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 9,Black gains his extra pawn.
17,Ne5,f3e5,rn1qkb1r/p1p2ppp/1p2p3/4N3/3Pb3/P1P5/5PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 9,"The Knight holds a strong point in the center of the board, threatening c6 and f7, as well as letting the WQ out to g4 should she choose that path later on."
18,Qh4,d8h4,rn2kb1r/p1p2ppp/1p2p3/4N3/3Pb2q/P1P5/5PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 10,"?! Personally, I don't think this accomplishes anything. Black doesn't have enough pieces in the field to make this a legitimate attack, and the Queen can be easily chased away here."
19,g3,g2g3,rn2kb1r/p1p2ppp/1p2p3/4N3/3Pb2q/P1P3P1/5P1P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 10,"If Black's goal was to weaken the White kingside, though, he's certainly succeeded at that task. This jab foreshadows things to come--White puts a Rook in danger in order to stab at a more valuable Black piece. The tactics and counterattacks only increase from here."
20,Qd8,h4d8,rn1qkb1r/p1p2ppp/1p2p3/4N3/3Pb3/P1P3P1/5P1P/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 11,"!? White puts off dealing with his Rook for another turn, in order to take advantage of the opportunity to develop with tempo..."
21,Bb5+,f1b5,rn1qkb1r/p1p2ppp/1p2p3/1B2N3/3Pb3/P1P3P1/5P1P/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 11,"!? White puts off dealing with his Rook for another turn, in order to take advantage of the opportunity to develop with tempo..."
22,c6,c7c6,rn1qkb1r/p4ppp/1pp1p3/1B2N3/3Pb3/P1P3P1/5P1P/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 12,Now two White pieces are hanging...
23,f3,f2f3,rn1qkb1r/p4ppp/1pp1p3/1B2N3/3Pb3/P1P2PP1/7P/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 12,This is the only way to avoid losing material.
24,Bd5,e4d5,rn1qkb1r/p4ppp/1pp1p3/1B1bN3/3P4/P1P2PP1/7P/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 13,"And likewise for Black, any other retreat for this Bishop loses the c-pawn (and 12...cxb5? 13.fxe4 gives White a massive center)."
25,Bd3,b5d3,rn1qkb1r/p4ppp/1pp1p3/3bN3/3P4/P1PB1PP1/7P/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 13,"White seems to have eked out some compensation for the pawn after all. Black's only developed piece is centrally-placed, but restricted by its own pawns and could be won outright by c3-c4!"
26,f6,f7f6,rn1qkb1r/p5pp/1pp1pp2/3bN3/3P4/P1PB1PP1/7P/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 14,"Since Black would rather not lose his only active piece, he pushes the Knight back to make room for ...e6-e5. I'm pretty sure 13...c5 was playable here, as well, and perhaps preferable as it frees up c6 for a Knight, but it does open the a4-e8 diagonal again, so perhaps pushing the Knight off of e5 first was best after all."
27,Ng4,e5g4,rn1qkb1r/p5pp/1pp1pp2/3b4/3P2N1/P1PB1PP1/7P/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 14,"White doesn't want to move to c4, since that would negate his threat against the Bishop."
28,e5,e6e5,rn1qkb1r/p5pp/1pp2p2/3bp3/3P2N1/P1PB1PP1/7P/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 15,"14...c5 was still playable, and personally I still prefer that move to the text. Here White actually has a chance to simply win back his pawn with 15.dxe5."
