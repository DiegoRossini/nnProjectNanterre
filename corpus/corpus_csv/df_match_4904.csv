1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

This is my longest game, albeit by just one move (surpassing that epic draw against the Master Mater), this time against a fellow Class B player.  Out of a QP opening I went into the middlegame and my position seemed fairly passive yet again.  However, a late pawn push eventually proved decisive in my favour.  My opponent allowed me to retain one of my promoted pawns and played the game out to mate.
