1,b3,b2b3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The Larsen's Opening. I think this was the second time I ever played vs this opening, which is kinda odd considering it's the 6th most popular opening move. Larsen himself thought that b3 is an opening in which most black players make a mistake somewhere, since they aren't familiar with the ideas behind the opening. He was more or less right, I didn't know and still don't know these ideas, hence why I'm analysing this game in the first place. I expected her to play the London system and prepared for that specific opening the night before, so I was a little bit baffled about b3, which invites a completely different kind of position."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Universally speaking the most played response. It blocks off the diagonal and takes a hold of the center.
3,Bb2,c1b2,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/1P6/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,Still the main line and the most logical move in my opinion.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/8/1P6/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,Still the main line and the most logical move in my opinion.
5,e3,e2e3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/8/1P2P3/PBPP1PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"Unfamiliar with the opening I was calculating d4 here, but couldn't see how that'd benefit white so I disregarded it. I should have thought a little longer about this move, even if it's just to familiarize myself with the ideas of the opening."
6,d5,d7d5,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/3pp3/8/1P2P3/PBPP1PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Taking a hold of the center.
7,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/1B1pp3/8/1P2P3/PBPP1PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 1 4,"And so it begins. black has got to be a little careful here. Usually a move like Bd7 would work fine, however because his bishop on b2 is attacking e5, the only really thing black can do is to defend e5. White usually tries to hold onto this pin for a little while, however I researched my opponent a little bit before the match and knew she had a tendency to just take in these type of positions."
8,f6,f7f6,r1bqkbnr/ppp3pp/2n2p2/1B1pp3/8/1P2P3/PBPP1PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,"Theory suggests that 4.Bb5 Bd6 5.c4 is the logical continuation after 4. Bb5. I opt for f6 instead. This move may look insignificant, but means a huge deal since it closes off a diagonal for my queen and makes Nf6 impossible for the time being. Also interesting to note is that after d4 all my pawns would be positioned on dark squares, which weakens his bishop on b2, but makes it hard for my own dark squared bishop to develop properly. This last part will become a huge issue later on."
9,Bxc6+,b5c6,r1bqkbnr/ppp3pp/2B2p2/3pp3/8/1P2P3/PBPP1PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,"As predicted she couldn't resist taking. Black has a frightening center now and ideas arise along the lines of Rb1 -> Rb4  and then bringing it over to the king side. That idea of course isn't useful just yet, but it's definitely there. I think black is better here and if black develops normally from this point onwards he'll have a very good game."
10,bxc6,b7c6,r1bqkbnr/p1p3pp/2p2p2/3pp3/8/1P2P3/PBPP1PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,"As predicted she couldn't resist taking.

11,Ne2,g1e2,r1bqkbnr/p1p3pp/2p2p2/3pp3/8/1P2P3/PBPPNPPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 1 6,Developing a knight to a rather poor square. Nf3 isn't really an option though since 6. Nf3 e4 makes white's position a tad cramped.
12,Ba6,c8a6,r2qkbnr/p1p3pp/b1p2p2/3pp3/8/1P2P3/PBPPNPPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 2 7,"this move took me quite long and quite frankly I think Bf5 is better, targeting the weak c2 square. Looking back at it, I'm not sure why that wasn't played. I assumed she was going to castle king-side, which is premature in my opinion."
13,O-O,e1g1,r2qkbnr/p1p3pp/b1p2p2/3pp3/8/1P2P3/PBPPNPPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 3 7,"She did end up castling, which I think is an error. Now the knight on e2 is in a spot where it can't move to g3."
14,c5,c6c5,r2qkbnr/p1p3pp/b4p2/2ppp3/8/1P2P3/PBPPNPPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 0 8,"This move and the following ones are the reason why I'm not too proud of this game. The idea behind c5 can be explained with 3 short sentences.: I have doubled pawns. I don't like double pawns. can we get rid of them?
I figured I'd push with d4 and get in a position where white is cramped and struggling to develop her minor pieces.  This however makes things awkward for my dark squared bishop. I wonder what I would play if I could replay this game, probably something like Bc5 or Nd7."
15,d3,d2d3,r2qkbnr/p1p3pp/b4p2/2ppp3/8/1P1PP3/PBP1NPPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 0 8,"Making room for the knight to develop to d2. I understand this move, but it feels sort of tame. I probably would have played f4 if I were in white's shoes. After 8. exf4 Rxf4 9. Bd6 Rf2 white gets out of the pin and can create some sort of counter play. She'll still have a very tough game, but it offers better chances in my opinion than 8. d3. If black doesn't take on f4 then after for example 8. f4 Ne7 9. fxe5 fxe5 10. d3 white has a pretty solid position with an open f-file. In that position black would probably still be better, but white would barely have any big weaknesses which black can exploit whereas black's position is aggressive but vulnerable on e5, c5,c7  the e8-h5 diagonal, etc."
16,d4,d5d4,r2qkbnr/p1p3pp/b4p2/2p1p3/3p4/1P1PP3/PBP1NPPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 0 9,You can probably tell by now that my dark squared bishop isn't going to play a huge role in the next few moves. At this point I started calculating f4. My opponent afterwards asked me what move she should have played and when I explained her my f4 idea she admitted to not noticing that idea. f4 is going to play a major role in all my future calculations.
17,exd4,e3d4,r2qkbnr/p1p3pp/b4p2/2p1p3/3P4/1P1P4/PBP1NPPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 0 9,"Black has more space, but f4 is a serious issue and black's white squared bishop is looking rather odd. I start to get a little nervous at this point, but decide to not show a worried face to my opponent. Instead I leave the room to tempt her to make her move more quickly. You often see lower rated players do this to win a couple of minutes. Up until this point I had spend about 20-25 minutes whereas she had used 15 minutes. By leaving my board I essentially tempt her in getting a 15 minute advantage in the hope that she doesn't think of f4."
18,cxd4,c5d4,r2qkbnr/p1p3pp/b4p2/4p3/3p4/1P1P4/PBP1NPPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 0 10,"Black has more space, but f4 is a serious issue and black's white squared bishop is looking rather odd.

19,c3,c2c3,r2qkbnr/p1p3pp/b4p2/4p3/3p4/1PPP4/PB2NPPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 0 10,"When I came back 5 minutes later I noticed 4 more minutes missing on my clock and c3 being played. I took a sip of my drink ( Which I ended up getting in the time I left my board ) and leisurely looked at the board. My worst nightmare, f4, wasn't played and it looked like I was going to get a pawn for free. Life was good."
20,dxc3,d4c3,r2qkbnr/p1p3pp/b4p2/4p3/8/1PpP4/PB2NPPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 0 11,"Losing a bit of my pressure, but making a move like f4 less uncomfortable. White also can't prevent black from winning material. She sighed as she realised she messed up. The following move strangely enough took her 5 minutes or so. After the game she told me that she was unsure of which piece she'd recapture with."
21,Nbxc3,b1c3,r2qkbnr/p1p3pp/b4p2/4p3/8/1PNP4/PB2NPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 11,The most logical recapture in my opinion. Notice how her minor pieces are developed whereas most of my pieces are still on the 8th rank.
22,Qxd3,d8d3,r3kbnr/p1p3pp/b4p2/4p3/8/1PNq4/PB2NPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 12,"Bxd3 was the other option. Both are fine in my opinion. I opted for a queen trade since I was 1 pawn ahead. It may seem like a premature decision, but surely I should be able to win an endgame against a usually weaker opposition right?"
23,Qxd3,d1d3,r3kbnr/p1p3pp/b4p2/4p3/8/1PNQ4/PB2NPPP/R4RK1 b kq - 0 12,"This move just straight up loses. She should have played Rf1e1 or Rf1d1 in my opinion. This just makes the position very awkward for white. The knight can't move, the open files aren't used, etc. 

Editing note: Looking back at this game once more, my assesment of the position before this move is that black is up, but not by much. The reason being because he's underdevelopped and one could argue that it's worth the pawn. In this position ideas of f4 arise once more. White should aim to open up the game and gives checks all across the board rather then bunker up. Rae1 is a mistake and instead Rfd1 or Rad1 should have been played after which I continue Rd8 or O-O-O. Maybe then Ng3 or f4, or something, but the move that was played."
