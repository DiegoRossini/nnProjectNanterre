1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"So far, all pretty normal for a London. Black can do two things: c5, and get countergame on the queenside, or try to castle queenside, instead. Black didn't make the mistake of Nc6 before c5, but castled kingside. This makes it a perfect target for me. It would be exaggerated to say that white has an edge, but black has to play with more care that it seems."
