3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"A relatively unusual continuation.  White's early Q move causes Black to reconsider his planned Najdorf variation.  Should I chase the Q straightaway with ..Nc6 or leave it there a while?  I decided that the immediate N move would invite White's LSB to pin on b5 and would thus achieve little. Therefore, I continued with a normal Najdorf move ..."

8,a6,a7a6,rnbqkbnr/1p2pppp/p2p4/8/3QP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"White's pawn formation is typical of the Maroczy Bind, though I don't think that is usually combined with 4. Qxd4.  The bind is aimed at restricting Black's position."

In this case, I think the primary purpose was to prevent ...Ng4, attacking the Q again."

However, Black has made one extra pawn move and not yet developed his Q.  Neither side has any significant weaknesses at present, though Black has the possibility of getting a fork on c2 and White may be able to exploit the weakness on b6."

If White exchanges on d5, Black's exposed N can centralise by recapturing on d5 at the appropriate moment."

However, I could then have forked a4 and c4 with b7-b5... This Q move over-defends the N and d-pawn but invites a skewering pin by Be5-c3.  My intention then was to play Bxa4 followed by Qxa4, winning a pawn while maintaining the defence of the N"
