The explanation I got from my opponent here was the following: On move 20 when I played Qh5 my thought was take on d5 next move with the bishop and win my pawn back. I have taken on d5 first and then played 21..Qh5 instead. I was looking at lines and made the move without double checking if you had a good move if I moved the queen first. Silly mistake, really. In short, ouch."
