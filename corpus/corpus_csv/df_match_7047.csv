1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Start off with my standard English Opening.  Karpov describes the English as best for when you wish to ""avoid long theoretical variations and rely more on 'understanding'"", which is why I have a strong preference for it when playing OTB games.  I haven't been playing long enough to have a great repertoire of openings, so I chose the English as my game to ensure I could be competitive without having to spend alot of time studying many variations."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"This move is full of possibilities, but the one I think is most popular is 2.d4 which transposes into the Indian Defence."
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 2,"As a true advocate of the English lines, I instead stick with them.  2.Nc3 doubles my attack on the d5 square, beginning my normal strategy of central control from the wings with an eventual fianchetto on the cards."
4,e5,e7e5,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Probably considered the main line response.
5,g3,g2g3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2P5/2N3P1/PP1PPP1P/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"Normally I would go with 3.Nf3, forcing Black to look at the e5 Pawn.  3.g3 isn't a line that I play or am experience in at all, but since I'm using Gameknot as a place for me to practice my chess and experiment I felt it was a good idea to test the line.  The idea was to begin my fianchetto earlier than normal, strengthening my centre.  Having finished the game I think I'll probably stick with 3.Nf3 from now on :o)"
6,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/1bP5/2N3P1/PP1PPP1P/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"I like exchanging Knights for Bishops, so this move wasn't something that worried me.  I guess it's all about personal preference, and I feel that my Bishops are much more useful during a game so am normally more than happy to exchange.  I could force Black to decide whether or not he REALLY wants to exchange with 4.a3, but I prefer to continue with my normal development."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/1bP5/2N2NP1/PP1PPP1P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,"Lots of choices.  I could put the question to Black with 4.a3, or I could fianchetto my light-Bishop with 4.Bg2 or develop my Knight.  I had expected Black to hesitate over the Bishop-Knight exchange so figured it didn't really matter which order I played Nf3 and Bg2, so sent my Knight out first.  It adds a little pressure on the central e5-Pawn so I hoped to force Black to defend that in some way before being able to continue with his plans."
8,Bxc3,b4c3,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2P5/2b2NP1/PP1PPP1P/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"I'm sure I'm not the only person surprised by this move.  It forces me to deal with the Bishop rather than immediately continue my development (or take the e5-Pawn which is currently only defended by the offending Bishop), gives me doubled Pawns on my Queen-side and thus slightly weakens my Pawn structure.  But it seems a bit of a waste on behalf of Black, who now will inevitably lose his Bishop.  I think I'd have advanced the central Pawn to e4 which forces White to waste a move by moving the Knight a second time and denies the e4 square to White."
9,dxc3,d2c3,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2P5/2P2NP1/PP2PP1P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"OK, so I double up my Pawns.  However, the d-file is looking nice and open for my Queen and Black must still make a move to keep the e5 Pawn safe."
10,d6,d7d6,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/2P5/2P2NP1/PP2PP1P/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,Finally get my light-Bishop into the fianchetto.  Looks fairly even right now.
11,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/2P5/2P2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,Finally get my light-Bishop into the fianchetto.  Looks fairly even right now.
12,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/2P5/2P2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 2 7,"I think a development move would have been better, perhaps Nc6."
13,Be3,c1e3,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/2P5/2P1BNP1/PP2PPBP/R2QK2R b KQ - 3 7,"I'm not sure where this got away from me, but I don't like the position I'm finding myself in.  I think it's still fairly even, but I dislike weakening my King-side after Black successfully weakened my Queen-side earlier.  Starting to believe that my best bet is to go on a major offensive, send my Pawns into attacking positions and keep my opponent on the back foot, reacting instead of being able to make a move by choice."
