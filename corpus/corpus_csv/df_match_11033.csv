1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"white plays an opening which black isn't to familiar with but doesn't seem to punish blacks innaccuracies, in what looks like an equal position black sacrifes a pawn for a strong attack on the white king, white returns the pawn immediately to try and appease the black army but returning the pawn was not good the black army snacks on the tasty white pawn then ploughs onward to the white king"
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,against e4 i often play Alekhines defence i guess i felt like playing something more normal for some reason

6,a6,a7a6,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,"white plays the open Ruy Lopez, an opening im not at all familiar with, i just tried to play sensibly and not lose out of the opening"
7,Bxc6,b5c6,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1B5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,"white plays the open Ruy Lopez, an opening im not at all familiar with, i just tried to play sensibly and not lose out of the opening"
8,dxc6,d7c6,r1bqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1p5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,this i knew was the main line after this though im ashamed to say i had no clue
9,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1p5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 5,now the black e pawn is threatened as ...Qd4 no longer works
10,Bd6,f8d6,r1bqk1nr/1pp2ppp/p1pb4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 6,"defending the pawn, seemed a sensible way to do so at the time."
11,d4,d2d4,r1bqk1nr/1pp2ppp/p1pb4/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 6,when this was played it seemed to me to be quite strong.
12,f6,f7f6,r1bqk1nr/1pp3pp/p1pb1p2/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,"it was either this, Qe7 which just doesn't seem natural or surrendering the centre completely with exd4. maybe there is some tactical defence here but i couldn't see it"
13,Re1,f1e1,r1bqk1nr/1pp3pp/p1pb1p2/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq - 1 7,"sencible, pointing your rook at your opponents king can't be bad here. obviously white doesn't want to releave the central tension just yet, both sides will fight to make concessions in the centre by trying to force each other to relieve the tension unfavourably"
14,Bg4,c8g4,r2qk1nr/1pp3pp/p1pb1p2/4p3/3PP1b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq - 2 8,? white gives up the fight a little to easily
15,dxe5,d4e5,r2qk1nr/1pp3pp/p1pb1p2/4P3/4P1b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq - 0 8,? white gives up the fight a little to easily
16,fxe5,f6e5,r2qk1nr/1pp3pp/p1pb4/4p3/4P1b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq - 0 9,breaking the pin on the knight but i don't feel hte pin is of much importance now. white should probably start to develop his queenside
17,Qd3,d1d3,r2qk1nr/1pp3pp/p1pb4/4p3/4P1b1/3Q1N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1R1K1 b kq - 1 9,breaking the pin on the knight but i don't feel hte pin is of much importance now. white should probably start to develop his queenside
18,Nf6,g8f6,r2qk2r/1pp3pp/p1pb1n2/4p3/4P1b1/3Q1N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1R1K1 w kq - 2 10,"now the kings knight can come to its most natural square, black also has the option of castling on either side here"
19,Bg5,c1g5,r2qk2r/1pp3pp/p1pb1n2/4p1B1/4P1b1/3Q1N2/PPP2PPP/RN2R1K1 b kq - 3 10,because of the pin on the knight i decide to castle short as the queen belongs on d7 but after 10...Qd7 11.Bxf6 gxf6leaves the f pawn weak but black does have the half open g file to operate on
20,O-O,e8g8,r2q1rk1/1pp3pp/p1pb1n2/4p1B1/4P1b1/3Q1N2/PPP2PPP/RN2R1K1 w - - 4 11,because of the pin on the knight i decide to castle short as the queen belongs on d7 but after 10...Qd7 11.Bxf6 gxf6leaves the f pawn weak but black does have the half open g file to operate on

22,Qd7,d8d7,r4rk1/1ppq2pp/p1pb1n2/4p1B1/4P1bN/3Q4/PPP2PPP/RN2R1K1 w - - 6 12,now black can double rooks on his half open f file and prepare an attack
23,Bxf6,g5f6,r4rk1/1ppq2pp/p1pb1B2/4p3/4P1bN/3Q4/PPP2PPP/RN2R1K1 b - - 0 12,now black can double rooks on his half open f file and prepare an attack
24,Rxf6,f8f6,r5k1/1ppq2pp/p1pb1r2/4p3/4P1bN/3Q4/PPP2PPP/RN2R1K1 w - - 0 13,white continues development. i'd give black a small plus here
25,Nd2,b1d2,r5k1/1ppq2pp/p1pb1r2/4p3/4P1bN/3Q4/PPPN1PPP/R3R1K1 b - - 1 13,white continues development. i'd give black a small plus here
26,Raf8,a8f8,5rk1/1ppq2pp/p1pb1r2/4p3/4P1bN/3Q4/PPPN1PPP/R3R1K1 w - - 2 14,"doubling rooks, getting as many pieces as possible into offencive positions before pushing forward."
27,Ndf3,d2f3,5rk1/1ppq2pp/p1pb1r2/4p3/4P1bN/3Q1N2/PPP2PPP/R3R1K1 b - - 3 14,? this allows black a strong attack
