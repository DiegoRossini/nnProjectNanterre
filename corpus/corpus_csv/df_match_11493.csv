After 8. ... d6, white can choose between 9. d4, allowing the pin Bg4, or 9. h3, where black has many good variations, including Na5 (Chigorin), Nb8 (Breyer's), Bb7 (Zaitsev), Nd7 (Smyslov), and Re8 (a flexible idea).  This move invites white to take a pawn for attacking chances."

Instead, he chose to accept it and walked right into Marshall's little surprise, almost daring him to spring the trap..."

22,Nf6,d5f6,r1bq1rk1/2p1bppp/p4n2/1p2R3/8/1BP5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ2K1 w - - 1 12,"This is an excellent move -- preparing to transfer the knight to the kingside where it can join in the attack!  Look at the white pieces -- the rook is about to get attacked, and the white queenside is asleep and blocked in!  Black these days plays either 11. ... Bb7 or 11. ... c6! more commonly, but Nf6 is also a very strong (and my preferred) move."
23,Re1,e5e1,r1bq1rk1/2p1bppp/p4n2/1p6/8/1BP5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQR1K1 b - - 2 12,"Anticipating black's 12. ... Bd6.  12. d4 and 12. Re2 are also worth considering as defensive options, but 12. Re2 would block the queen's defensive route to the kingside."

Kf1 [17. Kxh2? Qxf2] Bg3, winning the exchange.)  It is remarkable how deep black is into white's kingside.  Note also that black has won back the gambit pawn."
31,Re2,e1e2,r1b2rk1/2p2ppp/p2b4/1p6/3P3q/1BP2Q1P/PP2RnP1/RNB3K1 b - - 1 16,"Threatening to win the knight.  It is possible that Re2 would have been better back on the 12th move, saving white a tempo, but getting in the way of 14. Qf3.  As an aside, some say that 16. Bd2 is an even better move for white.  My analysis is that in that case, Ng4! for black looks excellent.  16. Bd2 Ng4 17. g3 Qxh3 18. Qxa8 Bxg3, and black has sacrificed a rook for a tremendous kingside assault."
32,Bg4,c8g4,r4rk1/2p2ppp/p2b4/1p6/3P2bq/1BP2Q1P/PP2RnP1/RNB3K1 w - - 2 17,"A difficult move in a difficult position.  I honestly don't know what move I'd make here, as 16. ... Bxh3 and 16. ... Nxh3  don't look too inviting either, and 16. ... Bg3? is checkmate (16. ... Bg3 17. Qxf7 ! Rxf7 18. Re8#)"

35,Kf1,g1f1,r4rk1/2p2ppp/p7/1p6/3P2Pq/1BP2Q2/PP2RnPb/RNB2K2 b - - 2 18,"Now the threat is Qh1#.  White must give the exchage back to survive.  Possibly 18. ... Nh8 is good, too."
