1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"My opponent suggested me to play the Reti as it's quite an easy system to learn and the basic moves are virtually the same whatever Black plays against it. I have tried it in a few games but it didn't really fit my style (by the way, both games transposed into other openings: one game into a rare kind of Queen's Indian and the other into a symmetrical English). After all I decided to stick with e4 (but I still try other moves sometimes), only on GK though."
2,b5,b7b5,rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/8/1p6/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"?! Obviously an incorrect pawn sac, but who can prove that against a master? At least it got us out of the databases almost immediately."
3,Bxb5,f1b5,rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/8/1B6/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 2,"So here it is... The compensation consists of a bishop on the strong a8-h1 diagonal with pressure on the e4 pawn (and eventually the g2 pawn and h1 rook) and a misplaced bishop for White on b5 which needs to move again (it does little at this square). I do not really trust the computer in this kind of positions, but the GK engine gives White an edge of almost +2 (winning for White). My own engine (Fritz) gives me +1.25, which is also a large advantage. I think it's less than that, but the compensation is probably not enough. Still, you can try it against a much weaker player."

5,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qkbnr/pbpppppp/8/1B6/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 2 3,"In hypermodern style, Black wants to complete another fianchetto."
6,g6,g7g6,rn1qkbnr/pbpppp1p/6p1/1B6/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 4,"In hypermodern style, Black wants to complete another fianchetto."
7,d4,d2d4,rn1qkbnr/pbpppp1p/6p1/1B6/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 4,"So I take the center, as was my strategy in this part of the game. Of course I knew Black would try to destroy the center from the flanks, but I had adopted this strategy from my first move on and so I thought I needed to stick with it."
8,Nf6,g8f6,rn1qkb1r/pbpppp1p/5np1/1B6/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 1 5,Putting more pressure on the center and almost forcing my reply. We can see now that Black has got the initiative by his first move.
9,Bd3,b5d3,rn1qkb1r/pbpppp1p/5np1/8/3PP3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 2 5,"I would like to be able to kick the knight, but unfortunately 5.e5?? walks into 5...Bxg2 winning the rook on h1. Also I thought this bishop needed to move another time anyway, so I decided to do it now rather than to defend with 5.Qe2 (the queen may be better placed on another square)."
10,d6,d7d6,rn1qkb1r/pbp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,Probably planning ...Nbd7 and inhibiting an e5 advance (which would be possible after Nf3).
11,Nf3,g1f3,rn1qkb1r/pbp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"Developing normally, but I like to play f4 against hypermodern systems and this stops that. I think I hesitated to make such a move because I knew how strong my opponent was and how such an opponent could create a kingside attack out of the blue. I know, it's never a good strategy to play too defensively, but it's simply something that happens almost unconsciously. Anyway, this move isn't bad, but simply less challenging than 6.f4. There were other options as well, for example 6.Be3."
12,Bg7,f8g7,rn1qk2r/pbp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 7,"I thought this was the best placement for the bishop since it helps defending the center but is nevertheless actively posted. However, it does block a file for the rook (and possibly queen) and does not prevent a counterpunch in the center like ...e5."
13,O-O,e1g1,rn1qk2r/pbp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 3 7,"I thought this was the best placement for the bishop since it helps defending the center but is nevertheless actively posted.

16,Nbd7,b8d7,r2q1rk1/pbpnppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2NBBN2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 6 9,"This seemed like the best place for the queen, because it prepares an eventual Bh6 exchanging Black's strong dark-squared bishop. this is also the best place to assist in a kingside attack, and she is also nicely placed when the center opens up."
17,Qd2,d1d2,r2q1rk1/pbpnppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2NBBN2/PPPQ1PPP/R4RK1 b - - 7 9,"This seemed like the best place for the queen, because it prepares an eventual Bh6 exchanging Black's strong dark-squared bishop. this is also the best place to assist in a kingside attack, and she is also nicely placed when the center opens up."
18,Rc8,a8c8,2rq1rk1/pbpnppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2NBBN2/PPPQ1PPP/R4RK1 w - - 8 10,"This move looked a bit weird to me. I thought it was possibly to prepare a ...c5 push. Now I think I need to make something happen, as my whole army except for the rook on a1 is developed."
19,e5,e4e5,2rq1rk1/pbpnppbp/3p1np1/4P3/3P4/2NBBN2/PPPQ1PPP/R4RK1 b - - 0 10,"!? I wanted to play either 10.e5 or 10.d5 and decided this was the best of those. The computer does not mark this as an inaccuracy but its evaluation drops half a point indicating it was not the best move in the position. I'm not quite sure what was better though. 10.d5, one of the suggestions of the computer, doesn't look very good either, it locks up the center completely, opens up the a1-h8 diagonal and gives Black the opportunity to strike at Whites center with a move like ...c6. Besides that, it creates a hole on e5 which can be exploited by a Black knight (not just yet, but after the knight on f6 has moved). However, it does discover an attack on the a7 pawn (I may have missed that). Another suggestion of my computer is 10.Bg5, indicating my bishop was not ideally placed on e3, but it's hard to play such a move after you have played Be3 2 moves ago."
20,dxe5,d6e5,2rq1rk1/pbpnppbp/5np1/4p3/3P4/2NBBN2/PPPQ1PPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 11,"Now my center comes under heavy pressure. I had not considered this move dangerous in my evaluations somehow, but now it seems as if my e5 pawn is already lost (three attackers and one defender)."

23,Bf4,e3f4,2rq1rk1/pbpnppbp/6p1/4P3/5Bn1/2NB1N2/PPPQ1PPP/R4RK1 b - - 2 12,"? Now this is a real mistake. I had completely missed the nice 12.e6! which would be a very interesting pawn sac (not really, actually, since I would lose that pawn anyway) which both the GK computer and my own Fritzs give. After 12...fxe6 I could attack the weak Black kingside with moves like Ng5 and Bc4. After 12...Nxe3? the line 13.exd7 Nxf1 14.dxc8=Q Nxd2 15.Qxb7 wins a piece for a pawn for me. The computer suggests 12...Nde5 as the best move for Black. I played 12.Bf4 to preserve my bishop pair and because I thought I wouldn't save that pawn either, but when a pawn is lost it's usually worth it to look for the best way to lose it."
24,Bxf3,b7f3,2rq1rk1/p1pnppbp/6p1/4P3/5Bn1/2NB1b2/PPPQ1PPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 13,"Before taking on e5, Freddy first demolishes my kingside pawn structure.... Ouch, this is even worse than a pawn structure with f4 (as mentioned at move 6), where you have a hole on the a7-g1 diagonal..."

However, I still give up my bishop pair, which I wanted to preserve 2 moves ago... My computer thinks 14.Be2 is the best move and I tend to agree."
