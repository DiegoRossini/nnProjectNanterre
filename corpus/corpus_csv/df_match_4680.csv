1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"1.e4 remaining as the all time favourite move to begin the game with, no matter are you beginner or grandmaster you are going to face this best-by-test move more than any other opening move. But back to the game, my opponent decided to go for this instead of playing 1.d4 which was his main opening move(I would have tried to go for kings indian defence if that would have happened)."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,My main defence against e4. I play other moves here too but it is a good rule when facing a stronger opponent on paper to go for the opening which you know the best.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"My absolute favourite of all times, Dragon variation, which is also regarded as one of the most complicated openings employed in modern practice. Back in early days of Dragon, the moves to begin with were much more different: 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 d6 and after 6. Be2 g6 black would have successfully got where he wanted(move order was developed from avoiding c2-c4 marcozy bind and attacking move e4-e5 when they were used against the imaginary d6, e7, g6, h7 formation resembling Dragon constellation). Modern move order was found after response 6.Bg5 against old move order cause 6...g6? 7.Bxf6 exf6 is no good."

It is beginning of organised attack on the kingside with already mentioned formation."
12,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 7,"With this move we come to position known as Yugoslav Attack(old name Rauzer Attack), white has long castle and a pawn storm in his mind on kingside. Less common replies in use here are 7...Nc6 and 7...a6(which are sometimes called anti-rauzer cause black delays castling counting on other benefits like first bringing pieces on queenside where white intends to castle)."
13,f3,f2f3,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"With this move we come to position known as Yugoslav Attack(old name Rauzer Attack), white has long castle and a pawn storm in his mind on kingside.

15,Qd2,d1d2,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3KB1R b KQ - 2 8,"There remains continuation 8.Bc4 Nc6 9.Qe2 which is just ""wrong"" cause true spirit of Yugoslav attack is to go and see who checkmates first! But the continuation I gave there is to go up against blacks counterplay on queenside."
16,Nc6,b8c6,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3KB1R w KQ - 3 9,"Black is ready for the battle, counterblow in the center that is. So white is going to either allow it by playing 9. 0-0-0, prevent it by 9.Bc4 or be a haymaker and go for 9.g4."
17,Bc4,f1c4,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/2BNP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3K2R b KQ - 4 9,"Some call this a modern approach of this opening as after many games and research done with the move 9. 0-0-0 this is regarded as the best shot by white to get the advantage in game(keep in mind, that in openings you never know when old moves come into fashion again. There is surely room for new ideas in 0-0-0 variation, you just have to find them). This move is to prevent any ...d6-d5 plans while developing light-squared bishop to its most active diagonal. So what white is planning then? Long castle, h2-h4-h5, Be3-h6 if needed, launching attack against black king."
18,Bd7,c8d7,r2q1rk1/pp1bppbp/2np1np1/8/2BNP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3K2R w KQ - 5 10,"Alright, I am not going into details with other possibilities as 9...Nxd4, 9...Nd7, 9...Na5, 9...a6 or 9...a5(if this would be introduction of opening, then yes). Bishop move ...Bd7 is a flexible choice in this position, black has lot of possibilities. For example, there is knight manoeuvre possibility ...Nc6-e5-c4(without developing queen before it cause simply saving tempo)."
19,O-O-O,e1c1,r2q1rk1/pp1bppbp/2np1np1/8/2BNP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR3R b - - 6 10,And white continues the plan I introduced. If you want to try something else here then go for 10.Bb3 cause immediate 10.h4 Rc8 11.Bb3 Ne5 leads to transposition(unless you are planning to delay castling then maybe some difference).
20,Rc8,a8c8,2rq1rk1/pp1bppbp/2np1np1/8/2BNP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR3R w - - 7 11,Black has to start working on his own counterplay queenside. There is nothing else now that we have come here so thematic c-file control in sicilian is a great way to start it.
21,Bb3,c4b3,2rq1rk1/pp1bppbp/2np1np1/8/3NP3/1BN1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR3R b - - 8 11,I don't believe there is much anything else. 11. Nxc6 Bxc6 12.Bb3 is not recommended as it doesn't give anything and black can even sacrifice pawn for an initiative: 12...b5!? 13.Bxa7 Qa5 14.Bd4 b4 15.Bxf6 Bxf6 16.Nd5 Bxd5 17. exd5 Rc5 and chances are usually on the side of player who is having more active bishop in cases where bishops are different colour included with other pieces on board.
22,Ne5,c6e5,2rq1rk1/pp1bppbp/3p1np1/4n3/3NP3/1BN1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR3R w - - 9 12,"And continuing with manoeuvre plan aiming for c4. White has now option to go for interesting 12.Kb1 which is prophylactic king move(when I was younger we used to joke about these as ""GM moves""). Other interesting possibility is to play 12. Bg5 where white wants to play e4-e5 break cause of a pin on d-file. Main continuation is 12.h4 which we shall see in the game."
23,h4,h2h4,2rq1rk1/pp1bppbp/3p1np1/4n3/3NP2P/1BN1BP2/PPPQ2P1/2KR3R b - - 0 12,"Flank attack, following the spirit of this opening and starting the attack against black king."
24,h5,h7h5,2rq1rk1/pp1bppb1/3p1np1/4n2p/3NP2P/1BN1BP2/PPPQ2P1/2KR3R w - - 0 13,Black weakens his castled position which should not be done if following general rules. Reason of this move is not to prevent g2-g4 advance cause it will come at some point anyway. But the reason is to delay it and make white to prepare it first. Question is: Can black achieve anything during that duration. 12...a5 is another move reducing blacks possibilities and 12...Nc4 is played here frequently.
25,Bg5,e3g5,2rq1rk1/pp1bppb1/3p1np1/4n1Bp/3NP2P/1BN2P2/PPPQ2P1/2KR3R b - - 1 13,"Here white had several possibilites: 13. g4, 13. Kb1, 13. Bh6, 13. Rhe1, leading to a different game. White goes to threaten knight protecting g2-g4 break and also narrows blacks counterplay possibilities."
26,Rc5,c8c5,3q1rk1/pp1bppb1/3p1np1/2r1n1Bp/3NP2P/1BN2P2/PPPQ2P1/2KR3R w - - 2 14,"Now this is interesting move which needs an explanation. Here has been tried 13...Nc4 but it doesn't look promising after 14. Qe2 Na5 15. Kb1 and white is happy to set attack on the kingside(1-0, Nunn - Mestel, London 1986, can be taken as example game). This rook move is unusual in Dragon but wonderful possibility in this position, prepares b7-b5 and scouts important squares on 5th rank."
27,Kb1,c1b1,3q1rk1/pp1bppb1/3p1np1/2r1n1Bp/3NP2P/1BN2P2/PPPQ2P1/1K1R3R b - - 3 14,14.f4 and 14.g4 are other two moves used here which are more like risking everything. King move is safer option but useful one at this point. Other options let black too easily to get counterplay with knight manoeuvre e5-c4.
28,b5,b7b5,3q1rk1/p2bppb1/3p1np1/1pr1n1Bp/3NP2P/1BN2P2/PPPQ2P1/1K1R3R w - - 0 15,Preparation is done so I started my play on queenside by pushing a pawn.
