1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I've been playing the controversial Latvian Gambit recently, and while it's not the most advisable opening for blitz due to the opening's very sharp nature (it's somewhat more popular in long-form games, where Black is less likely to misstep and lose in the first dozen moves or so), it has the advantage of likely getting White off-book very quickly (of course at high levels everyone is prepared for this opening), and Black can find a lot of tricky resources. Inadvisable or no, it certainly leads to fun games! This game opens with an uncommon line, and features several sacrifices (relatively-sound and otherwise) and a minor-piece checkmate. Enjoy!"
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,?! This is the key move of the Latvian Gambit. Black gives up a pawn in exchange for rapid development and lots of attacking potential.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,?! This is the key move of the Latvian Gambit. Black gives up a pawn in exchange for rapid development and lots of attacking potential.
4,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,?! This is the key move of the Latvian Gambit. Black gives up a pawn in exchange for rapid development and lots of attacking potential.
5,exf5,e4f5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pP2/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"The more common line is 3. Nxe5 Qf6. In the text, White is unlikely to be able to protect a pawn on f5, and he gives up his claim to the center. By playing this side line that looks more like a reversed King's Gambit, White makes me think he's unfamiliar with the opening. Main lines in the King's Gambit don't really apply very well to the Latvian."
6,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/3p4/4pP2/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"The standard line here is actually 3...e4 4. Ne5 Nf6 5. Be2 d6 6. Bh5+ Ke7, followed by White retreating his Knight and Black playing ...Bxf5 (note that 7. Nf7 loses material and time after 7...Qe1), but I chose a more conservative approach here, given that there's time pressure to consider."
7,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/3p4/4pP2/8/3B1N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"? White defends his wayward pawn on f5, at the cost of blocking the d-pawn and crippling his development. I think it's probably better to let the f-pawn go."
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp3pp/3p1n2/4pP2/8/3B1N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,"Threatening ...e4, forking Knight and Bishop."
9,O-O,e1g1,rnbqkb1r/ppp3pp/3p1n2/4pP2/8/3B1N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 3 5,"White puts off dealing with ...e4 directly, since for now he can counter with Re1."
10,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/ppp3pp/2np1n2/4pP2/8/3B1N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 4 6,"I continue my development. White's already gotten away into his castle, so I need to step it up."
11,b3,b2b3,r1bqkb1r/ppp3pp/2np1n2/4pP2/8/1P1B1N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 6,"This is the easiest way to let the DSB out at this point, but it's not destined to get much action pointed straight at a well-defended e5 pawn."
12,Bd7,c8d7,r2qkb1r/pppb2pp/2np1n2/4pP2/8/1P1B1N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 7,"White's just told me with his last move that his Bishop isn't leaving d3 anytime soon, so I might as well develop my own LSB."
13,Bb2,c1b2,r2qkb1r/pppb2pp/2np1n2/4pP2/8/1P1B1N2/PBPP1PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 2 7,Threatening ...e4.
14,Be7,f8e7,r2qk2r/pppbb1pp/2np1n2/4pP2/8/1P1B1N2/PBPP1PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 3 8,Threatening ...e4.
15,Nc3,b1c3,r2qk2r/pppbb1pp/2np1n2/4pP2/8/1PNB1N2/PBPP1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 4 8,Defending e4.
16,d5,d6d5,r2qk2r/pppbb1pp/2n2n2/3ppP2/8/1PNB1N2/PBPP1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 9,"?! This wasn't particularly well thought-out. I probably should have played 7...d5 to allow more options for my DSB. This does renew the threat of ...e4, though, which wouldn't actually be possible if the White Rook could still pin it to the BK."
17,Be2,d3e2,r2qk2r/pppbb1pp/2n2n2/3ppP2/8/1PN2N2/PBPPBPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 1 9,White chooses to pull his Bishop back to give himself some more space on d3.
18,Bxf5,d7f5,r2qk2r/ppp1b1pp/2n2n2/3ppb2/8/1PN2N2/PBPPBPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 10,"I finally get the f5 pawn back. Now I'm in a position I'm not used to--normally this opening leaves me significantly behind in material, trying to make the most of my advanced development. Here, I still have a slight spatial edge, but materially we are even."
19,d3,d2d3,r2qk2r/ppp1b1pp/2n2n2/3ppb2/8/1PNP1N2/PBP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 10,"I don't think this move accomplishes much right now. If White were planning to play c4, he should get the Knight out of the way first, and since the only decent place to put that Knight at the moment is b5, I don't see a reason to deny it the Bishop's support prematurely. This move adds a little defense to e4, but otherwise I don't see any reason for it."
20,O-O,e8g8,r2q1rk1/ppp1b1pp/2n2n2/3ppb2/8/1PNP1N2/PBP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 1 11,"In retrospect I wish I had castled queenside. White isn't at all set up for a pawn storm on that flank, and this position ends up leaving me a bit more exposed than I would like."
21,Re1,f1e1,r2q1rk1/ppp1b1pp/2n2n2/3ppb2/8/1PNP1N2/PBP1BPPP/R2QR1K1 b - - 2 11,"White gets his Rook onto the critical e-file, but as yet it can exert no influence with the stymied Bishop blocking its path."
22,e4,e5e4,r2q1rk1/ppp1b1pp/2n2n2/3p1b2/4p3/1PNP1N2/PBP1BPPP/R2QR1K1 w - - 0 12,"!? At this point I feel like I'm ahead enough in development and open space that I can break the position open and begin an attack. This move frees White's Bishop, but I'm feeling like my King is reasonably safe."
23,dxe4,d3e4,r2q1rk1/ppp1b1pp/2n2n2/3p1b2/4P3/1PN2N2/PBP1BPPP/R2QR1K1 b - - 0 12,"White sees an attack coming, so he immediately begins trading down."
