I can play g6 and Bg7 on one side, and Qc7 on the other - so in three moves I can get three separate pieces attacking the pawn, of which g6 and Bg7 are natural developing moves anyway. You don't want to have to tie up your pieces to defending pawns this early on."

Because of my bishop already on the diagonal, Nd4 will force you to capture with your knight as there is a double attack on your knight, your queen is threatened and there is a threat of a following Nc2  instead of capturing."
