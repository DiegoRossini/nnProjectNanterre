22,Re6,e4e6,r1bq2k1/p1p2ppp/2p1r3/1pb5/8/5B2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 2 12,"Black has a very weak pawn structure, it is true, but thanks to the ""ugly"" ...b5, he forced the White Bishop to a less effective square, which allows Morphy to post his Rook at e6, where it is well-placed for a lift to the King side. Perhaps Paulsen should have played 12.Bg4 followed by 13.Bxc8? But look at what else Morphy has: his Queenside pieces will develop quickly no matter what White does (although 12.c3 was a terrible lemon). The Queen will go to h4, the Bishop to d7, and the QR will double up on the King file. All of his pieces will stand ready for any action in the center or King side."
