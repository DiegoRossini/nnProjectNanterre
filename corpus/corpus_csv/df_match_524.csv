At this stage black could have taken my F rook with his bishop and that would have left me with a pawn ab out to take my B rook so would have created difficulties.  When I look at my king side I see I cannot progress with the queen still at d8 so I would have been hoping that my opponent would move this soon!  There was the f5 square for my knight which would be safe.
