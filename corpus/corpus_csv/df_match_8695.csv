He is playing black so I am annotating from black's point of view. I picked this game as it seems to be played between two relative equals (1265 vs. 1275 ratings at the start). White begins with the Open Game."

Even Kasparov used it occasionally. Main lines say black should take the pawn with 3. ... exd4 since he cannot easily maintain a pawn on e5. I don't find the text move in my limited reference material. It seems to have the benefit that 3. ... d6 would have, defending the e5 pawn with a pawn, and without the drawback of allowing white to play Qxd8 after the exchanges. It does, however, rob black's king's knight of its favorite square. It also opens the lane for white to eventually play Qh5 , a move that is often devastating to black, though right now white has no way to exploit it."
