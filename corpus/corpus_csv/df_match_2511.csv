1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Avoiding c4 and my Budapest-at-test. This is not a good move for white, but it is not straight forward to prove it."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"Avoiding c4 and my Budapest-at-test. This is not a good move for white, but it is not straight forward to prove it."
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 2,"Avoiding c4 and my Budapest-at-test. This is not a good move for white, but it is not straight forward to prove it."
4,b6,b7b6,rnbqkb1r/p1pppppp/1p3n2/8/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Passively taking a good diagonal. But white has few problems coping with that. The fianchetto has the disadvantage of being announced, so the opponent has time to move according to it."
5,e4,e2e4,rnbqkb1r/p1pppppp/1p3n2/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,Already threatening an annoying e5.
6,d6,d7d6,rnbqkb1r/p1p1pppp/1p1p1n2/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Well, this must be a mistake, but let's my opponent prove it."
7,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/p1p1pppp/1p1p1n2/6B1/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,"A doubled pawn is not a problem in this position, even if he cramps me a little."
8,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bqkb1r/p1pnpppp/1p1p1n2/6B1/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 2 5,The bishop has to go to b7 anyway.
9,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkb1r/p1pnpppp/1p1p1n2/1B4B1/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 3 5,Foreseen.
10,Bb7,c8b7,r2qkb1r/pbpnpppp/1p1p1n2/1B4B1/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 4 6,Now I threaten c6. He can take the knight and the other one and double my pawns... so what?
11,Bxf6,g5f6,r2qkb1r/pbpnpppp/1p1p1B2/1B6/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 0 6,"Good move, in order to control my bishop. Ok. But..."

15,Bd3,b5d3,r2qkb1r/1bpn1ppp/pp1p1p2/3P4/4P3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 1 8,"Now my knight seems to have a nice post on e5, but I must be careful since it can be kicked away with f4. NxB, under this circumstance, is not a wise move, since the white bishop is still almost useless."
16,g6,g7g6,r2qkb1r/1bpn1p1p/pp1p1pp1/3P4/4P3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 0 9,"...and it will bite on granite. Moreover, I leave room for my dsb to h6. A pretty unusual development scheme."
