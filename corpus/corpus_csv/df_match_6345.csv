1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Just about the most common opening move on GK blitz.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Normally I do not favor e5 and instead go for positional imbalance by counterplay on c5 or e6 for the french defense.
3,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,King's gambit? My opponent seems to favor the lesser played openings as the previous game's opening involved his knight dancing from a6 to recapture c5.
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Trying to throw the d pawn into king's gambit is usually a good idea.
5,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3Pp3/5P2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,Fearing Nc3 with a gained tempo after Qxd5 I took the f pawn instead hoping to squeeze pressure on to his king.
6,exf4,e5f4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3P4/5p2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Fearing Nc3 with a gained tempo after Qxd5 I took the f pawn instead hoping to squeeze pressure on to his king.
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3P4/5p2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,Just about forced. Qh4+ is ugly without Nf3.
8,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3P4/5pb1/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,The position becomes more imbalanced after 5. ... Bxf3 6. Qxf3 Qh4+
9,Bc4,f1c4,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3P4/2B2pb1/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 5,The position becomes more imbalanced after 5. ... Bxf3 6. Qxf3 Qh4+
10,Nd7,b8d7,r2qkbnr/pppn1ppp/8/3P4/2B2pb1/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 6,The position becomes more imbalanced after 5. ... Bxf3 6. Qxf3 Qh4+
11,Nc3,b1c3,r2qkbnr/pppn1ppp/8/3P4/2B2pb1/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 5 6,Impeding the threat of Qh4+
12,Ngf6,g8f6,r2qkb1r/pppn1ppp/5n2/3P4/2B2pb1/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 6 7,Impeding the threat of Qh4+
13,O-O,e1g1,r2qkb1r/pppn1ppp/5n2/3P4/2B2pb1/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 7 7,"Here's a curious moment, the d5 pawn is not particularly strong although it has potential if it survives and my f4 pawn is just waiting to get picked off. Development is about even."
14,Be7,f8e7,r2qk2r/pppnbppp/5n2/3P4/2B2pb1/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 8 8,Bc5+ loses a tempo to d4.
15,d4,d2d4,r2qk2r/pppnbppp/5n2/3P4/2BP1pb1/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,"So far the strategy on both sides has been pretty limited, positionally we are just about equal although I like white's bishop placement better (once his dark bishop is on f4)."
16,O-O,e8g8,r2q1rk1/pppnbppp/5n2/3P4/2BP1pb1/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 9,"So far the strategy on both sides has been pretty limited, positionally we are just about equal although I like white's bishop placement better (once his dark bishop is on f4)."

Unfortunately I didn't realize I was about to lose a pawn and some initiative. The knight cannot stay on d5 as it threatens his dark bishop and looks toward e3.
19,Bxf4,c1f4,r2q1rk1/ppp1bppp/1n3n2/3P4/3P1Bb1/1BN2N2/PPP3PP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 10,I felt okay about this position. Move 25 was coming closer and my position was holding thus far.

26,Bf6,e7f6,r4rk1/ppB2ppp/5b2/3q4/3P2b1/5N2/PPP3PP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 1 14,"Not much apparently, My threats are pretty much non existent and my opponent has a passed pawn which will convert into a win unless something drastic happens. All I want to do is get to move 25..."

28,b5,b7b5,r4rk1/p1B2ppp/5b2/1p1q4/3P2b1/2P2N2/PP4PP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 15,"I'm picking and teasing for some type of initiative, but nothing seems to be really going on. I can't play passively because that passed pawn will cost me the endgame."
29,Qb3,d1b3,r4rk1/p1B2ppp/5b2/1p1q4/3P2b1/1QP2N2/PP4PP/R4RK1 b - - 1 15,Applying pressure to the b pawn as well as threatening an unfavorable queen trade. Right around now my Soviet Russia roots start to show as sometimes you must turn a battle upside-down to avenge a fallen soldier.
30,Qc6,d5c6,r4rk1/p1B2ppp/2q2b2/1p6/3P2b1/1QP2N2/PP4PP/R4RK1 w - - 2 16,"The knight must die, there's no other way around it. Goodbye comrade bishop! Your sacrifice won't be forgotten as long as we win."

35,Qd1,b3d1,r4rk1/p4ppp/2q1b3/1p2B3/3P4/2P5/PP4PP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 2 18,...and the fight for the g file begins...naturally mate tops a pressured pawn.

38,f6,f7f6,r4rk1/p5pp/2q2p2/1p1bB3/3P2Q1/2P5/PP4PP/R4RK1 w - - 0 20,Normally this sort of move might be frowned upon since it exposes my king to check but I felt the need to remove the bishop from his e5 post was worthwhile.
