Ba4 - unlike Paolo in ""An Expert Lesson in K & P Endings"" my opponent does not opt for the Exchange Variation.  He decides to retreat his bishop to a4.  This is thought to be stronger than the Exchange Variation as Lighttotheright explained in my Paolo game."

Qa5?! - looks the best option in the database as a 1700  player drew against a 2000  player with the blacks after playing this move.  The other option Na6 loses according to the database.

My queen could have been transported back to the kingside to have faced the oncoming mating attack - instead I would have needed to teleport her - not possible in chess.  So this will make my later f5 push which may have made sense with Na6 but not in conjunction with this move an absolute, utter disaster."
