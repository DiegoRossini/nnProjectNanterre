I'd like to play c4, but when I do, it gets uncomfortable to have a hole on d3. I've tried that before and haven't been as successful, but maybe I need to look at it again ... play c4 so I can put the knight behind the pawn and then play d3 at some point. It's just that what usually will happen is Black will not trade on d3 -- he'll wait until I trade on e4 and then he can put a knight or something on d3 that a pawn can't chase away."

What do I like about this position?
... - My bishop on b2 is in an influential position, even though it's currently blocked by my knight.
... - I feel like I have lots of potential energy and flexibility in my position. My pawns aren't committed to a specific layout, and my pieces are on good squares, ready to attack either side of the board.
   
What don't I like about my position?
... - his pawn on e4 makes it hard for me to maneuver.
... - if the d-file opens up after a trade, he'll put a rook there, I'll have to move my queen, and he may even double his rooks. That'll be a substantial advantage for him.

I'm threatening to win a pawn by playing Nxe4. He won't be able to take the knight, because I'd play Qxa5 and win his queen. If he takes my queen, I recapture Nxd2 and save my knight. If he retreats, I put the knight back on c3 and g3 and win the pawn.
 
I expect him to guard the queen with b6 or to retreat the queen to b6 or c7. Then I'll trade pawns and play Rad1. By the time he moves his rook to d8, I can play my queen to c1, and he won't control the d-file. And after the center opens up a little, he'll have two pawns (on e4 and c5) that I can target, while mine feel harder for him to attack."

If he doesn't play c4, and I'm thinking he won't because he gives up control in the center, I'll have to decide what to do with the queen.

There are lots of ways to do captures, and if you do it in the wrong order, you lose. Dan Heisman, who's written lots of chess books and has a column on Chess Cafe, describes it as a tactic: Counting. And he also claims that it's the tactic that so often causes you to lose because you don't look far enough ahead or at all of the possible captures to determine if it's safe or not.

Here, I looked a little at Rxd8 to get his rook off of the c-file (I'm afraid that after everything clears, it's going to capture the pawn on c2 and win because of that), but I can't give him the open d-file. That also leads to doom & destruction for me. Qxb7 doesn't work because he just plays Bxc3 and wins a knight. I looked a long time at Na4 to move the knight (that's attacked twice and guarded just once), and it guards the bishop from there. If he plays Bxb2, I recapture with the knight. I have a threat against d8 from my rook. If his bishop goes to f5 to help the rook move to c2, my queen will have a threat against e8. So I was almost ready to play Na4. 
 But you always have to ask: what if he ignores the trade. If he plays b5, then he's attacking my bishop and knight. I pretty much have to play Bxf6, but he recaptures with the knight (Nxf6), and now he's attacking my knight on a4 with a pawn and my queen on e4 with the knight. I can play Qe5 to temporarily pin his pawn, but I don't think this will turn out well. Plus, he can trade pawns and then play Rxc2 and have a win. So maybe the best I can do is play Qe3. If he trades the knight (which he won't), then my pieces start to escape. More likely he adds pressure, but now I can play Na4, and if he plays b5, I can trade bishops and then move the knight -- and he won't be attacking my queen.
 
Now that I've made the move, it suddenly hits me that I didn't consider him playing cxb3. I can't recapture cxb3 because I lose the knight; three pieces attacking it and only two guarding it. I'll have to recapture axb3 and attack his queen, so he can't stop and take my knight. Maybe he'll play Qc7 so he's still attacking it three times. I can rescue the knight with Nb5, attacking his queen, but he plays Qxc2 and wins a pawn. That doesn't look good for me, down a pawn and rapidly coming to the endgame. This isn't looking good for our team. My partner was swept, and it's looking like I'm heading for the wrong side of a sweep, too."

That also leads to doom & destruction for me. Qxb7 doesn't work because he just plays Bxc3 and wins a knight. I looked a long time at Na4 to move the knight (that's attacked twice and guarded just once), and it guards the bishop from there. If he plays Bxb2, I recapture with the knight. I have a threat against d8 from my rook. If his bishop goes to f5 to help the rook move to c2, my queen will have a threat against e8. So I was almost ready to play Na4. 
 But you always have to ask: what if he ignores the trade. If he plays b5, then he's attacking my bishop and knight. I pretty much have to play Bxf6, but he recaptures with the knight (Nxf6), and now he's attacking my knight on a4 with a pawn and my queen on e4 with the knight. I can play Qe5 to temporarily pin his pawn, but I don't think this will turn out well. Plus, he can trade pawns and then play Rxc2 and have a win. So maybe the best I can do is play Qe3. If he trades the knight (which he won't), then my pieces start to escape. More likely he adds pressure, but now I can play Na4, and if he plays b5, I can trade bishops and then move the knight -- and he won't be attacking my queen.
 
Now that I've made the move, it suddenly hits me that I didn't consider him playing cxb3. I can't recapture cxb3 because I lose the knight; three pieces attacking it and only two guarding it. I'll have to recapture axb3 and attack his queen, so he can't stop and take my knight. Maybe he'll play Qc7 so he's still attacking it three times. I can rescue the knight with Nb5, attacking his queen, but he plays Qxc2 and wins a pawn. That doesn't look good for me, down a pawn and rapidly coming to the endgame. This isn't looking good for our team. My partner was swept, and it's looking like I'm heading for the wrong side of a sweep, too."

Here, I looked a little at Rxd8 to get his rook off of the c-file (I'm afraid that after everything clears, it's going to capture the pawn on c2 and win because of that), but I can't give him the open d-file.
