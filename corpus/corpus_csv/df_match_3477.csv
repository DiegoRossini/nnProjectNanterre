1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Arash starts with the queen's pawn opening.
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Queens pawn game.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Queens pawn gambit. A rather safe gambit, in my opinion."
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,I respond with the Queen's gambit declined. I'll also be honest with you here: I don't know anything about openings beyond this move. From here out I'm going with my best judgement.
5,a3,a2a3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/P7/1P2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,My guess is he played this to prevent Bb4.
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/P7/1P2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"""Develop the least developed piece to the best possible square"""
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/P1N5/1P2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 4,He develops his knight as well.
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/3p4/2PP4/P1N5/1P2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 3 5,I develop my second knight.
9,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/3p4/2PP4/P1N2N2/1P2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 4 5,Knights royal!
10,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/2n1pn2/3p4/2PP4/P1N2N2/1P2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 5 6,"I do this to castle, as well as defend against Bg5."
11,Bf4,c1f4,r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/2n1pn2/3p4/2PP1B2/P1N2N2/1P2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 6 6,I'm pretty sure this is a good move...
