1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,So I start with my favourite d pawn opening
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,He suggests he is going into the Indian systems
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,I continue on classical lines
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Aha either a Kings Indian or a Gruenfeld
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,I continue to follow the main line
6,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,So a King's Indian it is then
7,e4,e2e4,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,And I prevent any tranposition to the Gruenfeld
8,d6,d7d6,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,Main line
9,f3,f2f3,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2P2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"And this is the Samisch Variation, which I have played off and on for about 40 years!"
10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2P2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR w KQ - 1 6,The usual continuation
11,Be3,c1e3,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N1BP2/PP4PP/R2QKBNR b KQ - 2 6,"As is this. Black now really has to think about where his counterplay is coming from. White has an imposing centre, if given time to support it."
12,b6,b7b6,rnbq1rk1/p1p1ppbp/1p1p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N1BP2/PP4PP/R2QKBNR w KQ - 0 7,"This is unusual. c5, e5 or Nc6 are the most commonly played moves here."
13,Bd3,f1d3,rnbq1rk1/p1p1ppbp/1p1p1np1/8/2PPP3/2NBBP2/PP4PP/R2QK1NR b KQ - 1 7,So I continue my development.
14,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bq1rk1/p1pnppbp/1p1p1np1/8/2PPP3/2NBBP2/PP4PP/R2QK1NR w KQ - 2 8,I was rather expecting Bb7 or a6 after his last move.
15,Nge2,g1e2,r1bq1rk1/p1pnppbp/1p1p1np1/8/2PPP3/2NBBP2/PP2N1PP/R2QK2R b KQ - 3 8,And I continue to develop
16,c6,c7c6,r1bq1rk1/p2nppbp/1ppp1np1/8/2PPP3/2NBBP2/PP2N1PP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 9,This really doesn't fit in with the other moves he has been playing. Surely c5 or Bb7 is more consistent. c5 is actually the only move in the World database and it scores well for black! Bb7 is in the Gameknot Database. Black isn't really challenging the white centre.
17,Qd2,d1d2,r1bq1rk1/p2nppbp/1ppp1np1/8/2PPP3/2NBBP2/PP1QN1PP/R3K2R b KQ - 1 9,With a view maybe of a king's side attack and queen side castling.
18,Re8,f8e8,r1bqr1k1/p2nppbp/1ppp1np1/8/2PPP3/2NBBP2/PP1QN1PP/R3K2R w KQ - 2 10,Black continues with non-challenging moves. Is the rook any better on e8 rather than f8? Maybe and maybe not.
19,O-O-O,e1c1,r1bqr1k1/p2nppbp/1ppp1np1/8/2PPP3/2NBBP2/PP1QN1PP/2KR3R b - - 3 10,I thought that he has wasted so many moves I may as well go for his king.
20,e5,e7e5,r1bqr1k1/p2n1pbp/1ppp1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2NBBP2/PP1QN1PP/2KR3R w - - 0 11,Finally breaking in the centre
