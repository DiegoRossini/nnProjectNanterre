1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"A recent memorable game against a favorite opponent. Bunny obviously heavily favored to win, looking at rating (although we are 2-2 lifetime going into this game)."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"My first mistake... As white I love playing the opening 1. d4 d5, 2. e4 c5 (little-known fact: this is actually the official opening of my team, the Pawn Stars)so my only guess is here I was laboring under two misconceptions: (1) I'm not playing white, (2) opening was king's pawn not queen's pawn. Oops."

5,exf5,e4f5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pP2/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,Somehow this is not what I was expecting to see...

8,Bxf5,c8f5,rn1qkbnr/ppp3pp/8/3pPb2/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"Second real mistake, letting my knight get skewered against my queen."

14,Qd5,d8d5,rn2kb1r/ppp1n1pp/8/3qPBB1/3p4/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 1 8,"Here my priority is to release the skewer on the knight, but this will shortly turn out to be not such a bad move for other reasons."
15,Qh5+,d1h5,rn2kb1r/ppp1n1pp/8/3qPBBQ/3p4/8/PPP2PPP/RN2K1NR b KQkq - 2 8,So much for my removing the skewer... now it's a genuine pin. Didn't have a lot of other options though. This is really not how I wanted the board to look at this point.

At this point the rook at h1 is doomed, and there's not a whole lot white can do about it. Some responses are better than others, though."
