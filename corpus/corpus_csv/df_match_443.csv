1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The winner of the game of the season winter 2015/2016 for the ""Sixth Sense"" team is Nairobigal. I am annotating it at the request of the lovely elenapetrova - I never can resist her when she asks me to do something!"
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,So it starts as a Sicilian Defence.
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,White appears to be heading for a closed variation.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,Black does the same developing move.
5,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 3,White gets her other knight out.
6,d6,d7d6,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"It is wise to play this before Nf6, otherwise black may be faced with e4-e5."
7,a3,a2a3,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/2p5/4P3/P1N2N2/1PPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"This is a very unusual move, but not completely unheard of."
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/2p5/4P3/P1N2N2/1PPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,Black wisely continues to develop.
9,b4,b2b4,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/2p5/1P2P3/P1N2N2/2PP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"This is a rather unusual pawn sacrifice - again, not completely unheard of. White sacrifices a pawn to open up files on the queen side and to lure balck's c pawn away from the centre. It does have some similarities with the Benko Gambit. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benko_Gambit"
10,cxb4,c5b4,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/8/1p2P3/P1N2N2/2PP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,So black takes.
11,axb4,a3b4,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/8/1P2P3/2N2N2/2PP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,White takes back.
12,Nxb4,c6b4,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/1n2P3/2N2N2/2PP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,and now black accepts the pawn gambit.
13,h4,h2h4,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/1n2P2P/2N2N2/2PP1PP1/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"This is just a complete beginners move and carries no merit. White wins despite this move, not because of it. Sometimes this thrust is justified, if black has played g7-g6, but as black hasn't played that move, this is just a random thrust on the king side. White could, and should, have taken the centre with d2-d4 as in another game with this variation, which ended in a draw,- 7. d4 Qc7 8. Bb2 Nxe4 9. Nxe4 Nxc2+ 10. Kd2 Nxa1 11. Qxa1 Bf5 12.

14,e5,e7e5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/3p1n2/4p3/1n2P2P/2N2N2/2PP1PP1/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,Black wisely grabs some central control.
15,g3,g2g3,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/3p1n2/4p3/1n2P2P/2N2NP1/2PP1P2/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,I'm not sure of the reason for this move - maybe to give some protection to the pawn on h4? Maybe to develop the Bf1 to g2 or h3? c4 is also a good square to place the Bf1.
16,b6,b7b6,r1bqkb1r/p4ppp/1p1p1n2/4p3/1n2P2P/2N2NP1/2PP1P2/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 9,This is also a waste of time.Bg4 looks best.
17,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkb1r/p4ppp/1p1p1n2/4p3/1nB1P2P/2N2NP1/2PP1P2/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 9,Bishop moves to an attacking square.
18,h6,h7h6,r1bqkb1r/p4pp1/1p1p1n1p/4p3/1nB1P2P/2N2NP1/2PP1P2/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 10,Another complete waste of time when black should be getting his pieces out.
19,h5,h4h5,r1bqkb1r/p4pp1/1p1p1n1p/4p2P/1nB1P3/2N2NP1/2PP1P2/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 10,This pawn thrust doesn't seem to achieve much.
20,Bg4,c8g4,r2qkb1r/p4pp1/1p1p1n1p/4p2P/1nB1P1b1/2N2NP1/2PP1P2/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 11,Black finally develops a piece! Well done!
