For example, if the king was trapped on the a-file, then the bishop would be strongest on the d-file. If the king was trapped on the 1st rank, then the bishop is strongest on the 4th rank.

Ra6  allows Kf5, reaching the key position where White cannot effectively stop Rh8#.
Rf3  allows Kg5, where White still cannot effectively stop Rh8#
Ra7 allows Kf5, where Black reaches the key position, and I'll explain the winning process later, when Black forces White into the key position. White can still stall Black's win for longer with the move played, since 43.Rf2  is threatened if 43...Kf5 is played, drawing the game since Black's formation is disrupted."
