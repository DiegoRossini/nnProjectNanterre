1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The following game was my first round game of the 38th Southern Congress (U1600). This is the second year I have played in this tournament, and I have nothing but good memories from my experiences at the Atlanta Chess Center. As I have the white pieces in round one, I open with my standard 1. d4."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,Along with 1...d5 the most popular and solid response to a queen's pawn opening.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 2,"I have developed a taste for this move at this point. As a 1. d4 player, I am quite accustomed to reaching most of the standard QGA and QGD positions, and like to develop with a protective move such as this early because I am more than willing to play Qa4  should the need arise to regain the gambit c pawn after 2...d5 3. c4 dxc, and having the Nf3 squelches black ideas of play on my d pawn."
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"My opponent opts for a King's Indian set up. I can bet with some degree of certainty that his next 3 moves will be Bb7, 0-0, and d6."
5,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,Natural. White lays a claim on d5 while clearing c3 for the Nb1.
6,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,"For black, the dark squared bishop is one of the most powerful elements of the KID, and it's natural home is on the long diagonal."
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,"As black is giving me all the time in the world to load up in the center, I do so. The main danger for white is that black is preparing a very potent counterpunch once the opening phase ends, as the KID is a very versatile defense (Fischer used it a LOT)."
8,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 3 5,"Black secures his king rapidly, and prepares to develop his queenside."
9,e4,e2e4,rnbq1rk1/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQ - 0 5,"Staying with the ""book"" I continue to exert influence in the center with strong developing moves."
10,d6,d7d6,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 0 6,"Black has a ""book"" as well, and clears a line for his Bc8 while setting up a solid defensive position in the center. This whole opening so far is the classical line of the King's Indian Defense."
11,Be2,f1e2,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 1 6,"Standard play by white as well. Both sides now have excellent chances of reaching the middlegame fully developed, castled, and with fighting chances."
12,Re8,f8e8,rnbqr1k1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 2 7,"?! Black takes the first step off of the page by making this move. 6...e5 is the classical continuation. I suppose he was anticipating a big blast through the center, and wanted to support it."
13,O-O,e1g1,rnbqr1k1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 3 7,Sticking with the classical plan.
14,a6,a7a6,rnbqr1k1/1pp1ppbp/p2p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 8,? This move totally lost me. I have no idea what my opponent was trying to accomplish here. I was sure he would have played e5 here. I consider this move a tempo loser.
15,h3,h2h3,rnbqr1k1/1pp1ppbp/p2p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N1P/PP2BPP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 8,"I felt that since I had the free tempo I would restrict my opponent's light squared bishop, thereby keeping my Nf3 free to explore."
16,Bd7,c8d7,rn1qr1k1/1ppbppbp/p2p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N1P/PP2BPP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 9,Black again declines playing e5. I'm beginning to wonder if he is some sort of KID genius and I'm severely overestimating my position. I realize that at this point that if I can push d5 should he ever play e5 I will have severley crippled his developing chances.
17,Be3,c1e3,rn1qr1k1/1ppbppbp/p2p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N1BN1P/PP2BPP1/R2Q1RK1 b - - 2 9,Last piece developed.
18,e5,e7e5,rn1qr1k1/1ppb1pbp/p2p1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2N1BN1P/PP2BPP1/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 10,Black finally puts a move on the center. The delay in playing this move is about to get punished however.
19,d5,d4d5,rn1qr1k1/1ppb1pbp/p2p1np1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N1BN1P/PP2BPP1/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 10,"Taking c6 away from black's Nb8, freeing up a lane for my Be3, and weakening my opponent's strong Bg7. A very multi-purpose move."
20,Nh5,f6h5,rn1qr1k1/1ppb1pbp/p2p2p1/3Pp2n/2P1P3/2N1BN1P/PP2BPP1/R2Q1RK1 w - - 1 11,I guess black was hoping to launch f5 or perhaps play Nf4.
