It put's blacks bishop on one of two largest diagonals on the board and is excellent at indirect attacks.  Here, I would have moved 7 . . . Nf6 to develop the kingside with a goal of castling"

Bg7, then 11 . . . 0-0.  The placement of this pawn allows my bishop on f4 to move to g4 and attack black's knight on f6.  If you were dead set on moving this pawn, perhaps it would have been better to move 9 . . . h6 to prevent my black bishop the oppurtunity of occupying the g5 square."

29,Be4,d3e4,3qkb2/r3pp2/pnp4p/7P/3PB1b1/2N1PN2/PP3PP1/R2Q1RK1 b - - 2 15,"A better move would have been 15 . . . Bxh5 - (if white's bishop had not been on e4), but this is not a bad move as it threatens my pawn on b2.  Of course to avoid this, I can either develop my queen by moving her to either e2 or c2; or I can threaten black's knight by moving my queen to b3, and at the same time guard my b2 pawn.  

However, if I move my queen to b3, black could move 16 . . . Bxf3!, (also assuming white's bishop was not on e4.)  But it is.  If I retake with either my bishop or pawn, black could move 17 . . . Nd2.  This would fork white's queen, rook, and bishop.  This would help, as a for simply material value is worth, a rook is worth five points, and a knight is worth 3.

In addition, instead of guarding black's pawn on c6, black moved his knight.  This allows for me to capture the pawn and place black in check."

However, if black retakes with the rook, white will win a pawn on a6.  Tough decision. . . neither seems good."
