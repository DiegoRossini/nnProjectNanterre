Not that my positions suck but more that im not verry known with this lines. That doesnt say that SPCMN took it wrong but it tells me more that i need to analyze this opening better. In my answere u will be seeing why."

I know that it is allowed on gameknot to do, but i dont want to learn it that way. I play the game, and after the game i analyze it.. The computers tells you at this point that Bc5 is a weak move. More like it was Be7"

I still did it, more with the feeling that if i cant with even pawns i definetly cant win with one pawn less. After it i didnt liked my move and i did realise it was weak."

22,Ba7,c5a7,r1b1k2r/bpp1qppp/p4n2/8/1PPp4/P4PP1/3N1PBP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 1 12,I do believe that c5 isn't the strongest move here.. Re1 looks much stronger to me. The only way to avoid exchanging my queen for his rook is to play Be6. Be6 is standing there without any further meaning just a stubborn block to avoid losing the queen. Black also gets in a problem when white decides to move up the f pawn after.. Imagine a pawn on the square f5 and black is in serious problems
