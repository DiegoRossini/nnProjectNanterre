4,exf4,e5f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Black advances g5, which can lead to the ""Muzio"" opening.  It is a favourite opening of mine, but is rarely offered by opposition."
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"Black advances g5, which can lead to the ""Muzio"" opening.  It is a favourite opening of mine, but is rarely offered by opposition."

7,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/6p1/2B1Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"Bring out the bishop, allowing 0-0"
8,g4,g5g4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/8/2B1Ppp1/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,0-0.  Offering the Knight in exchange for position.
9,O-O,e1g1,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/8/2B1Ppp1/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 5,0-0.  Offering the Knight in exchange for position.
10,gxf3,g4f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/8/2B1Pp2/5p2/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 6,"Black accepts the Muzio.  I have played games at this point where black refuses the Muzio, preferring to keep a double pawn advancement."
11,Qxf3,d1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/8/2B1Pp2/5Q2/PPPP2PP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 0 6,"Take some time to observe this position.  Once the D pawn is advanced, the F4 will be won.  This gives 3 pronged power attack on black's isolated F7, and threatens mate.  
The object of Muzio (in my mind anyhow) is to keep this constant pressure on black.  Players <1700 will typically make a mistake under this constant pressure.  Most players >1700 will be familiar with the opening, and will defend it better.."
12,Qf6,d8f6,rnb1kbnr/pppp1p1p/5q2/8/2B1Pp2/5Q2/PPPP2PP/RNB2RK1 w kq - 1 7,"QF6 is highly unusual.  More normal is B-c5 , bringing out a major and 'buying' another turn to bring out the next major  (white normal response would be Kh1)"
13,e5,e4e5,rnb1kbnr/pppp1p1p/5q2/4P3/2B2p2/5Q2/PPPP2PP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 0 7,"The object of this is 2 fold to avoid the Bishop coming out... again, losing a piece in exchange for tempo.  And to cave the way for the next move.."
14,Qxe5,f6e5,rnb1kbnr/pppp1p1p/8/4q3/2B2p2/5Q2/PPPP2PP/RNB2RK1 w kq - 0 8,"Now this is drawing the King out, forfeiting the castling right.  Obviously white is significantly down on pieces right now."
15,Bxf7+,c4f7,rnb1kbnr/pppp1B1p/8/4q3/5p2/5Q2/PPPP2PP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 0 8,"Now this is drawing the King out, forfeiting the castling right.  Obviously white is significantly down on pieces right now."
16,Kxf7,e8f7,rnb2bnr/pppp1k1p/8/4q3/5p2/5Q2/PPPP2PP/RNB2RK1 w - - 0 9,"This move is buying tempo.  Sacrifice a pawn, but it avoids the Bc5  which is bring out a major.  This opens up c1x f4.  So far we still have the R-Q line on F threatening the King.  Black will have to scurry back soon.
Obviously, this buying temp can't continue forever.  White is running out of pieces."

18,Qxd4+,e5d4,rnb2bnr/pppp1k1p/8/8/3q1p2/5Q2/PPP3PP/RNB2RK1 w - - 0 10,"White has a major piece disadvantage, but a huge positional advantage.  The challenge for white is to keep constant pressure on the king.  Absolutely constant - like you were doing one of those chess puzzles in the newspaper.  Black obviously hopes to win another piece, then it is over.
This position was first seen in Shirov v Lapinski in 1990."

20,Qg7,d4g7,rnb2bnr/pppp1kqp/8/8/5p2/4BQ2/PPP3PP/RN3RK1 w - - 2 11,"Black had a lot of choices, and tempting would have been Qxb2 apparently winning the rook.  If you play that out, QxF4  will soon result in mate, or Kg7 resulting in white winning the black queen."
21,Bxf4,e3f4,rnb2bnr/pppp1kqp/8/8/5B2/5Q2/PPP3PP/RN3RK1 b - - 0 11,For me it is important to take with the bishop and not with the queen.  This point allows Be5 (  !_) and potentially winning a queen or rook.
22,Nf6,g8f6,rnb2b1r/pppp1kqp/5n2/8/5B2/5Q2/PPP3PP/RN3RK1 w - - 1 12,"Black notices the threat, and covers his King."
23,Bxc7,f4c7,rnb2b1r/ppBp1kqp/5n2/8/8/5Q2/PPP3PP/RN3RK1 b - - 0 12,"I chose BxP here, because I felt that Be5 would result in Be7 and then the game would be locked.  Also I needed to start winning back a few pieces."
24,Nc6,b8c6,r1b2b1r/ppBp1kqp/2n2n2/8/8/5Q2/PPP3PP/RN3RK1 w - - 1 13,"If I were black, I would have played Bc5 , and then Nc6."
25,Nc3,b1c3,r1b2b1r/ppBp1kqp/2n2n2/8/8/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/R4RK1 b - - 2 13,In Muzio it is essential to bring out the knight.  this applies whether you play standard Muzio or so called double Muzio.
26,Bc5+,f8c5,r1b4r/ppBp1kqp/2n2n2/2b5/8/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/R4RK1 w - - 3 14,Finally!
27,Kh1,g1h1,r1b4r/ppBp1kqp/2n2n2/2b5/8/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/R4R1K b - - 4 14,This is a good move by black.  The bishop is now locked in and threatened.
28,d6,d7d6,r1b4r/ppB2kqp/2np1n2/2b5/8/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/R4R1K w - - 0 15,This is a good move by black.  The bishop is now locked in and threatened.
29,Rae1,a1e1,r1b4r/ppB2kqp/2np1n2/2b5/8/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/4RR1K b - - 1 15,I did this in anticipaton of Bg4.
