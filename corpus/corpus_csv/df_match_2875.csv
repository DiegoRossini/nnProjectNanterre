1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The game will start very basic, the moves are the most common moves on the chess game database."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,standard
3,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,This is my usual game opening with white though I'm thinking of playing  1d4 some more because I'm not known to that opening.
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 3,still standard.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 3 3,This is pretty standard. Black could play Nxe4 here. The most standard move is Bc5 here. H6 is possible too.
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 4 4,This is pretty standard. Black could play Nxe4 here. The most standard move is Bc5 here. H6 is possible too.
7,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 5 4,This is pretty standard. Black could play Nxe4 here. The most standard move is Bc5 here. H6 is possible too.
8,d6,d7d6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"This move isn't really standard, but it's not really that bad. However after Ng5 black should play d5, so this may be counted as losing a tempo."
9,Ng5,f3g5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4p1N1/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,Here I go trying to get some fun. d5 is pretty standard here but black had a surprising move that lost immediately.
10,Ng4,f6g4,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p1N1/2B1P1n1/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 6,"This move looks ok, but it is not! Nxf7 looks good, probably Qf6 will follow and there will probably be some material loss for black. However there is a better move."
11,Bxf7+,c4f7,r1bqkb1r/ppp2Bpp/2np4/4p1N1/4P1n1/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,Bxf7+ this will go into a forced mate!
12,Ke7,e8e7,r1bq1b1r/ppp1kBpp/2np4/4p1N1/4P1n1/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 1 7,The player probably thought kd7 would lose the knight. However he is in a worse situation right now.
13,Nd5+,c3d5,r1bq1b1r/ppp1kBpp/2np4/3Np1N1/4P1n1/8/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 2 7,check. Only space is d7.
14,Kd7,e7d7,r1bq1b1r/pppk1Bpp/2np4/3Np1N1/4P1n1/8/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 3 8,And so this will result in
15,Qxg4#,d1g4,r1bq1b1r/pppk1Bpp/2np4/3Np1N1/4P1Q1/8/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 0 8,checkmate in 8. I was happy I saw it.
