1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"My first Walk the Walk and Learn to Run annotation... 
I started this annotation at least 3 earlier times and became discouraged during the process. I came back to it again, because it was my first game challenging one who plays in the celestial regions of the game and an obligation to fulfill the Walk the Walk annotation. The early part of the game was much fun but then it spiraled away from me...I must admit that after this game I have made a conscious effort to change some of the ways I approach my game. 

( I slide into my chair from the right and not the left )  ............. :)"
