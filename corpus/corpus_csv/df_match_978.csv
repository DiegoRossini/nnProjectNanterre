1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Evening all! i was hesitating to call this game ""3rd time is a charm"" as this is the third game vs this opponent. I give alot of respect to my opponent. He beat me fair and square in game 1, and in game 2 i got cheeky and tried a bishop sac and he made me pay and i couldnt take advantage of it in the end, making him up 2 nil."
2,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,i guess my opponent enjoys playing against me as i do enjoy playing against him. after this game he sent another challenge and we are currently playing a 4th. who knows how long this series could potentially go.
3,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"and let the games begin.  the most aggressive reply against the nimzowitsch. As for me, this game i cant screw around.  im going with what i'm comfortable with."
4,d5,d7d5,r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,natural replies ensue

6,Bf5,c8f5,r2qkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3pPb2/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,tock
7,Bb5,f1b5,r2qkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/1B1pPb2/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 4,like
8,e6,e7e6,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/1B1pPb2/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,clock
9,Nf3,g1f3,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/1B1pPb2/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,work!
10,f6,f7f6,r2qkbnr/ppp3pp/2n1pp2/1B1pPb2/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"and here i decided im taking the fight to him. im comfortable enough in my opening to go at it aggressively. and i like to invite the double pawn in the c file to take off his LSB in simple fashion.

usually id maybe aim to either kick the bishop with a5 to force him off right away. or reinforce e7 with my gknight.

but this game is a 3rd rematch dont want to get fancy."
11,Nh4,f3h4,r2qkbnr/ppp3pp/2n1pp2/1B1pPb2/3P3N/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,anticipated reply and i was expecting the queen to possibly come down next which often gets triggered when playing the f pawn.
12,fxe5,f6e5,r2qkbnr/ppp3pp/2n1p3/1B1ppb2/3P3N/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,and so onwards with the plan. clearing of the middle to help DSB movement. open a file for when i will king side castle.
13,Nxf5,h4f5,r2qkbnr/ppp3pp/2n1p3/1B1ppN2/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,hmm takes the bishop right away. i guess he knew better than to come down with his queen right away.
14,exf5,e6f5,r2qkbnr/ppp3pp/2n5/1B1ppp2/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"i didnt think his pawn was bothersome yet, nor did i feel like my pawns had become unconnected in anyway.  this puts pressure on his f pawn with future play possibly with my queen"
15,dxe5,d4e5,r2qkbnr/ppp3pp/2n5/1B1pPp2/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,"i didnt think his pawn was bothersome yet, nor did i feel like my pawns had become unconnected in anyway.  this puts pressure on his f pawn with future play possibly with my queen"
16,Bc5,f8c5,r2qk1nr/ppp3pp/2n5/1BbpPp2/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 9,"i didnt think his pawn was bothersome yet, nor did i feel like my pawns had become unconnected in anyway.  this puts pressure on his f pawn with future play possibly with my queen"
17,Nc3,b1c3,r2qk1nr/ppp3pp/2n5/1BbpPp2/8/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 9,more development + pressure on d pawn
18,Nge7,g8e7,r2qk2r/ppp1n1pp/2n5/1BbpPp2/8/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 3 10,i guess it invites development for me too and ne7 is very friendly in the nimzowitsch opening
19,Bg5,c1g5,r2qk2r/ppp1n1pp/2n5/1BbpPpB1/8/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 4 10,i dont face this pin very often but i am aware of it
20,O-O,e8g8,r2q1rk1/ppp1n1pp/2n5/1BbpPpB1/8/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 5 11,"playing queen d7 is also playable i believe. this castle invites alot of exchanges though. as whites pieces are all aiming different targets while all mine have good proximity/synergy, and if white doesnt start attacking very soon itll give me the chance to be the aggressor."
21,Nxd5,c3d5,r2q1rk1/ppp1n1pp/2n5/1BbNPpB1/8/8/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 11,charge! my opponent says.
22,Nxe5,c6e5,r2q1rk1/ppp1n1pp/8/1BbNnpB1/8/8/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 12,i replied in kind by also removing his bothersome middle pawn
