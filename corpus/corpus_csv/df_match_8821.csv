1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Another loss to easy. Here I have a decent game up to my 17th move.  At that point, I overestimate what the open lines will do for White and Black respectively. Followed by some other blunders, after which White resigns on move 29."
