At my level, I disagree that this was a mistake, and I actually think that this was one of my pivotal moves.  The computer analysis shows that the best response to b6 is qb5+.  However, that doesn't give white any obvious gain (Bd7 response), so few players at my level would choose that.

I like my move and would use it again because of the powerful threats against white's queen and knight (which I eventually took).  I thought that white would likely retreat, and I would move pxc5.  Instead, white fell for the bait.  That put me at -2, but I quickly responded by taking white's knight and pawn and pinning white's king and a1 rook for the entire rest of the game."
