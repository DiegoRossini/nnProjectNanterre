1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Rather a boring opening in my opinion.
2,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Now black is making it more interresting
3,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/4Pp2/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Nope! White doesn't like the idea of the swap
4,f4,f5f4,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/4P3/5p2/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,What is this? Pawn domination?
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/4P3/3P1p2/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,It seems so
6,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1pp1pp/8/2p1P3/3P1p2/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Black tries again
7,d5,d4d5,rnbqkbnr/pp1pp1pp/8/2pPP3/5p2/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,White still doesn't agree
8,g5,g7g5,rnbqkbnr/pp1pp2p/8/2pPP1p1/5p2/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"Ah, I think black realised that white's bishop was threatening its pawn! But was that the best idea?????!!!!!!!!!!"
9,Qh5+,d1h5,rnbqkbnr/pp1pp2p/8/2pPP1pQ/5p2/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 1 5,"Ha Ha Ha, that was sneaky but obviously successful!!! Lucky old white!"
