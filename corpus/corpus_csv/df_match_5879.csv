1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,My opponent starts with Reti's move
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,"I play a common reply. Afterwards on the databases I found that Nf6 is actually more popular, although d5 scores better."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,"Reti used to continue with c4. g3 is the most common move here, d4 is second, followed by c4"
4,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"This looked the most aggressive, the best chance to seize the initiative. Nf6, c6 and e6 are all more common."
5,c3,c2c3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/3P4/2P2N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,This seemed to me to be a passive reply. Afterwards I found that c4 and e3 are more popular and score better.
6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2pp4/3P4/2P2N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"This seemed best, I didn't like the idea of him taking on c5 and following up with b4."
7,g3,g2g3,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2pp4/3P4/2P2NP1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"This again is rather passive. Bf4, e3 and Bg5 are more popular, and in my view, better."
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2pp4/3P4/2P2NP1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"I thought it logical to bring out this knight, although Nf6 is slightly more popular."
9,Bg2,f1g2,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2pp4/3P4/2P2NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 5,The logical follow-up to his last move.
10,Bd6,f8d6,r1bqk1nr/pp3ppp/2nbp3/2pp4/3P4/2P2NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 3 6,"I decided to delay the development of this bishop, I was dreaming of maybe playing Ne7, 0-0, f6 and e5."
11,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk1nr/pp3ppp/2nbp3/2pp4/3P4/2P2NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 4 6,Again logical development by white
12,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2nbpn2/2pp4/3P4/2P2NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 5 7,"I wish I had had the courage to continue with my plan. There are two games on the database with this, both black wins! At the time I was worried about white getting in an early e4"
13,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2nbpn2/2pp2B1/3P4/2P2NP1/PP2PPBP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 6 7,So white pins the knight
14,h6,h7h6,r1bqk2r/pp3pp1/2nbpn1p/2pp2B1/3P4/2P2NP1/PP2PPBP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 0 8,Black attacks the bishop
15,Bxf6,g5f6,r1bqk2r/pp3pp1/2nbpB1p/2pp4/3P4/2P2NP1/PP2PPBP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 0 8,"of course retreat to h4 loses a piece to g5, so exchanging is more or less forced, although on the database there are a few games where white retreated the bishop to c1, d2 or f4."
16,Qxf6,d8f6,r1b1k2r/pp3pp1/2nbpq1p/2pp4/3P4/2P2NP1/PP2PPBP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 0 9,Black cannot allow his pawns to become weaker.
17,Nbd2,b1d2,r1b1k2r/pp3pp1/2nbpq1p/2pp4/3P4/2P2NP1/PP1NPPBP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 1 9,White makes a blunder that drops a pawn
18,cxd4,c5d4,r1b1k2r/pp3pp1/2nbpq1p/3p4/3p4/2P2NP1/PP1NPPBP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 10,"So I take it! Now 10. cxd4 Nxd4 11. Qa4+ Nc6 12. e4 O-O 13. exd5 exd5 14. Qb3 Be6 15. Qxb7 Rfc8 16. Rac1 Rab8 17. Qa6 Rb6 18. Qa4 Qxb2 19. Rc2 Qb4 20. Qxb4 Nxb4 21. Rxc8+ Bxc8 22. Re1 Bb7 23. Nb3 Nxa2 24. Na5 Bc6 25. Nd4 Nc3 26. Bf3 Rb2 27. h4 Bb5 28. Re8+ Kh7 29. Ndc6 Bc5 30. h5 Rd2 31. Bg4 Bd4 32. Bf5+ g6 33. hxg6+ fxg6 34. Re7+ Bg7 35. Be6 Ne4 36. f4 Nxg3 37. Ne5 Bf1 38. Bxd5 Rxd5 39. Kf2 Nf5 40. Rxa7 Bb5 41. Ng4 Rd7 0-1 was Campos Alexandr… (2114) vs. Oliveira Jeffer… (2289). My opponent finds an improvement, which takes us out of the databases."
19,c4,c3c4,r1b1k2r/pp3pp1/2nbpq1p/3p4/2Pp4/5NP1/PP1NPPBP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 10,Much better than meekly losing a pawn.
20,dxc4,d5c4,r1b1k2r/pp3pp1/2nbpq1p/8/2pp4/5NP1/PP1NPPBP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 11,I can't allow my d pawns to become doubled.
