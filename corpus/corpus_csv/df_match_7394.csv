15,f4,f2f4,rnbqkb1r/5ppp/p2ppn2/1p6/3NPP2/1BN5/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,But this is a bit unusual. White avoids the main lines but retains the chance of introducing complications.
16,Bb7,c8b7,rn1qkb1r/1b3ppp/p2ppn2/1p6/3NPP2/1BN5/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 9,"Almost certainly best: The bishop takes to the powerful diagonal. I've had this position as White quite a few times and never lost - honest. If you like a position - or are interested in it - then the chances are that you'll play reasonably well in it.

Things can turn nasty quite quickly- which is good if you like tactical chess. Consider what can follow  the provocative 8...b4 -

Kraiouchkine - Yanayt [2081 v 2287]; USA; 2009]  continued 8...b4 9.Na4 Nxe4 10. O-O d5 11.f5  Be7 12.fxe6 fxe6 13.Nxe6 Bxe6 14.Qh5+ g6 15.Qe5 Kd7 16.Bxd5 and White won quickly.

The same basic tactics were seen in Malik - Luch [2240 v 2364]; Czech Rep' 2004] 8...b4 9.Na4 Nxe4 10.O-O Bb7 11.f5 e5 12.Ne6 fxe6 13.Qh5 Kd7 14.fxe6+ Kc8 15.Be3 which ended as a draw. These disruptive sacrifices can be very difficult to defend against."
17,e5,e4e5,rn1qkb1r/1b3ppp/p2ppn2/1p2P3/3N1P2/1BN5/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 9,This has surprised some opponents in tournament chess: since the b7 bishop is now permitted to slice right across the entire board. Yet Black must be careful here.
18,Nfd7,f6d7,rn1qkb1r/1b1n1ppp/p2pp3/1p2P3/3N1P2/1BN5/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 10,"Normally, Black simply plays 9...dxe5 and only after after 10.fxe5 does he retreat the knight with hopes of capturing the e-pawn at some later point.
I considered castling here in the hope that, once Black trades pawns in the centre, the game would transpose back to the more usual continuation. 

After 10.O-O dxe5 11.fxe5 White is eyeing the two squares, e6 and f7. A rook sac on f7 can occur in some lines and can lead to great complications."

20,dxe5,d6e5,rn1qkb1r/1b1n1ppp/p3p3/1p2p3/3N1P2/1BN1B3/PPP3PP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 11,"As suspected - up to no good. Well, it was invited. Things could  get very interesting. 

I have my doubts if White can afford to play 12.Kd2 [hoping for ...Bxh1 13.Qxh1 with some compensation] because Black might instead play 12...b4 13.Na4 Nxe5 and Black is surely better.

In any event, the text move 12.Rg1 must be better: It introduces another piece into the mix without the need for further speculation."

Nominally, Black will have plenty of pawns for the piece he is about to lose. But material is no longer the problem. I think best - and probably what Black would have played nine times out of ten - was simply 13...Bb7. 

After the likely continuation 14.Qe2 b4 15.Na4 Nxe5 16.Nb6 Ra7 17.Rad1 I quite like White's attacking potential - but it is hardly yet a 'won game'."
