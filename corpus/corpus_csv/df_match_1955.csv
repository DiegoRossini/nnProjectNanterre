What was burned in my mind was the exchange of kxc4 exacting my revenge, black knight kxc4 in retribution, and I'm screwed since the black queen would get the last word and be in troublesome position for me.

I moved the rook here to prevent the Black queen from getting the last word and capturing on b2 after the exchanges on c4, but forgot to notice White LSBxc6+, and a pawn recapture here means black is in for some punishment after the white queen x again on c6+ forking the rook on a8. Ah well. 

Instead, the situation simply became more entrenched"

Basically I've caused more harm than good by now and am hoping for something to materialize. That black knight on b6 is really starting to earn it's weight in gold at this point. I *am*, however, happy about this semi-open f file since there are no queens and black has no DSB. I'm hoping I can leverage this in the future (foreshadowing)."
