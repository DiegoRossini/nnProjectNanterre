1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,My traditional opening.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I was expecting 1. e5. He played this instead. It's not usually a move I encounter, but doing things different can be advantageous."
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,A move I almost always make.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,A move I almost always make.
5,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/1Bp5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 3 3,A move I almost always make.
6,Nd4,c6d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/1Bp5/3nP3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 4 4,"Again, something I usually don't encounter, but he does put pressure on the bishop."
7,Bd3,b5d3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3nP3/2NB4/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 5 4,I decide to get it out of there.

9,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/3nP3/2NB1N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,Putting pressure on the knight.
10,Bg4,c8g4,r2qkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/3nP1b1/2NB1N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 6,"He responds by putting big pressure on my f3 knight, thus putting pressure on my queen, for moving the knight was no longer a good option."
11,Be2,d3e2,r2qkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/3nP1b1/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 6,"I give the knight more protection with this move. True, the g2 pawn already protected the knight, but it's best to be on the safe side here. Besides, I was getting ready to castle. If I instead played 6. h3 Bxf3 7.xf3, a door would be opened to my king if I castled king-side, so no matter what he played next, the outcome would not be negative for white."
12,Nf6,g8f6,r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/2p5/3nP1b1/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 4 7,Black starts getting the other knight involved.
