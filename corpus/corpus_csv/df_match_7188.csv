1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"c4, my standard and beloved opening move as white."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,Nf6 is a common counter for black.
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 2,"I'm preparing to play e4 next.  If my opponent plays 3...d5, I intend to transpose into a gambit position with 4. d4."
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Black plays g6 in preparation for the fianchettoed dark bishop on g7.  c5 would have been just as good, but in this case my opponent preferred the hyper-accelerated dragon."
5,e4,e2e4,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2P1P3/2N5/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"With e4, I establish control of the center early.  d6 is now dominated by the Knight on c3, as well as the c and e pawns.  Black must play baseline defense."
6,d6,d7d6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/2P1P3/2N5/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,d6 is a likely move.  Black anticipates the harassment of the f6 Knight with 4. e5.
7,f4,f2f4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/2P1PP2/2N5/PP1P2PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"I prefer playing f4 early.  This enables the eventual Nf3 move with out blocking the f-pawn.  I love wide open pawns on the c-f files.  This creates an explosive advantage for white, opening up for rooks on the e and f files later on."
8,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p1np1/2p5/2P1PP2/2N5/PP1P2PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"A solid book move for black.  c5 challenges the d-pawn, and helps black take some of his own control of the center.  It also creates a good opportunity for a knight or dark squared bishop outpost on d4."
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p1np1/2p5/2P1PP2/2N2N2/PP1P2PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"Nf3 is the logical progression for white, followed by Be2...O-O.  The knight is key in defending the d4 and e5 squares."
10,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pp2pp1p/2np1np1/2p5/2P1PP2/2N2N2/PP1P2PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,"Black will impose his own Knight on the d4 and e5 squares, while developing a minor piece.  I'm not sure why Nc6 was selected instead of Bg7.  Black probably recognized that there was no hurry in moving the bishop to g7, because the tempo of my opening presents no imminent threats to the king side."
11,d3,d2d3,r1bqkb1r/pp2pp1p/2np1np1/2p5/2P1PP2/2NP1N2/PP4PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"d3 is a conservative move.  It is not as sharp as d4, but it does open up the diagonal for the dark squared bishop as well as supports the c and e pawns.  Certainly Be2 would have allowed for castling king side on move seven, but since black delayed the fianchettoed bishop, I can linger with a more methodical opening.  I have played Bd3 on a few occasions, but it is a very unorthodox opening move and severely hampers the d-pawn, dark squared bishop--ultimately only creates problems.  The bishop will do fine on e2 temporarily."
12,Bg7,f8g7,r1bqk2r/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/2p5/2P1PP2/2NP1N2/PP4PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,The expected move for black.
13,Be2,f1e2,r1bqk2r/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/2p5/2P1PP2/2NP1N2/PP2B1PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 7,Preparing to castle...
14,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/2p5/2P1PP2/2NP1N2/PP2B1PP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 3 8,"After castling, I am now prepared to move into the middle game."
15,O-O,e1g1,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/2p5/2P1PP2/2NP1N2/PP2B1PP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 4 8,"After castling, I am now prepared to move into the middle game."
16,a6,a7a6,r1bq1rk1/1p2ppbp/p1np1np1/2p5/2P1PP2/2NP1N2/PP2B1PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 9,"Black plans to eventually play b5 after possibly Rb8, Qa5, or even a combination of Nd5 and Bd7.  This is the natural course of events that most defenders against this variation of the English will follow to foil whites control of d5."
17,h3,h2h3,r1bq1rk1/1p2ppbp/p1np1np1/2p5/2P1PP2/2NP1N1P/PP2B1P1/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 9,"It will take another two moves for black to play b5.  This will give me a chance to create some problems of my own for black.  I intend to play g4, followed by g5, harassing the Knight on f6. h3 also creates an escape for my King later on and allows the protection of the fork on g3 if black plays Nh5...Ng3; in addition, it prevents the annoying Bg4."
18,Rb8,a8b8,1rbq1rk1/1p2ppbp/p1np1np1/2p5/2P1PP2/2NP1N1P/PP2B1P1/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 10,"As I said before, black's design is to play b5 in hopes of distracting the pawn on c4 from the d5 square.  This really presents no immediate problem, however, because the d3 pawn will recapture on c4 if black threatens to take.  Of course, black could follow b5 with b4! threatening the Knight on c3, but such a move would only hyper-extend my opponent's resources.  At any rate, the threat of b4 is benign."
19,g4,g2g4,1rbq1rk1/1p2ppbp/p1np1np1/2p5/2P1PPP1/2NP1N1P/PP2B3/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 10,"Following through with my own intentions after playing h3.  If my opponent allows me to play f5, it will create trouble for his kingside.  Should black permit f5 to be played, it would behoove him not to capture with the g-pawn.  This is a designed attack, following that of many against the Sicilian Dragon in the past: crack open in the g and h files and reek havock on black's kingside!"
20,h5,h7h5,1rbq1rk1/1p2ppb1/p1np1np1/2p4p/2P1PPP1/2NP1N1P/PP2B3/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 11,"Black wishes for 11. gxh5, because my attack would fizzle out after 11...Nxh5.  Perhaps black also saw 11. g5 Ne8, 12. Kh2 Qd7, 13. Ng1 Bd4!...as advantageous.  In fact, he followed almost this exact move order.  But after 14. Rf3 Bxg1, 15. Qxg1...it was unclear to me how black proposed to continue his attach.  Instead black's light squared bishop would be incapacitated, which proved to be detrimental later in the game."
21,g5,g4g5,1rbq1rk1/1p2ppb1/p1np1np1/2p3Pp/2P1PP2/2NP1N1P/PP2B3/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 11,"I had already played through the posibilities in my mind.  11...Bxh3, 12. gxf6 Bxf1, 13. fxg7 fxe2, 14. gxf8+ Kxf8, 15. Qxe2... does not work out well for black.  Neither does 11...Bxh3, 12. gxf6 Qd7, 13. fxg7 Qg4+...because my king escapes by 14. Kf2 Qg2+, 15. Ke2... all is well.  The obvious next move for black then is Ne8."
