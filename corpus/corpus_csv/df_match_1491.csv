1,g3,g2g3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/6P1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This unusual opening is not bad, but it provides clear clues to black about what will be black's formation, so I know that I have to play against pressure on the white diagonal."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/6P1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Deviating from my usual developement (Bf5).
3,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/6P1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,Deviating from my usual developement (Bf5).
4,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/8/6P1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 3,Deviating from my usual developement (Bf5).
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/3P4/6P1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 3,"This is not necessarily bad, but provides me with a blocking move."
6,e4,e5e4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3Pp3/6P1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 4,"White would attack my central chaing, pretty advanced, at the cost of piece developement."
7,Be3,c1e3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3Pp3/4B1P1/PPP1PPBP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 1 4,"? White wants to defend instead of attack, and this is not the right thing to do as white. This move makes the two bishops virtually useless, but white's dsb does makes pressure on c5. But I won't go for it!"
8,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2p5/3p4/3Pp3/4B1P1/PPP1PPBP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,"I'll play ""around"" c5, ""through"" c5, but not ""on"" c5."
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2p5/3p4/3Pp3/2N1B1P1/PPP1PPBP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 1 5,I can attack b2 provided I don't move my lsb from guarding b7.

11,Na4,c3a4,rnb1kbnr/pp3ppp/1qp5/3p4/N2Pp3/4B1P1/PPP1PPBP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 3 6,"The standard defence for white, almost forced. But I have the initiative already! White can now reject my queen, but moreover, he has an almost-free access to my kingside with the two bishops. I won't play 5, kicking the knight, that will land undisturbed on c5, x-ray protected, and I won't have any pawn to kick it. So I played..."

15,b4,b2b4,rnb1k1nr/pp3ppp/2pb4/q2p4/NP1Pp3/2P1B1P1/P3PPBP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 0 8,Obviously. I lost the initiative in order to develop my dsb and control Bf4 by white.
16,Qc7,a5c7,rnb1k1nr/ppq2ppp/2pb4/3p4/NP1Pp3/2P1B1P1/P3PPBP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 1 9,"My queen is well placed, and if white insists in attacking the queenside. he will have not his lsb to support it. And as long as I keep the chance to play b6, c5 is under control."
17,Nc5,a4c5,rnb1k1nr/ppq2ppp/2pb4/2Np4/1P1Pp3/2P1B1P1/P3PPBP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 2 9,"I reached my objective: white's dsb is blocked by his own pawns, and his pieces have poor action. White can think in a future c4, even sacrifying it, but now it is impossible because the knight f3 will be attacked."
18,b6,b7b6,rnb1k1nr/p1q2ppp/1ppb4/2Np4/1P1Pp3/2P1B1P1/P3PPBP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 0 10,"I reached my objective: white's dsb is blocked by his own pawns, and his pieces have poor action. White can think in a future c4, even sacrifying it, but now it is impossible because the knight f3 will be attacked."

21,f3,f2f3,rn2k1nr/p1q2ppp/bppb4/3p4/1P1Pp3/1NP1BPP1/P3P1BP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 0 11,"White, finally, attacks my pawn's chain."
22,f5,f7f5,rn2k1nr/p1q3pp/bppb4/3p1p2/1P1Pp3/1NP1BPP1/P3P1BP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 0 12,"I can play this confidently, because of the passive position of white's pieces. I have to avoid white to unravel his pieces."

I saw this was the only way to avoid a long and boring game. But in chess, the lack of attack is often heavily punished, so probably this was ""the best wasy"" to go on. You should never let your opponent nothing to worry about, if you can avoid that!"
