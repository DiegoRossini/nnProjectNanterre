8,d5,d7d5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3pp1N1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"Standard reply, I would not even think 1 second on a real board."
9,exd5,e4d5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3Pp1N1/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,There are some options here: Nxd5 or Na5. I usually played Nxd5 because I've seen people do that a lot on a real board. But after playing a little with the chess game database I think Na5 is better.

12,h6,h7h6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2pp1/5n1p/n2Pp1N1/2B5/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"White could do a gambit and play Nxf7 but at this position I think its bad because it doesnt give an active thread to the king. With the knight on f6, Qf3 tricks are not possible. So black made the right decision. I didnt like to wait if he would do it or not so I forced him to decide now. It's not a lost in tempo since black has to move his knight away, instead it removes any attack from g5."

Normally I do not like to trade a knight with a lsb, because I like a lsb more than a knight. But in this situation if I play bh4 or bf5 he could play g4, trying to play a pawn attack, and do a long castling (0-0-0). Bd7 seems too passive for me."

I could go back to Nf6 and the queen had to move again but I'm a player that likes to play risky. It's just more fun. g3 seems like a good move, I would have answered it with Bxc3. It would have lead to a different game. This knight will stand here for 15 moves, so it didn't turn out to be a bad move at all."
