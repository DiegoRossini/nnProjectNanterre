1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Here is another aspect of my game that I need to improve upon as well as mounting successful mating attacks and spotting those decoys!  It is called Spot the Sacrifice.  I have come across quite a few sacrifices including queen sacrifices when doing the daily puzzles but again I need to develop it in a real game.  In this game I failed to spot an exchange sacrifice and paid the price!  In response to 1. e4 black plays e6 which is the French Defense."
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"3. ...... exd5 - this pawn trade characterises the Exchange Variation of the French Defense.  It does have the potential to be drawish but it is not always the case.  I thought I would get some nice open free play here.  Well, I do, but only up to a point."

Nc3 - hmm, in retrospect maybe instead of following the knights before bishops mantra it would have been better to have played Be3 followed by Nd2 and then my rooks would have a clear communication on the back row, and Henry would have been shielded on e2.  Do you the Inquest Jury agree?"

Kc2 - making room for my rooks to move but Nc5 is a death knell because I must now play b3 to give Henry a flight square on b2.  My rook on a1 will fall to a skewer (Be5) next move and so I decided to wave the white flag.  Well played Chris!
