I also thought his knight wasn't valuable and getting rid of his central pawn would allow me to rip open his kingside with f5 etc.. I believe Nc5 is a great multi purpose move. It attack the queen, It threatens to remove a defense of the f5 knight, it attacks b7 and prepares for a e6 fork. He can't defends against all these threats at once."
