5,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2pPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,3.e3 or 3.Nf3 are often played also.
6,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/2pPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Ofcourse 3...Nf6 or 3...b5 are options here.

Ofcourse taking the knight wins back material, but I decided to look a bit further and found this move! It doesn't threaten anything for now, but black should really feel the pressure on the kingside building up."
