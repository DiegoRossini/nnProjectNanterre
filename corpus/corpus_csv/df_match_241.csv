1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,After going through a bad patch - losing 2 and drawing one of my last 3 games - I finally get back to winning ways!
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,The match was played in a handicapped knock-out. If we drew 3-3 against our opponents we would go out. I knew I had one of the most favourable ratings difference against my opponent. http://www.cdchessleague.org.uk/results.php?comp=Knock+Out
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"I was not expecting my opponent - he doesn't normally play board 3, their normal board 2 was missing."
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Transposing into the Queen's Gambit Declined, Marshall Defence. I don't think it is very good, it give white a strong centre. It scores well for white."
5,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/3P4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,The recommended move.
6,Nxd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3n4/3P4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,The most common reply. 3...Qxd5 scores even worse. It allows white to attack the black queen with 4. Nc3.
7,e4,e2e4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3n4/3PP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,I seize the centre.
8,Nb6,d5b6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/1n6/8/3PP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"At the time I thought this was a mistake and that Nf56 was better, but now I see in the opening databases that both moves score about equally badly."
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/1n6/8/3PP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 5,The natural square for my knight.
10,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/1n2p3/8/3PP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,5....g6 and transposing into an unfavourable variation of the Gr√ºnfeld Defence scores better than this move.
11,Be3,c1e3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/1n2p3/8/3PP3/2N1B3/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 1 6,Played to prevent c7-c5.
12,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/1n2p3/8/3PP3/2N1B3/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 2 7,This move doesn't score very well - but neither does anything else!
13,Qd2,d1d2,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/1n2p3/8/3PP3/2N1B3/PP1Q1PPP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 3 7,"7. Nf3 is the normal move here. As I said, I was playing for a win and had planned 0-0-0. 7. Qd2 is not in any of the opening database I have access to."
14,c6,c7c6,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/1np1p3/8/3PP3/2N1B3/PP1Q1PPP/R3KBNR w KQkq - 0 8,"A bit passive, and leaving his d6 square weak."
15,O-O-O,e1c1,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/1np1p3/8/3PP3/2N1B3/PP1Q1PPP/2KR1BNR b kq - 1 8,So I castle.
16,Nb8d7,b8d7,r1bqk2r/pp1nbppp/1np1p3/8/3PP3/2N1B3/PP1Q1PPP/2KR1BNR w kq - 2 9,He develops.
17,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqk2r/pp1nbppp/1np1p3/8/3PP3/2N1BN2/PP1Q1PPP/2KR1B1R b kq - 3 9,I have a plan of Bg5 and exchanging dark squared bishops followed by e4-e5 and Nc3-e4-d6
18,Nf6,d7f6,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/1np1pn2/8/3PP3/2N1BN2/PP1Q1PPP/2KR1B1R w kq - 4 10,Continuing with his development.
19,Bd3,f1d3,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/1np1pn2/8/3PP3/2NBBN2/PP1Q1PPP/2KR3R b kq - 5 10,and me with mine.
20,h6,h7h6,r1bqk2r/pp2bpp1/1np1pn1p/8/3PP3/2NBBN2/PP1Q1PPP/2KR3R w kq - 0 11,He stops my plan.
