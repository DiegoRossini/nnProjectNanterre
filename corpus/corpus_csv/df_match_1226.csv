1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"White starts with a standard e4, simple move but nicely effective. 
He challenges the vital center squares, and opens up nice diagonals for his Queen and LSB."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,The sicilian defense! the move ideally prevents white from 2. d4 (taking good control of the center) and gets the game started for the Queen.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Nice development of White's g-knight! It gets the knight off the back rank and attacks the center at the same time, plus at a later stage it will allow for a very effective defense when the king is castled."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"Black decides not to waste time and develops his knight, attacking the center. The d4 square is now attacked twice by black."
5,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,"Ahh, Ruy Lopez. Once black's d-pawn advances, the knight will be effectively pinned to the king, and therefore unable to attack or defend. Strong move!
Trying to scare white's LSB away with 3. ... a6 will only cause 4. Ba4 ; the pin will still stand, and both players will have used up a move, while Black would also be left with a weak queenside...."
6,e5,e7e5,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n5/1Bp1p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,"...Therefore Black decides to advance his e-pawn, as so far it is still protected by the knight."
7,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n5/1Bp1p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 4,"Ruy Lopez allows White to be highly aggressive, disputing the center, attacking on the queenside and protecting his king very early.
Excellent opening really! the pawn structure in front of White's king, along with the presence of his rook and knight, makes for a very tight defense, as long as the pawns aren't moved."
8,Bd6,f8d6,r1bqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/2nb4/1Bp1p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 5,"Black gets his DSB off the back rank, developing a minor piece. It now protects both e and c-pawns, so it is a little overworked.
The move is not too bad, although in hindsight, a better square for the DSB at this stage could have been e7 instead, choosing 4. ... d6 before.
Now the d-pawn is stuck behind  the DSB, and the LSB is also therefore stuck! However, this way the knight isn't pinned yet, and is one of three attackers of the d4 square; not too shabby!"
9,c3,c2c3,r1bqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/2nb4/1Bp1p3/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 5,"This move sets up many things at once: White's Queen has now an additional diagonal to act in, LSB has the c2 square to run off to in case Black decides to chase it away from its position, and finally, 5. c3 supports the advance of White's d-pawn to the d4 square, which is defended thrice."
10,b6,b7b6,r1bqk1nr/p2p1ppp/1pnb4/1Bp1p3/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 6,"Black decides to move his b-pawn in order to give his LSB some breathing space, while also defending better the c-pawn"
11,Na3,b1a3,r1bqk1nr/p2p1ppp/1pnb4/1Bp1p3/4P3/N1P2N2/PP1P1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 6,"White develops his b-knight. In general, moving a knight to the side of the board means giving up half of its attacking power.
In this case it defends the LSB and prepares to move to c4, a very nice square to be controlled by a knight."
12,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/p2p1ppp/1pnb1n2/1Bp1p3/4P3/N1P2N2/PP1P1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 7,Gets the knight out and prepares to castle.
13,Re1,f1e1,r1bqk2r/p2p1ppp/1pnb1n2/1Bp1p3/4P3/N1P2N2/PP1P1PPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq - 3 7,"The rook comes into play! it defends the e-pawn, which was attacked with the previous move."
14,Bb7,c8b7,r2qk2r/pb1p1ppp/1pnb1n2/1Bp1p3/4P3/N1P2N2/PP1P1PPP/R1BQR1K1 w kq - 4 8,"Black gets his last minor piece off the back rank, in the only other safe square available to his LSB. this position is very cramped for him, so all he can do his park it behind the knight in order to eventually unleash a possible discovered attack."
15,Nc4,a3c4,r2qk2r/pb1p1ppp/1pnb1n2/1Bp1p3/2N1P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq - 5 8,"....And the knight comes into action! occupying this square, a lot of options are available to him. The one that catches White's eye is to attack Black's DSB, which is currently undefended. Black's gonna have to do something about that..."
16,Qe7,d8e7,r3k2r/pb1pqppp/1pnb1n2/1Bp1p3/2N1P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/R1BQR1K1 w kq - 6 9,"...And he does so by developing his queen! Bishop is now well defended enough, and actually Black has a choice of which side to castle to."
17,d3,d2d3,r3k2r/pb1pqppp/1pnb1n2/1Bp1p3/2N1P3/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq - 0 9,"White is a little bit behind with his development, having moved a couple of his pieces twice, so he decides to continue. 
This pawn advance protects the e-pawn and allows his DSB, up till now doing nothing in the back rank, a long diagonal to get into play."
18,Bc7,d6c7,r3k2r/pbbpqppp/1pn2n2/1Bp1p3/2N1P3/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQR1K1 w kq - 1 10,"At this point, castling on the kingside would have probably been better for Black.
It seems though he wanted to get that d-pawn into the game, while employing the DSB elsewhere.
Both of Black's bishops, although off the back rank, aren't really being used to their maximum potential, while White's are much better placed!"
19,Bxc6,b5c6,r3k2r/pbbpqppp/1pB2n2/2p1p3/2N1P3/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq - 0 10,"White goes for an exchange, perhaps hoping Black will cripple himself with a doubled pawn on the C-file, and a semi open D-file."
20,Bxc6,b7c6,r3k2r/p1bpqppp/1pb2n2/2p1p3/2N1P3/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQR1K1 w kq - 0 11,"But black takes the offering with his LSB, which now has more breathing space than before.
In hindisight, it seems like because of black's cramped position and misuse of his bishops as a result, white wanted to cripple him further by taking out 1-2 knights, the best piece when it comes to navigating similar positions."
