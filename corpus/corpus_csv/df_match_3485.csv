1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Queens pawn game... i prefer playing against e4 but oh well.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"Developing the Knight, a common reply to d4."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,I honestly don't know what this is called but i believe it essentially transposes into the Queens gambit.
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,I honestly don't know what this is called but i believe it essentially transposes into the Queens gambit.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,all standard so far.
6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Contests the center, i believe we are in a Queens gambit game."
7,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,Pins the Knight to the Queen
8,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 2 5,Removes the pin as well as preparing to castle. My King has a pool table so it is a pretty legit castle.
9,e3,e2e3,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,Opens up his light squared bishop. I believe this is all standard so far.
10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR w KQ - 1 6,"Chillin' like a villain, with a pool table."
11,Nf3,g1f3,rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 2 6,Developing move.
12,dxc4,d5c4,rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/6B1/2pP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 7,"So i think i played this a bit too prematurely. This allows him to simply recapture with the bishop, thus developing a piece. My eventual goal was to play c5 to contest the center and i didn't want a scenario like 6...c5 7. dxc5 Bxc5 8.cxd5 exd5 which would leave me with an isolated d pawn. In  retrospect, i don't think this was best."
13,Bxc4,f1c4,rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/6B1/2BP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 7,develops his bishop with the recapture.
14,c6,c7c6,rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/2p1pn2/6B1/2BP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 8,um... i think i was looking for a caro-kann type structure but with the bishop still closed in on the back rank this just seems bad. Now my Knight doesn't have the c6 square to go to either. I don't really know what i was thinking but i don't like it.
15,O-O,e1g1,rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/2p1pn2/6B1/2BP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 8,"Goes into safety, however i doubt his castle has a pool table like mine."
16,Nd5,f6d5,rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/2p1p3/3n2B1/2BP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 2 9,"forces the exchange of bishops however i don't think this benefits me too much as my other bishop is blocked in and i am exchanging my good bishop for his bad one, even if it is outside his pawn chain... It is clear that i'm not playing winning chess right now."
17,Bxe7,g5e7,rnbq1rk1/pp2Bppp/2p1p3/3n4/2BP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 9,"Gets the evil succubus into play and piles up on the knight at d5. However, my pawns have him pretty reinforced for now."
18,Qxe7,d8e7,rnb2rk1/pp2qppp/2p1p3/3n4/2BP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 10,"Gets the evil succubus into play and piles up on the knight at d5. However, my pawns have him pretty reinforced for now."
19,Qb3,d1b3,rnb2rk1/pp2qppp/2p1p3/3n4/2BP4/1QN1PN2/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b - - 1 10,"Gets the evil succubus into play and piles up on the knight at d5. However, my pawns have him pretty reinforced for now."
20,Nd7,b8d7,r1b2rk1/pp1nqppp/2p1p3/3n4/2BP4/1QN1PN2/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w - - 2 11,"develops my Knight, i need some catching up to do."
21,Nxd5,c3d5,r1b2rk1/pp1nqppp/2p1p3/3N4/2BP4/1Q2PN2/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b - - 0 11,Was that exchange beneficial for him?
22,exd5,e6d5,r1b2rk1/pp1nqppp/2p5/3p4/2BP4/1Q2PN2/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 12,Was that exchange beneficial for him?
23,Bd3,c4d3,r1b2rk1/pp1nqppp/2p5/3p4/3P4/1Q1BPN2/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b - - 1 12,Was that exchange beneficial for him?
24,Nf6,d7f6,r1b2rk1/pp2qppp/2p2n2/3p4/3P4/1Q1BPN2/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w - - 2 13,So my bishop sees some light although he is still considered bad. At this point i was really looking to try to exchange him...
25,h3,h2h3,r1b2rk1/pp2qppp/2p2n2/3p4/3P4/1Q1BPN1P/PP3PP1/R4RK1 b - - 0 13,takes away the g4 square.
