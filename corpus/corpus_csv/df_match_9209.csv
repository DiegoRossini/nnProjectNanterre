Here is where I get stumped - where do I go from here?  I look back at some of the illustrative games in the World Database and find that the move e5 was played to exchange the central pawns - white drew that game so I thought it was a reasonable plan here.  Maybe a better idea would have been to have played either Bc2 or b3 here, at least the former would have avoided what is to come.  I now have a tip for all beginners and intermediate players here - when you come to the end of the database do check to see what is covering what and then decide on what piece to move in order to improve your position, especially for overloads like this one, otherwise you will worsen it."

Marin stated in a pm in response to my resignation note that I should have taken with the f pawn.  I did consider it but it would have left the f pawn an isolani so I thought that it was better to keep my pawn structure together.  Unfortunately, after Marin's next move, the irony is, that pawn is to fall anyway together with a whole lot more."

Rd1) I go for the line which loses the pawn, any other plausible replies such as Nxd7 lose one of the bishops to the pile up on the d file - this is a skewer.  Do note that Glenda is defending both e5 and Frere Leblanc   Frere Lenoir, Glenda the Defender is extremely put upon here!  Another plausible try is Ne4 attacking the Wicked Witch of the West but Bxe4 ensures that a piece drops on d3."
