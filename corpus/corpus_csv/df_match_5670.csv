I'm not usually a Ruy Lopez player (from either the white or black side), however there were some idea variations and pet lines that I wanted to experiment with, so I christened a seven-man tournament.  In my first game as white I'm paired with a strong 1800 player."

6,Nd4,c6d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/1B2p3/3nP3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,"?! The Bird's Variation of the Ruy Lopez.  Henry Edward Bird loved opening eccentricities like this.  Black moves his only developed piece, allowing it to be snapped off.  Frowned upon by classicists, but as with many offbeat lines, it does contain subtle poison.  I played against one Bird Ruy Lopez before and thought I had a good game since my opponent had isolated double center d-pawns, but my game crumbled grotesquely by move 20 when I tried to exploit them and unwittingly sprung my opponent's pieces (and two bishops) to life. I was determined not to repeat that mistake."
7,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/1B2p3/3NP3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,"The most popular continuation, but 4. Bc4 also has its following, which I considered, but ultimately decided on the most forcing move."
8,exd4,e5d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/1B6/3pP3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"?! A very queer move to my eyes, although even mainline Bird variations are strange by Ruy Lopez standards (5. ...h5!? has its adherents, for instance).  5. ...Bc5 is usual.  I figured 5. ...a5 was played with aspirations towards trapping my King's bishop with a Noah's Ark-esque maneuver if I was asleep at the wheel."

Be2, and then play d3, Ne2-f3, Qe1, and treat the position like a reversed Classical Dutch, perhaps challenging the d4 pawn with c3 at some point in the future, perhaps leaving it alone, depending on what black did."

Black wants to play ...d5 but his King is still in the center and his position is already precarious.    He should play 9. ...O-O and then possibly sac a pawn with 10. ...d5 to uncramp his position."

Qg3; both have merit and strictly speaking are more accurate.  I decided on his move because it basically forces black's reply and I could plan my follow-up with accuracy.
