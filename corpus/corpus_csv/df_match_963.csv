4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"It went like a ""normal"" Scandinavian, but this move is seldom faced. This bishop will run for a while."
5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 3,"It went like a ""normal"" Scandinavian, but this move is seldom faced. This bishop will run for a while."
6,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/2B3b1/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 3 4,"I've seen this idea recently (Portuguese Gambit?) played and commented here on GK, and I gave it a try."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/2B3b1/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 4 4,"The N is pinned, so I could have gone for Nd7, threatening Ne5."
8,Nxd5,f6d5,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3n4/2B3b1/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"The problem with Bc4 is that it prevents white to play c4 instead, so this N take is just fine!"
9,h3,h2h3,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3n4/2B3b1/5N1P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"OH, well, of course... backwards? Never! :-) (just joking, don't play chess like that, please! :-D"
10,Bxf3,g4f3,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3n4/2B5/5b1P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"It looks dreadful, because if Nf6, Qxb7."
11,Qxf3,d1f3,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3n4/2B5/5Q1P/PPPP1PP1/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 6,"It looks dreadful, because if Nf6, Qxb7."
12,e6,e7e6,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4p3/3n4/2B5/5Q1P/PPPP1PP1/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 7,But this simple move saves it all. Because white can't play c4 now.
13,d3,d2d3,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4p3/3n4/2B5/3P1Q1P/PPP2PP1/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 7,"Here I could have gone for the complications of Nb4 (allowing Qxb7 for Nxc2+, cashing the R after saving my own... oh, I already played this one, and it's very complicated!)"
14,c6,c7c6,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3n4/2B5/3P1Q1P/PPP2PP1/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 8,"This saves it all, because now even if white manages to play c4, my N can safely leave this square, since b7 is defended."
15,O-O,e1g1,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3n4/2B5/3P1Q1P/PPP2PP1/RNB2RK1 b kq - 1 8,Very important: I have to use my dark squares to create pressure.
16,Bd6,f8d6,rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/2pbp3/3n4/2B5/3P1Q1P/PPP2PP1/RNB2RK1 w kq - 2 9,Very important: I have to use my dark squares to create pressure.
17,Bg5,c1g5,rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/2pbp3/3n2B1/2B5/3P1Q1P/PPP2PP1/RN3RK1 b kq - 3 9,?? I don't think that QxB gave some compensation to white. It was just a blunder and I...
18,Qb6,d8b6,rn2k2r/pp3ppp/1qpbp3/3n2B1/2B5/3P1Q1P/PPP2PP1/RN3RK1 w kq - 4 10,"?? I played authomaticly this move, without even realizing that the WB was ""free of charge"", so concerned I was about b2's AND c2's weaknesses.."
19,b3,b2b3,rn2k2r/pp3ppp/1qpbp3/3n2B1/2B5/1P1P1Q1P/P1P2PP1/RN3RK1 b kq - 0 10,"? This stops forever the c4 option for white, and allows for a future b5 threat..."
20,Nb4,d5b4,rn2k2r/pp3ppp/1qpbp3/6B1/1nB5/1P1P1Q1P/P1P2PP1/RN3RK1 w kq - 1 11,"? The threat on c2 must control white, because he has very dangerous sacs like Bxc6. On the other side, I will spend a tempo castling ONLY if absolutely needed. I need my tempoes for my own attack. BUT much more important was Be5, forcing c3, and only then Nb4, where if cxN, BxR."
21,Qe2,f3e2,rn2k2r/pp3ppp/1qpbp3/6B1/1nB5/1P1P3P/P1P1QPP1/RN3RK1 b kq - 2 11,"! Now white's threat is even worse! And, besides, Be5 is not possible anymore!!! Time to castle?"
22,Nd5,b4d5,rn2k2r/pp3ppp/1qpbp3/3n2B1/2B5/1P1P3P/P1P1QPP1/RN3RK1 w kq - 3 12,NO! This is many times more efficient to stop white's threats.
23,a3,a2a3,rn2k2r/pp3ppp/1qpbp3/3n2B1/2B5/PP1P3P/2P1QPP1/RN3RK1 b kq - 0 12,"? White has to go on, and Kh1, allowing f4 - f5 would have been black's next challenge. But this move goes for a slower plan."
24,Nd7,b8d7,r3k2r/pp1n1ppp/1qpbp3/3n2B1/2B5/PP1P3P/2P1QPP1/RN3RK1 w kq - 1 13,"If I am not forced to castle, why to concede a tempo? Better is to develop."
25,b4,b3b4,r3k2r/pp1n1ppp/1qpbp3/3n2B1/1PB5/P2P3P/2P1QPP1/RN3RK1 b kq - 0 13,"white is going for a pawn storm on the Qside! Wow! Very interesting, but not for a blitz. The correct procedure for black (IMO!) is a5. b5 by white is just ok, bxc6, bxc6 goes in black's favour and doesn't concede anything."
26,Be5,d6e5,r3k2r/pp1n1ppp/1qp1p3/3nb1B1/1PB5/P2P3P/2P1QPP1/RN3RK1 w kq - 1 14,"This is now very strong, but it comes too late."
