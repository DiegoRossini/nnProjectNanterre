1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

After losing my first game against Vlado playing white it was a pleasant surprise to get into a fine position against him playing black.  After 18 moves, I found myself a clear pawn up and with a much superior pawn structure until a combination of nerves and the need to make up rating points after a bad loss in the King Pawn Tournament led me to click on that Offer Draw button and convert my clear advantage to 6 rating points.  My opponent accepted and 6 rating points was what I got.  Here is how the action unfolds."

""Well done. I preferred your position to his, although I didn't like your last move. He can play the check to swap off queens, but you have wasted a move by playing qc4....I thought g5...after check, then swap queens...then h5 to open the h file... That must be better for you.""

Yes, I did briefly consider g5, that would have made h6 available to Glenda and then she could retreat to the bottom rank if she looked in danger of being trapped.  I suppose Vlado may well have exchanged queens to join his two kingside isolanis together.

Ah well, now that I can count on one hand how many Experts I have drawn against it is time to move up a gear and make my first Expert victory a new goal.  Hope you have had a good read everyone.

Bye for now.
