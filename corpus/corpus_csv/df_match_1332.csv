1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"In blitz you see players with ""ridicolous"" ratings. Be aware of them: some are very good, and I have no idea why have those ratings. The nick is not the real one, of course, but the rating is about the same. It was a very intense and (for my standards) interesting game. The nature of the endgame remembered me so much of a tennis game, with all its emotion, game after game, with the one to check as the ""server"" of the ""game""... it was very funny, I hope you like it."
