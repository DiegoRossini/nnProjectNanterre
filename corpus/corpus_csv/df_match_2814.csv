3,Bf4,c1f4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/3P1B2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"I go on as normal (for the London, or at least my way to play it), controlling e5."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2np4/8/3P1B2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,"Brings in forces on e5. I kind don't like this move with d5 by black, but I wasn't sure it was really stunning 3. d5. After Ne5 black's game looks weird and cramped, but it is difficult to say if it is a real edge for white, and how to exploit it. It was only a blitz..."
5,e4,e2e4,r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2np4/8/3PPB2/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"This can't be bad, I though. Out of my scheme, but due."
6,f6,f7f6,r1bqkbnr/ppp1p1pp/2np1p2/8/3PPB2/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Black is decided to play e5 even against common sense, that suggest not to move f6 before castling. But 4. Qh5+ at once is ineffective: after 4. g6, black's pawns are weakened, true, but my queen has nothing best than to go backward, losing a tempo. And black's 5... e5 will follow undisturbed."
7,Bd3,f1d3,r1bqkbnr/ppp1p1pp/2np1p2/8/3PPB2/3B4/PPP2PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 1 4,"With a piece hitting g6 - either knight or bishop -, it is possible to use ""piece x g6"" tactics (being h7 pinned to the queen) to break in, but the knight won't be the piece to do it, in this position: the bishop is. OF course this is a silly line, since black can play 4... e5, blocking the bishop's action. So this was a blunder of mine, actually. I just though that black could be tempted to take in d4, giving me the necessary tempo to push e5."
8,Bd7,c8d7,r2qkbnr/pppbp1pp/2np1p2/8/3PPB2/3B4/PPP2PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 2 5,"He didn't take the bite, but he is not playing what he has prepared: all this moves's scope was to take control of e5, so why don't you play it, now that you can? If you don't, I'll do, and this will be dangerous for you. Actually, this move, is awful, since it blocks an escape rout for he king, and closes the queen in a self trap, not allowing the queenside castiling."
9,e5,e4e5,r2qkbnr/pppbp1pp/2np1p2/4P3/3P1B2/3B4/PPP2PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,"So I went for it. I didn't care if he had taken it with either of his pawns: I'll go Qh5+ anyway. I was not sure it would have won, but it looked like it. I had too many favours, due to Bd7, not to get something in return if I attacked that way, despite Bf4 was attacked by the pawn. Black could have tried g6 at once, his only defence, and white would have had to rethink the attack. But my opponen wanted to get things more complicated, and counterattacked the bishop wihtout compromising his central pawns. true is that if white takes one of them, e5 becomes playable again.. opening the black's king cage, with a complex game (IMO)."
