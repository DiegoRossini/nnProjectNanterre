1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Good choice. Get a centre p and open lines for Q and B. But I hope this is the first move of your plan !
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,A move behind still but achieves same as white
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"good - develop with a threat and we head toward Ruy Lopez - which is your plan, right !"
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,develop - but with defense
5,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,good developing move - clears way for 0-0 - carries a threat of BxN with Nxp following
6,a6,a7a6,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,pushes the B to take or move.
7,Bc4,b5c4,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"Ba4 is usual, so you must have some logic for this. c4 is not a bad square for B but moving the B twice to get there is not a good idea unless you have compensation for the loss of tempo. In this case the logic is not apparent to me, and it shows you not following through the plan you initiated with move 3. Bb5  In summary, the move is not especially bad, but you broke a few tips - always play to a plan (even a bad plan is better than no plan) - and avoid moving pieces more than once to reach their development square. The result - loss of a tempo"
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,"I want to open up for 0-0, I'm keeping it simple, I'm doing N before B development, there is a threat of Nxe4, and I've just about achieved ""equality"" (I've sort of recovered from being a move behind)"
9,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 5,"good developing move. I would have looked at 0-0 - only because black needs 2 moves to castle and therefore 0-0 has more potential to apply pressure on the e file, and discourages Nxe4"
10,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk2r/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 4 6,"I'm very tempted by Nxe4 and it looks safe, grabs the initiative, etc. but for training purposes I'll follow my own preaching, keep developing, prepare for 0-0, etc. etc."
11,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk2r/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 5 6,d3 first might be better.

13,d3,d2d3,r1bqk2r/1pp2ppp/p1np1n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,likewise

15,Re1,f1e1,r2qk2r/1pp2ppp/p1np1n2/2b1p3/2B1P1b1/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq - 2 8,With Nd4 coming you should have considered h3 or Be3.
