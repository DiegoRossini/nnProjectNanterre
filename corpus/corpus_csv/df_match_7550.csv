1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

This was my last match in the Annotations Project Part 1 and it ended in a high.  Commiserations to Nick on copping Old Matey - this tournament has been a very hit and miss affair.  I am so relieved to come out of it with 17 points out of 20 games, losing only to the Master Mater and conceding two Low Draws to Zebulun and Steve.  Anyhow, on with the match.

If only she can make it safely to this square more often!  This demonstrates why this move is inferior.  White's lsb is now toast.  I work out that after Glenda whips off the bishop, Nick's e6 horsie will not be able to stage a Royal Fork because Glenda will be facing that knight on the diagonal with one square in between.  Yup, this is a little tip for you to try and avoid walking into a knight fork.  Your king may be checked next move if he is facing the knight on a rank or a file with one square in between or on a diagonally ajdacent square - provided the knight can give the check safely.  Be even more wary if the knight is on a diagonally adjacent square to the king and can move away and attack your queen if there is a Q or B lined up behind it."
