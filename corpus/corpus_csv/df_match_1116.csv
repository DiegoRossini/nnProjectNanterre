1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi all! Queen's pawns games are often considered to be less tactically sharp than games that begin with 1. e4. But this game certainly shows tactics can come in very quickly in some variations! This was a hard-fought game where white sacrifices material early to try to keep the initiative and not allow black to consolidate his material edge. It's a tense battle, with Black succeeding over time to force some of white's aggressive pieces off the board. So how did it turn out? Well, read on and don't forget to comment and rate."
