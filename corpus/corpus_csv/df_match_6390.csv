1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is the first of two games vs payam_eagle and I'm sure he is as upset as I am about this game.  However, I've learned quite a bit from reviewing this game. My hope is that you will take something out of this game as well. By the time this game ended in a draw I had 3-0 for my tourney this makes my score a 3.5 which is pretty good. If you would like to look at the other 3 wins which are pretty neat you can view them here: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=14099627&rnd=0.2591759961626843 features an opening trap; http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=14100315&fb=1&rnd=0.9084254376000573 A poisoned pawn; http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=14099101&rnd=0.7170149447687891 and a discovered attack on the queen."

This shows the importance of checking out all the possibilities.  Here exf6 wins the knight because of the mate on g7.

I had seen a way to win a pawn and took it but it turns out threatening mate is devastating.  Rh3!! Black must now deal with the double threat of Qxh7# and Qxe1.  The computers best line for this was 21. Rh3 Ne2+ 22. Kf2 Rxf1+ 23. Kxf1 Qf4+ 24. Kxe2 leaving white with an exposed king but a material advantage and an unclear position slightly favoring white just a bit.
