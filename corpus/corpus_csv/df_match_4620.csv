9,Ngxe2,g1e2,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/8/2N5/PPPPNPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 5,Better is Bxe2. This move heavily delays white's developement.
10,c6,c7c6,rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/8/2N5/PPPPNPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Necessary to avoid Nb5. Bd7 doesn't work on account of the fact that, sooner of later, the knight will develop on c6, renewing the threat of Nb5."
