Here I have to make a choice either i will stay on the a2-g8 diagonal or i will take my move back..Good move from my opponent. He centerilized his Knight on e5 and i had to retreat my Bishop losing one tempo.. But luckily it s not the end yet..

This move might be bad because it turns black's dark square Bishop to a monster because after giving up my Bishop he can dance on the long diagonal as he likes"
26,Bxf6,g7f6,2rq1rk1/1p1bpp1p/p2p1bp1/4n3/3NP3/2N5/PPPQBPPP/3RR1K1 w - - 0 14,He doesnt want to exchange his strong bishop with my centerilized Knight because he wanted to do that with his other bishop.

29,f4,f2f4,2rq1rk1/1p1bppbp/p2p2p1/3Nn3/3NPP2/8/PPPQB1PP/3RR1K1 b - - 0 15,So it is time to get rid of that Knight from the center..
30,Nc4,e5c4,2rq1rk1/1p1bppbp/p2p2p1/3N4/2nNPP2/8/PPPQB1PP/3RR1K1 w - - 1 16,I didnt want to retreat my queen to c1 to defend my pawn. ı t would be real bad duty for excelancy:P nor i wanted to lose a pawn So i exchanged my Bishop

Material would be even and it would be end game Rook+Bishop versus Rook+Knight.. Actually I would have the advantage because of the pin on his bishop on d7. But didnt calculate further."
