2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Start of the Sicilian an opening which i have became accustomed to playing against and playing with. If played properly can cause your opponent real problems. white must play carefully as this is a very useful counter attacking opening compared to others.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,I find this the best way to respond when in this position.

6,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,Common opening here. I have played from this position many times as white.
7,Nxd4,f3d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,Common opening here. I have played from this position many times as white.
8,Bc5,f8c5,rnbqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2b5/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"Easily dealt with and whites response asks black the question of the exchange after black either protects bishop after Nb3, or moves bishop to safety."
9,Nb3,d4b3,rnbqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2b5/4P3/1N6/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,"This now gives white an ""extra move"" which is used for development of whites pieces."
10,Bb6,c5b6,rnbqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/1b2p3/8/4P3/1N6/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 3 6,"This now gives white an ""extra move"" which is used for development of whites pieces."
11,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/1b2p3/8/4P3/1NN5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 4 6,"Trying for mate on f2! Disappointed with this move, the queen has been moved out to early and now is a target for white to attack/develop pieces."
12,Qf6,d8f6,rnb1k1nr/pp1p1ppp/1b2pq2/8/4P3/1NN5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 5 7,"Trying for mate on f2! Disappointed with this move, the queen has been moved out to early and now is a target for white to attack/develop pieces."
13,f4,f2f4,rnb1k1nr/pp1p1ppp/1b2pq2/8/4PP2/1NN5/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,This opens the diagonal for the queen prevents Qf2 and now hopefully can be used to open up the DSB's diagonal.
14,e5,e6e5,rnb1k1nr/pp1p1ppp/1b3q2/4p3/4PP2/1NN5/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,I think this move is a major factor why black lost the match. It allows the knight into a very good position (d5) which will cause problems for black and can not be moved easily as there are no pawns which are able to threaten it.
15,Nd5,c3d5,rnb1k1nr/pp1p1ppp/1b3q2/3Np3/4PP2/1N6/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 8,"Into good position forking queen and bishop. Again forcing black to make a move of a ""developed piece"""
16,Qd8,f6d8,rnbqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/1b6/3Np3/4PP2/1N6/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 9,To look at the board here my position is far superior and now have a game only I can lose. Black is underdeveloped and all whites lines are open with the exception of DSB however after fxe5 that will be available. White has had tempi from very early and now dictates the game.
17,Qg4,d1g4,rnbqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/1b6/3Np3/4PPQ1/1N6/PPP3PP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 3 9,Brings the queen into game on a very strong position and threatens blacks rook.
18,g6,g7g6,rnbqk1nr/pp1p1p1p/1b4p1/3Np3/4PPQ1/1N6/PPP3PP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 0 10,dealing with the threat on the rook.
19,fxe5,f4e5,rnbqk1nr/pp1p1p1p/1b4p1/3NP3/4P1Q1/1N6/PPP3PP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 10,although the threat on the rook has been diverted white now opens the DSB's diagonal and now white is fully developed in an attacking sense. Defence of the king is easily taking care of if Ba5 is played with c3. Pressure is relieved from black if white plays Nxa5 as Queen can then escape from its position where it is now trapped.
20,h5,h7h5,rnbqk1nr/pp1p1p2/1b4p1/3NP2p/4P1Q1/1N6/PPP3PP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 0 11,"Now white has all diagonals open for bishops the knights are situated for defensive/attacking duties ideally and once queen is moved to g3, to protect e5 pawn which is major in whites attack as this prevents black from alot of options and helps keep blacks queen trapped. white is strolling. Note: Qf4 closes bishops diagonal."
21,Qg3,g4g3,rnbqk1nr/pp1p1p2/1b4p1/3NP2p/4P3/1N4Q1/PPP3PP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 1 11,"White now can wait to exploit blacks limited moves. 11. ..,h4 12. Qg4 not as strong a position for queen but still is enough to over run black."
22,Ne7,g8e7,rnbqk2r/pp1pnp2/1b4p1/3NP2p/4P3/1N4Q1/PPP3PP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 2 12,The reason for opening up the bishops diagonals as quickly as possible against the under developed black.
23,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqk2r/pp1pnp2/1b4p1/3NP1Bp/4P3/1N4Q1/PPP3PP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 3 12,Black is totally lost and has been for some time. white now waits the next move. there are so many options for white to play from any move black can think up! Black should resign.
24,Nbc6,b8c6,r1bqk2r/pp1pnp2/1bn3p1/3NP1Bp/4P3/1N4Q1/PPP3PP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 4 13,Black is totally lost and has been for some time. white now waits the next move. there are so many options for white to play from any move black can think up! Black should resign.
