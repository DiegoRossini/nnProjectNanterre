11,Bh6,e3h6,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/2pp1npB/8/3PP3/2N5/PPPQ1PPP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 1 6,"evgraan: Okay, playing aggressively for white, this opens some interesting options for black. This is in my opinion white's most direct (not necessarily best!) attempt at a quick advantage, but you can expect to have some opponents play this against you... 
what are the major idead behind white's move? What strength / weaknesses do you see in your own and white's game so far? (25.07.06)

brulla: Major idea: spoil black’s short castling, start an attack on the king’s wing. I think, black should go for the quenn’s side attack.
Black weaknesses: queen’s wing not developed
White weaknesses: king’s wing not developed, pawn b2 is not protected (could be in the next move, e.g. 0-0-0. (26.07.06)"
12,Bxh6,g7h6,rnbqk2r/pp2pp1p/2pp1npb/8/3PP3/2N5/PPPQ1PPP/R3KBNR w KQkq - 0 7,"brulla:
In our game, I want to try the variant with taking the white bishop: 5….Bxh6 
This variant seems to be quite popular and I found an interesting game (Adams vs. Van Wely, European men’s singles championship 1992), which Van Wely eventually lost but to my impression due to a calculation mistake, not because of the opening. I send you the notation via e-mail.

13,Qxh6,d2h6,rnbqk2r/pp2pp1p/2pp1npQ/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 0 7,"brulla: It's a bit weird to see the ""proud"" bishop g7 disappear. This game will be definitely a ""special Pirc""."
14,Qa5,d8a5,rnb1k2r/pp2pp1p/2pp1npQ/q7/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R3KBNR w KQkq - 1 8,"brulla: As alternatives I see now 7...Qb6 and 7...Qa5. 
Qb6 puts pressure on the points d4 and b2, white's 0-0-0 is the only move to relieve both. Here, when white makes no blunder, white seems to get quite a good play. Many players in chessbase played Qa5 in the next move after Qb6, which seems to me like a time lost.
Qa5 pins the knight to the king which can be relieved at once by 0-0-0 or Qd2. I opted for Qa5 because it seemed me to give more active chances, looking at the played master games, especially by Loek van Wely."
