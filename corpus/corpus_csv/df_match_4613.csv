Bobby Fischer could have quoted that, and maybe he did..."

In blitz, I mostly play 2. d4!? Nxe4 3. Nd2 d5 4. Bd3 Nxd2 5. Qxd2 Nc6 6. Nf3 Qd6 (Bg4, Ne5) 7. 0-0, and gain much in development..."

5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/3nP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"More principal than straightaway c4. Never spoil a good threat... This game is about using tempo, via pressure..."

Spasski - Fischer 1972, game 13, continued with 4. ... g6?! 5. Bc4? (correct is Ng5!) Nb6 6. Bb3 Bg7, and white has nothing... Fischer won, unjustly... In game 19, Fischer continued with 4. ... Bg4 5. Be2 c6? (correct is e6) 6. Ng5? (too early, correct is c4) Bxe2 6. Qxe2, dxe5, 7. dxe5 (this is supposed to be Nxe5) e6 8. 0-0 Nd7 and drawed... White must learn from this..."
8,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p4/3nP3/3P2b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,"It is too early for black, to whip up an attack against c2, via Nc6/Bf5 and Nb4...

This is the whole idea, behind blacks approach in Alekhine...

After Nc6, Bb5. After straightaway Bf5, Bd3, or Bb5+, c6, Bd3...

Nb4 can still be met with a3, after Nc6/Bf5...

White opens possibilities for Ng5, so it has to be pinned..."

10,c6,c7c6,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2pp4/3nP3/3P2b1/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"Highly inaccurate. This spoils all chances for Nc6, the only successfull parade in case of c4, Nb4!...

Black had to play 5. ... e6 (release Bf8, in case of exd6, and prepare dxe5, plus 0-0) 6. c4 (forced, if white wants to hold the initiative; after 6. 0-0 Nc6 7. c4 Nde7 black can break up all tensions), Nb6/e7... Nb8 becomes a burdon from now on..."
11,c4,c2c4,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2pp4/3nP3/2PP2b1/5N2/PP2BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"Also possible is 6. 0-0 dxe5 (e6, c4, Nc7, Qb3), 7. Nxe5... White prefers to postpone castling, and gains tempo in development, using clear threats..."

7. Nbd2! solves this problem, in a very elegant way; all threats are maintained.

It is too early for 7. Ng5 Bxe2 8. Qxe2 dxe5 9. dxe5 e6 10. 0-0...

We play for bigger game... The following is practically forced..."

After 9. ... Qxd4?! 10. Ndf3 Qc5 (Qd6, Ng5!) 11. a3! f6 (to avoid Ng5) 12. b4 Qd6, 13. c5!

I would say pawn d4 is pretty poisonous..."

Black has sincere development problems:

9. ... N8d7 seems logical, but is - still - met with 10. Qb3! After 10. ... Nxe5 11. dxe5, the threat c5 becomes nasty.

10. Nxd7 Qxd7, looks promising but it is not part of whites plan...

9. ... f6 is met with 10. c5 fxe5 11. cxb6 Qxb6 12. Nxe5 Qb4+, 13. Kf1! (remember this) e6 14. a3!..."

This is like Alekhine, playing white against f7... In stead of black, playing Nc6-Nb4 against c2...

The threat Nxf7 has to be met immediately... Black is lured into whites plan...

A mistake, would be 10. g4? Be4! 11. c5? f6! 12. Nd3 (what else?) Nd5, 13. 0-0 g5...

And whites hands are empty... From now on, Ng5 is a long lasting threat..."

After 10. ... f6, 11. Nef7, white is right...

After 10. ... Bg6, 11. Bh5!, the problem only grows bigger...

Now, after 11. Bd2? Qxg5! 12. Bxb4 Qxg2 13. Bf3 Qh3, shortly followed by f6...

White has only one option..."
