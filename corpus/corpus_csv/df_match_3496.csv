5,Bd3,f1d3,rn1qkbnr/pbpppppp/1p6/8/3PP3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 3,"I am hoping for the Matovinsky Gambit f5. I saw it first in the early 1970s, in an edition of the magazine Chess in the early 1960s, and a ""How good is your chess?"" column. In that it gave 3...f5 as the best move for black with continuations like 4. exf5! Bxg2 5. Qh5+ g6 6. fxg6 Bg7 7.gxh7+ Kf8 etc. However in an edition of British Chess Magazine later, I found out that 8.Nf3! leads to an advantage to white in all lines. Unfortunately my opponent didn't play that."
