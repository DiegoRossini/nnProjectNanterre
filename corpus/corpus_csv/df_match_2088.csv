1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Last night's game in the Oxford & Didtrict League's knockout competition, the Frank Wood Shield.  We got a strange position out of the opening, after which White applied some pressure for a while but eventually cracked under time pressure.  There's a rather comical ending too ..."

normal open Sicilian but this time I decided to embarrass her bishop first,
offering the opportunity to swap a piece for two pawns, creating remote passed
pawns as compensation."

does, she didn't exploit it effectively ..."

completely undeveloped kingside.  I had to think hard over the next few moves
to manage my development while avoiding threats and traps."

way to do so immediately.  I was worried about 9...Ngf6 10. e5 dxe5 11. dxe5,
when I'd have to move the attacked N again.  Swapping now on d4 reduced that
risk but gave my opponent a second remote passed pawn and allowed her N to take
up a threatening position, with c6 undefended allowing further disruption."

or 11. f4 or 11. Bg5.  It seemed solid enough but didn't seem to threaten to
disrupt my development."

originally planned by playing  ...Be7 because of the unpleasant fork from c6.
Once my Q moved, he could just swap N for B and leave my K stuck on e7."
23,Bg5,c1g5,r2qkb1r/3n1p1p/3ppnp1/6B1/3NP3/8/PPP1QPPP/R4RK1 b kq - 1 12,"Another surprise: rather a timid looking move when I'd been expecting
aggression, though it looks more logical from White's viewpoint than it did
from where I sat."

something I wouldn't have minded as I couldn't see a convincing follow-up for
her."

scoresheet and clocks enabled me to work out at this stage that I had moved
faster than a move a minute, whereas she had been averaging 3 minutes a move.
It was comforting to know that I would have plenty of time to plan my defence
and counter-attack."

from c4 or g4, and blockading White's e-pawn."

rest of the middle game."

lynchpin of my defence and prepared the ground for the pawn advance."

on e4."

wins the exchange."
