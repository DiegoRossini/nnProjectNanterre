1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Queen's gambit can be fun...to watch! I do not enjoy this particular opening regardless of the color I play as it seems much too solid if one plays ordinary moves.

6,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2p5/2pP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Not so popular for good reason as the invitation for d5 is rather tempting and hard to dislodge for black.
7,d5,d4d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pP4/2p5/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"So far my main task is simply to take the pawn on d5. However, white has enough to defend it and so it looks like he has the advantage for the opening as I will have to plant my undeveloped knight on d7 and suffer spacial disadvantages."

15,Nxe4,c3e4,rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p3p3/2pP4/P1p1N3/5N2/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,?? This is a very natural move but has consequences.
