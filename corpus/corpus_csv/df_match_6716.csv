1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Played after the first long think of the game.  I guessed he was trying to weigh up whether to play the 4 Pawns, the Saemisch or the Main Line.  This flexible move allows variations of all three though it doesn't particularly help the Saemisch as it deprives the Ng1 of e2."

10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1BQK1NR w KQ - 2 6,"Again White refrains from Nf3, causing me to think awhile.  Eventually I reasoned that if 6...e5 would have been my move with the N on f3 it must still be good with it on g1 ..."

12,e5,e7e5,rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/3p1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2N1B3/PP2BPPP/R2QK1NR w KQ - 0 7,"White plays the knee-jerk response.  Both his bishops have good ranges, albeit largely contested by Black's pieces and pawns."
13,d5,d4d5,rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/3p1np1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N1B3/PP2BPPP/R2QK1NR b KQ - 0 7,"White plays the knee-jerk response.  Both his bishops have good ranges, albeit largely contested by Black's pieces and pawns."
14,a5,a7a5,rnbq1rk1/1pp2pbp/3p1np1/p2Pp3/2P1P3/2N1B3/PP2BPPP/R2QK1NR w KQ - 0 8,"?! I want to bring my QN to c5 to attack e4 and generally cause a nuisance, not such a good plan if White is really planning to play f3 and the Saemisch.  This early thrust inhibits White from playing a version of the Bayonet Attack with 8. b4, thus protecting c5 from disturbance.  Sometimes this is only played after the N has gone to c5 but that seems to be locking the stable door after the horse has bolted.  In retrospect, I think I would have been better preparing immediately for kingside action with 7...Ne8."
15,h4,h2h4,rnbq1rk1/1pp2pbp/3p1np1/p2Pp3/2P1P2P/2N1B3/PP2BPP1/R2QK1NR b KQ - 0 8,!? Unexpected - but maybe it shouldn't have been.  White beats Black to the first aggressive gesture on the kingside and this sets the tone of the game.  Black never gets to play a typical King's Indian strategy.
16,h5,h7h5,rnbq1rk1/1pp2pb1/3p1np1/p2Pp2p/2P1P2P/2N1B3/PP2BPP1/R2QK1NR w KQ - 0 9,"Ghastly memories of the thrashing I received at the hands of Martin's teammate, Paul Paxton-Doggett, earlier in the season, informed this move, designed to stop the pawn in its tracks."
17,f3,f2f3,rnbq1rk1/1pp2pb1/3p1np1/p2Pp2p/2P1P2P/2N1BP2/PP2B1P1/R2QK1NR b KQ - 0 9,"A dual purpose move, allowing Qd2 by preventing the annoying ...Ng4 and also supporting the potential pawn advance g4."
18,Na6,b8a6,r1bq1rk1/1pp2pb1/n2p1np1/p2Pp2p/2P1P2P/2N1BP2/PP2B1P1/R2QK1NR w KQ - 1 10,"This develops the N without blocking in the Bc8 and heads as planned for c5, whence it is ready for action on either wing, theoretically."
19,Nh3,g1h3,r1bq1rk1/1pp2pb1/n2p1np1/p2Pp2p/2P1P2P/2N1BP1N/PP2B1P1/R2QK2R b KQ - 2 10,"White also develops his N to the wing, clearly prepared to give up the chance of castling kingside."

21,Rxh3,h1h3,r2q1rk1/1pp2pb1/n2p1np1/p2Pp2p/2P1P2P/2N1BP1R/PP2B1P1/R2QK3 b Q - 0 11,The idea behind this move was to inhibit White's planned g-pawn advance since on g4 it would be pinned against the Rh3.  I hoped thereby to slow down White's attack sufficiently to generate some activity for myself.  This move also connects my Rooks.
22,Qd7,d8d7,r4rk1/1ppq1pb1/n2p1np1/p2Pp2p/2P1P2P/2N1BP1R/PP2B1P1/R2QK3 w Q - 1 12,The idea behind this move was to inhibit White's planned g-pawn advance since on g4 it would be pinned against the Rh3.

24,Kh7,g8h7,r4r2/1ppq1pbk/n2p1np1/p2Pp2p/2P1P2P/2N1BP1R/PP1QB1P1/R3K3 w Q - 3 13,"This move was played to prevent 13. Bh6.  It also gives Black's N another retreat square so that Black can possibly advance his f-pawn - but actually I was already feeling that it was too late to play such a move because White was already ready to play g4.  If Black played ...Ng8 followed by ...f5, he would merely be weakening his own kingside, with little prospect of getting an attack going."
25,O-O-O,e1c1,r4r2/1ppq1pbk/n2p1np1/p2Pp2p/2P1P2P/2N1BP1R/PP1QB1P1/2KR4 b - - 4 13,"Played so that if White swapped B for N on c5, Black wouldn't have to recapture with the d-pawn, thus giving White's advanced d-pawn scope for a future advance.  I think this was too slow though.  An immediate 13...Nc5 followed by ...a4 might have given Black the start of an attack, which at least would have given White cause to think about something other than his kingside attack.  White's B is much more concerned with the holes in Black's kingside anyway."

28,Nc5,a6c5,r4r2/2pq1pbk/1p1p1np1/p1nPp2p/2P1P2P/2N1BP1R/PP1QB1P1/2K3R1 w - - 2 15,Black finally gets his N where he wants it but it's a useless spectator for most of the game.

31,Bxh6,e3h6,r4r2/2pq1p1k/1p1p1npB/p1nPp2p/2P1P2P/2N2P1R/PPQ1B1P1/2K3R1 b - - 0 16,"I didn't think I could allow 18. g5+, when my Queen's discovered attack on the Rh3 would have been useless, though it would, of course still have discouraged 19. gxf6."
