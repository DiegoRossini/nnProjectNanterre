1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"All book up to here. This move is strange, and probably bad, but not terrible."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"All book up to here. This move is strange, and probably bad, but not terrible."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"All book up to here. This move is strange, and probably bad, but not terrible."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"All book up to here. This move is strange, and probably bad, but not terrible."
5,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 3,"All book up to here. This move is strange, and probably bad, but not terrible."
6,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 4 4,"All book up to here. This move is strange, and probably bad, but not terrible."
7,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 5 4,"All book up to here. This move is strange, and probably bad, but not terrible."
8,d6,d7d6,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/2b1p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"All book up to here. This move is strange, and probably bad, but not terrible."
9,Bd5,c4d5,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/2bBp3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,"All book up to here. This move is strange, and probably bad, but not terrible."
10,Bg4,c8g4,r2qk1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/2bBp3/4P1b1/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 6,I continue normally.
11,O-O,e1g1,r2qk1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/2bBp3/4P1b1/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 3 6,"A mistake. My knight can now position itself on d4, attacking the pinned piece where I can then destroy his kingside pawn structure. If I were white, I might have kicked out the bishop with h3 and g4, then attempt a long castle."
12,Nd4,c6d4,r2qk1nr/ppp2ppp/3p4/2bBp3/3nP1b1/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 4 7,"This seems to be a common attack (pinned king knight being attacked by a knight on d4, not this exact variation). I've been crushed by it a few times."
13,Bxb7,d5b7,r2qk1nr/pBp2ppp/3p4/2b1p3/3nP1b1/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,"Thinking he can safely take the pawn, it's hard to come up with anything better though. Surely 7. Kh1 Nxf3 8. gxf3 Bh3 9. Rg1 ... would have been better."
14,Nxf3+,d4f3,r2qk1nr/pBp2ppp/3p4/2b1p3/4P1b1/2N2n2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,8. Kh1? That was unexpected.
15,Kh1,g1h1,r2qk1nr/pBp2ppp/3p4/2b1p3/4P1b1/2N2n2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1R1K b kq - 1 8,8. Kh1? That was unexpected.
16,Nxh2,f3h2,r2qk1nr/pBp2ppp/3p4/2b1p3/4P1b1/2N5/PPPP1PPn/R1BQ1R1K w kq - 0 9,The crushing move.
17,Bc6+,b7c6,r2qk1nr/p1p2ppp/2Bp4/2b1p3/4P1b1/2N5/PPPP1PPn/R1BQ1R1K b kq - 1 9,"Didn't even consider an attempted counter, but it is easily handled."
18,Kf8,e8f8,r2q1knr/p1p2ppp/2Bp4/2b1p3/4P1b1/2N5/PPPP1PPn/R1BQ1R1K w - - 2 10,9. ... Ke7 10. Nd5+ Ke6 would be slightly dangerous.
19,Ne2,c3e2,r2q1knr/p1p2ppp/2Bp4/2b1p3/4P1b1/8/PPPPNPPn/R1BQ1R1K b - - 3 10,Another mistake.
20,Qh4,d8h4,r4knr/p1p2ppp/2Bp4/2b1p3/4P1bq/8/PPPPNPPn/R1BQ1R1K w - - 4 11,"The rook must not be taken yet, let's not get hasty."
21,Kg1,h1g1,r4knr/p1p2ppp/2Bp4/2b1p3/4P1bq/8/PPPPNPPn/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 5 11,The final mistake allowing mate. The best option was 11. Ng1 Nxf1+ 12. Nh3 Bxd1 which is also devastating.
22,Nf3+,h2f3,r4knr/p1p2ppp/2Bp4/2b1p3/4P1bq/5n2/PPPPNPP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 6 12,Forced.
23,gxf3,g2f3,r4knr/p1p2ppp/2Bp4/2b1p3/4P1bq/5P2/PPPPNP2/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 12,Forced.
24,Bxf3,g4f3,r4knr/p1p2ppp/2Bp4/2b1p3/4P2q/5b2/PPPPNP2/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 13,"White resigns with mate in one. He could try 13. Ng3, but then Qxg3#. Anything else allows Qh1#"
