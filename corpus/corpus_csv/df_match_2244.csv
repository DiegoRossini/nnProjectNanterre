7,Nxd4,f3d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,... so that white equalises. Lancelot is now on the center.

9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,logical move
10,a6,a7a6,rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,To prevent 6. Nb5
11,Nb3,d4b3,rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/4P3/1NN5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"Later or sooner, Lancelot will have to retreat (if 6. ... e5)."

14,e6,e7e6,r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1nppn2/8/4P3/1NN5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,Classical sicilian pawn structure
15,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1nppn2/8/4P3/1NN5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 8,Long castle was another option.

20,Qc7,d8c7,r1b2rk1/1pq1bppp/p1nppn2/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 6 11,Probably to menace the c3 knight if 11.b3. It also aims at h2.
21,Bf3,e2f3,r1b2rk1/1pq1bppp/p1nppn2/8/3NP3/2N1BB2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 7 11,"Menacing c6, defending e4 in case of 11. d5 but forbiding 12. Nf3. White is stronger at the center but the position is not very comfortable. I have the impression that black has more available options"
