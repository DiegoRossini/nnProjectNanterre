1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was a realtime blitz, 5 min + 20 seconds each. As my opponent was rated somewhere in between the area of equal to better than me, I decided to go with an opening in which I'm really comfortable.  Comments are welcome on this game. I'm an amateur and relatively inexperienced player who has recently begun to study and play chess more seriously."
