8,Bxb4,c5b4,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/1bB1P3/5N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,The challenge is accepted.
9,c3,c2c3,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/1bB1P3/2P2N2/P2P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"There are a few typical responses (5...Ba5) maintains a pin on c3, but allows Qb3 with pressure on f7. (5...Bc5)  loses tempo after d2-d4, but does allow ...Na5. And finally the text move, which is considered the strongest response and allows ...Na5 to prevent an early attack on f7."

11,d4,d2d4,r1bqk1nr/ppppbppp/2n5/4p3/2BPP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"!? More usual is ...exd4, but the text move has some benefits of creating an off balance situation for white who now has to consider what to do about the attack on the bishop."

13,Bxf7+,c4f7,r1bqk1nr/ppppbBpp/8/n3p3/3PP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,"!? Not a guarantee of a win by any means, but this certainly creates a disruption for black who is encouraged to recapture with the king, a move which loses tempo by another check on the next move. This move was played in the adventurous spirit of the opening."
14,Kxf7,e8f7,r1bq2nr/ppppbkpp/8/n3p3/3PP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 0 8,This looks better than keeping the king in the open.

17,Qh5,d1h5,r1bq1knr/ppppb1pp/8/n3N2Q/3PP3/2P5/P4PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 2 9,"?! I continue the attack, but with some reservations that this move may be a little soon. I had considered Nd2 or 0-0 as good alternatives."
18,Qe8,d8e8,r1b1qknr/ppppb1pp/8/n3N2Q/3PP3/2P5/P4PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 3 10,Stops the threat of Qf7#
19,Qf3+,h5f3,r1b1qknr/ppppb1pp/8/n3N3/3PP3/2P2Q2/P4PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 4 10,"I know the queen has to retreat from future persecution, and do so with a parting check."
20,Nf6,g8f6,r1b1qk1r/ppppb1pp/5n2/n3N3/3PP3/2P2Q2/P4PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 5 11,Sensible because it offers the king the g7 square to break the pin.
21,O-O,e1g1,r1b1qk1r/ppppb1pp/5n2/n3N3/3PP3/2P2Q2/P4PPP/RNB2RK1 b - - 6 11,Activates the rook.

24,Bg4,c8g4,r3qk1r/ppp1b1pp/3p1n2/n7/3PP1b1/2PN1Q2/P4PPP/RNB2RK1 w - - 2 13,! The computer cracks out a good move which forces the decision to lose the pin or keep a piece.
25,Qf4,f3f4,r3qk1r/ppp1b1pp/3p1n2/n7/3PPQb1/2PN4/P4PPP/RNB2RK1 b - - 3 13,"!? I decide to play on in a risky manner. Hiarcs9 calls my move questionable and attaches a ?, but I have a plan and am not going to let something minor like losing a piece to get in the way."
26,Be2,g4e2,r3qk1r/ppp1b1pp/3p1n2/n7/3PPQ2/2PN4/P3bPPP/RNB2RK1 w - - 4 14,"Choices, choices. Save a rook? Save a knight?"
