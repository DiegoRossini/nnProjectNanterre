Lessons to learn

1.) Make sure if back rank mate is a possibility don't move pieces that can stop it
This may seem like common sense but 20.Qxe6+?? may have seen like an OK move but because of the threat of back rank it turned out to cost white the game.(Although he was already down by 4 points)
2.) When facing attacks on rooks on the a1-h8 and h1-a8 diagonals always make sure you can protect these
3.) b3,b6,g3,g6 are generally good squares for the queen as they force the opposition to be on guard for a possible mate and also means they can quickly hope onto the a1-h8 and h1-a8 diagonals"
