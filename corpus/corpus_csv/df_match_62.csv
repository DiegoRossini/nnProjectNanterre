A lot of possible moves, too hard for me going through all them. 1) I move the R, and the fork trheat is still ""on"". But dxe3, and if I get the piece, exf2+. Scary. 2) I take one piece and let my R to be taken: exB, and if BxR, exc7, and the Q has to move. Enough? 3) I take the N, and if BxR, fxg7, threatening the R, say Rg8, Bh6. Enough? 4) Block the B's diagonal. With f3 (dxe3 still looks dangerous for me), 5) with e4, and finally 6) with Nf3. 
Very hard decision in a blitz."
