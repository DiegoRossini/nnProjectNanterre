Black has moved 6 of his 8 pawns, developed only one piece so far and still he's the one striking at the center. On top of that he has a weakened K-side, a backward pawn on an open file and he's still some moves away from castling. Classical Grandmasters would have been appalled at playing like this. Yet, practice has proven it to be one of the toughest nuts to crack against e4. Maybe there will come a day when computers will prove it to be unsound but until that day human players having the White side will have to solve the Sveshnikov problem themselves."

If the Knight was on a more normal square, Black would have a lost positional game. So many White players, my opponent included, favor an early re-routing of the Knight to a better square."

This seems a little counter intuitive since opposite color Bishop endgames are very drawish but this works exactly the opposite with extra pieces. Even with only a pair of Rooks on the board, the side attacking can make the Bishop feel like a full extra piece. Things are even more clear cut when Queens are still in play."
