Ne2 may be slightly better as this leaves the d4 knight hanging and the other pieces on the wrong side of the board.  However, Ne2 would allow Bf3, which could be annoying."

Bxg5 is better, this removes the bishop from the game.  It'll sit on the sidelines and watch the rest of the game.  I believe the intention was to capture black's d pawn, but the pawn can be protected by either c5 or Be3."
