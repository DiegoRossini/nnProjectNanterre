4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"Until now, we have a standard opening. Here, Black departs from the standard response, which would have been 3...Nf6. However, he plays it on the next move."

White's formation is approaching an approximation of the Colle-Zukertort System. Meanwhile, Black has been advancing his kingside pawns without doing anything about king safety. Indeed, king safety becomes a problem for Black before long."

In the mainline Colle-Zukertort System, White's queenside bishop moves to b2 to exert additional pressure on the a1-h8 diagonal; indeed, this is the purpose of playing b3 in the first place. Nonetheless, White's formation still holds Black's pawns at d5 and e6 and causes mobility problems for Black."

For example, if Black played 16...dxc4, White could recapture with 17.Nxc4, attacking the queen and leaving it with no way to escape. On the other hand, if Black ignored White's pawn on c4, the pawn could advance on the next turn to c5 and threaten the queen directly. Black would have responses that save the queen, but most would come at a cost."
