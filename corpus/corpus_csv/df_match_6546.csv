7,c3,c2c3,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2NP4/2P5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,I don't know why he castled king side (although I do sometimes)

9,Qc2,d1c2,rnbq1rk1/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2NP4/2P5/PPQ1PPPP/R1B1KBNR b KQ - 2 5,A very good queen position.

11,Bg5,c1g5,r1bq1rk1/ppppppbp/n4np1/6B1/2NP4/2P5/PPQ1PPPP/R3KBNR b KQ - 4 6,I would not take the knight because bishops are worth slightly more than knights (but still a very good move because pawns are worth less than knights.

13,O-O-O,e1c1,r1bq1rk1/ppppppbp/n5p1/6Bn/2NP4/2P5/PPQ1PPPP/2KR1BNR b - - 6 7,Queen-side castling is much better because King-side castling would be stuck in the corner and would get checkmated easily.
