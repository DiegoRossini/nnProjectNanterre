This is the Kings Indian Defense - 4 pawns attack mini-tournament and the third game in my Glenda on h6 theme and this is the happiest outcome of the lot!  Although I do not get to deliver mate, a trade off between Glenda and the Wicked Witch of the West results in a decisive gain of material in my favour.  Wanna see how, well read on ....."

13,d5,d4d5,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2pP4/2P1PP2/2N2N2/PP4PP/R1BQKB1R b KQ - 0 7,8. ....... Bxe6 - the wall has at last been breached by a pawn trade on e6.  Now I need to develop my back row and I start with Fou Leblanc who moves to d3 to clear the way for kingside castling.

Fatcat2 parries the threat with Ne8 - it does make the knight passive though but can I exploit this.  Hmm, read on......"

I decided to let my opponent trade first because Glenda sneaks onto d2 ready for destination h6.  Notice that after the trade I will take the opportunity to rid myself of my backward pawn on e4 which will open up a line for Fou Leblanc through to h7 to give me more attacking options.
