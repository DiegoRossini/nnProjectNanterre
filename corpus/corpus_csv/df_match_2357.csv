1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Message from one of our club players. ""Good attack by black using the diagonals, indeed, particularly interested because I had the impression white was better after the development. But what puzzled me more are the king's move (from both sides). I very seldom move my king, except to face an immediate threat and, I saw no such threats in your game. I also was surprised by one of your queen's move. I would be interested in seeing annotations about it."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,So this annotated game is in response to the club players questions. Often king moves fall under two rationales #1 king safety and #2 Waiting move. you will see the later sometimes in quiet positional positions such as in this game.

13,f3,f2f3,r1bqkb1r/1p1npppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,My favored response when playing white. The idea is to setup for a quick king side attack with g4-g5 and h4-h5

17,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkb1r/1p1n1pp1/p2ppn2/7p/2BNP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3K2R b KQkq - 1 9,?! not seen very often for good reason. The only reason white would want to play Bc4 is to put pressure on f7 which is only effective after black has committed his e-pawn to e5. So this move is an easy one to exploit.
18,Ne5,d7e5,r1bqkb1r/1p3pp1/p2ppn2/4n2p/2BNP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3K2R w KQkq - 2 10,gaining valuable tempo by attacking the hanging bishop and driving it to a less desirable square.  Though the tempo gain is temporary you will see quite a few of these kinds of moves from black in this game. The idea behind it is that white is forced to move a piece twice(the definition of poor piece placement and losing tempo). Only to have black develop another piece
19,Bb3,c4b3,r1bqkb1r/1p3pp1/p2ppn2/4n2p/3NP3/1BN1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3K2R b KQkq - 3 10,Also playable is 10. Be2. Even though it may look counter productive it may in the long run prove sounder than 10. Bb3. The rationale for this is that white's main idea is to play g2-g4-g5. Having the bishop on e2 supports that. furthermore many white players like placing a knight on b3 to contest the c5-strong point.
20,Qc7,d8c7,r1b1kb1r/1pq2pp1/p2ppn2/4n2p/3NP3/1BN1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3K2R w KQkq - 4 11,I am currently badgering my club students about the importance of developing pieces over moving pawns. In the alternative white must commit to queen side castling before playing the ... b5 ideas For example if 10...b5? right now then  11. O-O-O Bb7 12. Bg5 Qa5 13. Kb1 Nc4 14. Bxc4 bxc4 15. Rhe1 Rb8 16. Nf5 +/-
21,O-O-O,e1c1,r1b1kb1r/1pq2pp1/p2ppn2/4n2p/3NP3/1BN1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR3R b kq - 5 11,A little bit of saber rattling on my part. The Sicilian is often a game of inches and pawns. The Alternative 11...Be7 is just as strong if not stronger. But then again it does not give my opponent something to think about like 11...b5 does!
22,b5,b7b5,r1b1kb1r/2q2pp1/p2ppn2/1p2n2p/3NP3/1BN1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR3R w kq - 0 12,A little bit of saber rattling on my part. The Sicilian is often a game of inches and pawns. The Alternative 11...Be7 is just as strong if not stronger. But then again it does not give my opponent something to think about like 11...b5 does!
23,Kb1,c1b1,r1b1kb1r/2q2pp1/p2ppn2/1p2n2p/3NP3/1BN1BP2/PPPQ2PP/1K1R3R b kq - 1 12,Why 12.Kb1? The rationale is that it improves the king's safety by getting him off the hotly contested c-file and allows the white pieces congested on the d-file a little freedom to unravel themselves. I suspect that white wants to setup a powerful battering ram along f2-h7 diagonal with Qf2.  It also will give the d1-rook strength along the d-file.
24,Nc4,e5c4,r1b1kb1r/2q2pp1/p2ppn2/1p5p/2nNP3/1BN1BP2/PPPQ2PP/1K1R3R w kq - 2 13,forcing white to give up the bishop pair. Which right now is not significant but it will be later on. Plus the pawn on c4 acts like a wedge in white's position making it difficult for him to free himself.
25,Bxc4,b3c4,r1b1kb1r/2q2pp1/p2ppn2/1p5p/2BNP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/1K1R3R b kq - 0 13,A player can not go on the offensive he is tripping over himself! Also I  have created a new opening along the b-file.
26,bxc4,b5c4,r1b1kb1r/2q2pp1/p2ppn2/7p/2pNP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/1K1R3R w kq - 0 14,A player can not go on the offensive he is tripping over himself! Also I  have created a new opening along the b-file.
27,h3,h2h3,r1b1kb1r/2q2pp1/p2ppn2/7p/2pNP3/2N1BP1P/PPPQ2P1/1K1R3R b kq - 0 14,"?! White's only hope of freeing himself is on the d-file. This is why I was expecting 14. Nde2 Bb7 15. Bf4 Rd8 16. Qe3 Nd7 17. Bg5 Rb8 =. This by the way is a great example of how improving piece position before moving a pawn could have maybe lead white to the better line. However, white wants to play g2-g4-g5. Something I can not stop effectively so I try to counter balance it with threats of my own."
28,Rb8,a8b8,1rb1kb1r/2q2pp1/p2ppn2/7p/2pNP3/2N1BP1P/PPPQ2P1/1K1R3R w k - 1 15,A rook aiming straight down to the enemy king makes sense right?
29,g4,g2g4,1rb1kb1r/2q2pp1/p2ppn2/7p/2pNP1P1/2N1BP1P/PPPQ4/1K1R3R b k - 0 15,forced

32,g6,g7g6,1rb1kb1r/2qn1p2/p2pp1p1/7p/2pNP1P1/2N1BP1P/PPP1Q3/1K1R3R w k - 0 17,everything is dead level at this point. We are 16 moves in and I am still not ready to castle! My intend to play ...Bg7 with great influence along the central dark diagonal
33,Qd2,e2d2,1rb1kb1r/2qn1p2/p2pp1p1/7p/2pNP1P1/2N1BP1P/PPPQ4/1K1R3R b k - 1 17,"I think white is bidding his time, waiting for me to get impatient and over commit. I have a great deal of strength in these types of positions where there are only tiny advantages."
