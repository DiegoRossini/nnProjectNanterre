1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I started a thematic tournament with the Nimzo-Indian defense in order to learn this opening better. It's a good way to explore an opening and to see if a particular opening works for you. You get to play quite a few games with that opening from both the White and Black sides, picking up practice with the common middlegame positions in that opening."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"I have always preferred the classical variation of the Nimzo-Indian defense. White develops the queen prematurely, but there are two main reasons behind this early queen development:

1. If Black plays Bxc3 , white can recapture with the queen, avoiding doubled pawns on the c-file.
2. The queen on c2 supports the pawn thrust e4.

In this game, I allowed the dpubled pawns anyway, and used the c2-queen to help the e-pawn move to e4 in one go."
