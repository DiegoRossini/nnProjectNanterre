1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"As usual, my standard."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Nf6 is also very playable.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Ive been playing around with this move, as it allows a transposition into the QGA (one of my standards) while also preparing 0-0 a little faster than the ""normal"" response of 2. c4."
4,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1p1pp/8/3p1p2/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"Here, the first thought I had was that my opponent's name was very fitting. I can tell that he plans to dominate e4 and that Nf6 is coming very soon. I must admit, at this point I was a little concerned. My opponent is stronger than I, and I am now out of my ""book""."
5,Bf4,c1f4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1p1pp/8/3p1p2/3P1B2/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"Developing my dark squared bishop in such a way that I can play e3. I really don't have a sense of where this game is going yet, but realize that maintaining my lead in development should be one of my priorities."
6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/4p3/3p1p2/3P1B2/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"?! I really expected Nf6. While it is still very early, start keeping an eye on black's light squared bishop. It is very weak, and needs to be exploited."
7,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/4p3/3p1p2/3P1B2/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"I also considered Nbd2, with the idea of playing Rc1 and then pushing my c pawn. I opted for e3, however, as it hastens castling."
8,Bd6,f8d6,rnbqk1nr/ppp3pp/3bp3/3p1p2/3P1B2/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"Black finally develops a piece, and begs me to exchange it off. As my own dark squared bishop is somewhat threatened by an aggressive (yet risky) play of g5, I opt to oblige him. In doing so, black is faced with the decision of re-taking with his queen or c pawn, and either way his resulting position will be somewhat unbalanced."
9,Bxd6,f4d6,rnbqk1nr/ppp3pp/3Bp3/3p1p2/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"He chooses to re-take with his queen. It is here that I realize that the c5 square is potentially very weak, as he can play Nd7 followed by a very strong c5!"
10,Qxd6,d8d6,rnb1k1nr/ppp3pp/3qp3/3p1p2/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"He chooses to re-take with his queen. It is here that I realize that the c5 square is potentially very weak, as he can play Nd7 followed by a very strong c5!"
11,a3,a2a3,rnb1k1nr/ppp3pp/3qp3/3p1p2/3P4/P3PN2/1PP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,This move accomplishes 2 things - it prevents Qb4  (threatening b2) and also prepares the threat of playing b4.
12,c6,c7c6,rnb1k1nr/pp4pp/2pqp3/3p1p2/3P4/P3PN2/1PP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"? Not sure what he was planning here. I assumed he would develop a piece - either Nf6, Nd7, or Bd7. I see this move as accomplishing more for me than for him, as his Nb8 is restricted even further."
13,c4,c2c4,rnb1k1nr/pp4pp/2pqp3/3p1p2/2PP4/P3PN2/1P3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"Ok - time to start forcing black into making some tough decisions. If he takes, then I develop my light squared bishop with some aggressive tempo. If he doesn't take, I can play c5 (which locks the pawns up and gives me a space advantage on the queenside)."
14,Nf6,g8f6,rnb1k2r/pp4pp/2pqpn2/3p1p2/2PP4/P3PN2/1P3PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,"Finally! The e4 square is a very aggressive post, and I know he wants to get this knight there."
15,c5,c4c5,rnb1k2r/pp4pp/2pqpn2/2Pp1p2/3P4/P3PN2/1P3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,Hello space advantage:)
16,Qe7,d6e7,rnb1k2r/pp2q1pp/2p1pn2/2Pp1p2/3P4/P3PN2/1P3PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 1 9,"I think a retreat to c7 was stronger, as Qa5  is a move that I would have to deal with. By making this more passive move, black is allowing me to continue to be the aggressor."
17,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1k2r/pp2q1pp/2p1pn2/2Pp1p2/3P4/P1N1PN2/1P3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 2 9,A developing move which hits his destination square of e4.
18,Nbd7,b8d7,r1b1k2r/pp1nq1pp/2p1pn2/2Pp1p2/3P4/P1N1PN2/1P3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 3 10,"I can see him wanting to get developed, but this move even further restricts his light squared bishop. Maybe he intends to play b6? I think 0-0 may have been a stronger play."
19,Bd3,f1d3,r1b1k2r/pp1nq1pp/2p1pn2/2Pp1p2/3P4/P1NBPN2/1P3PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 4 10,"Another developing move which hits e4. Now I envision 0-0 for myself with the plan of starting an attack. Where? I have no idea, but I will have a strong lead in development which I can use aggressively."
20,O-O,e8g8,r1b2rk1/pp1nq1pp/2p1pn2/2Pp1p2/3P4/P1NBPN2/1P3PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 5 11,"Black secures his king, and obviously wants to start raising Cain on the kingside."
21,b4,b2b4,r1b2rk1/pp1nq1pp/2p1pn2/2Pp1p2/1P1P4/P1NBPN2/5PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 11,? I guess I just wanted to secure my domination of the queenside. 0-0 was probably a better play though.
