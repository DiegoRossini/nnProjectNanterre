1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"This game features a very critical line against the Reti move order, 1. Nf3 d5 2. c4.  By responding 2...d4, Black enters a Benoni reversed, but with an extra tempo for White.  White can counter 3. b4, or as in this game, 3. g3, intending to undermine the center with Re1 and e3."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,Black has given up the light squares in the center with his 2nd move.  White intends to exploit this.

6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/8/2Pp4/5NP1/PP1PPP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,"Entering a Schmidt-Benoni, where White has an easier time breaking up the Black center.  3...c5 is not only the most popular, but probably the most critical line."
7,d3,d2d3,r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/8/2Pp4/3P1NP1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"5...f5, is a more ambitious choice, but White is fine either way."

Qxb4 b6!? 11. c5, rejecting the win of the exchange to keep the light-squares around his castled position intact.  Nigel Davies in his book on the Reti, believes that 7...Bxb4 is Black's best option."

Here Black forces the knight to move without the option of exchanging itself for the f6 knight.  Black has a space advantage, and any exchanges will only favor the cramped player."
