1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

This is my return game with Coach Ion as black in the King's Indian 4 Pawns Attack.  In this game I achieved only my second High Draw against him.  Between the two draws I have had some really bad games, including the King's Indian 4 Pawns Attack as White in which I blundered a piece after walking into a pin and never recovered.  Also, that game Pipped at the Post was only a pretence of a contest, although Ion got his checkmate in first I was never really in that game.  Then there was this shocker - I think Be6 was the loser - I followed the database and I think that that move should be given the skull and crossbones http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=13392792&fb=1&rnd=0.7322375019235583 - do you the Jury agree on that one?  Anyhow, I will take you to move 6 in this game ......"
