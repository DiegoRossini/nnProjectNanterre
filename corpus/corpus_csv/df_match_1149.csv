1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"While I know 1. e4 c5 is statistically the best response for black I've been studying the Kings Indian and various King side fianchetto openings lately and they're, I'm finding, much better suited for my style of play. Discovered attacks on my opponents queenside rook are becoming much more common. (I do want to note that as White I've been opening with g3 almost exclusively but after studying a lot of games I've now gone back to e4 though my hope most of the time is to develop into a Kings Indian or variation there of.)"

3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,He is making a strong play for center control and I'm preparing for a quick king side castle.

5,h4,h2h4,rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/8/3PP2P/8/PPP2PP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"h4 here really threw me off. I don't like h4 personally... especially in this situation. Nc3, Nf3 or even c4 would probably be a much better response here. I'll sometimes play h4 if I fianchetto king side (usually in a KIA) but thats usually much later in the opening. I'm really not sure what he was trying to do here. Maybe nf3, ng5, attacking the f7 square? I played d7 defending the center and allowing for development into either a Kings Indian Fianchetto Variation or maybe a Sicillian Dragon. To be honest, I play the position I try not to pay too much attention to the openings names. I am citing them here simply because it may help others look into what I'm playing here."

7,h5,h4h5,rnbqk1nr/ppp1ppbp/3p2p1/7P/3PP3/8/PPP2PP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,I don't know why he wanted to attack so quickly at g6. I guess he was trying to destroy my protection on the king side if I were to castle early... I didn't like this move so I accepted the quick trade.

I know that it was not a good move, but for me I sometimes make plays based on reading the person. I felt confident in this move and felt that the knight wouldn't be an issue. My goal here was to get the queen side rook eventually. Sometimes when I play blitz games I base my moves on feel. Kind of like poker I felt confident I was reading my opponent here."
