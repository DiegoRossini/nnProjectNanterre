Here we see one of the first great chess masters, Gioachino Greco, in action. While Greco is credited with developing some gambits, his main contribution to chess was to publish witty collections of games that illustrate his theories. Greco considered the following one of his best games."
2,b6,b7b6,rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/1p6/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The Queen's Fianchetto opening. An early fianchetto by Black shows a willingness to defend against a big pawn center, picking away at it from the wings. In ceding so much territory, Black must be on constant guard against direct attacks on the King, as this game amply illustrates."
