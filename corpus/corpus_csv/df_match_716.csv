14,d5,d7d5,r1bqk2r/p1p2ppp/2p2n2/3p4/1b2P3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,un-doubling the pawns while at the same time increasing the scope of his LSB and queen. Black is following a common theme in the Scottish game which is to hit at and liquidate the e4-pawn. Here he succeeds in getting white's center pawns of the board but at the expense of freeing the d3-bishop. Such wide open spaces often suit the bishop pair.
15,exd5,e4d5,r1bqk2r/p1p2ppp/2p2n2/3P4/1b6/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,putting the question mark on the bishop and forcing black to decide what to do retreat or exchange.

18,Be7,b4e7,r1bqk2r/p1p1bppp/5n2/3p4/8/P1NB4/1PP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 10,This is IMO slightly more accurate than 9....Bxc3 as in one resent correspondence game white manage to make good use of his bishop pair after 10.bxc3 0-0 11. 0-0 Qd6 12. Qf3 Ba6 13. Bf4
19,Bf4,c1f4,r1bqk2r/p1p1bppp/5n2/3p4/5B2/P1NB4/1PP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 2 10,Develpoing the bishop to a very active square and hitting at the weak c7 pawn.
20,c6,c7c6,r1bqk2r/p3bppp/2p2n2/3p4/5B2/P1NB4/1PP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 11,shores up d5 but not that threatening more active is 10...c5!? with counter play.

Therefore, I saw no need to create a weakness in front of my castled king position. It is often advised to now move the pawns in front of the castled king unless absolutely necessary."

For example, if black did try the immediate 12...c5 white could now counter with 13.c4 and black's counter chances are all but stopped and settled with a backward c-pawn that could be a target."

33,Bg3,f4g3,r3r1k1/pb2bppp/5n2/2p2q2/N7/P5B1/1P3PPP/R2QRBK1 b - - 3 17,despite having the bishop pair kicked around abit the position is dynamically equal due to white's strong presence in the center and black having a isolated c-pawn.
34,Bf8,e7f8,r3rbk1/pb3ppp/5n2/2p2q2/N7/P5B1/1P3PPP/R2QRBK1 w - - 4 18,Neither side is willing to commit to an attack. So black quickly offers a trade and tries to force a draw.
