1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,A game from a real-time tournament which I would like to highly recommend as a game in which my opponent was slowly squeezed out of life!

4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"The Marshall Defence. This is quite common in minor tournament level, like this one - in fact I had been faced with the Marshall Defence in the game before this one - but it is considered anti-positional at the highest levels, as after 3.cxd5 Nxc5 4.e4 White has as superior position and excellent control of the centre with tempo as the knight must flee. The creator of the Marshall Defence, Frank Marshall, ditched it after losing with it to Alexander Alekhine at the Baden-Baden tournament of 1925 - that should tell you what HE thought of his opening..."

Black goes for the more open and flexible choice 4...Nb6, so I restrain my eager central pawns and hurry with my pieces' development."

For the first time in this game, I was completely dumbfounded and stunned as I watched his king slowly roll of the table. So many times in my career I have had a massive positional advantage but was unable to convert it into a win and have had to settle for a draw - but this time I didn't even need to convert it for my opponent to resign. But the thing that surprised me was that it seems to me that, at least in the short term, Black's position can at least be held. He is beginning to break through my positional blockade, and my attack might not last long - for example, after 22...Kh7 (only move, as 22...Kh8 23.Qg8#) 23.Qg7  Kg6 and what then? How do I press my attack? And should Black have resigned?"
