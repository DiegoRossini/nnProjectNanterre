1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I am not familiar with this opening against the queen's gambit. It may have merit, but it looks to me like it doesn't offer control over the center."
2,f6,f7f6,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/5p2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I am not familiar with this opening against the queen's gambit. It may have merit, but it looks to me like it doesn't offer control over the center."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/5p2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Notice how control is now focused on the 5 line instead of the 5/4 lines. This gives white a full 33% more space with which to maneuver
4,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1pp1pp/2p2p2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Notice how control is now focused on the 5 line instead of the 5/4 lines. This gives white a full 33% more space with which to maneuver

7,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pp1p2pp/2p1pp2/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,White solidifies control of the center. Pay attention to whites development options as compared to black. White can all backrow pieces except rooks and can support/defend pawns that are pushed
8,Qa5,d8a5,rnb1kbnr/pp1p2pp/2p1pp2/q7/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"This is most likely too early. If you bring your queen out while everyone has a lot of material on the board, not only does it reduce its effectiveness because there are fewer spaces it can threaten, but it gives the opponent a chance to threaten it. Would you make Qc7 on this turn? If no, then don't move the queen, leave her be. The queen is actually in a pretty good starting position, so long as you get the pieces around her out of the way"
9,Bd2,c1d2,rnb1kbnr/pp1p2pp/2p1pp2/q7/2PPP3/2N5/PP1B1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 2 5,I can develop my bishop while also putting pressure on the queen. The queen being out front is now a liability
10,Qb6,a5b6,rnb1kbnr/pp1p2pp/1qp1pp2/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP1B1PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 3 6,"Again a liability. Qb2 leads to trading the queen for a rook (iirc) and so full retreat is the best move. This has given white three free moves (Bd2 to threaten, c5 to threaten again, and then the next move after. Note that it also locks out blacks black bishop from moving aggressively past the front"
11,c5,c4c5,rnb1kbnr/pp1p2pp/1qp1pp2/2P5/3PP3/2N5/PP1B1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,"Again a liability. Qb2 leads to trading the queen for a rook (iirc) and so full retreat is the best move.

12,Qc7,b6c7,rnb1kbnr/ppqp2pp/2p1pp2/2P5/3PP3/2N5/PP1B1PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 1 7,"Don't be afraid of putting the piece back where it started if that is the best move. Not sure it is or not, but something to think about."
13,Nf3,g1f3,rnb1kbnr/ppqp2pp/2p1pp2/2P5/3PP3/2N2N2/PP1B1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 2 7,"More development, preparing to castle."
14,g5,g7g5,rnb1kbnr/ppqp3p/2p1pp2/2P3p1/3PP3/2N2N2/PP1B1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,"I am not sure there are better moves, but this one is particularly bad. g5 leaves f6 a weak pawn. Notice how there are no pawns behind it supporting? Once f6 falls so does g5. So i attack the f6 pawn. This also has the advantage of locking out the queen from being able to pressure on its long diagonal."
15,e5,e4e5,rnb1kbnr/ppqp3p/2p1pp2/2P1P1p1/3P4/2N2N2/PP1B1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,"At this point i feel like the game is irrevocably won for white. Black has none of his backline developed, does not have a strong defense in the event of a king side castle, and is many moves away from a queen side. I attack the weak pawn and move my knight forward to exploit this poor defense"

The fork at Ng6 ensures that black cannot castle and trades a knight for a bishop in a game without strong diagonal pawn lines. Diagonal pawn lines constrain bishops in ways that don't constrain knights. So this trade is definitely in the favor of white. This move also makes e6 a weak pawn. Which will be exploited as soon as the knight is out of danger
