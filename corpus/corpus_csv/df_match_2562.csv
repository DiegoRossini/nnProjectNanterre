1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"A Big Peta Students club Mini-Tournament game.  Excellent defending by black and a few mistakes by white led to a long close game.  Wanting to gauge my assessment, I requested computer analysis -after- completing the annotation."
2,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"1. ...d6, apparently the Pirc defense.  I have never played it or played against it."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,2. d4 gives white some space to work with early and hinders black by controlling his fourth rank.  Perhaps a disadvantage of the Pirc?
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pp1p/3p2p1/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,2. ...g6 lays some groundwork to challenge the center.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pp1p/3p2p1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"4. f4.  I come to like and regret this move equally, the main downside being that several squares (e4, g3, g4, and f3) are weakened.  Benefits similar to d4."
6,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk1nr/ppp1ppbp/3p2p1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"4. f4.  I come to like and regret this move equally, the main downside being that several squares (e4, g3, g4, and f3) are weakened.  Benefits similar to d4."
7,f4,f2f4,rnbqk1nr/ppp1ppbp/3p2p1/8/3PPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"4. f4.  I come to like and regret this move equally, the main downside being that several squares (e4, g3, g4, and f3) are weakened.  Benefits similar to d4."
8,f6,f7f6,rnbqk1nr/ppp1p1bp/3p1pp1/8/3PPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"4. f6.  A strange move by black.  Seems to put delays on the N and B getting in to play.  Probably setting up e5?  If white develops an advantage, it may be traceable to 1. ...d6 and 4. ...f6. [computer agrees, prefers 4. ...Nf6.  computer does not mind 1. ...d6]"
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk1nr/ppp1p1bp/3p1pp1/8/3PPP2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"5. ...Nc6.  Following a lot of early pawn moves on both sides, minor pieces are getting in to the game."
10,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk1nr/ppp1p1bp/2np1pp1/8/3PPP2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,"5. ...Nc6.  Following a lot of early pawn moves on both sides, minor pieces are getting in to the game."

12,e5,e7e5,r1bqk1nr/ppp3bp/2np1pp1/4p3/3PPP2/2N1BN2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"6. ...e5 as expected.  An exchange here favors black, so..."
13,Qd2,d1d2,r1bqk1nr/ppp3bp/2np1pp1/4p3/3PPP2/2N1BN2/PPPQ2PP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 1 7,"White plays 7. Qd2 preparing to castle.  Black also passes on a capture, and plays..."
14,Bg4,c8g4,r2qk1nr/ppp3bp/2np1pp1/4p3/3PPPb1/2N1BN2/PPPQ2PP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 2 8,"7. ...Bg4, clearing off some of his back rank.  Still an edge in development for white."
15,Be2,f1e2,r2qk1nr/ppp3bp/2np1pp1/4p3/3PPPb1/2N1BN2/PPPQB1PP/R3K2R b KQkq - 3 8,"8. ...f5.  Hmm, it's getting crowded.  All pieces and all pawns still on the board.  Still unhappy with the prospects of an exchange..."
16,f5,f6f5,r2qk1nr/ppp3bp/2np2p1/4pp2/3PPPb1/2N1BN2/PPPQB1PP/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 9,"8. ...f5.  Hmm, it's getting crowded.  All pieces and all pawns still on the board.  Still unhappy with the prospects of an exchange..."

19,O-O-O,e1c1,r2qk1nr/ppp1n1bp/3p2p1/3Ppp2/4PPb1/2N1BN2/PPPQB1PP/2KR3R b kq - 2 10,"10. O-O-O adds a rook to the pressure on the center, ...perhaps useful if thing open up.  Black's king and queen are starting to look like targets.  Perhaps an idea around which to build a plan (the plan to this point having been to take advantage of the space advantage gained with those early pawn moves by placing my pieces to greatest advantage).  Other than the B on g4, I'm reasonably happy with the position here."

24,Qd7,d8d7,r3k1nr/pppqn1bp/3p2p1/3Pp3/4NP2/4BB2/PPPQ2PP/2KR3R w kq - 1 13,"12. ...Qd7.  The queen and king are both still potential targets.  And now I'm thinking it might also be useful to prevent black from castling, thereby delaying his rooks getting into the game while also keeping his king from getting to a safe location."
