1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"In this game I will continue to use the d4 opening which has proven to be effective against most players here on GK, I want to thank eesther for the challenge, as he is undefeated to everyone here besides myself."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,d5 is a solid move for center control
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"This is a book move and is made most of the time, depending on how black plays, Nf3 was considered also."
4,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,protects the center pawn
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"Now I play the other move now, Nc3 was also a move I liked more than c5."
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,Black continues to develop Nf6
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 4,my second N is developed to Nc3
8,a6,a7a6,rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p1p2n2/3p4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"a6 is played by black, I thought developing another minor piece would have been better, But He had a reason for this move I am sure."
9,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p1p2n2/3p4/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,I play e3 protecting my d4 pawn and opening way for my lsb to be developed.
10,b5,b7b5,rnbqkb1r/4pppp/p1p2n2/1p1p4/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,b5 played protected by pawn on a6 and c6. This also allows Black to develop his pieces on his Q side.
11,c5,c4c5,rnbqkb1r/4pppp/p1p2n2/1pPp4/3P4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,I now advance pawn  to c5 and have a fine wall of connected pawns. My other thought was to get castled quickly by developing my lsb.
12,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bqkb1r/3npppp/p1p2n2/1pPp4/3P4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,develops his N in front of his Q. I thought he might of played Bg4 here.
13,b4,b2b4,r1bqkb1r/3npppp/p1p2n2/1pPp4/1P1P4/2N1PN2/P4PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,I add another protector to my c5 pawn.

15,bxa5,b4a5,r1bqkb1r/3npppp/2p2n2/PpPp4/3P4/2N1PN2/P4PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,I decide to take here thinking to take is a mistake. By taking here I actually shift tempo to his favor I believe.
16,Qxa5,d8a5,r1b1kb1r/3npppp/2p2n2/qpPp4/3P4/2N1PN2/P4PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 9,"Q takes pawn  and I wonder how I can defend this move. he took this move over taking with his rook, which could have been played and not getting his Q out early. The Q takes seems to be best."
17,Bb2,c1b2,r1b1kb1r/3npppp/2p2n2/qpPp4/3P4/2N1PN2/PB3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 9,this simple move does the job to protect the loss of my R if I had left his attack of a skewer not stopped.
18,e5,e7e5,r1b1kb1r/3n1ppp/2p2n2/qpPpp3/3P4/2N1PN2/PB3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 10,e5 is played attacking the center.
19,Be2,f1e2,r1b1kb1r/3n1ppp/2p2n2/qpPpp3/3P4/2N1PN2/PB2BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 10,lsb is developed and now gives me a way to castle if I decide too. Right now I question if this is best place for my piece. My N is pinned and Bfd3 was my other move I had to choose from
20,Ne4,f6e4,r1b1kb1r/3n1ppp/2p5/qpPpp3/3Pn3/2N1PN2/PB2BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 11,I believe I said nice move after Ne4 was played. thinking I should have had my lsb on d3 here to take his N.
