1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I don't know really how to play against an English opening, so I went for a standard developement plan, exploiting the black diagonal with a fianchetto."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"Being the c pawn still in c7, it is not difficult to control the white's lsb."

9,e4,e2e4,rnbq1rk1/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2P1P3/2N3P1/PP1P1PBP/R1BQK1NR b KQ - 0 5,"Preventing an early e5, that can be annoying.
c6 makes sense, too, fighting for the center (e6, d5). But I didn't want to keep my pieces undeveloped because of f4 and a possible early attack on my kingside."
10,d6,d7d6,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2P1P3/2N3P1/PP1P1PBP/R1BQK1NR w KQ - 0 6,"Preventing an early e5, that can be annoying.

13,O-O,e1g1,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2p5/2P1P3/2N3P1/PP1PNPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 7,"Standard moves right now. I hate to develop bishops on d7 or e7, since they seem very inactive, there. But I had no choice. I don't want to play e6 because I don't want to trap my own bishop, so unless it becomes unavoidable, I won't do it."

But in doing so, he is weakening the kingside, unnecessarily, since neither the knight or the bishop are doing anything in g4..."

With the played move, I was looking for a surprising future b5, but in doing so, I left the white knight a wonderful outpost on a4-b6."
21,Be3,c1e3,r1q2rk1/1p1bppbp/p1np1np1/2p5/2P1P3/2NPB1PP/PP2NPBK/R2Q1R2 b - - 1 11,"White doesn't seem to want to take advantage of it, so the game proceeds in a - not clear what to do fashion, and begins to be ""squeezed""."

Now, if white plays f4, I can try Ng5 as a dubious sac, or he wins two tempoes."

Bxh3 (BxB, Nf3+ and...?), or Ng5+, hxN... what? Maybe Qxg5 could have given me something, but in order to play it I must have taken the bishop out of the way...
White's move IS a loss of tempo, after Bf4 (?)"

I don't want to move the pawn because I want to keep the diagonal free for my queen as long as possible, but Nf6 is ""blocked"" because Bxe7, then Bxd6 would be nasty moves.
And Re8 seems weird, since sooner or later the f column will play a role in all this, for sure."
