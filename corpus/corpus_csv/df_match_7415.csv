1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"My usual 1. Nf3 has been replaced by this more flexible move in this game.  The main reason for the change is that I can reach many of my well studied openings by transposition and at the same time can avoid the Classical Kings Indian, which has built up a ton of theory.  Not only that, but by playing either the Saemisch or the Hungarian Attack (as in this game) I am able to generate a kingside attack with the white pieces.  Enjoy!"
