9,a4,a2a4,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/8/P1pP4/2N2N2/1P2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"Since I already played Nf3, e3 could be met by b5, and now a4 wouldn't work because of ... b4."
10,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/8/PbpP4/2N2N2/1P2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,"Even though I can't kick the bishop immediately, it doesn't mean b4 is a good square."
11,e3,e2e3,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/8/PbpP4/2N1PN2/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"I would play Bg5 if he played Nf6 on the previous move, but since he didn't I opted for a safer e3 option."

15,bxc3,b2c3,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/8/P1BP4/2P1PN2/5PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,The knight attacks c3 but it's a bad move. Black shouldn't move the same piece again at least until he develops his other knight (on d7).

19,Bb2,c1b2,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/2p1p3/8/P1BPn3/2P1PN2/1B3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 4 10,maybe if black's knight wasn't there Ba3 would be better.
20,Qd7,d8d7,rnb2rk1/pp1q1ppp/2p1p3/8/P1BPn3/2P1PN2/1B3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 5 11,"takes away a square for both the knight and the bishop, so not very good."
21,Qc2,d1c2,rnb2rk1/pp1q1ppp/2p1p3/8/P1BPn3/2P1PN2/1BQ2PPP/R4RK1 b - - 6 11,attacking the knight
22,c5,c6c5,rnb2rk1/pp1q1ppp/4p3/2p5/P1BPn3/2P1PN2/1BQ2PPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 12,attacking the centre but leaving the knight en prise
23,Qxe4,c2e4,rnb2rk1/pp1q1ppp/4p3/2p5/P1BPQ3/2P1PN2/1B3PPP/R4RK1 b - - 0 12,now it's a matter of technique from white and resistance from black.
24,f5,f7f5,rnb2rk1/pp1q2pp/4p3/2p2p2/P1BPQ3/2P1PN2/1B3PPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 13,now it's a matter of technique from white and resistance from black.

26,h6,h7h6,rnb2rk1/pp1q2p1/4p2p/2p2p2/P1BP3Q/2P1PN2/1B3PPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 14,good move
27,Rfd1,f1d1,rnb2rk1/pp1q2p1/4p2p/2p2p2/P1BP3Q/2P1PN2/1B3PPP/R2R2K1 b - - 1 14,"I don't remember what I was planning to do with the rook, but now I see that if cxd4, Rxd4 may be possible."
28,b6,b7b6,rnb2rk1/p2q2p1/1p2p2p/2p2p2/P1BP3Q/2P1PN2/1B3PPP/R2R2K1 w - - 0 15,"b6 defends c5 and allows the black's bishop to go on b7, but I think Qc7 would be better since it opens up d7."

30,Qc6,d7c6,rnb2rk1/p5p1/1pq1p2p/2P2p2/P1B4Q/2P1PN2/1B3PPP/R2R2K1 w - - 1 16,"again the queen moves to a light square, which is not the problem right now."
31,Bb5,c4b5,rnb2rk1/p5p1/1pq1p2p/1BP2p2/P6Q/2P1PN2/1B3PPP/R2R2K1 b - - 2 16,I want to gain a tempo and unblock my c3 pawn.
