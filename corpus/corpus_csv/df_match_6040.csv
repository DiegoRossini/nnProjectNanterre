1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,Tal kicks things off with the Reti opening
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 2,...with a transposition into a kind of Queen's gambit
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,...with a transposition into a kind of Queen's gambit
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,...with a transposition into a kind of Queen's gambit
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2P5/2N2N2/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,...with a transposition into a kind of Queen's gambit
6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2P5/2N2N2/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,...with a transposition into a kind of Queen's gambit
7,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,...with a transposition into a kind of Queen's gambit
8,c6,c7c6,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Keller over-protects the d5 pawn. Nc6 is also playable, and personally I would have chosen it"
9,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,A pin on the f6 knight...
10,dxc4,d5c4,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/6B1/2pP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"and now Keller accepts the gambit pawn - but it seems risky when played against Tal! :P Accepting the gambit pawn in the Queen's Gambit will most often lead to White getting a significant spatial advantage over Black, and White gets more opportunities for an attack. Add Tal's sacrificial nature to that and Black has reason to be afraid. Very, very afraid..."
11,e4,e2e4,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/6B1/2pPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,The natural follow-up - Tal grabs the lion's share of the centre while discovering an attack on the c4 pawn.
12,b5,b7b5,rnbqkb1r/p4ppp/2p1pn2/1p4B1/2pPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"?! From what I've heard, trying to hold on to the gambitted pawn is generally considered inferior in Queen's Gambit Accepted lines, so it's interesting to see a strong player like Keller try it... but then again, those b and c pawns do have their say later on"
13,a4,a2a4,rnbqkb1r/p4ppp/2p1pn2/1p4B1/P1pPP3/2N2N2/1P3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"Pressurising the b5 pawn, but Keller need not worry about that due to his fourth move. Tal threatens to get back his pawn..."
14,Qb6,d8b6,rnb1kb1r/p4ppp/1qp1pn2/1p4B1/P1pPP3/2N2N2/1P3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,"?! but I don't believe that this is the best way to prevent that - instead, 7...Bb4 ought to have been looked at. With this move, the queen leaves the protection of the f6 knight..."
15,Bxf6,g5f6,rnb1kb1r/p4ppp/1qp1pB2/1p6/P1pPP3/2N2N2/1P3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,allowing Tal to double up pawns kingside!
16,gxf6,g7f6,rnb1kb1r/p4p1p/1qp1pp2/1p6/P1pPP3/2N2N2/1P3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 9,"Well, it doesn't look like Keller can castle kingside or queenside because of his pawn structure... which will, in turn, make his king more of a target. Given who he's playing against, Keller needs to tread very lightly at this point..."
17,Be2,f1e2,rnb1kb1r/p4p1p/1qp1pp2/1p6/P1pPP3/2N2N2/1P2BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 9,"Tal doesn't see any attack at the moment, so he calmly develops and prepares castling"
18,a6,a7a6,rnb1kb1r/5p1p/pqp1pp2/1p6/P1pPP3/2N2N2/1P2BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 10,?! Yet another strange move to me... why would b5 need any move protection than what it has?
19,O-O,e1g1,rnb1kb1r/5p1p/pqp1pp2/1p6/P1pPP3/2N2N2/1P2BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 1 10,Both Tal and Keller play natural developing moves

22,cxd5,c6d5,rn2kb1r/1b3p1p/pq2pp2/1p1p4/P1p1P3/2N2N2/1P2BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 12,"...Keller has this resource. By driving the knight away from the protection of the d5 square, Keller can now win an additional pawn. In addition, he will be able to create a formidable queenside pawn structure after exd5 [though perhaps Bxd5 might be preferred to prevent the opening of the e-file... reader comments are welcome :)]"
23,exd5,e4d5,rn2kb1r/1b3p1p/pq2pp2/1p1P4/P1p5/2N2N2/1P2BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 12,"...Keller has this resource.

27,dxe6,d5e6,rn2kb1r/1bq2p1p/p3Pp2/P7/1pp5/2N2N2/1P2BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 14,"Nope - you all knew this was coming! :) Tal is more interested in the initiative than he is material, so he hangs his own knight out to dry in order to gain a successful attack on Keller's king."
28,bxc3,b4c3,rn2kb1r/1bq2p1p/p3Pp2/P7/2p5/2p2N2/1P2BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 15,"Keller accepts the sacrifice - but how will Tal follow up? He has no pieces beyond the third rank, and Keller has plenty of pieces around his king for defence"
