1,b3,b2b3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Larsen's Opening. I don't have much experience with it.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"This is the Modern Variation, the only line I have any familiarity with in this opening. Black aims to limit the scope of White's DSB and occupy the center directly."
3,Bb2,c1b2,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/1P6/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"This is the first deviation from the main line, which would continue with 5. f4 before playing Nf3."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/8/1P6/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,"This is the first deviation from the main line, which would continue with 5. f4 before playing Nf3."
5,e3,e2e3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/8/1P2P3/PBPP1PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"This is the first deviation from the main line, which would continue with 5. f4 before playing Nf3."
6,d5,d7d5,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/3pp3/8/1P2P3/PBPP1PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"This is the first deviation from the main line, which would continue with 5. f4 before playing Nf3."
7,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/1B1pp3/8/1P2P3/PBPP1PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 1 4,"This is the first deviation from the main line, which would continue with 5. f4 before playing Nf3."
8,Bd6,f8d6,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2nb4/1B1pp3/8/1P2P3/PBPP1PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 2 5,"This is the first deviation from the main line, which would continue with 5. f4 before playing Nf3."
9,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2nb4/1B1pp3/8/1P2PN2/PBPP1PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 3 5,"This is the first deviation from the main line, which would continue with 5. f4 before playing Nf3."
10,Qe7,d8e7,r1b1k1nr/ppp1qppp/2nb4/1B1pp3/8/1P2PN2/PBPP1PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 4 6,Defending the e-pawn and looking at a3. I think 5...f6 might be better here.
11,d4,d2d4,r1b1k1nr/ppp1qppp/2nb4/1B1pp3/3P4/1P2PN2/PBP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"? This seems like a mistake to me. White has spent a lot of time building pressure on e5 and trying to open the lane for his Bishop, and now he allows me to shut it down almost entirely. This is the advantage of 5. f4; it leaves the a1-h8 diagonal gloriously free."
12,e4,e5e4,r1b1k1nr/ppp1qppp/2nb4/1B1p4/3Pp3/1P2PN2/PBP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"This seems like the most logical move. After the Knight retreats, I need to be ready to try to prevent c4, which White will play as soon as he can to reopen the position. At this point, I'm planning to drive White's Bishop away and then get a pawn on b5 to restrict c4."
13,Nfd2,f3d2,r1b1k1nr/ppp1qppp/2nb4/1B1p4/3Pp3/1P2P3/PBPN1PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 1 7,Basically forced; the Knight is more useful supporting c4 than spending two tempi moving Ng1-e2.
14,Bd7,c8d7,r3k1nr/pppbqppp/2nb4/1B1p4/3Pp3/1P2P3/PBPN1PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 2 8,"I need to prevent White from pulling my b-pawn off its file, or I won't be able to stop him from playing c4."
15,a4,a2a4,r3k1nr/pppbqppp/2nb4/1B1p4/P2Pp3/1P2P3/1BPN1PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 0 8,"This introduces possible complications after ...a6 and ...b5, but frankly I'm not sure what the point of this move is at the time. White will clarify his idea shortly."
16,a6,a7a6,r3k1nr/1ppbqppp/p1nb4/1B1p4/P2Pp3/1P2P3/1BPN1PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 9,Asking the question.
17,Bxc6,b5c6,r3k1nr/1ppbqppp/p1Bb4/3p4/P2Pp3/1P2P3/1BPN1PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 0 9,"White decides to trade a Bishop for a Knight, given the closed position. The LSB wouldn't have many prospects on e2 either, but perhaps he could swing a kingside attack that way."
18,Bxc6,d7c6,r3k1nr/1pp1qppp/p1bb4/3p4/P2Pp3/1P2P3/1BPN1PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 10,Black reveals the point of 8. a4: he wants to get his stuffed Bishop into action. Evidently he's not as sure as I am that playing c4 will solve his troubles relatively efficiently.
19,Ba3,b2a3,r3k1nr/1pp1qppp/p1bb4/3p4/P2Pp3/BP2P3/2PN1PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 1 10,Black reveals the point of 8. a4: he wants to get his stuffed Bishop into action. Evidently he's not as sure as I am that playing c4 will solve his troubles relatively efficiently.
20,b5,b7b5,r3k1nr/2p1qppp/p1bb4/1p1p4/P2Pp3/BP2P3/2PN1PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 11,"White can *still* play c4 here, but at least now I can remove one defender without moving the d-pawn. 10...b5 also gives me the option of getting my Bishop to b7 (or a8 if the a-file opens up and Rooks are exchanged), allowing ...c6. At this point, though, I'm starting to think an open center wouldn't be such a bad thing--I need to make use of my Bishops."
21,Bxd6,a3d6,r3k1nr/2p1qppp/p1bB4/1p1p4/P2Pp3/1P2P3/2PN1PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 0 11,"Make that 'Bishop', singular."
22,Qxd6,e7d6,r3k1nr/2p2ppp/p1bq4/1p1p4/P2Pp3/1P2P3/2PN1PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 12,"As White now has no Bishops left, I absolutely need to open up the game, or his Knights may be able to run circles around me."
23,Nc3,b1c3,r3k1nr/2p2ppp/p1bq4/1p1p4/P2Pp3/1PN1P3/2PN1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 12,"With the threat of the a-file opening up, I decide it's high time to finish developing minor pieces and prepare to connect my rooks. This does lose a pawn for me, but I'm hoping my extra space and mobility will make up for it."
24,Nf6,g8f6,r3k2r/2p2ppp/p1bq1n2/1p1p4/P2Pp3/1PN1P3/2PN1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 13,"With the threat of the a-file opening up, I decide it's high time to finish developing minor pieces and prepare to connect my rooks.

Besides, I don't actually have a choice (13. ...Bxb5?? 14. Nxb5 and I can't retake without losing both Rooks)."
26,axb5,a6b5,r3k2r/2p2ppp/2bq1n2/1p1p4/3Pp3/1PN1P3/2PN1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 14,"I'm not too happy about putting my Bishop on a8, but I think I can open up the game and I'd rather have BN vs NN than N vs N.
