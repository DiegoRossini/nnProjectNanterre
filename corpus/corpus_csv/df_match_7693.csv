12,Nxd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4p3/3n4/3P4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,the kingside is weak enough! activating other pieces would have been more appropriate

17,Bd3,f1d3,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4p3/3n4/1b1P4/2NB1N2/PP1B1PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 5 9,a good strong move building an attack on a kingside that has jsut been further weakend by castling
18,Nxc3,d5c3,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4p3/8/1b1P4/2nB1N2/PP1B1PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 10,white is in no hurry to loose his bishops in this position and the pawn's prevent any nasty surprizes from the two active dark squared pieces
19,bxc3,b2c3,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4p3/8/1b1P4/2PB1N2/P2B1PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 10,white is in no hurry to loose his bishops in this position and the pawn's prevent any nasty surprizes from the two active dark squared pieces
20,Ba5,b4a5,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4p3/b7/3P4/2PB1N2/P2B1PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 1 11,the position is brilliant for white.he has excellent chanses on the queenside and some very active pieces coupled with the ability to dominate the b file with a rook at leisure
21,O-O,e1g1,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4p3/b7/3P4/2PB1N2/P2B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 2 11,"an iritating move but i think a necessary one if the rook is to be involved in the kingside assult, whilst Q c2 is more direct it leaves open the chance of the attack being under-powered"
22,Nc6,b8c6,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2n1p3/b7/3P4/2PB1N2/P2B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 3 12,"planning e5 perhaps? however white has noticed the line Bxh5, Kxh5  Ng5+! and teh queen can cause major problems on either h5 or c2 if it wants due to black having no controll on teh white squares"
23,Bxh7+,d3h7,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppB/2n1p3/b7/3P4/2P2N2/P2B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 12,"black has obviously also seen this line and wants to avoid it, however this allows white leisure to play Ng5 and with the tempo advantage  this is leathal"
24,Kh8,g8h8,r1bq1r1k/pp3ppB/2n1p3/b7/3P4/2P2N2/P2B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 1 13,"black has obviously also seen this line and wants to avoid it, however this allows white leisure to play Ng5 and with the tempo advantage  this is leathal"
25,Ng5,f3g5,r1bq1r1k/pp3ppB/2n1p3/b5N1/3P4/2P5/P2B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 2 13,"certainly this is a response (stopping the queen going via h5 to its destination), however perhaps there are better ways to go about this such as Qf6  which is infinitely more accurate"
26,g6,g7g6,r1bq1r1k/pp3p1B/2n1p1p1/b5N1/3P4/2P5/P2B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 14,"certainly this is a response (stopping the queen going via h5 to its destination), however perhaps there are better ways to go about this such as Qf6  which is infinitely more accurate"

28,f6,f7f6,r1bq1r1k/pp5B/2n1ppp1/b5N1/3P4/2P2Q2/P2B1PPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 15,black repsonds to Nf7
29,Qh3,f3h3,r1bq1r1k/pp5B/2n1ppp1/b5N1/3P4/2P4Q/P2B1PPP/R4RK1 b - - 1 15,white now really has it all anything other than Kf7 by black forces mate in two after Qh6! though i noticed this as i pressed submit on move 16 :(
