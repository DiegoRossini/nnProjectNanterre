1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was a non rated game for tutoring purposes, between myself, Scott Miller (faithfulltrav) and my new friend Ananya (ananyapathak). So, Ananya, I want to start by letting you know a little about where I am coming from when I tutor chess, my favorite game. First I want to say, there are varying ideologies and styles of play. I for one am a fairly aggressive, very calculating player. I am a much stronger tactical player than I am strategic. For the difference, imagine a general in a war. He may say to his men ""OK, there are 10,000 of us. I want 9,000 men to lay in wait at the top of this hill. The other 1,000 of you go make like you are attacking the enemy town down below. When they come out after you, flee to the cave at the bottom of the hill. Then the 9,000 at the top attack them. That is strategy. It is an overall plan. Then the general may say, ""When you engage in hand to hand combat, use the long swords, as you can strike from a greater distance. Keep your daggers ready though."" That is a tactic, not a strategy. Strategies give general direction, tactics are more specific. So in our game, for example, part of my strategy in the middle game was to force you to trade off your DSB, then infiltrate the h6 square and attack your g6 square, to open your king to attack. That's strategy, my basic game plan. Tactics were putting my bishop on h6 to trade bishops, push my h pawn to make space for my knight to go to h2, then g4, to bring my queen to h6, to push my pawn to trade on g6, ect. So tactics are the processes used to apply the strategy. A more strategic player may look at one of my comments and say, ""Ananya, this guys is leading you wrong."" It's not that I'm leading you wrong, but that I can only lead based on my own style. A strategic player will lead differently than a tactical player. A passive player will give different advise from an aggressive player. That's not to say anything bad about passive chess players, as I've met passive players who I could not beat. I had a friend in college named Pablo. He'd sit back, making very passive moves. He'd set up a very solid position you can't break through and if you slip up, then all of a sudden he'd get aggressive! So when taking advise, (from me or anyone else) take it all in from as many sources as possible, then make a rational decision for yourself, based on your own style and abilities, what is for you."

According to MCO, the vast majority of lines in this defense give White at least a slight advantage. Some lines give Black equality, and a rare few give Black a slight advantage. 

I found this very encouraging, because I know that a very slight advantage, if played accurately, becomes a great advantage, which in turn, if worked correctly, becomes a won game."

In this variation, Black willingly allows White to establish an imposing pawn center, with intention of attacking and destroying that center! So it's an intense debate between the 2 sides, a debate won not with words, but in tactical chess moves. White says, ""My solid pawn center will restrict your pieces, giving me a superior position!"" Black says, ""Your pawns are weak! I'll use my pawns to destroy your weak pawn center! I will undermine those overly advanced pawns, and trade them off and gain a free open position!"" What I find is interesting is, if White succeeds in keeping this ""strong"" pawn center, he will definitely have the better game. Yet, if black accomplishes his goal of undermining and trading off White's pawns, in my opinion, he will probably gain equality, but he still has a major fight to gain superiority! This is why I love to play White against the Grunfeld."

Your tactics should include c5, which you did on move 8, and c5xd4, which you never did. To attack my LSB, you played c4 (move 16). Since pawns can't move backwards, you would never again get the chance to play c5xd4! Thus my pawns on c3 & d4 were pretty secure. As my attack developed, I saw opportunity to use my LSB to attack g6, were it not for the e4 pawn. So I had to push this pawn & trade it off to open the line. Once I did this, you had no more pawns to use in your attack against my center. The c-pawn was overly advanced, and can't attack the center. The d & f pawns were traded off. The e-pawn was blocked behind my knight on e5, and can't attack the center. So the only remaining pawn that could attack my center was the b pawn, by advancing to b4 and capturing c3. My move Rb1 (which I made more for attacking purposes than to stop the pawn) permanently kept him at bay, though. To see the details of the position I just described, look at 27.
