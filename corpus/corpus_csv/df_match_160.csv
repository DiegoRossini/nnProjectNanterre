8,dxc6,d7c6,r1bqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1p5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"Better than 4...bxc6. Now if White captures the e-pawn Black has 5...Qd4, regaining the pawn with a slight advantage."
9,d3,d2d3,r1bqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1p5/4p3/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"Now White has supported his own e-pawn, Black's is genuinely threatened."
10,Bd6,f8d6,r1bqk1nr/1pp2ppp/p1pb4/4p3/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 6,"Fischer actually recommended 5...f6, but I thought I'd try this instead, which is perfectly playable, as is 5...Qd6."
11,h3,h2h3,r1bqk1nr/1pp2ppp/p1pb4/4p3/4P3/3P1N1P/PPP2PP1/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"A bit over cautious, I think. White wants to prevent the pin, but would be better completing his development."

15,a3,a2a3,r1bqk2r/1pp2ppp/p1pb2n1/4p3/2P1P3/P2P1N1P/1P3PP1/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,White has now made five pawn moves and he still hasn't castled or started to develop his Q-side. This should give me some advantage.
