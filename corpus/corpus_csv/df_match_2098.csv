1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"E4 is my opponent's choice, the perfect chance to try out what I've been practicing. My opponent was rated 2363 when we played. Most Grandmasters no longer play the Caro-Kann, because it is deemed as rather dry and drawish - that is, black in most lines gets easy development and good draw chances. However, although sharp positions can arise, the Caro-kann is not considered as 'fighting' as the Sicilian; in my games I've found this to be true - but if my opponent makes a mistake, after the Caro-Kann opening and into the middle game, black usually has a very good pawn structure and can take advantage of said mistake very easily. Stay tuned! ;)"
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I respond with c6, the characteristic Caro-Kann 2nd move."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,D4 by my opponent. All this is theory.
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"This is a lesser played line, favored by Anatoly Karpov at times. Taking with the queen in this position IS a safe 'uninspiring' response, but it does something important: preserves the pawn structure black wishes to keep."
5,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3P4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"This is a lesser played line, favored by Anatoly Karpov at times. Taking with the queen in this position IS a safe 'uninspiring' response, but it does something important: preserves the pawn structure black wishes to keep."
6,Qxd5,d8d5,rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3q4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"This is a lesser played line, favored by Anatoly Karpov at times. Taking with the queen in this position IS a safe 'uninspiring' response, but it does something important: preserves the pawn structure black wishes to keep."
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3q4/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,"And the usual response is to chase the queen away, with tempo. Some don't like taking with the queen because of that tempo, but the loss of tempo here is not as much of an issue as it could be in the middle game or in a sharper opening."
8,Qd8,d5d8,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 5,"And again, this is the safest place for the queen right now. I don't favor Qa5, eventually having to move the queen a second time when tactics and strategic concerns are becoming a greater issue. Better to just move it back."
9,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/2BP4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 3 5,"A typically aggressive place to position the Bishop, although the d3 square for that bishop is considered in many lines to be better... nevertheless, Fritz says this is the strongest move. F7 is often the weak point in the Caro-Kann, and black must be aware of attacks against that point if choosing to play this system."
10,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/5b2/2BP4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 4 6,"Now, in some lines, Bg4 is much better. Black actually would like his knight on f5 in many lines of the Caro-Kann, but getting the bishop to g4 requires some preparation. Had white tried Qf3, e6 would have followed. All kinds of things white can steer these lines into, but black simply follows a few ideas and can be okay."
11,Nf3,g1f3,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/5b2/2BP4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 5 6,"Development. I could have chosen to move Nf6 first, followed by Bg4; but I was wary of that light-squared bishop, and needed my own bishop out so as to play e6 quickly."
12,e6,e7e6,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/5b2/2BP4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"So before the rook comes to e1, I position the pawn on e6, which is a thematic place for it in the Caro-Kann."
13,O-O,e1g1,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/5b2/2BP4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 7,"This is a good place for the bishop; it prevents tactics involving discovered check in a few moves, protects against further piece aggression on the kingside. Now, often in the Caro-Kann, white castles queenside and throws those kingside pawns at black. He still can do that, but if his attack fails, his king will be vulnerable. EDITED: he can still throw his kingside pawns at me even having castled kingside was my intented meaning here; sorry for the vagueness of  my comment!"
14,Be7,f8e7,rn1qk1nr/pp2bppp/2p1p3/5b2/2BP4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 8,"This is a good place for the bishop; it prevents tactics involving discovered check in a few moves, protects against further piece aggression on the kingside.

15,Qe2,d1e2,rn1qk1nr/pp2bppp/2p1p3/5b2/2BP4/2N2N2/PPP1QPPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 3 8,"Getting ready to hit the e6 pawn. Ne5 was more accurate, however! It will take a few moves for white to be ready, and my king will not remain there long enough. So I continue developing. The purpose of the Caro-Kann is to, in most lines, develop fully before trying to make inroads against the space advantage white WILL have. It is a lot like a French defense, and in some lines very similar; but of course there is not the problem of the bishop... or at least, not to that extent. So far, most of the play has not been the more dangerous lines for black. So far! if you want to see a dangerous line for black, watch that 2nd Anand/Carlsen game, up to the QxQ move, and imagine instead Vishy going for Qg4. Unpleasant!"
16,Nd7,b8d7,r2qk1nr/pp1nbppp/2p1p3/5b2/2BP4/2N2N2/PPP1QPPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 4 9,This is a very important move in the Caro-Kann. it is to prevent a white knight from remaining at the e5 outpost where it can greatly pressure f7 as white mounts an attack.
17,Ne4,c3e4,r2qk1nr/pp1nbppp/2p1p3/5b2/2BPN3/5N2/PPP1QPPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 5 9,"And now my development is almost complete. Notice that white has a space advantage, his pieces are fairly coordinated, but there is not yet great pressure on black's king."
18,Ngf6,g8f6,r2qk2r/pp1nbppp/2p1pn2/5b2/2BPN3/5N2/PPP1QPPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 6 10,"And now my development is almost complete. Notice that white has a space advantage, his pieces are fairly coordinated, but there is not yet great pressure on black's king."
19,Nfg5,f3g5,r2qk2r/pp1nbppp/2p1pn2/5bN1/2BPN3/8/PPP1QPPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 7 10,"This is the first inaccurate move. Not a blunder, but it really does little for white's attack here, despite the scary look of the board! ;)"
20,O-O,e8g8,r2q1rk1/pp1nbppp/2p1pn2/5bN1/2BPN3/8/PPP1QPPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 8 11,Am I castling into it? Fritz says the game is now equalized.
21,c3,c2c3,r2q1rk1/pp1nbppp/2p1pn2/5bN1/2BPN3/2P5/PP2QPPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 0 11,"Shoring up the white pawn structure... and, I believe, sitting there trying to provoke h6. My opponent here is making a high percentage of very good moves."
22,Nxe4,f6e4,r2q1rk1/pp1nbppp/2p1p3/5bN1/2BPn3/2P5/PP2QPPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 0 12,"Well, let's see which piece he takes with..."
23,Nxe4,g5e4,r2q1rk1/pp1nbppp/2p1p3/5b2/2BPN3/2P5/PP2QPPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 0 12,"I thought as much. This guy, remember, is rated over 2350. One of the strongest players I've ever played. But I am not experimenting this game; yes, I am trying out some of what I've been studying, but focusing in this one; trying my best to win. Fritz says the game is equal here, but white has a tiny edge still."
24,Nf6,d7f6,r2q1rk1/pp2bppp/2p1pn2/5b2/2BPN3/2P5/PP2QPPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 1 13,"Now white has made a few inaccuracies; take note of them: ideally, he'd like a knight on e5, and should be advancing the h pawn, and often other kingside pawns. Perhaps he is not as familiar with the theory; as a result, so far my defense is solid. Notice that although I don't like my light-squared bishop where it is at, I haven't repositioned it yet because I haven't needed to yet. All my pieces are where they need to be except that one, but where it needs to be I am not certain of yet. Oh! And the queen of course. C7 is a typical spot for the queen in the Caro-Kann, but at this point I have a plan and don't feel like moving the queen twice..."
