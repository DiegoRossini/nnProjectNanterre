1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"i think this move deserves a !? and should be treated energically. I'm quite imaginative perhaps but i think that black's odd opening is somewhat justified in this line: 2.d4,Nf6; 3.Nc3, c5; So black could use later his h pawn for an attack, even sacrifice it to open the h-file. At least, this is what i'd do i i were in black having committed myself to h5. At this stage of the game probably h5 just a waste of time, he can't know where i'm going to castle, so, what's the point?"

3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppppppp1/8/7p/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"usually i don't play d4 when i play the english, at least not so early. But i think that sizing the center is the best way for white to try to demonstrate black's really has chosen an odd move order."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppppppp1/5n2/7p/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"3...Ng4??; why not 3...c5? (or some other developing move). Now i understand that h5 was really a beginner play, not just eccentric"

7,f3,f2f3,rnbqkb1r/ppppppp1/8/7p/2PP2n1/2N2P2/PP2P1PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"Since my idea here was to hit back the knight and then play 5.e4 probably better was 4.h3,Nf6; 5.e4.
The position is similar with that reached in the game but white as an easier development of his kingside pieces (not having a pawn on f3)
I have to admit that in the game i didn't even take in consideration a developing move like 4.Nf3, but probably this is much better than the idea of making black waste tempi wandering around with his knight"
8,Nf6,g4f6,rnbqkb1r/ppppppp1/5n2/7p/2PP4/2N2P2/PP2P1PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"so, i have a big center, space, and a slight lead in development. I will play to defend my center and if black does not succeed to destroy it my advantage certainly can only get bigger and sensible"

Here i spent some time looking at the position to discover if this sacrifice was justified. No way. This is a blunder, black can't attack with just two pieces (bishop and queen [when he takes on f6]), so let's accept the sacrifice..."

I reserve the possibility to take the knight later and black can't even react with h6!! Also it develops a piece. But i would have to move it again after exf6, gxf6 so in the end i chose to take the knight"
14,Qxf6,d8f6,rnb1k2r/pppp1pp1/5q2/2b4p/2P1P3/2N2P2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 8,"i don't know if this is the stronger move here, but certainly black is already in danger with the double attack on f6 and c7. Given that black really can't hurt me for the moment i think 8.Nd5 is surely playable"
15,Nd5,c3d5,rnb1k2r/pppp1pp1/5q2/2bN3p/2P1P3/5P2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 8,"i don't know if this is the stronger move here, but certainly black is already in danger with the double attack on f6 and c7. Given that black really can't hurt me for the moment i think 8.Nd5 is surely playable"
16,Qe5,f6e5,rnb1k2r/pppp1pp1/8/2bNq2p/2P1P3/5P2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 9,"probably better was 8...Qe5. The queen in the middle seems only a danger for black, but at least he is trying to keep his remaining pieces active (let's pretend it is so)"
17,Bd2,c1d2,rnb1k2r/pppp1pp1/8/2bNq2p/2P1P3/5P2/PP1B2PP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 3 9,"here i spent really a lot of time calculating the possibilities arising from 9.Bf4, Bb4 ; only later i realized that after 9...Qxb2 black threatens mate on f2 and the bishop on f4 seems somewhat misplaced. Ok, white still has the advantage and can calmly play 10.Be2 but i didn't like no more my bishop on f4 in this continuation. So i played the text move, now 9...Qxb2 is just not possible in view of 10.Nxc7  (this time i don't have to waste a time defending from checkmate) and i have the threat of 10.Bc3.

We shall see what could happen if we played 9.Bf4,Bb4 

10.Bd2 is too passive although after 10..Bxd2 ; 11.Qxd2 white clearly is happy
10.Nxb4, Qxf4; is not really what i had in mind when i thought about 9.Bf4
so, let's move the king and enjoy tactics!
10.Ke2 (Kf2 seems safer), Qxb2 ; 11.Kd3 this was my idea! take a walk in the center with the king and demonstrate that black really has nothing"
18,Qd4,e5d4,rnb1k2r/pppp1pp1/8/2bN3p/2PqP3/5P2/PP1B2PP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 4 10,"more fire on f2 but as seirawan once said ""if you can't defend from a mate on f2 you are dead meat"" (he really said: if you can't defend from a mate on f2 you are dead meat)"
19,Nh3,g1h3,rnb1k2r/pppp1pp1/8/2bN3p/2PqP3/5P1N/PP1B2PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 5 10,"My only concern here was if black could be able to play something like 10...d6 with the idea of eliminating the only defender of f2. Since after 10...d6; 11.Qc2(b2 need some attention), Bxh3; 12.Bc3 (that was the point of 9.Bd2!) i defend easily"
20,Qxb2,d4b2,rnb1k2r/pppp1pp1/8/2bN3p/2P1P3/5P1N/Pq1B2PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 11,ok that was my idea on move 9 and finally i played it. Only after the game i found that i can play 11.Rb1 and black can't take on a2 because his queen get trapped after the simple Ra1. In the game i feared to loose another pawn. Ghosts hunting!!!
