1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone,

I decided to play the white side of this gambit against Master Freddy.  I lost a game with the black pieces against this opening so I decided to see how I would get on as white.  Freddy showed me how the gambit could be refuted.  First we play the Four Knights Opening so the action starts on Move 4."
