1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

It's back to the old routine for me, passivitis just does not go away.  I get into some big bother yet again but somehow I avoid a heavy points loss yet again but find myself conceding another low draw.  My assessment of the final position was that I thought my defense around Henry would be able to hold but I could do no more than that - I had just about enough wood for the absent Glenda, a R + B + P (although the P was a passer) I thought that the Wicked Witch of the West and her castle were very threatening indeed and I thought that if I wasn't careful the Witch could get in some really nasty checks.  I decided that I could live with the loss of 5 rating points and offered the draw which my opponent, Steve kindly accepted.  As you are all familiar with the other annotated games I will start the action at Move 9."
