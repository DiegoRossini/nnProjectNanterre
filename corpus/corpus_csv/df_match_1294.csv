Black has serious difficulties to push back the white Ne5. Ne7 doesn't help, since black can't exchange NxN or dxe5, forking N and B. The only other option is BxN (leaving white in control of the dark squares), to which white will answer dxe5, ""blinding"" his own B, but cramping black's developement."

The most frightening (and, probably, strong) moves are just pawn's moves. The lsb will come out ONLY if a concrete threat is made, not before (timing is crucial). White would like a tempo to play Nd2, but more important (in this case) is to attack black's kinside before he can unravel his pieces."

Probably it will be a little slow, because white can't just ignore it: 8. c5 (ok, a tempo was lost before, playing c6, but...), and white is not forced to do anything. He welcomes c4 by black (since no Bd3 won't have to move a second time), and cxd4 (white can even try Qxd4!?)."

White would play kicking the N after f3, Ng5, h4, if not for Qh4+!, but white can simply play Nd2 and eventually safely exchanging it. Anyway, if Black goes 9... Ne4, white will answer h4!, preventing the BQ's burst on the black squares. So, this was a wise move by black. Nevertheless, his position is already very weak!"

Observe how ""undeveloped"" white is, but how powerful his threats. Both bishops and a R, and the Q, in some way, are participating in the attack. The lsb will come in when/if needed, I don't even have to castle."

Now, I would have preferred for him g6 instead, since black's duty is to put a barrier to white. g6 doesn't leave much of a hole in h6 because Wdsb is blocked, and through the 7th rank now black will be able to get some action with Rf7 (defending the N, which can't move or Qh8#)."

I choose this one instead, with the idea that ""opening columns will be in my favour, anyway"". So I was inviting him to ""come on, please..."" :-). I'll allow him to move, but I hold a pressure that will allow my lsb to get to h5... and curtains for black, if he doesn't come up with something (which he did)."
