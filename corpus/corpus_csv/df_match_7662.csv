1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"When I opened with 1.d4, Freddy offered me a couple of Marshall's more obscure gambits to explore.  I liked the look of his gambit against the Tarrasch Defence, so here we have it.  Freddy sent me the wikipedia reference too: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarrasch_Defense#Variations, which, oddly enough, doesn't mention the Marshall Gambit."

7,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2pP4/3P4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"White's most active response.  In my previous two games against the Tarrasch, I'd tried 4. e3 and 4. Nf3, losing both, so I had nothing to lose by taking the game to Freddy."

10,dxe4,d5e4,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/8/2p5/3Pp3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,Gameknot's database is already exhausted.  This is Simon Williams's move from the World database.  Williams is one of Britain's most aggressive players.
11,Bb5+,f1b5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/8/1Bp5/3Pp3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 6,Gameknot's database is already exhausted.  This is Simon Williams's move from the World database.  Williams is one of Britain's most aggressive players.
12,Bd7,c8d7,rn1qkbnr/pp1b1ppp/8/1Bp5/3Pp3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 2 7,"Freddy departs from the Williams game, so now we're on our own.  This move is a direct challenge to White's aggression."
13,Bxd7+,b5d7,rn1qkbnr/pp1B1ppp/8/2p5/3Pp3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 7,"Another pawn move doesn't further White's development, so seems to be sightly counter to the spirit of the gambit, but the pawn is hard to defend on d4 and capturing on e4 would expose my N to a nasty pin.  Capturing c5 would merely help Black develop his B."
14,Qxd7,d8d7,rn2kbnr/pp1q1ppp/8/2p5/3Pp3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 8,"Another pawn move doesn't further White's development, so seems to be sightly counter to the spirit of the gambit, but the pawn is hard to defend on d4 and capturing on e4 would expose my N to a nasty pin.  Capturing c5 would merely help Black develop his B."

16,Nf6,g8f6,rn2kb1r/pp1q1ppp/5n2/2pP4/4p3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 1 9,Black immediately develops his KN and attacks White's advanced pawn.
17,Qe2,d1e2,rn2kb1r/pp1q1ppp/5n2/2pP4/4p3/2N5/PP2QPPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 2 9,Indirectly defending the d5 pawn by attacking the e4 pawn.
18,Be7,f8e7,rn2k2r/pp1qbppp/5n2/2pP4/4p3/2N5/PP2QPPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 3 10,Black continues with sensible development.
19,Bf4,c1f4,rn2k2r/pp1qbppp/5n2/2pP4/4pB2/2N5/PP2QPPP/R3K1NR b KQkq - 4 10,"Freddy queried this, suggesting that 10. Bg5 was stronger.  I expalined that I thought it would lead quickly to a swap of Bishops.  I preferred to keep them on and was hoping for a chance to hit c7, with forking opportunities, not that I expressed such a naive thought to Freddy!"
20,Nxd5,f6d5,rn2k2r/pp1qbppp/8/2pn4/4pB2/2N5/PP2QPPP/R3K1NR w KQkq - 0 11,Black tidies up the centre and attacks White's B
21,Nxd5,c3d5,rn2k2r/pp1qbppp/8/2pN4/4pB2/8/PP2QPPP/R3K1NR b KQkq - 0 11,"I thought this was a better option than 11. Qxe4 Nxc3 12. bxc3, when White's c-pawn looks very vulnerable"
22,Qxd5,d7d5,rn2k2r/pp2bppp/8/2pq4/4pB2/8/PP2QPPP/R3K1NR w KQkq - 0 12,"Black dominates the centre, and now has a two pawn advantage."
23,Nh3,g1h3,rn2k2r/pp2bppp/8/2pq4/4pB2/7N/PP2QPPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 1 12,So White is forced to develop his knight on the edge (or could have moved his Q again to make room for it - not helpful)
24,Nc6,b8c6,r3k2r/pp2bppp/2n5/2pq4/4pB2/7N/PP2QPPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 2 13,"Whereas Black can develop his knight centrally, improving his hold on the centre."
25,O-O,e1g1,r3k2r/pp2bppp/2n5/2pq4/4pB2/7N/PP2QPPP/R4RK1 b kq - 3 13,At least White can castle now.
26,O-O,e8g8,r4rk1/pp2bppp/2n5/2pq4/4pB2/7N/PP2QPPP/R4RK1 w - - 4 14,As can Black
27,Rfe1,f1e1,r4rk1/pp2bppp/2n5/2pq4/4pB2/7N/PP2QPPP/R3R1K1 b - - 5 14,White seeks to win back a pawn and contest the centre.
28,f5,f7f5,r4rk1/pp2b1pp/2n5/2pq1p2/4pB2/7N/PP2QPPP/R3R1K1 w - - 0 15,So Black reinforces the dominant e-pawn.
