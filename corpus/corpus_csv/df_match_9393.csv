1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Most common first move, i hope the better one."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,He answers symetrically with a hope to have same rights over center.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Develops a piece and attacks to opposition's pawn.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,Defends his pawn and develops a piece too.
5,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,I like placing the bishop to c4.Maybe it is because of i don't like to spend effort to learn Ruy Lopez theory.
6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,Develops other knight and makes pressure on my pawn.
7,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 5 4,O-O!?  This move provokes to capture the centre pawn.And you realize how a mistake he does by capturing pawn.
8,Nxe4,f6e4,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1n3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 5,"Re1!?. A good move i think and put an exclaimation  because if he moves his knight away,he would lose his pawn and i will be better as position."
9,Re1,f1e1,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1n3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq - 1 5,"Re1!?. A good move i think and put an exclaimation  because if he moves his knight away,he would lose his pawn and i will be better as position."
10,f5,f7f5,r1bqkb1r/pppp2pp/2n5/4pp2/2B1n3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq - 0 6,He tries to keep the knight on the center therefore.But he weakenes the kingside by f5?!.I can easily make knight move away from there by d3.
11,d3,d2d3,r1bqkb1r/pppp2pp/2n5/4pp2/2B1n3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq - 0 6,I have replaced the opposition knight and got the pawn back.
12,Nc5,e4c5,r1bqkb1r/pppp2pp/2n5/2n1pp2/2B5/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq - 1 7,I have replaced the opposition knight and got the pawn back.

14,Ke7,e8e7,r1bq1b1r/ppppk1pp/2n5/2n1Np2/2B5/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 w - - 1 8,"he plays this move coz he doesnt want to exchange the bishops due to this line above:

7...Nxe5 8.Rxe5  Be7 9.Bg5! and the loss of his bishop.However he could not see the biggest danger."
15,Nxc6+,e5c6,r1bq1b1r/ppppk1pp/2N5/2n2p2/2B5/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 b - - 0 8,Double check!! He has lost his quuen.He can't move his queen because the  rook checked too.
16,Kf6,e7f6,r1bq1b1r/pppp2pp/2N2k2/2n2p2/2B5/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 w - - 1 9,He lost at the begining due to a wrong move.Other moves are more much or more less related to the strength of the player.

18,d6,d7d6,r1bN1b1r/ppp3pp/3p1k2/2n2p2/2B5/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 w - - 0 10,Maybe a shorter line that leads to mate can be possible; i hope you will discuss about it.
