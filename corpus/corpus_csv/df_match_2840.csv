1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,The game begins as a Bishop's Opening: Vienna Hybrid (C28). A rare opening which allows you to avoid the hackneyed Ruy Lopez. This opening is ok as long as you are not in love with your king's bishop. You allow the exchange of it for the queen's knight to gain time and a white square lock on the center

It is because of these types of positions, I love chess. The energy of the white position completely overcomes the material considerations.
The combination begins with 19. Ngxe4.

After the game the Gameknot analyzer said that this was an inaccuracy. Here is the Gameknot analyzer analysis at this point:

19. Ngxe4 Inaccuracy: -1.13 » 19. Ngxe4 fxe4 20. Qg3+ Kh8 21. Nxe4 Bb4 22. Bxb4 Qxb4 23. Ng5 Bf5 24. Rxd7 Rxd7 25. Qe5+ Kg8 26. Rxf5 Rxf5 27. Qxf5 Rd1+ 28. Kh2 

Best: -0.29 » 19. Ncxe4 fxe4 20. Qxd7 Rxd7 21. Bxa5 Rxd1 22. Rxd1 e3 23. Rd3 Bg5 24. h4 Bf4 25. Ne2 Bh6 26. Bc3 Rf1+ 27. Kh2

Funny, huh? The gameknot analyzer thought that my continuation 19. Ngxe4 was a mistake and completely missed the subsequent 22.Nd5!"
