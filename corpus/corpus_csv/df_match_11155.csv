1,Nh3,g1h3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/7N/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,This move (1) does not control center squares and allows Black to take the center with pawns and (2) develops the knight to a position that does not control KR4/h4.  The weakness of not developing to KB3/f3 will be seen.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/7N/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,"My opponent allows me to play P-K4 as Black.  Unless White wishes to challenge the square KB4/f4, White's knight will be limited in scope."
3,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/4P2N/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,"Taking more control over the center with a pawn, while releasing the QB for K-side attack."
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/8/4P2N/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"Taking more control over the center with a pawn, while releasing the QB for K-side attack."
5,Qf3,d1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/8/4PQ1N/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 1 3,An early Queen move that will allow Black to chase it around.  White can not challenge P-KB4/f4 right away because of 3...BxN 4 PxB Q-R4ch forcing the King to move.   White would need to make plans to Q-side castle first.
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3pp3/8/4PQ1N/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 2 4,An early knight move that has no forces backing it up.  It will be easy to chase it off and gain time developing my own forces.
7,Ng5,h3g5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3pp1N1/8/4PQ2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 3 4,An early knight move that has no forces backing it up.  It will be easy to chase it off and gain time developing my own forces.
8,h6,h7h6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2pp1/5n1p/3pp1N1/8/4PQ2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Basic development, but also preparing to limit moves for the WQ."
9,Nh3,g5h3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2pp1/5n1p/3pp3/8/4PQ1N/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"Basic development, but also preparing to limit moves for the WQ."
10,Bd6,f8d6,rnbqk2r/ppp2pp1/3b1n1p/3pp3/8/4PQ1N/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 2 6,"Basic development, but also preparing to limit moves for the WQ."

12,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qk2r/ppp2pp1/3b1n1p/3pp3/6b1/2N1PQ1N/PPPP1PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 4 7,The first move to trap the Queen. White can not escape loss. P-K5/e4 would also work but moves the pawn a second time w/o developing a piece.
13,Qxf6,f3f6,rn1qk2r/ppp2pp1/3b1Q1p/3pp3/6b1/2N1P2N/PPPP1PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 7,Black gets one piece for the Queen.
14,Qxf6,d8f6,rn2k2r/ppp2pp1/3b1q1p/3pp3/6b1/2N1P2N/PPPP1PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 0 8,Taking time to secure the back rank before embarking on attacks. Q-KN3/g6 or K3/e6 would be ambitious and not needed.
15,Nxd5,c3d5,rn2k2r/ppp2pp1/3b1q1p/3Np3/6b1/4P2N/PPPP1PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 8,Taking time to secure the back rank before embarking on attacks. Q-KN3/g6 or K3/e6 would be ambitious and not needed.
16,Qd8,f6d8,rn1qk2r/ppp2pp1/3b3p/3Np3/6b1/4P2N/PPPP1PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 1 9,Taking time to secure the back rank before embarking on attacks. Q-KN3/g6 or K3/e6 would be ambitious and not needed.
17,f3,f2f3,rn1qk2r/ppp2pp1/3b3p/3Np3/6b1/4PP1N/PPPP2PP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 9,This opens a dark-squared path against the King.
18,Be6,g4e6,rn1qk2r/ppp2pp1/3bb2p/3Np3/8/4PP1N/PPPP2PP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 1 10,"Avoiding BxN, which would trade a good bishop for a Knight on the side of the board.  The WN has no scope unless several moves are used to reposition it."
