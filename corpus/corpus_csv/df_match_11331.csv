4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,Defends the pawn while developing a piece.
5,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,Passive move. Black should've continued more actively with Nf6 or Bc5. Piece development is especially important in double king-pawn positions and other open games. Don't expect to acheive equality if you are playing a move like h6.

7,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkbnr/pppp1pp1/2n4p/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 4,"I don't want to defend with d3 or Nc3 because I am planning to take over the centre with c3 and d4, and moves like d3 or Nc3 interfere with those plans."
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1pp1/2n2n1p/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 5,"I don't want to defend with d3 or Nc3 because I am planning to take over the centre with c3 and d4, and moves like d3 or Nc3 interfere with those plans."

13,d4,d2d4,r1bqk2r/pppp1pp1/2n4p/2b1p3/2BPP1n1/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq - 0 7,"I am adding another pawn to my centre, and Black will have to trade his strong e-pawn for my less valuable c-pawn, because moving the bishop immidiately will lose a pawn beceause h3 drives the knight away from the defense of the e-pawn."
14,exd4,e5d4,r1bqk2r/pppp1pp1/2n4p/2b5/2BpP1n1/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq - 0 8,"Bb4 Nc3 Bxc3 bxc3 is good for me because I will have three strong pawns dominating the centre, which would soon advance and crush Black."

17,b4,b2b4,r1bqk2r/pppp1pp1/1bn4p/8/1PBPP1n1/5N2/P4PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq - 0 9,"I offer Black a pawn. This is somewhat risky because you should only complicate the game when you are losing, and I have a pretty decent position here. But I am good at complicated positions and was confident I could beat him in one.
If Black hadn't accepted the pawn, my plan would be to play a3 Bb2 Qb3 and then advance my central pawns."
18,Nxb4,c6b4,r1bqk2r/pppp1pp1/1b5p/8/1nBPP1n1/5N2/P4PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq - 0 10,"A positional mistake, giving me a slight advantage.
For compensation for the pawn, I have a new open diagonal for my bishop, and an open b-file I can use later to help me with my attack after I play h3 and advance my central pawns."

And Black could've also defended f7 with Nh6 if he hadn't made the terrible h6 move earlier. But other than the what-ifs, the only other way to stop mate in 1 is to sacrifice the queen."

But it was Black's one faulty 3.h6 move that led to these complications, because it gave me a lead in development, allowing me to get an initiative in the centre, driving Black's defensive pieces away. Just look at the knight on g8, which isn't even developed, yet it moved 4 times in the game."
