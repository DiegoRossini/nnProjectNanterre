2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"After e5, Nf3 we have d6, Philidor's defence."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"After e5, Nf3 we have d6, Philidor's defence."

5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 3,"White played Bc4, Steinitz Philidor, for quick development."
6,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk1nr/ppp1bppp/3p4/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 4,"Black responded with Be7, standard move, and probably the best move."
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk1nr/ppp1bppp/3p4/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 4,"In this position, white would normally play c3, and then play c4 at some point, but I prefer my knight on c3, I simply continued with Nc3."
8,c6,c7c6,rnbqk1nr/pp2bppp/2pp4/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"c6, first inaccurate move by black, Nf6 would be a much better move, I'm not sure why this move was played, maybe c6 is to support d5?"
9,O-O,e1g1,rnbqk1nr/pp2bppp/2pp4/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 5,"After white castled king side black played Bf6, I thought he might play Ne7 in the next move and then castle king side."
10,Bf6,e7f6,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/2pp1b2/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 6,"After white castled king side black played Bf6, I thought he might play Ne7 in the next move and then castle king side."
11,d4,d2d4,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/2pp1b2/4p3/2BPP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 6,"I played d4, my king is safe, black's king is still two moves away from castle, so I would like to open up the files for the attack, and also clear the path for my dsb."
12,exd4,e5d4,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/2pp1b2/8/2BpP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,"After exd4, Nxd4 we have Bxd4 from black! I don't see the point of this exchange, black should have played Ne7 and then castle."
13,Nxd4,f3d4,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/2pp1b2/8/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,"After exd4, Nxd4 we have Bxd4 from black! I don't see the point of this exchange, black should have played Ne7 and then castle."

15,Qxd4,d1d4,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/2pp4/8/2BQP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 0 8,"After Qxd4 black offered a queen trade at this point, obviously, capturing black queen only helps black to develop."
16,Qf6,d8f6,rnb1k1nr/pp3ppp/2pp1q2/8/2BQP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 1 9,"After Qxd4 black offered a queen trade at this point, obviously, capturing black queen only helps black to develop."
17,Rd1,f1d1,rnb1k1nr/pp3ppp/2pp1q2/8/2BQP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BR2K1 b kq - 2 9,"I didn't want to play Qe3, because queen would be blocking the bishop, black would gain a tempo from Qd1, and Qd3 would be awkward for white, because black would play b5, and after white plays Bb3, c5 would be a killer, I have also considered Be3, but again, black would pawn-storm my queen side, and gain space advantage. that's the reason I played Rd1, get the rook activated, and develop dsb next."
18,Qxd4,f6d4,rnb1k1nr/pp3ppp/2pp4/8/2BqP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BR2K1 w kq - 0 10,"after queens are exchanged, I got a centralized rook :P, black is way behind in development, and plus d6 pawn is lost, black just can't defend it."

20,Ke7,e8e7,rnb3nr/pp2kppp/2pp4/8/2BRP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B3K1 w - - 1 11,"Ke7?! o_O?! why?! d6 pawn is going to fall for sure, and now black is giving up castle right? I got no idea what is going on...."
21,Bf4,c1f4,rnb3nr/pp2kppp/2pp4/8/2BRPB2/2N5/PPP2PPP/R5K1 b - - 2 11,Bf4 developing dsb with tempo.
22,Ke8,e7e8,rnb1k1nr/pp3ppp/2pp4/8/2BRPB2/2N5/PPP2PPP/R5K1 w - - 3 12,"LOL, now Ke8, black wasted a move and lost his castle right."
23,Rxd6,d4d6,rnb1k1nr/pp3ppp/2pR4/8/2B1PB2/2N5/PPP2PPP/R5K1 b - - 0 12,Rxd6 with the idea to play Rad1.
24,Ne7,g8e7,rnb1k2r/pp2nppp/2pR4/8/2B1PB2/2N5/PPP2PPP/R5K1 w - - 1 13,"Finally Ne7 was played, poor black king is staring at the rook, but just can't castle."
25,Rad1,a1d1,rnb1k2r/pp2nppp/2pR4/8/2B1PB2/2N5/PPP2PPP/3R2K1 b - - 2 13,"Rad1 developing rook with mate in one threat. Have a look at this position, white has activated all the pieces, but black only developed his knight, and his king is exposed to the attack!"
26,Nd7,b8d7,r1b1k2r/pp1nnppp/2pR4/8/2B1PB2/2N5/PPP2PPP/3R2K1 w - - 3 14,"Black's choice was limited, and played Nd7"
27,Bb3,c4b3,r1b1k2r/pp1nnppp/2pR4/8/4PB2/1BN5/PPP2PPP/3R2K1 b - - 4 14,"Bb3, avoiding b5."
