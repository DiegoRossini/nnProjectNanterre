22,Nc5,d7c5,r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/3b4/1BnPp1N1/4P3/2P5/P4PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 9 12,black is thinking to remove the white's knight at the next move and so leaving the e4 pawn unprotected. And also opening his bishops diogonal. But losing tempo and giving a white chance to attack. 11....f6 could have been better

27,fxg5,f4g5,r1bq1rk1/ppp2pp1/3b4/1BnPp1PQ/4P3/2P5/P5PP/R1B2RK1 b - - 0 14,"black is afraid of white's g6. but it wouldnt be that dangerous for the black. besides 14...Ne4, then Bc5 and Nf2 would give black a chance to draw."
28,g6,g7g6,r1bq1rk1/ppp2p2/3b2p1/1BnPp1PQ/4P3/2P5/P5PP/R1B2RK1 w - - 0 15,"black is afraid of white's g6. but it wouldnt be that dangerous for the black. besides 14...Ne4, then Bc5 and Nf2 would give black a chance to draw."
