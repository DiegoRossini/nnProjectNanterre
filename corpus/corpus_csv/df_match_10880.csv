Although I think the idea is right, it's implementation should have waited for a little. The reason i say this is that 15.f5 leaves white's queen bottled in for a few moves after 17.Bxe3. That gives black time to choose a plan of action at will. However, considering that black has not yet castled, and already has a weak looking K-side, white should try to make things more complicated for black over the next few moves, and I think the way to do that would be to keep the Q more active, and then play f4. For example, 15.Qc2 or Qd3 look to be promising. After 15..Bxc3 16.Qxc3 Ne4 17.Qb4 b6 18.f5 the position is the same as it would be after 17.Bxc3 in this game, with the important differences that black: has 'holes' in his Q-side, cannot play Qg5 (or any other attacking move), cannot safely castle on either side of the board.
