You will have your own reasons for choosing this over the main openings, but I don't like this move: develops your Queen too early IMO and I can have a 'free' developing move for my Q-Side Knight.
2. d4 was fine, but only if you are prepared to follow it up with a gambit: 2. d4 cxd4 3. c3 or Nf3.
The mainline WT 2nd move was Nf3, other good options include 2. Nc3 & c3 if you want to avoid heavy theory."

Comment from charleshiggie (1937):  I can't help thinking that if White wants to play this, it is better to move the queen to a4 or even d1 on move 4.
