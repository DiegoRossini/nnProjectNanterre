9,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/1B2p3/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,Preparing d5 which wins a piece. White has the dynamic advantages (development and initiative) as well as a lead in space.
10,Bd7,c8d7,r2qkb1r/pppb1ppp/2np1n2/1B2p3/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 6,As far as I can tell this move is completely wrong for the position. It does nothing to compliment White's advantages.
11,Nd5,c3d5,r2qkb1r/pppb1ppp/2np1n2/1B1Np3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 6,As far as I can tell this move is completely wrong for the position. It does nothing to compliment White's advantages.
12,a6,a7a6,r2qkb1r/1ppb1ppp/p1np1n2/1B1Np3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,Some of the pressure has been relieved from Black's position. Trading pieces when you have less space (as Black does in this position) is generally considered a good thing. Now Black has pressure on White's center and is caught up in development.
13,Bxc6,b5c6,r2qkb1r/1ppb1ppp/p1Bp1n2/3Np3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,Some of the pressure has been relieved from Black's position.

15,Nxf6+,d5f6,r2qkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1bp1N2/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,White missed 9. d5. Black has no Knights so closing the center would have benefited White and gained a tempo as Black's light squared Bishop would have to move to safety. White's move does nothing but force Black's Queen to a better square (g6) which increases the pressure on e4 and indirectly pins White's Knight to the defense of the Bishop.
16,Qxf6,d8f6,r3kb1r/1pp2ppp/p1bp1q2/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,White missed 9. d5.
