By the way: would Qe2 have been better? I see a very interesting line over there: after 10. Qd2, Qxc2. In my view, white can go 11. NxN (tactic, because it leaves the bishop en prise). Best black's seems to be BxBf4, leaving white with the exchange 12. NxRf8, KxN. After it, white frees the docks with Nf3. 
But wait: what if black goes after the a1 rook with: 12. NxRf8, Qxb2! ? White goes 13. Nb3, it seems the most sensible move. Black may want to exchange queens then taking the Nf8, and the game proceeds quietey, or go for 13.... Qc3+, 14. Kd1, Ne5, after which white is very unconfortable. Not whorty to try to grab a pawn (Nxe6), that frees black. 
So, Qe2 seems a bad choice, but a lot must be said, for sure."

The idea is that after 11.... f6, 12. gxf6, Nxf6, 13. Rg1, attacking. Or 12... Rxf6, that leads to strange lines like this one: 13. NxN, and if RxB, 14. Ne5, BxNe5, 15. dxe5, and I'm too tired to find out more. It is an interesting position.

I think white loses after Qa5+, followed with the knight sac, with either c3, Ke2 or Nd2. Do you agree? The three are interesting, believe me :-)"
