1,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Another tournament game, for me this comes while my rating is at its lowest range for some considerable time. This game however was over in only 6 moves."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Tournament start position, Bird opening, From Gambit."
3,fxe5,f4e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/8/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Nothing much wrong with this move, it's been a common one in the tournament."
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4P3/8/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,A bit of me thinks this is is a strange move and I have had mixed success with it in the tournament.
5,exd6,e5d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3P4/8/8/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"For me this move was a bit of an experiment, previous efforts had mostly revolved around Bxd6 but here I stuck with the old adage of getting knights out before bishops. The gameknot database seems to indicate this as promising too.

From my perspective I was starting to get ideas about a possible Ne4 and Qh4 early attack, trying to take advantage of the e1-h4 open diagonal"

7,dxc7,d6c7,rnbqkb1r/ppP2ppp/5n2/8/8/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,No real alternative here that I could see and I would love to get my queen to g3
8,Qxc7,d8c7,rnb1kb1r/ppq2ppp/5n2/8/8/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,No real alternative here that I could see and I would love to get my queen to g3
9,d4,d2d4,rnb1kb1r/ppq2ppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1P1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"This is the sort of normal developing move that with the benefit of hindsight looks quite weak. I'm not sure what would be better, perhaps e3 or Nc2"
10,Bg4,c8g4,rn2kb1r/ppq2ppp/5n2/8/3P2b1/8/PPP1P1PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,"Looking to tease the h pawn forward, if that doesn't work then the e pawn is still pinned to the queen and I have Bd6 threatening a bishop sac on h2, perhaps Bd6 would have been the better move, I'm still not entirely sure."
11,h3,h2h3,rn2kb1r/ppq2ppp/5n2/8/3P2b1/7P/PPP1P1P1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,This is the losing move for white.
12,Qg3+,c7g3,rn2kb1r/pp3ppp/5n2/8/3P2b1/6qP/PPP1P1P1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 7,"White resigned due to Kd2, Ne4#
