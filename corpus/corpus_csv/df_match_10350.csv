1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,The Caro-Kann is one of my favorite defenses. Black has all the advantages of the french and none of it's weaknesses. The only two weaknesses of the Caro-Kann are that black usually is a little worse in the endgame and white has an enduring space advantage. But in this game I choose to play a risky varation of the Caro-Kann; the Little know Bronstein-Larsen defense.

10,Ngf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1npppp/2p2n2/8/2BPN3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 3 6,"Here White chooses to exchange on f6 immediately Black has three main options 
1. 6. ...Ndxf6 with an interesting game.
2.  play exf6 which leads to the Kornchoi defense
3. As I play gxf6 of the bronstien-Larsen Caro-Kann varation."

12,gxf6,g7f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1npp1p/2p2p2/8/2BP4/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 7,"This is in my opinion an inferior move for black and is not for beginner players. I play it from time to time to spice things up. If black can survive the first wave of attacks by white he can usually get good counter play along the g file. This is known as the Bronstein-Larsen formation.
 
Black's strategy is simple 1. Place the H rook on the g file where it will eye the weak g2 pawn. 2. Develop the bishops to the King side. 3. Prepare for a f6-f5-f4 pawn break. 3. Castle Queen side. Amass huge pressure on the g file by playing Qg5, or Qh5. Of course that is if he can do all that before white deals a quick blow! However, as seen in this game Black has major weakness , but it is not easy for white to exploit it with accurate play. Thus, after black endure the initial attack he can usually mount a sufficient attack along the G file, or white's weak d5 pawn.
 
Black can also play exf6 moving into the Kornchoi variation. In that setup black has strong defensive and attacking chances. see this game for an

example: http://gameknot.com/chess.pl?bd=5122032"
13,Qh5,d1h5,r1bqkb1r/pp1npp1p/2p2p2/7Q/2BP4/8/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 1 7,"This move aims at the heart of Black's weakness. White can also try the quiet 7. c3, or Nf3. As strange as it may seem I do not think this is Whties best reply . I played a similar game against a player rated above 2000 which I managed to easily draw."
14,e6,e7e6,r1bqkb1r/pp1n1p1p/2p1pp2/7Q/2BP4/8/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 0 8,"The advantage of Black's gxf6 plan is that it creates an open g file from which to launch an attack. As well, Black has an extra pawn in the centre to mount a timely push in the centre if white gets carried away."
15,Ne2,g1e2,r1bqkb1r/pp1n1p1p/2p1pp2/7Q/2BP4/8/PPP1NPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 1 8,"better is Nf3, however the threat of Nf4 is sufficient to give black pause."
16,Nb6,d7b6,r1bqkb1r/pp3p1p/1np1pp2/7Q/2BP4/8/PPP1NPPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 2 9,Gaining tempo on the bishop on route to d5
17,Bb3,c4b3,r1bqkb1r/pp3p1p/1np1pp2/7Q/3P4/1B6/PPP1NPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 3 9,I could actually do way with this move. I played it with the idea of queen side plans in the future. But thinking about it now it creates more weaknesses that out weigh it strengths.
18,a5,a7a5,r1bqkb1r/1p3p1p/1np1pp2/p6Q/3P4/1B6/PPP1NPPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 0 10,I could actually do way with this move. I played it with the idea of queen side plans in the future. But thinking about it now it creates more weaknesses that out weigh it strengths.

20,Nd5,b6d5,r1bqkb1r/1p3p1p/2p1pp2/p2n3Q/P2P4/1B6/1PP1NPPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 1 11,These long knight manovuers are characteristic of the Bronstein-larsen varation.
21,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkb1r/1p3p1p/2p1pp2/p2n3Q/P2P4/1B6/1PP1NPPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 2 11,White could capture on d5 but would give up the bishop pair. Usually it is not wise to exchange pieces so early especially bishop pairs. You never know if you are going to miss them!
22,f5,f6f5,r1bqkb1r/1p3p1p/2p1p3/p2n1p1Q/P2P4/1B6/1PP1NPPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 0 12,making room on f6 for the bishop or knight as well as breaking communication between White's bishop and queen on d5. This effectively splits board in half.
23,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqkb1r/1p3p1p/2p1p3/p2n1pBQ/P2P4/1B6/1PP1NPPP/R4RK1 b kq - 1 12,it is pretty hard to resist this move with a gapping hole on f6
24,Nf6,d5f6,r1bqkb1r/1p3p1p/2p1pn2/p4pBQ/P2P4/1B6/1PP1NPPP/R4RK1 w kq - 2 13,"so far despite Black's inferior 6th move White has not found a real way of exploiting the weakness. Matter of fact, black is slowly consolidating his position."
25,Qh3,h5h3,r1bqkb1r/1p3p1p/2p1pn2/p4pB1/P2P4/1B5Q/1PP1NPPP/R4RK1 b kq - 3 13,Qh4 would have been better.
26,Rg8,h8g8,r1bqkbr1/1p3p1p/2p1pn2/p4pB1/P2P4/1B5Q/1PP1NPPP/R4RK1 w q - 4 14,exploiting White's inferior queen move.

28,Bg7,f8g7,r1bqk1r1/1p3pbp/2p1pn2/p4pB1/P2P3Q/1B6/1PP1NPPP/R4RK1 w q - 6 15,The bishop on g7 has two purposes. 1. to defend f6  2. To attack White's weak d5 pawn
29,Rfd1,f1d1,r1bqk1r1/1p3pbp/2p1pn2/p4pB1/P2P3Q/1B6/1PP1NPPP/R2R2K1 b q - 7 15,c3 would have been better. This would ensure domination of the centre. As well it would put the b7 bishop out of position.
