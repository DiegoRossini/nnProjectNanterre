1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"White starts with the Queen's Pawn Opening. This is the most common move leading to the Stonewall Attack. Other's include the 'Closed Blocker': 1. e3 and the Bird's Opening: 1. f4. A last one which is now often seen is 1. Nc3 or 1. Nf3. All these possibilities all lead to the same attack, but the extremely common ones are 1. d4 and 1. Nc3."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"After 1. d4 I usually open up with 1. ... Nf6 stopping 2. e4 or 1. ... e6 trying to open a line for my DSB. This is known as the 'Closed Blocker with Colours Reversed' or, as in an example after 1. e4 e6 it is then named after the foul but fabulous French, 'The French Defence'. But this serious but relaxing move: 1. ... d5 mentions key features of the Queen's Pawn Game."
3,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Strictly speaking, White makes this text move because he is trying to steer the play into the Pawn Pattern which he has observed, and with which you will become familiar. From a theoretical point of view, White's move has certain advantages and certain disadvantages. Thus, White will now be able to develop his LSB. This is a factor of the greatest importance, as the bishop will play a big role in White's coming plans. True, e3 blocks white's DSB but that does not matter yet, at this point."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"This is an excellent developing move which has the merit of controlling e4 and preparing for castling. Also, this secures Black's position before he comfortably counter-attacks/attacks. Also, if the greatest move 3. f4?! is played, then Black can reply with the miraculous 3. ... Ne4! establishing a strong outpost in the centre."
5,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/3BP3/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 3,"! This is one of the key moves in White's development. The Bishop move prepares for castling, sets up the bishop on a strong diagonal, and disputes many glisters of control on the vital square: e4. In addition, it also stops 4. ... Ne4?! after 4. f4! without risking doubled pawns for Black. Plus, when Black has castled, the bishop will also be eyeing the h7 pawn and the f5 square."
6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3P4/3BP3/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 4,"Black follows suit, preparing for his development of his DSB (main bishop). Black also makes this text move because he is trying to build a critical pawn structure and defend easily, also counter-attacking on the queenside. This move, as seen with White's 2. e3 also has certain advantages and also certain disadvantages, including the blockade of his LSB but the strong a3-f8 diagonal suited for his DSB."
7,Nd2,b1d2,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3P4/3BP3/PPPN1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 4,"White intends to play 5. e4 which is one of the characteristic moves of his Pawn Pattern. Once 5. e4 has been played, Black can consequently bring out his other knight without causing much danger to White's adequate position."
8,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/3P4/3BP3/PPPN1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,"! A good move theoretically, as it engages d-pawn and thus minimizes somewhat White's pressure on e5. Of course White would not dream of playing 5. dxc5? as that would relax his grip of the valuable square e5, and this allows Black to develop another piece, after 5. ... Bxc5."
9,c3,c2c3,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/3P4/2PBP3/PP1N1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,! White supports the d-pawn and also retreats for the LSB along the powerful diagonal.
10,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2pp4/3P4/2PBP3/PP1N1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 1 6,"Black aims to develop his knight and faintly press on the e5 square and somewhat threatens to play 6. ... e5!! or 6. ... Be7! and finally, the light 6. ... Bd7!? This forces White to play 6. f4! which prevents Black from playing the vital 6. ... e5!!  and launches the unique Stonewall Pawn Structure. Note that 6. ... c4? would have released the grip on the tight pawn chains of White's personalized structure, delete his faint but solid attack on the queenside, and after that, White can still play 7. Bc2! without any catastrophes or any major disruptions. Plus, it would still be controlling the b1-h5 diagonal, which is a very important piece of the board for White's attack (The Stonewall Attack)."
11,f4,f2f4,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2pp4/3P1P2/2PBP3/PP1N2PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 6,"! This move completes the Stonewall pawn pattern (although maybe rots the kingside). Now we have 6. ... e5  permanently prevented, and White prepares to anchor his King Knight at a powerful outpost following 7. Ngf3! Also, White keeps the majority of his pawns on Black squares, where his LSB will be extremely powerful (not to mention his useless DSB). Now we begin to see how the Stonewall Pattern got its name!"
12,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/2pp4/3P1P2/2PBP3/PP1N2PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 1 7,"Black continues developing and prepares for castling. Notice how 6. ... Bd6?! encounters the danger of a pawn fork on e5, when a pawn reaches e4/e5."
13,Ngf3,g1f3,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/2pp4/3P1P2/2PBPN2/PP1N2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 7,"! White immediately increases pressure near Black's Kingside. This is the reason why Black played 6. ... Be7! which indirectly defends Black's Kingside when the knight on f6 has moved. Another option would have been to 'fianchetto' Black's DSB but it would take an extra developing move in the opening, although the positive fact is that it would have given his Kingside extra protection."
14,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/2pp4/3P1P2/2PBPN2/PP1N2PP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 3 8,"Black gets his King into safety so he hopes-and looks forward to completing his development on the Queenside with 8. ... Bd7!? or 8. b6!? However, Black needs to huddle up quickly, as White's attack is preparing to be launched!"
15,Ne5,f3e5,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/2ppN3/3P1P2/2PBP3/PP1N2PP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 4 8,"!! White has now achieved his opening objectives: He has set up the Stonewall Pawn pattern, which gives him a firm grip on the centre; he has posted his LSB at d3 with strong attacking prospects, and he has brought his King Knight to e5 emphasizing his grip on the centre."
16,Qc7,d8c7,r1b2rk1/ppq1bppp/2n1pn2/2ppN3/3P1P2/2PBP3/PP1N2PP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 5 9,"!? Black intends to ""fianchetto"" his LSB. Before he can do this, however, he must give his Queen Knight additional protection."
17,O-O,e1g1,r1b2rk1/ppq1bppp/2n1pn2/2ppN3/3P1P2/2PBP3/PP1N2PP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 6 9,"! While automatically removing his King to safety, White enhances the force of coming attack by bring his King Rook into action. White has shown good sense in adding the King Rook to his attacking forces before embarking on an offensive."
18,b6,b7b6,r1b2rk1/p1q1bppp/1pn1pn2/2ppN3/3P1P2/2PBP3/PP1N2PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 10,"!? Black is looking forward to play 10. ... Bb7!? which is not very useful at this moment (until later on), because White is strongly developing and attacking, and Black needs to think about defending himself, and not concerning too much on developing Queenside pieces in two/three moves. 9. ... Bd7 is still fairly OK and comfortable, and even after 10. ... Bd7!? White would not even think about playing 11. Nxd7? as Black would relax after 11. ... Qxd7. Note that after 10. ... Bd7!? 11. Nxd7? Nxd7?! would leave Black's valuable h7 pawn undefended. Still, after 10. ... Bd7!? 11. Nxd7? White would have an uncomfortable time strengthening his grip on the centre and attack."
19,g4,g2g4,r1b2rk1/p1q1bppp/1pn1pn2/2ppN3/3P1PP1/2PBP3/PP1N3P/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 10,"!? White's violent thrust of the King Knight pawn is made with several objectives in mind. His basic idea is to drive away black's king knight, so his Bishop can be freely attacking h7. The downside is that White's kingside is also weakened, but at the moment the Black Queen must wait until it can make use of the h2-b8 diagonal, and the Bishop on e7 needs a tempo to reach h4 where it will dominate a specific but extremely fierce attack when the Black Queen gets to a place like h3, where it is safe and provides a powerful attack for Black. If Black's LSB reaches h3, his DSB reaching h4 and his queen dominating the g-file from a safe distance, and possibly a knight placed on g4 or f3, White would be in big trouble! But all this can and must wait."
20,Bb7,c8b7,r4rk1/pbq1bppp/1pn1pn2/2ppN3/3P1PP1/2PBP3/PP1N3P/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 11,"! Now Black actually threatens to play 11. ... Nxe5! But why? Now the claim is made that NxN would be good. Yes, I have explained that, but the question is, why now, and not before?

The point is, that after 11. ... Nxe5! 12. fxe5 Black would be able (after 10 ... Bb7) to play 12...Ne4!! establishing and maintaining an outpost of his own. White's attacking plans would be disrupted, which means that his structure will weaken."
