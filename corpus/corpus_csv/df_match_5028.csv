2,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,The Dutch (A80).
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Preventing Black from doing 2...e5?? unless he does 2...d6.
4,Nh6,g8h6,rnbqkb1r/ppppp1pp/7n/5p2/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,?! A dubious move; the knight is in the wrong place. Better was 2...Nf3.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/ppppp1pp/7n/5p2/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 3,I have a slight advantage due to well placed knights.

8,d5,d7d5,r1bqkb1r/ppp1p1pp/2n4n/3p1p2/3P1B2/2N2N2/PPP1PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"A partial mistake. After this move, I should play 6.Be3 or 6.Bg3 depending on what he does next."

16,e6,e7e6,r1bqkb1r/ppp3pp/4p3/3pB3/3Q2p1/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 9,"With that, I had the option to gain more material with 9.Qxg4 and lose the Bishop for two pawns, or 9.O-O-O, which is safer."
17,Bxg7,e5g7,r1bqkb1r/ppp3Bp/4p3/3p4/3Q2p1/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 9,A mistake for me. I got greedy about the pawn and the rook and forgot how mobile the rook actually is.
