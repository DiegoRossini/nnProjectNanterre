1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,ive been practicing the nimzowitsch defense instead of the sicilian for the passed 2-3 months and its helped me improve my rating by 250~ heres a nice game with a gambit i love to do.
2,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"im usually most often faced with d4 in this situation but in these rare games where an oponent follows with nf3 i love transposing into this gambit,  ive had a few blunderous games with it  but its been very good to me."
3,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 2,"im usually most often faced with d4 in this situation but in these rare games where an oponent follows with nf3 i love transposing into this gambit,  ive had a few blunderous games with it  but its been very good to me."
4,f5,f7f5,r1bqkbnr/ppppp1pp/2n5/5p2/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"the fun part about my blunders they were usually against much higher rated oponents which made me learn quickly how to improve my moves and discover new ones.

gambit starts here if they accept, it is to undermine whites middle and hold a strong middle as black"
5,exf5,e4f5,r1bqkbnr/ppppp1pp/2n5/5P2/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"from here on the game can take Very many different dynamics depending on what white does. the most aggressive move is usually Bb5, others also tend to play D4 first.

when white starts to try to hold onto the pawn is when a nice game develops for black,
Be2 or g4 are generally not good moves for white, neither is Kh4  and Bd3 also lacks alot of punch where black will have a fun game if he plays it right."

8,Bxf5,c8f5,r2qkbnr/ppp1p1pp/2n5/3p1b2/8/5N2/PPPPBPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"some games ive gone g6 here others times ive also tried e6 or Kf6 also which have given me various results sometimes very difficult games for myself as white takes a really Passive deployment to an opening thats meant to be very aggressive and counter whites mid.

but this game white is not developing mid so i opted to go with a new d4 to crunch white in"
9,O-O,e1g1,r2qkbnr/ppp1p1pp/2n5/3p1b2/8/5N2/PPPPBPPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 5,"some games ive gone g6 here others times ive also tried e6 or Kf6 also which have given me various results sometimes very difficult games for myself as white takes a really Passive deployment to an opening thats meant to be very aggressive and counter whites mid.

10,d4,d5d4,r2qkbnr/ppp1p1pp/2n5/5b2/3p4/5N2/PPPPBPPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 6,"hes forced to d3 if not i can push my pawn to d3 end up with possibly cxd3 Bxd3 Bxd3 Qxd3 blocking his black bishop in behind his pawn and then possibly castle queen side or develop my knight but he opted to play the D3,  which i found was ok as it kept his white bishop in"

12,e5,e7e5,r2qkbnr/ppp3pp/2n5/4pb2/3p4/3P1N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,"as im venturing forth in my new line in this opening i can start seeing my e5 pawn can be lost or can become my demise if i start focusing too hard on defending it,

for now ill prevent his Black bishop from coming into the game."

15,h3,h2h3,r2qkbnr/ppp3p1/2n4p/4pb2/3p4/3P1N1P/PPP1BPP1/RNBQR1K1 b kq - 0 8,having played h6 last move allows me to have a tuck away spot for my white bishop when he plays g4 and him moving his pawns up is desired as im going king side attack
16,Bd6,f8d6,r2qk1nr/ppp3p1/2nb3p/4pb2/3p4/3P1N1P/PPP1BPP1/RNBQR1K1 w kq - 1 9,at the time of the game after playing this move and following his reply is when i took a while to analyse that fighting for the e5 square was very dangerous for me in the long run
17,Nh2,f3h2,r2qk1nr/ppp3p1/2nb3p/4pb2/3p4/3P3P/PPP1BPPN/RNBQR1K1 b kq - 2 9,"i had to fully develop, connect my rooks, queen side castle and forgo the e5 pawn.i concluded that path would have me in a far better position if play developed naturaly i would have too many pieces developed near his king for it to matter at the part of where i would lose my pawn."
18,Nf6,g8f6,r2qk2r/ppp3p1/2nb1n1p/4pb2/3p4/3P3P/PPP1BPPN/RNBQR1K1 w kq - 3 10,"i had to fully develop, connect my rooks, queen side castle and forgo the e5 pawn.i concluded that path would have me in a far better position if play developed naturaly i would have too many pieces developed near his king for it to matter at the part of where i would lose my pawn."

21,g4,g2g4,r3k2r/pppq2p1/2nb1n1p/4pb2/3p2P1/3P1B1P/PPP2P1N/RNBQR1K1 b kq - 0 11,as i saw the battle coming to e5 is where i had to think of what my plan was. this is where i saw the checkmate from.  from my part thats if my oponent played how i calculated too lol but the game development looked natural enough to calculate.
22,Bh7,f5h7,r3k2r/pppq2pb/2nb1n1p/4p3/3p2P1/3P1B1P/PPP2P1N/RNBQR1K1 w kq - 1 12,as i saw the battle coming to e5 is where i had to think of what my plan was. this is where i saw the checkmate from.  from my part thats if my oponent played how i calculated too lol but the game development looked natural enough to calculate.

25,Nc4,d2c4,2kr3r/pppq2pb/2nb1n1p/4p3/2Np2P1/3P1B1P/PPP2P1N/R1BQR1K1 b - - 4 13,"he wants to fight on e5 i knew it from a while back this is where i trick him ill act as if i dont want to fight on e5 anymore but to just gain time on that diagonal without repositioning his WSB either, to keep mine alive i do not want to have any types of exchanges on e4 either"
26,Bb4,d6b4,2kr3r/pppq2pb/2n2n1p/4p3/1bNp2P1/3P1B1P/PPP2P1N/R1BQR1K1 w - - 5 14,for sure he had no other choice but to go with what he had planned. i dont want to eat his Rook i want to reposition my Bishop on d6 without his queen or black bishop getting involved
27,Nxe5,c4e5,2kr3r/pppq2pb/2n2n1p/4N3/1b1p2P1/3P1B1P/PPP2P1N/R1BQR1K1 b - - 0 14,for sure he had no other choice but to go with what he had planned. i dont want to eat his Rook i want to reposition my Bishop on d6 without his queen or black bishop getting involved

29,Rxe5,e1e5,2kr3r/pppq2pb/5n1p/4R3/1b1p2P1/3P1B1P/PPP2P1N/R1BQ2K1 b - - 0 15,this is planning to open up the lines for my h8 rook it also kinda forces my oponent to make a passive move
30,Bd6,b4d6,2kr3r/pppq2pb/3b1n1p/4R3/3p2P1/3P1B1P/PPP2P1N/R1BQ2K1 w - - 1 16,this is planning to open up the lines for my h8 rook it also kinda forces my oponent to make a passive move

34,h5,h6h5,2kr3r/pppq3b/3b1n2/6pp/3p2P1/3P1B1P/PPPBRP1N/R2Q2K1 w - - 0 18,looks like a mistake but its time to promote queen to d6 and not let him start stacking his queen and rooks or develop any type of attack queen side either.
