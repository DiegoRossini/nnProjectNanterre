6,d6,d7d6,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,"Black played the Old Steinitz defense, known for its cramped but solid positions. I have an old book, by Leonard Barden called The Ruy Lopez, Winning Chess with 1P-K4. It's one of only two opening books I own. It offers only a very brief analysis in passing, but it says the Old Steinitz is passive and fallen into disfavor, and ""it is most forcefully countered by white's maintaining the option of castling on either wing"" - well, I already blew that, didn't I? The book says 4. d4 and 5. Nc3 are called for. Of course, much may have changed in 46 years, since the GK DB seems to believe the move as played is a strong choice."
