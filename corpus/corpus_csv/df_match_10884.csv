1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Here's a very modern game (NED championship 2005) in the botvinnik.  This is a completely wild line, and Van Wely made a nice find in it, though it's quite a subtle move.  This game is significantly more complicated than the previous two games I showed in the botvinnik."

11,e4,e2e4,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/6B1/2pPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,Black grabs a pawn and white grabs the lion's share of the center as well as preparing to add pressure to f6 with a later e5.

14,h6,h7h6,rnbqkb1r/p4pp1/2p1pn1p/1p2P1B1/2pP4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,This is the best move to save the double attacked knight on f6.  7... b4 is easily met by 8.Ne4 adding even more pressure to the pinned knight on f6.
15,Bh4,g5h4,rnbqkb1r/p4pp1/2p1pn1p/1p2P3/2pP3B/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 8,"White's key point is his pressure on f6, this move retains that."

19,Bxg5,h4g5,rnbqkb1r/p4p2/2p1pn2/1p2P1B1/2pP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 10,"This move stops 11.Bxf6 which would give white a superpowerful bishop on f6.  White won't play Bxf6 because the g5 bishop is more important than either of the knights, black is covered with dark squared holes (notice how all his pawns but one are on light squares).  White should keep his dark squared bishop to attack the undefended dark squares, thus he can't exchange it for a white if he wants an advantage.  Black can also play 10... Be7 to cover f6, but 10... Nbd7 beginning black's queenside development is more popular."

Both moves have merits, and they can easily transpose."
22,Bb7,c8b7,r2qkb1r/pb1n1p2/2p1pP2/1p4B1/2pP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 12,"Taking back on f6 with the d7 knight giving white another nasty pin on f6.  Black would equalize material, but he can do that almost anytime, and there's no need to give white a pin.  Also for the moment the pawn on f6 gets in the way of white's bishop and black should be in no hurry to take such a helpful pawn."

Notice that black can't take on d5 for example: 13... exd5 14.Qe2  Be7 15.fxe7.  Note that if black allows the position to open, the pawn on f6 suddenly becomes a huge help for white."

It can get in white's way but black has to be INCREDIBLY careful about it.  There are two alternatives to 13... Qb6 though neither are are common.  13... Bh6 trades off white's valuable dark squared bishop.  The second alternative, 13... Qc7 threatens the dangerous 14... Qe5 ."
