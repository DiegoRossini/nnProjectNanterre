2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I prefer the Sicilian over the ""principled"" e5, since c5 controls the same d4 square with a less important pawn"
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"This is ""delayed Alapin,"" rather than normal Alapin where White plays c3 on the second move. I think Alapin is stronger than delayed Alapin since Black can stall d4 unlike if White had played c3 on move 2"
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"This is ""delayed Alapin,"" rather than normal Alapin where White plays c3 on the second move. I think Alapin is stronger than delayed Alapin since Black can stall d4 unlike if White had played c3 on move 2"

6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/2p5/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,There is an opening trap where White plays Nxe4?? and White wins with Qa4  winning the knight. Another line is h3 (preventing Bg4) followed by Bd3 where White wants the bishop on c2 to defend e4 before playing d4.

8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/2p5/4P3/2P2N2/PP1PBPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 3 5,"I think g6 was a better move because I didn't realize that White could play d4 here. After d4, Nxe4 is impossible because of d5 followed by Qa4  winning the e4-knight after the c6-knight moves"
9,d3,d2d3,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/2p5/4P3/2PP1N2/PP2BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"White must not have realized the chance to expand the centre, and plays a passive move."

I was able to develop my kingside knight, unlike in French Advance where it is blocked by e5. I have a pawn on b6 instead of a queen, which strengthens my center. White has undeveloped his bishop, which is dubious in this type of opening. Because of these differences, I would prefer my position."
