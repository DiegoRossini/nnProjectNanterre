1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The French Defence, though conceding more than many other defences, has the virtue of solidity."
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The French Defence, though conceding more than many other defences, has the virtue of solidity."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Building a broad centre.  This move is by far and away the most preferred line.
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"The most usual, and what I normally play as well.  But every now and ten I will switch to 2...b6!? - Owen's Defence. Non-committal in the centre, Black intends later to undermine white's central hold.   With this pawn advance, Black is at once challenging for the centre more directly."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"Main Line.  Also playable are 3.e5 (Advance Variation) and 3.Nd2 (Tarrasch).  The Advance line intends to cramp Black's game, especially on the K-side.  But Black usually challenges this plan outright, with ...c4 after which a big battle rages around the d4-square: 3.e5 c4  4.Nf3 Nc6  5.c3 Qb6.  The Tarrasch is more restrained, but seeks a K-side attack without allowing the pin by a Bishop at b4."
6,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/1b1PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,The Winawer - one of my favorite Chess openings - for both sides.
7,e5,e4e5,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3pP3/1b1P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"White's most usual response, this heralds an intention to attack the K-side.  White could keep Black guessing and play 4.a3 right now, or even 4.Bd2: the 'Finger Slip.'"
8,c5,c7c5,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/1b1P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,Equally thematic: Black looks to operate on the Q-side.
9,a3,a2a3,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/1b1P4/P1N5/1PP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"Forcing Black to make a decision about what to do with the Bishop.  I rather like the retreat to a5, but have to admit that it is not bringing me very good results against strong opposition.  More usual in any case is the exchange on c3."
10,Bxc3+,b4c3,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/P1b5/1PP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"Apparently preparing to castle.  But it is probably just as well to develop this knight right now, as otherwise 7.Qg4 would induce the g-pawn's advance, leaving the dark squares weak.  It would be playable, but I can't say I like it much.  This might be due to the many times in the past I have been able to exploit the dark square weakness when I've had the white pieces."
11,bxc3,b2c3,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,"Apparently preparing to castle.

It would be playable, but I can't say I like it much.  This might be due to the many times in the past I have been able to exploit the dark square weakness when I've had the white pieces."
12,Ne7,g8e7,rnbqk2r/pp2nppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 7,"Apparently preparing to castle.

13,Qg4,d1g4,rnbqk2r/pp2nppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P2Q1/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 2 7,"Although White could simply develop by 7.Nf3, this Queen sortie is quite popular, and quite good, too.  What should Black do?  He could defend the g-pawn by ...Kf8 or even ...0-0, but I like to let the K-side go.  There are compensations, as you will see."
14,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqk2r/pp2nppp/4p3/3pP3/3p2Q1/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 0 8,Instead 8...cxd4 was possible.  But here white accepts the challenge and goes for the lucrative raid among Black's K-side pawns.
15,Qxg7,g4g7,rnbqk2r/pp2npQp/4p3/3pP3/3p4/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 0 8,Instead 8...cxd4 was possible.  But here white accepts the challenge and goes for the lucrative raid among Black's K-side pawns.
16,Rg8,h8g8,rnbqk1r1/pp2npQp/4p3/3pP3/3p4/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQq - 1 9,Taking the open file.
17,Qxh7,g7h7,rnbqk1r1/pp2np1Q/4p3/3pP3/3p4/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQq - 0 9,Black's turn: attacking c3 and e5 both.
18,Qc7,d8c7,rnb1k1r1/ppq1np1Q/4p3/3pP3/3p4/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQq - 1 10,Black's turn: attacking c3 and e5 both.
19,Bd2,c1d2,rnb1k1r1/ppq1np1Q/4p3/3pP3/3p4/P1P5/2PB1PPP/R3KBNR b KQq - 2 10,"Defending c3 and averting the K/R fork by the Queen.  Black could play ...Qxe5 now, but prefers to create an imposing-looking pawn phalanx in the centre."
20,dxc3,d4c3,rnb1k1r1/ppq1np1Q/4p3/3pP3/8/P1p5/2PB1PPP/R3KBNR w KQq - 0 11,Instead 10...Qxe5ch  11.Ne2 and if then 11...dxc3  12.Bxc3.  I much prefer the text.
21,Bf4,d2f4,rnb1k1r1/ppq1np1Q/4p3/3pP3/5B2/P1p5/2P2PPP/R3KBNR b KQq - 1 11,"This might look like a loss of time for white, but in fact he did well to force Black to commit to a line of action.    Black's central majority looks impressive, but the fact is, it's not very easy to get it moving.  White, meanwhile, has a passed h-pawn, and that has to be a consideration for the rest of the game."
22,Nbc6,b8c6,r1b1k1r1/ppq1np1Q/2n1p3/3pP3/5B2/P1p5/2P2PPP/R3KBNR w KQq - 2 12,"Now that the opening skirmishes have died down, both sides look to completing their development.  This is a good moment to review the position.  Black's position looks the more solid, and his central pawns the more imposing.  He is a little further ahead in development as well.  But White has badly wounded Black's K-side, such that the White passed  h-pawn remains a long-term asset.  Not so far ahead in development, White can be picky about how he mobilizes his K-side.  Altogether, this is a very unclear position, difficult to call."
23,Nf3,g1f3,r1b1k1r1/ppq1np1Q/2n1p3/3pP3/5B2/P1p2N2/2P2PPP/R3KB1R b KQq - 3 12,"(?) A mistake, but a very plausible one.  Seeing an opportunity to strike at the f7-square, White goes for it.  The threat is 14.Qxf7ch Kd8  15.Nxe6ch.  In response, I did briefly consider 13...Nxe5, but quickly found Black had a much better reply..."
24,Bd7,c8d7,r3k1r1/ppqbnp1Q/2n1p3/3pP3/5B2/P1p2N2/2P2PPP/R3KB1R w KQq - 4 13,"(?) A mistake, but a very plausible one.  Seeing an opportunity to strike at the f7-square, White goes for it.

27,Bxg5,f4g5,r3k3/ppqbnp1Q/2n1p3/3pP1B1/8/P1p5/2P2PPP/R3KB1R b KQq - 0 14,Forking King and Bishop.  What can White do about it?
