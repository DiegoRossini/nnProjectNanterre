1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"One of my friends suggested me some other chess game site with some new interface which obviously was confusing for me. I was NOT interested to play as I wanted to leave for some work but was just checking some options and by mistake landed up accepting a 5 min blitz game. Now I am a very slow player and need lots of time. And plus I was in a hurry but then didnt want to lose my first ever game! So I played this game. However I won because of blunder(s) by opponent but I am more excited because of rapid moves (thoughts) I made. (again, I am very bad at rapid chess!)"
