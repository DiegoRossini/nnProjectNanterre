1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I usually play 1.e4 because 2 pieces are released. But 1.d4 I play rarely because sometimes it can get boring but 1.d4 is what many grandmasters play. But it was worth a try!
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,not very common against  1.d4.  I tried to get him into the French defence by doing.....

4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3pp3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"2.d6?  this move deserves a question mark it really does, because it is a dull move,  far too  passive and both bishops are shut in."
5,Be3,c1e3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3pp3/8/3PP3/4B3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,getting out my Queenside pieces.
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3ppn2/8/3PP3/4B3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,!   Developing a piece with a threat  (4.Nxe4)  good move!
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3ppn2/8/3PP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 3 4,! developing a piece too and at the same time covering the e4 pawn!
8,c6,c7c6,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2pppn2/8/3PP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,?   Prevents the b8 knight from coming to c6.

12,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/2pppn2/8/3PPP2/2N1BN2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 3 7,"?  Yes, Yes, Yes  Dellerth had castled on the same side as my attack was  going to   take place. I think Dellerth  should have delayed castleing or maybe not to castle at all."
13,Qd2,d1d2,rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/2pppn2/8/3PPP2/2N1BN2/PPPQ2PP/R3KB1R b KQ - 4 7,"Getting ready to 0-0-0 and also to have the Queen and bishop lined up on 
    the diagonal. Not blocking my f1 bishop,  which was my very powerful weapon
   later on!"
14,b5,b7b5,rnbq1rk1/p3bppp/2pppn2/1p6/3PPP2/2N1BN2/PPPQ2PP/R3KB1R w KQ - 0 8,!    A very good move. That made me not wanting to 0-0-0 at any point. Dellerth was also threatning 8. b4  9. Ne2 and Nxe4  winning  a pawn

     rook, but I did not use it."
