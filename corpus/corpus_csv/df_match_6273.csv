1. Don't make excess pawn moves  2.aim to develop all pieces as actively as possible and connect rooks (castle)
3.don't move a piece twice before moving most of your other pieces once, UNLESS YOU CAN MAKE A SERIOUS THREAT TO YOUR OPPONENT'S POSITION THAT MUST BE MET.
4.hamper your opponent's development, but don't go out of your way to do so."
