4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"I wanted to try something different here. I did not feel like playing a cluttered, positional game today."
5,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pP4/8/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,Great! White now has an isolani pawn which gives me a focal point of attack. Let's see how long he can hold his ground here.

10,e5,e7e5,rnb1kbnr/pp3ppp/8/3qp3/3P4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,The most direct method.
11,Be3,c1e3,rnb1kbnr/pp3ppp/8/3qp3/3P4/4B3/PP3PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 6,Not wanting to trade.  Both (6. dxe5 Qxd1+ (?!) 7. Kxd1 ... I go down a pawn but White cannot castle) and (6. dxe5 Qxe5+ 7. Be2 Be7 where White has minimal central influence) seemed unappealing to White I guess.
12,exd4,e5d4,rnb1kbnr/pp3ppp/8/3q4/3p4/4B3/PP3PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,The problem pawn gets axed anyway.
