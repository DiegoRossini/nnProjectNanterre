Black could eventually bring a pawn to the d4 square and fork the bishop and knight if I am not careful. However, I'm aware of the possibility, so if I see black moving towards that, I'll move either the knight or bishop to safety first."

Otherwise, the knight could take the bishop on e6 and leave a temporarily unprotected pawn on c6. With most of black's pawns on light squares, and me having a light square bishop, I might be able to pick off those pawns later.  On the downside, taking out black's bishop gives black's rook control over a half-open file."
