of a game played in late 2007.  Cursory, at best, but at least some ideas 
to throw in the hat.  Thanks to everyone at Gameknot who continues to make this a wonderful
place to freely play and freely learn the game we all love."

challenge the solidness of White's huge pawn on e4.  Also, white's d pawn would be hemmed 
in stagnating the development of White's queenside minor pieces.  
Problem with this option is that uses an additional move for the same piece in the opening.  Already
having the disadvantage as the player who goes second in the game, Black should not nurse that
problem by trying to stir up trouble just yet in the center.  Indeed, it was good that Black didn't waste 
time with that- Black didn't even have time to castle this game!"

Another option here for White is to develop his bishop to Bb5 and allowing the king to castle.  If
Black moves his queen to b6, White can capture the knight on c6 and reducing some pressure off
of d4.  Tough call as this would give Black the two bishop advantage."

on the kingside on the h file (after...Bg7 fianchetto, Black has a nice castle).  In exchange, white has the more mobility, or ""space"" since the position is closed in the center, thus making his knights more valuable.  
Indeed, Black would have trouble developing the ""problem"" bishop in the French Defense.  It wasn't until
move 15 where Black's light squared bishop made a cameo during an exchange on e6.

On another note, if White decides not to exchange on h6, then if Black moves the Knight to the
 outpost f5 White can always play the irritating g4."

clear up the center for play along the long diagonals (a1-h8 and b1-g7).  Throughout the game, white
didn't have a justified reason for the pawn sacrifices, therefore allowing me to take. 

Notice here an idea that I read in one of Silmans books.  Certainly not an original idea, but he helped 
me understand it better:  It is common that your attack should be directed towards the side where your pawns are pointed.  
With my f7-e6-d5-c4 it's easy to see that my attack on the queenside is further justified."
