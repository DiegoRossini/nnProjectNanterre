11,O-O,e1g1,rnbqk1nr/pppp1pb1/7p/6p1/2BPPp2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 6,?! I don't like this push as much as I would like e4-e5. The text creates a hole on e5 and gives the Black Bishop pretty much unlimited scope on the long diagonal.

This move was really unexpected at the time, but it's actually a kind-of okay way of transferring forces over to the kingside to defend against Black's mounting assault, assuming White uses the next several moves efficiently.
