27,Qd2,d1d2,r1b2rk1/2p2pbp/1p1qp1p1/p2n2B1/P2P4/1B3N1P/1PPQ1PP1/R3R1K1 b - - 1 14,14.c3 was another candidate move but this one prevents 14. ... h6

31,Rad1,a1d1,r1r3k1/1bp2pbp/1p1qp1p1/p2n2B1/P2P4/1BP2N1P/1P1Q1PP1/3RR1K1 b - - 2 16,"To menace the queen (and, indirectly, prevent 16. c5) - White's developpement is completed : center strongly supported - Good possibilities to attack black's kinside.

33,dxc5,d4c5,r1r3k1/1b3pbp/1p1qp1p1/p1Pn2B1/P7/1BP2N1P/1P1Q1PP1/3RR1K1 b - - 0 17,Obvious move to get the best of white superiority on the d file (black cannot double the queen with a rook because of white's DSB).
