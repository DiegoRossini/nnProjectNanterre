1) My knight holds a powerful square in the centre
2) My d7 bishop can now get out onto the board
3) The c-file is now wide open offering good attacking chances (to either side)
The other posibility would have been ...e5, driving the powerfully placed white knight away and gaining a tempo to move out the rook on the next move."

35,f4,f2f4,5rk1/ppqb1ppp/4p3/8/2PN1Pn1/4P3/P2QN1PP/2R3K1 b - - 0 18,"Easily defended, though perhaps Ng3 would be better as now the e3 pawn looks very weak"
