4,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/8/2p1p3/4P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"This response is not in the database.  Black usually does pretty well moving a knight here, either Nf6 or Nc6 instead."
5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/8/2p1p3/2B1P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 1 3,"Ok, this is the famous four move checkmate.  Black must guard against QxPf7#.  Qe7 would probably work."
6,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/3p4/2p1p3/2B1P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 0 4,Nope.  Blunder.  QxPf7# -- game over.  Black has lost.
7,Bb5+,c4b5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/3p4/1Bp1p3/4P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 1 4,"Blunder.  QxPf7# (that little hash mark or pound sign means check mate).  The bishop protects the queen against KxQ.  The black king has nowhere to move.  Here black can interpose the bishop, or the knight @ d7 or c6.  I recommend the bishop."
8,Bd7,c8d7,rn1qkbnr/pp1b1ppp/3p4/1Bp1p3/4P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 2 5,Yes.
9,Bc4,b5c4,rn1qkbnr/pp1b1ppp/3p4/2p1p3/2B1P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 3 5,Once again black must defend against QxPf7#.
