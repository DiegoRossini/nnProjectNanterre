5,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3P4/3P4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,The EXCHANGE?  I had never faced this before... I suppose this is one of the nice things about being a lower-rated player with 5000  games playing a higher rated one with ~ 30 games...

11,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p2n2/3p2B1/3P4/2N3P1/PP2PP1P/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 1 6,A mildly annoying pin.
12,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p2n2/3p1bB1/3P4/2N3P1/PP2PP1P/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 2 7,"Breaking the pin, but perhaps Nbd2 was better, as this is my ""good"" bishop, on a very passive square."

16,O-O,e8g8,rn1q1rk1/pp2bppp/2p2n2/3p1bB1/3P4/2N1PNP1/PP3P1P/R2QKB1R w KQ - 1 9,challenging my light-square bishop.

18,Bg4,f5g4,rn1q1rk1/pp2bppp/2p2n2/3p2B1/3P2b1/2NBPNP1/PP3P1P/R2QK2R w KQ - 3 10,"?  Not a good move.  Moving the same piece twice in the opening is usually a bad idea, but I should've jumped at the chance to exchange the Bf4.  Now, while this pin looks dangerous since the g pawn is out of place, that threat proves to be a phantom."
19,h3,h2h3,rn1q1rk1/pp2bppp/2p2n2/3p2B1/3P2b1/2NBPNPP/PP3P2/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 10,! A strong move that forces black to either give up the bishop pair or concede a space advantage to white.
20,Bh5,g4h5,rn1q1rk1/pp2bppp/2p2n2/3p2Bb/3P4/2NBPNPP/PP3P2/R2QK2R w KQ - 1 11,Wrong choice?  It's hard to find a good move for the bishop.
21,g4,g3g4,rn1q1rk1/pp2bppp/2p2n2/3p2Bb/3P2P1/2NBPN1P/PP3P2/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 11,Rolling the bishop back to g6.

23,Bxg6,d3g6,rn1q1rk1/pp2bppp/2p2nB1/3p2B1/3P2P1/2N1PN1P/PP3P2/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 12,Now black gets the choice of which pawn to double.  The only compensation I have is that his kingside pawns are pretty far-flung.

29,Bh4,g5h4,r2q1rk1/pp1nb1p1/2p2npp/3p4/3P2PB/2N1P2P/PP1N1P2/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 15,"?!  Underestimating the intent of Nd2.  Black has the idea to play g5 and then exchange the bishops on g3, opening the f-file completely.  White has other ideas."
30,Bd6,e7d6,r2q1rk1/pp1n2p1/2pb1npp/3p4/3P2PB/2N1P2P/PP1N1P2/R2Q1RK1 w - - 2 16,"?!  Underestimating the intent of Nd2.  Black has the idea to play g5 and then exchange the bishops on g3, opening the f-file completely.  White has other ideas."

32,Qc7,d8c7,r4rk1/ppqn2p1/2pb1npp/3p4/3P1PPB/2N1P2P/PP1N4/R2Q1RK1 w - - 1 17,Trying to make the best of a bad situation.
