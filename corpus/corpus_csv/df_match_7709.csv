1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

In this game Dave's king ended up stuck on the a column, it took me a long while to find a way to exploit this situation, but my final move which prompted Dave to wave the white flag sealed his fate.  He was either gonna cop Old Matey or suffer ruinous loss of material.  Anyhow, on with the show and we start the action on Move 9 as the first 9 moves have followed the main line."
