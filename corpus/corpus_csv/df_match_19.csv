1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"In this match Malpas & Oswestry were home to Wrexham in Malpas. We(Malpas & Oswestry) were missing several players, so I had to play on top board, rather than board 4. I had already lost to Bob with black earlier in the season, where he played 1. e4 and an open Sicilian. Instead now he plays The English Opening. The English derives its name from the English (unofficial) world champion, Howard Staunton, who played it during his 1843 match with Saint-Amant and at London 1851, the first international tournament."
