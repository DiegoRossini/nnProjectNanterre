1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,So he starts conventionally
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I play the Sicilian
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"He develops his knight, preparing d2-d4"
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,And I develop mine.
5,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,He pushes
6,cxd4,c5d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,I take
7,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,He takes back
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,I hit his e pawn
9,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,He protects it.
10,d6,d7d6,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"I prevent him from playing Nd4xNc6 followed by e4-e5. This is really the parting of the way next. He can play  6.Bc4, called ""Sozin"" (ECO code B57). It brings the bishop to an aggressive square, or 6.Bg5, the Richterâ€“Rauzer Attack (ECO codes B60 et seq). The move 6.Bg5 was Kurt Richter's invention, threatening to double Black's pawns after Bxf6 and forestalling the Dragon by rendering 6...g6 unplayable. He plays the thrid most popular move at this point."
11,Be2,f1e2,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"Quite playable, but perhaps less agreesive that the previously mentioned moves."
12,e5,e7e5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2np1n2/4p3/3NP3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"This is the Boleslavsky Variation, named after Isaac Boleslavsky. Black gets a foothold in the centre, but has a backward d pawn on a semi-open file. Both sides have chances."
13,Nb3,d4b3,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2np1n2/4p3/4P3/1NN5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,"This is the old move, which used to be considered the ""main line"". Now Nf3 is more common."
14,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2np1n2/4p3/4P3/1NN5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 8,So I develop.
15,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2np1n2/4p3/4P3/1NN5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 3 8,He castles
16,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2np1n2/4p3/4P3/1NN5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 4 9,I castle.
17,Be3,c1e3,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2np1n2/4p3/4P3/1NN1B3/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 5 9,"He develops. Now I have had this position before. See http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/hagley-v-kidderminster?gm=44180
In that game I continued with Be6 and d6-d5. There were exchanges on d5 and then on the d file and the game ended in a draw. So I decided to play something else, which seemed to keep the pieces on more."
18,a5,a7a5,r1bq1rk1/1p2bppp/2np1n2/p3p3/4P3/1NN1B3/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 10,"I threaten to drive his knight away from b3. If it goes to d2 it blocks the d file, allowing d6-d5 without so many exchanges, and if it goes to c1 it stops the co-ordination of rooks along his back rank."
19,a4,a2a4,r1bq1rk1/1p2bppp/2np1n2/p3p3/P3P3/1NN1B3/1PP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 10,So he stops that.
20,Be6,c8e6,r2q1rk1/1p2bppp/2npbn2/p3p3/P3P3/1NN1B3/1PP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 1 11,And now I develop the bishop.
