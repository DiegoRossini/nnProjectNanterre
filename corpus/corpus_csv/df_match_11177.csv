1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I prefer e4 since it develops faster and pieces have more mobility, but d4 is just as playable, even though it's slower and more cramped."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I don't play this opening anymore, because it isn't sharp, and I think Nf6 is a more accurate move."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,A sharper move is d5. But Nf3 is solid and safer.
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,The strongest developing move.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 3,"White usually doesn't obstruct his c-pawn in this variation, but whatever. And he shouldn't take on c5 and try to hold the pawn, because I will eventually get it back with a better position."
6,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/8/3p4/2N2N2/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"I force White to move a knight twice in the opening, because if he recaptures with his queen, then Nc6 gains a tempo."
7,Nxd4,f3d4,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/8/3N4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"After 4...e5 5.Ndb5 d5, White wins a pawn after 6.Nxd5 Nxd5 7.Qxd5 Qxd5 8.Nc7  recovering the queen. So if I wanted to play e5, then I'd have to play d6 after Ndb5 since White's threatening Nd6 , and then e4 would transpose into the Sveshnikov Variation of the Sicilian, an opening I played for three years but now consider to be good for White."
8,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p4/3N4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"After 4...e5 5.Ndb5 d5, White wins a pawn after 6.Nxd5 Nxd5 7.Qxd5 Qxd5 8.Nc7  recovering the queen. So if I wanted to play e5, then I'd have to play d6 after Ndb5 since White's threatening Nd6 , and then e4 would transpose into the Sveshnikov Variation of the Sicilian, an opening I played for three years but now consider to be good for White."
9,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p2B1/3N4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"Isn't much of a threat, since taking my knight will only improve my position."
10,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/3p2B1/3N4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,"I thought about e5, but I played this first because I wanted White to play f4 trying to stop e5, which would leave him with a backward e-pawn."
11,e3,e2e3,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/3p2B1/3N4/2N1P3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,White doesn't want to recapture his knight with his queen if I trade it.
12,e5,e7e5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/3pp1B1/3N4/2N1P3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,Tempo.
13,Bxf6,g5f6,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n2B2/3pp3/3N4/2N1P3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"Not good, because like I said earlier, it will strengthen my position."
14,gxf6,g7f6,r1bqkb1r/pp3p1p/2n2p2/3pp3/3N4/2N1P3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,"Now White has strengthened my centre, given me an open g-file, and an extra open line for my bishop if I need it."
15,Nxc6,d4c6,r1bqkb1r/pp3p1p/2N2p2/3pp3/8/2N1P3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,White is only strengthing my centre more.
16,bxc6,b7c6,r1bqkb1r/p4p1p/2p2p2/3pp3/8/2N1P3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 9,"White stops the unpleasant Bb4, while giving him the option of expanding with b4."
17,a3,a2a3,r1bqkb1r/p4p1p/2p2p2/3pp3/8/P1N1P3/1PP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 9,"White stops the unpleasant Bb4, while giving him the option of expanding with b4."
18,f5,f6f5,r1bqkb1r/p4p1p/2p5/3ppp2/8/P1N1P3/1PP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 10,"I stop White from playing e4, because it disrupts my strong centre. And I also strengthen my centre slightly more."
19,Qh5,d1h5,r1bqkb1r/p4p1p/2p5/3ppp1Q/8/P1N1P3/1PP2PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 1 10,"White places his queen on an advanced square where it cannot be chased away. But other than the pressure on my h-pawn, White's queen isn't a threat."
20,Rb8,a8b8,1rbqkb1r/p4p1p/2p5/3ppp1Q/8/P1N1P3/1PP2PPP/R3KB1R w KQk - 2 11,I place my rook on an open file while attacking White's pawn.
21,b4,b2b4,1rbqkb1r/p4p1p/2p5/3ppp1Q/1P6/P1N1P3/2P2PPP/R3KB1R b KQk - 0 11,"Rb1 is more passive, and Na4 allows Qa5"
22,Qf6,d8f6,1rb1kb1r/p4p1p/2p2q2/3ppp1Q/1P6/P1N1P3/2P2PPP/R3KB1R w KQk - 1 12,"Now there isn't any more pressure on my h-pawn, because if I move my defending rook, then Qxh7 would lose to Rh8."
