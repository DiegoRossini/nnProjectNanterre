3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Far more common is 2. c4 but it can still transpose.
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,So my opponent chose to play the London System. I will admit that I had not prepared for this opening at all. So I just played moves that were natural and followed opening principles.

6,c6,c7c6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/3P1B2/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"!? 3. c5 is considered the main line. This response is slightly more passive, but it is still O.K."
7,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/3P1B2/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"This position is quite unusual. However, both sides seem to have decent chances."
8,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p1b2/3P1B2/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"This position is quite unusual. However, both sides seem to have decent chances."
9,c4,c2c4,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p1b2/2PP1B2/4PN2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"This position is quite unusual. However, both sides seem to have decent chances."
10,e6,e7e6,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p1b2/2PP1B2/4PN2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"This position is quite unusual. However, both sides seem to have decent chances."

13,Qb3,d1b3,rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p1b2/1bPP1B2/1QN1PN2/PP3PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 3 7,I had overlooked this move. The bishop can not move because it is pinned to the b pawn.
14,Qe7,d8e7,rn2k2r/pp2qppp/2p1pn2/3p1b2/1bPP1B2/1QN1PN2/PP3PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 4 8,? Best probably would have been to exchange immediately. Now I must be very careful with my next few moves.
15,c5,c4c5,rn2k2r/pp2qppp/2p1pn2/2Pp1b2/1b1P1B2/1QN1PN2/PP3PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 8,! Cutting off the bishop from the queen's protection. This move also opens up the threat of Bd6 which would prevent me from castling and making my position cramped.

17,bxc3,b2c3,rn2k2r/pp2qppp/2p1pn2/2Pp1b2/3P1B2/1QP1PN2/P4PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 9,This is practically force to keep the bishop off of d6.

19,Bd6,f4d6,rn2k2r/pp2qppp/2pBp3/2Pp1b2/3Pn3/1QP1PN2/P4PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 2 10,"!? Interesting. White will seize a strong initiative, but I can create a counter attack quite easily. White will have a difficult time defending that d pawn. However, it certainly can cause some problems in the future..."
20,Nxd6,e4d6,rn2k2r/pp2qppp/2pnp3/2Pp1b2/3P4/1QP1PN2/P4PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 11,"White gains another tempo, but now I will start to really pressure white."

24,Qc8,d7c8,rnq1k2r/pp3ppp/2pPp3/3pNb2/3P4/1QP1P3/P4PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 3 13,I think 13. c4 might have been a slightly better alternative.

31,dxe5,d4e5,r1q2rk1/pp3ppp/2pPp3/3pPb2/2P5/1Q2P3/P3BPPP/R4RK1 b - - 0 16,"My plan was quite simple at this point. Open the f file, get my queen to g6 to attack white's king, and try to isolate the d6 pawn."

36,Qe8,c8e8,1r2qrk1/pp4pp/2pPpp2/3pPb2/2P2P2/1Q2P3/P3B1PP/2R2RK1 w - - 3 19,?! I don't really know what the purpose of this move is. Perhaps cxd5 or maybe even Qd1!? was worth considering.
