1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This is really odd.  I like playing the caro kann because it is really solid and actually affords black a lot of aggressive attacking positions (contrary to popular belief).  Normally when I see some try to play anything but the actual main lines I generally assume they aren't very prepared to face the CK!

4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4P3/6P1/PPPP1P1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,All too happy to exchange the pawn and get my knight out with tempo.

7,Bxe4,g2e4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/4B3/6P1/PPPP1P1P/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 4,I like this better than Bf4.  I am trying to lure Nf3 as whites knight on f3 is almost always better than my LSB in a lot of Caro Kann positions.
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/8/4B3/6P1/PPPP1P1P/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 5,I like this better than Bf4.  I am trying to lure Nf3 as whites knight on f3 is almost always better than my LSB in a lot of Caro Kann positions.
9,Bg2,e4g2,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/8/8/6P1/PPPP1PBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 5,I like this better than Bf4.  I am trying to lure Nf3 as whites knight on f3 is almost always better than my LSB in a lot of Caro Kann positions.
10,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/8/6b1/6P1/PPPP1PBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 3 6,I like this better than Bf4.  I am trying to lure Nf3 as whites knight on f3 is almost always better than my LSB in a lot of Caro Kann positions.
11,f3,f2f3,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/8/6b1/5PP1/PPPP2BP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 6,This is a bad move.  It unnecessarily opens up white's king side.
12,Bh5,g4h5,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/7b/8/5PP1/PPPP2BP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 7,I think Nh3 might have been better.  Either way the pawn on f3 is not promising for white.
13,Ne2,g1e2,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/7b/8/5PP1/PPPPN1BP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 7,I think Nh3 might have been better.  Either way the pawn on f3 is not promising for white.
14,e6,e7e6,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/7b/8/5PP1/PPPPN1BP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,I am taking time with development as white's handling of the opening is completely passive and non-threatening.
15,O-O,e1g1,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/7b/8/5PP1/PPPPN1BP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 8,I am taking time with development as white's handling of the opening is completely passive and non-threatening.
16,Bg6,h5g6,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pnb1/8/8/5PP1/PPPPN1BP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 9,I am taking time with development as white's handling of the opening is completely passive and non-threatening.
17,Kh1,g1h1,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pnb1/8/8/5PP1/PPPPN1BP/RNBQ1R1K b kq - 3 9,Probably because he didn't want to see any checks on the g1-a7 diagonal.
18,h6,h7h6,rn1qkb1r/pp3pp1/2p1pnbp/8/8/5PP1/PPPPN1BP/RNBQ1R1K w kq - 0 10,To prevent any uncomfortable Nf4 or pawn bum rushes on my LSB.
19,Nbc3,b1c3,rn1qkb1r/pp3pp1/2p1pnbp/8/8/2N2PP1/PPPPN1BP/R1BQ1R1K b kq - 1 10,I really don't like this move.  I'm sure it's ok but white is basically showing that he doesn't care about establishing a pawn center in the middle of the board.
20,Bd6,f8d6,rn1qk2r/pp3pp1/2pbpnbp/8/8/2N2PP1/PPPPN1BP/R1BQ1R1K w kq - 2 11,Planning to put a knight on e4.

23,Nf4,e2f4,r2qk2r/pp1n1pp1/2pbpnbp/8/5N2/2NP1PP1/PPP3BP/R1BQ1R1K b kq - 2 12,Development completed.  Let's start the party!
24,Bh7,g6h7,r2qk2r/pp1n1ppb/2pbpn1p/8/5N2/2NP1PP1/PPP3BP/R1BQ1R1K w kq - 3 13,Development completed.  Let's start the party!

27,Bh3,g2h3,r2q1rk1/pp1n1ppb/2pbpn1p/8/5N2/2NPBPPB/PPP4P/R2Q1R1K b - - 6 14,Not really sure what the point of this is.  I think since white can't initiate a pawn break at all he is looking for play with his pieces.  Though there really is nothing for him to attack yet.
28,Re8,f8e8,r2qr1k1/pp1n1ppb/2pbpn1p/8/5N2/2NPBPPB/PPP4P/R2Q1R1K w - - 7 15,Preparing e5.
29,Qc1,d1c1,r2qr1k1/pp1n1ppb/2pbpn1p/8/5N2/2NPBPPB/PPP4P/R1Q2R1K b - - 8 15,"Again, no idea what white is doing."
30,Qc7,d8c7,r3r1k1/ppqn1ppb/2pbpn1p/8/5N2/2NPBPPB/PPP4P/R1Q2R1K w - - 9 16,This looks like a solid move.  That square should be occupied by a knight.
31,Ne4,c3e4,r3r1k1/ppqn1ppb/2pbpn1p/8/4NN2/3PBPPB/PPP4P/R1Q2R1K b - - 10 16,This looks like a solid move.  That square should be occupied by a knight.

36,Nd5,f6d5,r3r1k1/pp1n1ppb/2pq3p/3np3/8/3PBPPB/PPP1N2P/R1Q2R1K w - - 2 19,I like this move.  I am preparing f7-f5.  White can't challenge my knight with c4 as the d3 pawn would become extremely weak.
