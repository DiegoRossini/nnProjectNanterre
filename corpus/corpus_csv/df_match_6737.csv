1,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/2N5/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 1,Dunst Opening. An unusual opening move that develops a knight and pressures the central light squares. The reasons for its unpopularity are that it does not prevent Black from occupying the center (unlike 1.Nf3) and that it blocks White's c pawn from advancing.
