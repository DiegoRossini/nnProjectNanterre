1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I always favour 1.e4 as my opening, because I have little experience in 1.d4."
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"1.e6 is common enough so that I know the main line for this, the French."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Following the main line of the French.
4,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,This move hit me like a bullet. I have never seen this move in play before. What I see way more often is 2...d5.
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"Although the d pawn was already protected, I protected it again with a knight while developing."
6,Qa5+,d8a5,rnb1kbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/q1p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,"The queen comes out with check, so I have to get out of it."
7,Bd2,c1d2,rnb1kbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/q1p5/3PP3/5N2/PPPB1PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 3 4,"I block the check with the bishop, which attacks the offending queen."
8,Qb6,a5b6,rnb1kbnr/pp1p1ppp/1q2p3/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPPB1PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 4 5,The queen moves back and attacks the b pawn
9,Be3,d2e3,rnb1kbnr/pp1p1ppp/1q2p3/2p5/3PP3/4BN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 5 5,"A mistake. Correct is Bc3, defending the b pawn."
10,Qxb2,b6b2,rnb1kbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/3PP3/4BN2/PqP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Black snaps at this opportunity to take my b pawn which I had missed. With this move, black attacks my rook in the corner."
11,Nbd2,b1d2,rnb1kbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/3PP3/4BN2/PqPN1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,This was the only real way to get out of trouble because moving the knight to c3 would lose the knight...with check!
12,Qc3,b2c3,rnb1kbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/3PP3/2q1BN2/P1PN1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 7,Black plays a move that keeps pressure on me to keep everything defended.
13,Bc4,f1c4,rnb1kbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/2BPP3/2q1BN2/P1PN1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 3 7,"I am continuing development while black falls behind. I have developed all my minor pieces and ready to castle, while black only has his queen out."
14,Qa5,c3a5,rnb1kbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/q1p5/2BPP3/4BN2/P1PN1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 4 8,Another queen move. Black should have been developing a longtime ago.
15,O-O,e1g1,rnb1kbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/q1p5/2BPP3/4BN2/P1PN1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 5 8,"I castle kingside and feel safe because the black queen will need time to get to my king, time that black needs to use developing his pieces."
16,g6,g7g6,rnb1kbnr/pp1p1p1p/4p1p1/q1p5/2BPP3/4BN2/P1PN1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 9,This move prepares to fianchetto black's bishop which is currently being traped by the c5 pawn.
17,Rb1,a1b1,rnb1kbnr/pp1p1p1p/4p1p1/q1p5/2BPP3/4BN2/P1PN1PPP/1R1Q1RK1 b kq - 1 9,One of the advantages I get with black taking my b2 pawn is I get the half open b file whereas black doesn't have any files to work with his rooks.

20,f6,f7f6,rnb1kbnr/pp1p3p/4ppp1/q7/2BBP3/5N2/P1PN1PPP/1R1Q1RK1 w kq - 0 11,The expected move. The pawn is protected by the knight on g8.
