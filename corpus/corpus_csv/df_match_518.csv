9,e4,e2e4,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PPB2/5N2/PPPN1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,Strong center?
10,c6,c7c6,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/2pp1np1/8/3PPB2/5N2/PPPN1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"c4 doesn't give me much more. My aim is the white diagonal pointing to f7, of course."

One of the strongest weapons black has is Na5 once Q and B are aligned. With this move black deprives himself from it, and e6 from a defender."
13,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqk2r/pp1nppbp/2pp1np1/8/2BPPB2/2P2N2/PP1N1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 2 7,"Provoking b5, Bb3. Of course I can't hope to get Q, B and N(g5) without resistance, so I wanted to face the problem at once."

19,a4,a2a4,r1bq1rk1/3nppbp/2pp1np1/pp4N1/P2PPB2/1BP5/1P1N1PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 10,"...ok, another tempo for my attack. I can ignore bxc3, bxc3."

Ba6+ is not dangerous, but white can counter it easily. Black has also bxc3, bxc, and Bxc3, threatening the R and pinning my Nd2. White, on its part, has: exf7+, Kh8, Ne6, which forces Qb6, so white can play Be3, and after any defence, NxR ensures an exchange and the pawn in f7 is still alive. White also has Nxf7, Qg6, Be3, Qmoves, exNd7... black has to choose among attack and defence. Of course, NxBf4 comes to mind, but after Qf3, black has to consider Qxc6, threatening Ra8... what would you do? Attack? Defend? How?"
26,Nc5,d7c5,r1bq1rk1/4ppbp/2p1P1p1/p1n3Nn/Pp3B2/1BP5/1P1N1PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 1 14,"Black chooses to add another motiv to the position: NxBb3, or Nd3+. At the same time, covers e6 so I can't use it anymore. Very clever move."
