1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Back in my teenage/early 20's years I always played 1. e4. (Except when I was goofing around I would play 1. g4). Then I went through a long period in my life when I didn't play at all. A few years ago I started playing computer chess and found that my style has pretty much changed. So I'm bouncing back between 1. d4, 1. b3, and 1. c4. So far my best success has been with 1. b3 actually."
