1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Englund Gambit.  I have not played against this before.  According to Wikipedia, the idea is for Black to move into a tactical game and away from the closed d4 openings.  I thought the game definitely had more of an e4 character, so I think it succeeded at that."
