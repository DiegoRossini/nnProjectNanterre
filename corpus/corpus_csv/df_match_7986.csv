10,Bb4+,f8b4,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/8/1bB1P3/8/PB3PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 1 6,I find this gambit so rare in my games I don't know the next move of the main line here. I still knew I'd be better off trading pieces to neutralize the attack.
11,Nd2,b1d2,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/8/1bB1P3/8/PB1N1PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 2 6,"I was considering Bxd2+ and trade off, but his bishops were my main problem."
12,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/8/1bB1P3/8/PB1N1PPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 3 7,"I was considering Bxd2+ and trade off, but his bishops were my main problem."
13,a3,a2a3,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/8/1bB1P3/P7/1B1N1PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 0 7,"I was considering Bxd2+ and trade off, but his bishops were my main problem."

15,Ngf3,g1f3,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/b7/2B1P3/P4N2/1B1N1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 2 8,"I felt like I could snatch a pawn. After Bxg2, I probably could play Rg8, trade off some pieces, and take on g2 and devastate the king side, the side he would be attacking on."
16,Nxe4,f6e4,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/8/b7/2B1n3/P4N2/1B1N1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 9,"I felt like I could snatch a pawn. After Bxg2, I probably could play Rg8, trade off some pieces, and take on g2 and devastate the king side, the side he would be attacking on."
17,O-O,e1g1,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/8/b7/2B1n3/P4N2/1B1N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 1 9,I don't see another sensible move. Ne4 serves no purpose.
18,Nxd2,e4d2,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/8/b7/2B5/P4N2/1B1n1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 10,I don't see another sensible move. Ne4 serves no purpose.
19,Re1+,f1e1,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/8/b7/2B5/P4N2/1B1n1PPP/R2QR1K1 b kq - 1 10,I don't see another sensible move. Ne4 serves no purpose.
20,Kf8,e8f8,rnbq1k1r/pppp1ppp/8/b7/2B5/P4N2/1B1n1PPP/R2QR1K1 w - - 2 11,I don't see another sensible move. Ne4 serves no purpose.
21,Nxd2,f3d2,rnbq1k1r/pppp1ppp/8/b7/2B5/P7/1B1N1PPP/R2QR1K1 b - - 0 11,Chasing the bishop off.
22,d5,d7d5,rnbq1k1r/ppp2ppp/8/b2p4/2B5/P7/1B1N1PPP/R2QR1K1 w - - 0 12,Chasing the bishop off.
23,Qa4,d1a4,rnbq1k1r/ppp2ppp/8/b2p4/Q1B5/P7/1B1N1PPP/R3R1K1 b - - 1 12,"This hangs a knight on d2, but will later get me in a difficult position."
24,Bxd2,a5d2,rnbq1k1r/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/Q1B5/P7/1B1b1PPP/R3R1K1 w - - 0 13,Taking the rook did not seem bad.
25,Bxd5,c4d5,rnbq1k1r/ppp2ppp/8/3B4/Q7/P7/1B1b1PPP/R3R1K1 b - - 0 13,Taking the rook did not seem bad.
26,Bxe1,d2e1,rnbq1k1r/ppp2ppp/8/3B4/Q7/P7/1B3PPP/R3b1K1 w - - 0 14,Taking the rook did not seem bad.
27,Rxe1,a1e1,rnbq1k1r/ppp2ppp/8/3B4/Q7/P7/1B3PPP/4R1K1 b - - 0 14,"Right now, black has the advantage, but I could lose instantly if I play incorrectly here. After Qxd5, I get checkmated on e1. That was the main problem; unable to get my queen out. Other major problems would include the bishops attacking my king cover, the rook dominating my king's file, and constant threats from the queen from any side. You can find the variations yourself. Also try to find the two best moves here."
28,Nc6,b8c6,r1bq1k1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/3B4/Q7/P7/1B3PPP/4R1K1 w - - 1 15,The second best move. I lose a pawn. Perhaps Na6 was the best move.

The lessons here are to trade off when your winning, find any way to get out of a bad position with as good as a result you can, but plan out how many moves it will take.
