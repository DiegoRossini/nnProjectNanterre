Not sure that was necessary. Perhaps black was afraid of losing a tempo somewhere if I were to take instead. One thing I like about the white position is the other black knight is not doing so much right now.

However, black decided he didn't want that rook yet, although I think he could have grabbed it and had enough time to defend. Someday I'll learn to use computer programs to analyze these positions and learn from them, rather than simply playing them and not studying them. So, before thinking of grabbing the rook, black made a quality move that totally gave me pause:"

So, without calculating... well, heck; I did not calculate ANY  moves this game until the end, and even then needed help for it to work; so, I played simply for opportunities to control squares and create weaknesses. But this opponent was no slouch, and inevitably began about now to do that to me!"
