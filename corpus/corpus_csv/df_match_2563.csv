1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

You would never believe that a queen could find herself without a move in a queen and pawn ending, would you?  Well, it happens here.  I will now start this game with the Scandinavian Defense.  I ended up in a similar position against damalfi and went on to lose but here it was a different story.  The Scandinavian (Centre Counter) is the move 1..... d5 in response to e4.  Black brings his/her queen out into the open before any other pieces are developed, but it can be possible to find a safe haven for her on a5.  Anyhow ....."

Firstly I will exchange the remaining pair of rooks.  I will leave Glenda exactly where she is and then use Henry as a fighting piece.
