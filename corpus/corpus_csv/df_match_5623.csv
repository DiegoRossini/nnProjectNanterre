2,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,The Pirc Defence [thanks to nosferatu for the correction]
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"I was expecting Black to play e5, but this is perfectly playable as well!"
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p1n2/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"I was expecting Black to play e5, but this is perfectly playable as well!"
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p1n2/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 3,A follow-up to the knight move - it attacks the queen - but this threat is easily countered!
6,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p1n2/8/3PP1b1/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 3 4,A follow-up to the knight move - it attacks the queen - but this threat is easily countered!
7,Nf3,g1f3,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p1n2/8/3PP1b1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 4 4,"4.f3 would have driven back the bishop, but I wanted that square for the knight... in hindsight though, f3 would have probably been better as it supports the centre and the knight can reach e2 [after the bishop moves]"
8,Nbd7,b8d7,r2qkb1r/pppnpppp/3p1n2/8/3PP1b1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 5 5,"Black may have been worried about d5 after Nc6... well, I would be but whether it would be the best move, I don't know. At any rate, according to GK analysis White has come out of the opening with the advantage. [of less than a pawn, but an advantage all the same!]"
9,Be2,f1e2,r2qkb1r/pppnpppp/3p1n2/8/3PP1b1/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 6 5,this and Bc4 are both playable - White decides to break the pin on the knight.
10,e5,e7e5,r2qkb1r/pppn1ppp/3p1n2/4p3/3PP1b1/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"5...e5 comes now, and White has the option of locking up the centre with 6.d5. Black's reply..."
11,O-O,e1g1,r2qkb1r/pppn1ppp/3p1n2/4p3/3PP1b1/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 6,...would have probably been the same as his reply to White's castling.
12,c6,c7c6,r2qkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2pp1n2/4p3/3PP1b1/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,Perhaps the intention of 4...Nbd7; this will challenge White's d5 should he decided to play it.
13,Bg5,c1g5,r2qkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2pp1n2/4p1B1/3PP1b1/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 1 7,White doesn't play it yet and continues development
14,Be7,f8e7,r2qk2r/pp1nbppp/2pp1n2/4p1B1/3PP1b1/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 2 8,"As the development of White comes to an end [Black has yet to castle and connect rooks, but his position seems solid enough at this point], Black has ambitions of queenside pawn expansion..."
15,Qd2,d1d2,r2qk2r/pp1nbppp/2pp1n2/4p1B1/3PP1b1/2N2N2/PPPQBPPP/R4RK1 b kq - 3 8,"As the development of White comes to an end [Black has yet to castle and connect rooks, but his position seems solid enough at this point], Black has ambitions of queenside pawn expansion..."

If Black plays 9...b4! here then he'll have the opportunity to win a pawn next move with Nxd5; 9...d5 10.Nd1 Nxd5 11.exd5 Bxf3 12.Bxf3 Bxg5. Fortunately for me, Black misses this too and exchanges pawns"
18,cxd5,c6d5,r2qk2r/p2nbppp/3p1n2/1p1pp1B1/4P1b1/2N2N2/PPPQBPPP/R4RK1 w kq - 0 10,Pushing back my knight...

22,a5,a7a5,r2qk2r/3nbppp/3p1n2/p2Pp1B1/1p4b1/5N2/PPPQBPPP/R2N1RK1 w kq - 0 12,Bolstering the b4 pawn...
23,Ne3,d1e3,r2qk2r/3nbppp/3p1n2/p2Pp1B1/1p4b1/4NN2/PPPQBPPP/R4RK1 b kq - 1 12,While I re-connect my rooks and activate my knight again
24,Rb8,a8b8,1r1qk2r/3nbppp/3p1n2/p2Pp1B1/1p4b1/4NN2/PPPQBPPP/R4RK1 w k - 2 13,"? Puts the rook and queen in danger of being forked. It doesn't seem that White can take advantage of that right now, but the tricks up chess players' sleeves are infinite; 13.Bxf6 Nxf6 14.Nxe5! wins a pawn since if 14...dxe5, then simply 15.Bxg4, and if Black takes the bishop on e2 White has the zwischenzug Nc6. Though I do see a way to nab a pawn here, it doesn't appeal to the GK analysis as much... though it is more flashy! :P"

29,Nd4,f3d4,1r2k2r/3nqppp/3p4/p2Pp3/1p1N2n1/8/PPPQBPPP/R4RK1 b k - 1 15,"! The line I missed back at move 13 has the same 'discovered attack' motif. My idea was that should Black choose to exchange (which he does) it will be pretty hard to hold on to the d4 pawn. However, Black can complicate; 15...Nxh2!? 16.Rfe1 and there are quite a few ways that Black can proceed here, but I'll just show why 16...exd4 doesn't work; 16...exf4 17.Bb5! [pinning the knight, preventing Ne5] Rxb5 18.Rxe7+ Kxe7 19.Qg5+ Ke8 20.Qxg7 Rf8 21.Kxh2 with advantage to White. If the sac is declined, then the line that Gameknot found plays out [analysis at beginning of this annotation] but sometimes, that analysis confuses me :)"
