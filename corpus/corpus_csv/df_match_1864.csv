1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

I have been trying to find a game to annotate which involved yours truly and a fellow Bigpeta Club member.  I think it may be best to fish out one of my games with Coach Ion which I did not get round to annotate.  Sadly it was not one of my best efforts against The Coach and indeed I was absolutely steamrollered!  However, it does have some interest value because the guy who ran this mini-tournament was Freddy the Master Mater.  Freddy just lurves to play unusual openings and this is one of his experiments.  Anyhow, this is the Traxler (Wilkes-Barre Opening) arising out of the Two Knights Defense."
