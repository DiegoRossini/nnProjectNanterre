4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Declined. This seems counter-intuitive, blocking in my light-square bishop, but it's solid (there was another game where I played Bf5, intending to play e6 next move. I paid heavily for it - the annotation of that particular game will come soon)  I would also consider Nf6 some time"
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"White prepares a kingside fianchetto, but according to GK analysis (which had labelled all moves as 'book' so far) , this is an inaccuracy that gives Black a .53 advantage. GK gives 4.Nc3 Nf6 as equal in the position."
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,"White prepares a kingside fianchetto, but according to GK analysis (which had labelled all moves as 'book' so far) , this is an inaccuracy that gives Black a .53 advantage. GK gives 4.Nc3 Nf6 as equal in the position."

8,Bd7,c8d7,r2qkbnr/pppb1ppp/2n1p3/3p4/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,making room for queenside castling (though I never do so in the game)
9,Bg2,f1g2,r2qkbnr/pppb1ppp/2n1p3/3p4/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 5,logical
10,Nf6,g8f6,r2qkb1r/pppb1ppp/2n1pn2/3p4/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 3 6,"there is nothing wrong with this move, but if I were to reach this position again, I would like to try something different; Qe7, 0-0-0. g6, Bg7 and Nf6, if I get the chance. The resulting game for Black would be less cramped than the position he finds himself in soon."
11,O-O,e1g1,r2qkb1r/pppb1ppp/2n1pn2/3p4/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 4 6,"? I played this move a little too quickly, and was immediately dissatisfied with it. It seemed good at the time, the bishop acting a little like a sniper zooming in on White's position, but it gets driven back too easily. The GK analyser gives dxc4 as preferable (and it does make sense now, since the bishop can't recapture anymore)"

Here, Black can keep the diagonal with; 7...Ba5 8.b4 Nxb4 [8...Bb5 9.c5] 9.axb4 Bxb4, but I didn't like the look of that position"
14,Be7,b4e7,r2qk2r/pppbbppp/2n1pn2/3p4/2PP4/P4NP1/1P2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 8,"This is where I began to feel cramped. I would prefer to be White in this position, but the GK analyser gives this position as equal (well, .08 advantage to White, but that doesn't really make any difference)"

17,e4,e2e4,r2qk2r/pppbbppp/2n1pn2/8/2pPP3/P1N2NP1/1P3PBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 9,"! White gains the classical centre... but apparently, it is now a .45 advantage to Black. How strange...."

The plan was a kingside pawn storm, but that is hazardous for my king, for sure! 0-0 would be better [and in fact, it would have saved me a LOT of heartache! You'll see what I mean :)]"
19,Qe2,d1e2,r2qk2r/pppbbpp1/2n1pn1p/8/2pPP3/P1N2NP1/1P2QPBP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 1 10,"targeting Black's c4 pawn. However, when White played this move, it gave me notice of an interesting feature in White's position..."

True, it does invoke weaknesses in Black's queenside position, but right now Black plans to castle kingside... I was wondering whether White would try 13.Nxc4 bxc4 14.Qxc4, but it turns out...."

From here, I saw the line up to move 17, where I thought that I had a refutation idea to White's idea... [you know, I;ll take the opportunity now to tell you all something that I really hate about GK's analysing system - you play a move like this, it looks pretty, it works wonderfully... then along comes GK analysis, saying that it was an 'inaccuracy/mistake!' Here, GK gives 'inaccuracy,' although it ends up being 0.48 in Black's favour - still anyone's game!]"
