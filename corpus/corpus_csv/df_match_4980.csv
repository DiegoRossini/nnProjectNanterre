16,Bb7,c8b7,r2qkb1r/pb3ppp/2p2n2/nB2p1N1/8/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 2 9,This move seems weird to me because it blocks the d3 pawn but I don't really have anywhere else to put it and it exercises important control over e4.
17,Bd3,b5d3,r2qkb1r/pb3ppp/2p2n2/n3p1N1/8/3B1Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 3 9,This move seems weird to me because it blocks the d3 pawn but I don't really have anywhere else to put it and it exercises important control over e4.

23,Qxf6,f3f6,r3kb1r/pb3pp1/5Q1p/n1p1p3/8/3B4/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 12,To elminate Bxg2.  I was considering Bb5+ instead of 0-0.  If anyone has any input that would be great.

28,Ke7,e8e7,r4br1/pb2kp2/5p1p/nBp1p3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB2RK1 w - - 4 15,No castling for black.
29,f3,f2f3,r4br1/pb2kp2/5p1p/nBp1p3/8/5P2/PPPP2PP/RNB2RK1 b - - 0 15,f3 appeals more then g3 here.  Again feedback would be great.  I simply didn't want that pesky bishop to see into my castle.
30,Nc6,a5c6,r4br1/pb2kp2/2n2p1p/1Bp1p3/8/5P2/PPPP2PP/RNB2RK1 w - - 1 16,I did not want to deal with the knight on D4.  So this exchange seems good.

32,Bxc6,b7c6,r4br1/p3kp2/2b2p1p/2p1p3/8/5P2/PPPP2PP/RNB2RK1 w - - 0 17,Helps to hold onto e4 and frees up my darksquare bishop (which proves to be the decisive piece).
33,d3,d2d3,r4br1/p3kp2/2b2p1p/2p1p3/8/3P1P2/PPP3PP/RNB2RK1 b - - 0 17,Helps to hold onto e4 and frees up my darksquare bishop (which proves to be the decisive piece).
34,Rb8,a8b8,1r3br1/p3kp2/2b2p1p/2p1p3/8/3P1P2/PPP3PP/RNB2RK1 w - - 1 18,I wish to place the knight on the outpost e4.

36,f5,f6f5,1r3br1/p3kp2/2b4p/2p1pp2/8/2NP1P2/PPP3PP/R1B2RK1 w - - 0 19,This is not favorable for my opponent.

38,Ke6,e7e6,1r3br1/p4p2/2b1k2p/2p1pp2/8/2NP1P2/PPP3PP/1RB2RK1 w - - 2 20,Centralizing his king and freeing up his dark square bishop.
39,Re1,f1e1,1r3br1/p4p2/2b1k2p/2p1pp2/8/2NP1P2/PPP3PP/1RB1R1K1 b - - 3 20,"Seemed good to me until about 5 seconds after I made this move.  I have opened myself to one of those more advanced (at least to new players like myself it seems ""advanced"")tactical situations.  Now my f3 pawn is undefended.  Bxf3 would be terrible for me.  Fortunately my opponent didn't notice this weakness and continued on with development."
40,Bd6,f8d6,1r4r1/p4p2/2bbk2p/2p1pp2/8/2NP1P2/PPP3PP/1RB1R1K1 w - - 4 21,To be honest I made this move so I could eventually double the rooks here.  This is a bad move though because it does nothing to prevent Bxf3.  (Which my opponent didn't see).
41,Re2,e1e2,1r4r1/p4p2/2bbk2p/2p1pp2/8/2NP1P2/PPP1R1PP/1RB3K1 b - - 5 21,To be honest I made this move so I could eventually double the rooks here.  This is a bad move though because it does nothing to prevent Bxf3.  (Which my opponent didn't see).
