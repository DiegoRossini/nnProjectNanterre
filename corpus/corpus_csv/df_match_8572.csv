Back then, I was rated 1504 (I had completed only 26 games on GameKnot at that time) and my opponent was rated 1490. Our first game ended on 2/24/09 and is annotated, titled Aggressive Plans on that date. It's a short little gem that ends on move 26 after white walks black's king over to whites side of the board for a checkmate. White begins this game with the queen's pawn, and I reply Indian."
