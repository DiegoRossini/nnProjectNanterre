1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I have been asked to annotate this game, which is quite interesting. I play a sacrifice, which may not be the best move in the position, but it throws my opponent off track. He doesn't find the best defence and loses quickly, in just 17 moves."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,So my trusted Sicilian Defence
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,The usual reply
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,and the same from me.
5,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,"3. d4 is more common, but this is often played by players of Michael's standard"
6,e6,e7e6,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,So I blunt the scope of his Bc4
7,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,He continues to develop
8,a6,a7a6,r1bqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p1n1p3/2p5/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"I threaten to drive the Bc4 back. This is actually given as a mistake by the post-match computer, but it is the most common move."
9,a4,a2a4,r1bqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p1n1p3/2p5/P1B1P3/2N2N2/1PPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,He wisely prevents this.
10,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/1p1p1ppp/p1n1pn2/2p5/P1B1P3/2N2N2/1PPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 6,So I continue to develop
11,Bd3,c4d3,r1bqkb1r/1p1p1ppp/p1n1pn2/2p5/P3P3/2NB1N2/1PPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 6,"This is a mistake. You shouldn't move pieces twice in the opening without a good reason. It is not given as a mistkae by the post-match computer, although its assessment of the position changes from slight advantage for white to slight advantage to black."
12,d5,d7d5,r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1n1pn2/2pp4/P3P3/2NB1N2/1PPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,So I advance in the centre.
