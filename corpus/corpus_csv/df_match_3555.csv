1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"A Walking the Walk club - Big Peta Students club hybrid game.  Pete wanted to try an opening beginning 1. c4 e5, 2. Nc3 Nf6.  Unfortunately, a mistake by black at move 14 made the experiment less useful than it could have been.  Then a bad idea at 16 landed black in a position with severely restricted mobility and no solution being found."

I had a vague idea that lateral mobility for the rook could be used to some positive end.  but that rook NEVER leaves that square and this contributes to an oddly immobile game for black.  In keeping with this theme of the game being ""locked up,"" I'll point out that the black pawns on e5 and d5 do not move from move 14 to move 30, a not awful aspect of a fairly awful game.  I say not awful (those pawns put some limits on white), but Pete will have no trouble working in the limited real estate along c and b."
