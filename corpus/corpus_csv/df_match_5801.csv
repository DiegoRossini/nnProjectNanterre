If my pawns are weakened I will be prone to sniper attacks from both long diagonals. Furthermore, the Rooks are connected. Black's strategic ideas are made clear. He wants to continue advancing Queenside, possibly trade Rooks grabbing the a-file and either pin or skewer the c3-Knight or force it off the edge of the board using the dark-squared Bishop. On the other hand, I want to remove the active dark-squared Bishop, hold the center and forge through the middle as Black's flank attacks run out of fuel. I usually have good results with ascending pawn chain formations so I think I can last a while here."
