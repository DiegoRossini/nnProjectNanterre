19,Bf4,c1f4,r2q1rk1/pppbbppp/2n1pn2/8/4NB2/3P1NP1/PPP2PBP/R2QR1K1 b - - 2 10,Development move to bring out the bishop to play but not good due to 10..Nd5 is best response here for black to kick bishop to 11.Bd2 and now Black Knight has more aggressive position now on d5 square.

If we go 14..Bxg2, 15.Nxf6,Bxf6 16.Bxf6 and now black loses a whole piece and white threatens mate he can delay it one move with 16..g6 but then 17.Qh6 wins next move with Qg7.  Next move to look at is 14..Qg4 15.Nxf6,Bxf6 16.Bxf6,Qxg5 17.Bxg5,Bxg2 18.Kxg2,Rfe8 White is up Bishop and pawn in the position not as tactical as a little while ago but the endgame is very simple you want to move bishop to d2 exchange a rook then rook e1 if you then exchange the other pair of rooks if he denies capture then Re7 is coming and white will have a overwhelming position but he captures then its 6 pawns vs 7 pawns and Bishop I don't mind playing that any day of the week. On to the next move 14..Kh8 this move make sense to get out of the pin of his pieces 15.Bxf6 (if Nxf6 then black has a annoying pin to my queen),Bxf6 16.Nxf6,Bxg2 is also a option here then 17.Kxg2 the position gives white a very strong because of powerful knight full control E E E-file with Re7 and Rae1 soon to follow(if black captures knight on f6 it leads to overwhelming attack after moves Qf6 check then Re5 is coming)(h6 is also possible here but it helps white get out of the pin) now 14..h6  15.Qh4,Nxe4! 16.Qxh3(16.Qxe4,Bxg2 17.Kxg2,Rfe8 possible line but gives black more chances to hold the position),Qxh3 17.Bxh3,Ng5 18.Bg2,c6 leading to a position where white is only up by one pawn rather than a whole piece."
