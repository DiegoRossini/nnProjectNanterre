Sure, this is a fairly rare opening, but even so, this fairly natural looking move must have been tried before, somewhere? If it's not in book, maybe white just stepped into a well-known trap?

Note that white's vulnerability on the e-file and his vulnerability on the d5-h8 diagonal are both by-products of his first move. Sure, these vulnerabilities were exposed by later play, but it seems to me that a stronger opening choice such as 1. d4 or 1. e4 would have ruled out these two vulnerabilities right from the start."
