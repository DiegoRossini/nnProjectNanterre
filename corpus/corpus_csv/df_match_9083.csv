The player's ratings ranged from 1899 - 2430 (the 1899 player was at one time an Expert).  This is the game against the 2400  player, an International Master, and the result, well you might have guessed, another loss!  Well, you could say this is all good experience!  Read on ...."

To prepare Bxb2. If an immediate Bxb2 then Rxc2 . 

beefyness then said ""ok but pointless as Rc2 kills the attack, better was Rd3 attacking e3 & b3 19..Rd3 20 f4. Bd6 21 Rd5. Rxe3. Not 21 Kf2(protecting the bishop). Rxb3 22 Rc1-c2. Rb3xb2 22 Rc5xc7  Be5xc7 23 Rc2xb2 Rh8-d8 and you wrestle control of the centre column. It was my feeling at that this was the point you went on the defensive 
19...Rd3 20.f4 Bd6 21. Rc5-c3 Re3 22. Rxe3 Bxf4 is also good for black
- so maybe the 3 other experts didn't make such a bad error, it was probably 19. Rd7? that did the damage!"

Bxb2 - I have the satisfaction of removing white's b pawn but it is too late, next move white plays his bishop to f6 screening out Frere Lenoir from h8.  White's bishop is backed up by his king.  There is no way I can stop white from crowning one of his passers so I waved the white flag.   Thankfully the loss was just 0.3 points.   I just hope I can put up a better show against him in my return challenge as white.  Cheers everyone!  Joanne"
