1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This was an online fast game I played a couple days ago. I have the Black pieces
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"I don't like playing sicilian in short games because I tend to think a lot. Short timed games probably aren't good for my chess.
Alekhine defense entices White's pawns to move forward so they will become attackable."
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 2,White decides not to overextend his position more and develop a piece instead
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"I can open up the centre for easy equality.
Could someone give their opinion on if they think this position is equal? Now looking I think maybe I was slightly better, but surely this is still book."
5,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"If 3.e5, then 3...Nfd7 is fine for me because 4.d4 c5! turns into a French-type position but where I haven't played the blocking e6 move. If 5.dxc5 then I can go into French with 5...e6 since I will win back a pawn and exchanging a central pawn for flank one usually isn't good."
6,Nxd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3n4/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Baker likes to play Bg4 here but I don't study his crazy gambit openings
7,Nge2,g1e2,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3n4/8/2N5/PPPPNPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,A passive move by White. Taking the knight was probably his best option. Or Ne4 is interesting
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n5/3n4/8/2N5/PPPPNPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,"Since White blocked his diagonal, I need not fear Bb5, and also if Nxd5 Qxd5 Nc3 Qe5  and I shouldn't have any problems with development I can fianchetto KB"
9,g3,g2g3,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n5/3n4/8/2N3P1/PPPPNP1P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"This move weakens the light squares, and the previous knight move also weakened the light squares...........so............."
10,Bg4,c8g4,r2qkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n5/3n4/6b1/2N3P1/PPPPNP1P/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,I annoyingly place my bishop here threatening to ruin White's kingside castling chances and pinning the knight
11,Bg2,f1g2,r2qkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n5/3n4/6b1/2N3P1/PPPPNPBP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 6,Best move
12,Nd4,c6d4,r2qkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3n4/3n2b1/2N3P1/PPPPNPBP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 3 7,This was my tricky move. All my tactics are revolved around the weak light squares. Both my knights are invinsible. I also have a direct threat of Nxc3 dxc3 Bxe2.
13,Bxd5,g2d5,r2qkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3B4/3n2b1/2N3P1/PPPPNP1P/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,"White takes my invinsible knight, which is a mistake, as his light squares are incredibly weak."
14,Qxd5,d8d5,r3kb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/3n2b1/2N3P1/PPPPNP1P/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"I love taking advantage of weak squares. Nxd5 results in Nf3  Kf1 Bh3#
Always consider which squares you are weakening when you make pawn moves. White has advanced the g and e-pawns, making f3 especially weak."
15,O-O,e1g1,r3kb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/3n2b1/2N3P1/PPPPNP1P/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 8,"I was hoping White would fall for my mating trick, but I knew I still had an advantage due to my incredible grip on the light squares..... maybe even a a forced mate. White's only ways to get out of mate were d3 or f3, but I still win material."
16,Nf3+,d4f3,r3kb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/6b1/2N2nP1/PPPPNP1P/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 9,The only check to keep the initiative
17,Kh1,g1h1,r3kb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/6b1/2N2nP1/PPPPNP1P/R1BQ1R1K b kq - 3 9,If Kg2 then Nh4   Kg1 Qg2#.
18,Ng5+,f3g5,r3kb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3q2n1/6b1/2N3P1/PPPPNP1P/R1BQ1R1K w kq - 4 10,"White realizes castling into his weak squares was a terrible idea. White may have thought he was safe since any check would leave my queen hanging, but he doesn't have time to take my queen because I have Bf3  Kg1 Nh3# exploiting the weaknesses on h3, g2, and f3."
19,f3,f2f3,r3kb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3q2n1/6b1/2N2PP1/PPPPN2P/R1BQ1R1K b kq - 0 10,"If Kg1 then Nh3#, so White tries to hang on as long as possible, but it's clear I have won."
20,Bxf3+,g4f3,r3kb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3q2n1/8/2N2bP1/PPPPN2P/R1BQ1R1K w kq - 0 11,"Now White is mated because Kg1 Nh3#, and White's continuation also got him mated"
