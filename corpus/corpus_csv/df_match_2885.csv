Its about here that I decided I might have the possibility to win against Jo so I decided to switch from a fast moving tempo to correspondence mode like my esteemed opponent.
Though the position looks potentially drawish : (fixed & symetrical pawn positions, equal centre control, safe k positions and equally contested e file with potential multiple Rook exchanges).
We do have a minor piece imbalance. N/B V Bishop pair though the fixed centre tends to balance them out.
Blacks plan will be to try and provoke weakness on both sides of the board in the hope of utilizing his B pair.
Whites plan to exchange down to a Q/N v Q/B ending where white has the superior piece combination."
