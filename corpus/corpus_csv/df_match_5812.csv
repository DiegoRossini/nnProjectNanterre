In the end I banking the hope that black feel constantly under pressure and never has time to implement his own ideas. 

Just is in the blitzkrieg tactic it's major drawback is that the force can advance beyond it's supply lines. This leaves the front most troops vulnerable to attack on the flanks and rear. The end result is you cut off and surrounded."

However, in the mean time black is in no serious dangerous as the centre is still fluid and there are no open lines. Therefore, whites ultimate objective is to

This demonstrates the dangers of opening lines if your opponent has a space advantage. The rule is is if you are cramped seek to exchange pieces not pawns.

However the truth black asked dor it by castling into the pawn storm. Black would be still fine if he paid more attention to piece development and castling away from my space advantage."
