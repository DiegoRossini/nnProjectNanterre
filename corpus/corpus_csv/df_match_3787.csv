8,e5,e7e5,r1bqkb1r/pppn1ppp/3p1n2/4p3/3PPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"This move takes us (or at least me) out of the books.  The move grabs space, but takes a lot of pressure of e5 and Black's center.  Another drawback is that White falls behind in development, which can explode in White's face if he gets too aggressive and allows Black to detonate the center."

I think this is an example of the psychological aspect of the Philidor.  White perhaps feels that Black is playing a passive system and that he as all the time in the world to develop his attack against Black."
