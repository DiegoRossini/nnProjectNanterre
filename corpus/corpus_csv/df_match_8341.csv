1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

It's back to the board, I have done my Saturday afternoon chores - got that hoovering out of the way and my mother-in-law a birthday present, so I can now sit down and do some more chess study.  I recently played an unrated game with a near-IM.  He is fairly new to gameknot.  I ended up challenging him after he put a thread in the gameknot forum about unrated games which sparked off quite a debate!  I kicked off with 1. e4 and he responded with the Reversed Grob, g5."

The trouble with this move is, is that black's lsb could go onto the b1-h7 diagonal and cut across my position like a knife.  All this is hindsight.  My opponent stated in a post-match pm that Fou Leblanc should have gone to d3.  This would have preserved the bishop and controlled that b1-h7 diagonal.  Now see how this reasonable position gets more and more cramped."

This knight should have in fact gone to c1 and then perhaps d3 screening out that black dsb's line.  In fact my opponent also recommended a3.

Poor Glenda is trapped and the only way to save her is for either Fou Lenoir or one of the horsies to give up their lives for a humble pawn to save her.  That is probably just for starters though.  With my pieces all cramped up as it is I decided to wave the white flag.  It just shows how some fairly small innacuracy by an intermediate player is well and truly punished by a near-IM.
