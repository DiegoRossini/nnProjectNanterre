Black usually won't want to play …Bb4 in this opening anyway (unless White plays some silly weakening move like b3) because the trade …Bxc3+ just helps White — pair of Bishops, c3-pawn supports the center, open b-file, etc.

White does make the correct decision to avoid Nb5, which is just a waste of time after …Na6."
