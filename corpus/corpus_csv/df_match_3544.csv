9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,This is the starting position of the powerful Sicilian Najdorf defense.

11,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,The sicilian Najdorf Lipnitzky attack is extremely dangerous line against black. White has tremdeous power on the king side and on e6. For good intro of this great line for white copy and paste this link. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZcakUoDrkQ

14,b5,b7b5,rnbqkb1r/5ppp/p2ppn2/1p6/3NP3/1BN5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,black has to play assertively or white will be able to sac on e6 or e5. Black avoids developing with Bb7 and Nbd7 to avoid Bd5 and the pin of Bg5

17,Qf3,d1f3,rnbqk2r/4bppp/p2ppn2/1p6/3NP3/1BN2Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 3 9,"This move has tremendous power for white. White has e4-e5 and Qg3 attacking the weak g7 square. Qg3 coupled with Bh6 can be very difficult for black to handle. Especially, if white can get a knight to the f4 outpost. At this point it is critical that black avoids castling 0-0. Instead black must play to prevent e4-e5 or Bh6 by attacking and forcing white to defend."
18,Qb6,d8b6,rnb1k2r/4bppp/pq1ppn2/1p6/3NP3/1BN2Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 4 10,I prefer this over Qc7 because it puts the queen on the b file to support b5-b4 and attacks the hanging knight on d4. After the logical 10. Be3 Qb7 the queen sits well on the b7-g2 diagonal preventing the immediate e4-e5 break.
