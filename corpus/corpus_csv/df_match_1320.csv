1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I am offering up this game annotation for two guys I've been trying to help out in learning to play chess.
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Queen's Gambit Accepted.  It can sometimes lead to very exciting play.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Queen's Gambit Accepted.  It can sometimes lead to very exciting play.
4,dxc4,d5c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2pP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Queen's Gambit Accepted.  It can sometimes lead to very exciting play.
5,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2pP4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"A more aggressive response is e4, making a more strategic push for the center, but this move open up the bishop going after the c4 pawn for early equalization."
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/8/2pP4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,This move doesn't seek to capitalize on the early pawn movement but does get your knight into the game.
7,Bxc4,f1c4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/8/2BP4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 4,"A bit premature perhaps?  Another good option is Nf3, but there is nothing wrong with this move."
8,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/8/2BP2b1/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 5,"Early aggressive.  Unless you want to castle queenside, I would focus on less aggressive development.  I think e6 is a good response.  It blunts any light squared bishop attacks and allow the black squared bishop a path to development."
9,Nf3,g1f3,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/8/2BP2b1/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 5,I think that this is the best response.
10,e6,e7e6,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/8/2BP2b1/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,Good development so far.
11,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/8/2BP2b1/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"I like h3 here better, but good for knight dev.  Also consider Nbd2."
12,Nc6,b8c6,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/8/2BP2b1/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 7,A fairly routine development on both sides now.
13,e4,e3e4,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/8/2BPP1b1/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,"I would have chosen to castle here.  Get out of any potential danger.  This move is a mistake as it allows Black to win a center pawn.  Bxf3, Qxf3, Nxd4, threatening White's Q or what Black chose to do and Nxd4."
14,Nxd4,c6d4,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/8/2BnP1b1/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,Now white has to be careful about b5 pawn fork.
15,Qa4+,d1a4,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/8/Q1BnP1b1/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 1 8,Now white has to be careful about b5 pawn fork.
16,c6,c7c6,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/8/Q1BnP1b1/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 0 9,Now white has to be careful about b5 pawn fork.
17,Ne5,f3e5,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/4N3/Q1BnP1b1/2N5/PP3PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 1 9,"I am uncertain how good this move is, considering the threat of b5, you really need to hope black doesn't see it and that you can get your king to safety quickly."
18,Qd6,d8d6,r3kb1r/pp3ppp/2pqpn2/4N3/Q1BnP1b1/2N5/PP3PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 2 10,"I think I would have played Bd6 instead, as it achieves the same goal and develops the bishop, allowing Black to castle kingside."
19,Nxg4,e5g4,r3kb1r/pp3ppp/2pqpn2/8/Q1BnP1N1/2N5/PP3PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 0 10,Mistake.  In order to do this move you need to remove the defending queen first.  Much better is b5! or equalizing play with Nxg4.
20,Nc2+,d4c2,r3kb1r/pp3ppp/2pqpn2/8/Q1B1P1N1/2N5/PPn2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 1 11,Mistake.  In order to do this move you need to remove the defending queen first.  Much better is b5! or equalizing play with Nxg4.

22,Nxg4,f6g4,r3kb1r/pp3ppp/2pqp3/8/2B1P1n1/2N5/PPQ2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 0 12,HUGE BLUNDER!  Qxh2 is mate (1)!
23,O-O,e1g1,r3kb1r/pp3ppp/2pqp3/8/2B1P1n1/2N5/PPQ2PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 1 12,HUGE BLUNDER!  Qxh2 is mate (1)!
24,Nxh2,g4h2,r3kb1r/pp3ppp/2pqp3/8/2B1P3/2N5/PPQ2PPn/R1B2RK1 w kq - 0 13,Black does not have their eyes on the prize and missed a turn 12 Mate(1).
25,Rd1,f1d1,r3kb1r/pp3ppp/2pqp3/8/2B1P3/2N5/PPQ2PPn/R1BR2K1 b kq - 1 13,Much better to Q to c7. Now you are trading a Queen for a Rook.
26,Be7,f8e7,r3k2r/pp2bppp/2pqp3/8/2B1P3/2N5/PPQ2PPn/R1BR2K1 w kq - 2 14,Much better to Q to c7. Now you are trading a Queen for a Rook.
27,Rxd6,d1d6,r3k2r/pp2bppp/2pRp3/8/2B1P3/2N5/PPQ2PPn/R1B3K1 b kq - 0 14,Good to get rid of pesky knight.

30,Ng4,h2g4,r3k2r/pp3ppp/2pbp3/8/2B1P1n1/2N3P1/PPQ2P2/R1B3K1 w kq - 1 16,Also consider Nf3+ for a free move.
