1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Today in my quest of game annotation I continue my examination of games that I have played in the Evan's gambit. Unlike the first game that I played, this game was a closer affair with an interesting attack that lead to a winning endgame. Let's examine."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"As normal with the Evan's gambit I will be making notes on what the computer (Komodo) says in these positions is the best move, focusing on what black should be doing on defense and what white should be doing on the attack. The usual caveat with machines not always understanding a position exists, however, machines tend to be quite good at concrete lines and tactics, which the Evan's gambit is full of."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Signifying the Evan's gambit. Black does not actually have to take this pawn, but if they don't they do fall back into a passive position with white gaining space and often an attack as well."

8,Bxb4,c5b4,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/1bB1P3/5N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,Also the best way to refute a gambit is to accept it.
9,c3,c2c3,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/1bB1P3/2P2N2/P2P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,One of the main ideas in the opening is to stop black from developing properly all while opening avenues for your pieces to attack. At some point the idea is that black will have to give back some material to stay in the game and at worst white will have an even endgame. That is the idea of course. Does not always happen that way.
10,Ba5,b4a5,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/b3p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/P2P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 6,"The best move, keeping an eye on the e1 square for the future."
11,d4,d2d4,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/b3p3/2BPP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,This is the variation I have been trying so far. It is a full 3 pawn sac if black wants. Check out another game I annotated if you would like to see how that might go. http://gameknot.com/annotate.pl?id=62485
12,exd4,e5d4,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/b7/2BpP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"The natural move, accepting another pawn and asking white what their idea is."
13,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/b7/2BpP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 7,"The full three pawn sacrifice, at least temporarily. Black can take on c3 and be up three pawns and down in development. Or they can start to develop but give white a strong center with many nice attacking chances."
14,d6,d7d6,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/b7/2BpP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,"Black chooses the latter idea and plays the natural looking d6 move. There are often ideas here of white playing e5 because d6 is now a target to attack, but if white can't figure out a way to do that then it opens up the light squared bishop and tries to control some important squares."
15,cxd4,c3d4,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/b7/2BPP3/5N2/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,"Here is the first important position of this game. Black has to decide how to unravel his pieces and there are a lot of possible lines for white to attack. White is still down a pawn, or course but is ready to begin an attack. The a5 bishop is controlling e1, so the rook can't come into there if white can open the center, and the threat of Qb3 is such that the c8 bishop is kind of stuck. Interesting position though, and one of the reasons I like the Evan's gambit. Lots of ways for black to go wrong."
16,Nge7,g8e7,r1bqk2r/ppp1nppp/2np4/b7/2BPP3/5N2/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 9,"Potentially getting ready to castle and developing. This move seems kind of odd to the eye, but Bf6 doesn't really work because it allows white to play e5 at the right moment with tempo and smash open the center with likely tactics to go along with it."
17,Ng5,f3g5,r1bqk2r/ppp1nppp/2np4/b5N1/2BPP3/8/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 2 9,"I think this is probably the best move in the position, though I did also consider Qb3 and some other normal looking development moves. This prevents black from castling here though because if 9..O-O then 10. Qh5 looks great, threatening mate on h7 and pressuring f7 as well. 10..h6 11. Nxf7 Rxf7 wins the exchange and keeps a very strong attack going. Of course black has to figure out how to deal with the pressure on f7 without castling."
18,Rf8,h8f8,r1bqkr2/ppp1nppp/2np4/b5N1/2BPP3/8/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w q - 3 10,"Defending f7. Take a minute and think what you should play. White clearly has a nice position. You could play Qb3 or Qh5 with extra pressure on f7 which is somewhat hard to meet nicely. You could just take on h7 with the knight, for the rook to move, and then repeat the position at material equality. You could just take on f7 anyway, giving two pieces for a pawn and a rook and then play Qh5 at the end to pick up the h7 pawn anyway. Not to mention some Ba3 developing move or e5 trying to smash open the middle. Consider what you'd play and we'll talk about it in a second."
19,Qh5,d1h5,r1bqkr2/ppp1nppp/2np4/b5NQ/2BPP3/8/P4PPP/RNB2RK1 b q - 4 10,This is what I played. I thought it better than Qb3 because it have the option of taking with the queen instead of taking with the bishop if black doesn't meet this properly. I thought that if g3 then Qxh7 looked great and that I was likely to win an exchange in the worse case scenario. The computer likes Nxh7 here with the idea that 10. Nxh7 Rh8 11. Ng5 Rf8 12. Qh5 is the same but now black can't block with Ng6 so easily. if 12..Ng6 then Nxf7 Rxf7 Qxg6 (not possible right now because the h7 pawn would protect g6) and white is crashing through winning the exchange in a great position instead of in an unclear position. If you think another move works as well let me know in a comment. I'm always looking for interesting ideas in this opening.
20,d5,d6d5,r1bqkr2/ppp1nppp/2n5/b2p2NQ/2BPP3/8/P4PPP/RNB2RK1 w q - 0 11,(!?) pretty cool try by black here. In most of these lines I end up winning the exchange but taking on h7 with the knight and winning the rook for that knight. The real question is who is going to have the initiative after the dust settles and this idea opens up some nice squares for the black pieces and gives black a bit of activity.
21,exd5,e4d5,r1bqkr2/ppp1nppp/2n5/b2P2NQ/2BP4/8/P4PPP/RNB2RK1 b q - 0 11,"Taking with the bishop allows him to trade the knight for the bishop and keep simplifying, which helps his cause."
22,Nxd5,e7d5,r1bqkr2/ppp2ppp/2n5/b2n2NQ/2BP4/8/P4PPP/RNB2RK1 w q - 0 12,"(?!) My thought here was that I'm winning an exchange by force, but this allows black to complicate the matter needlessly. Better is to just play a developing move. 12. Nd2 or Bd2 is better (blocking the e1 square from the black bishop so the rook can open up against the king. Remember, material here is dead equal and white has a great attack going. Not that the h1 rook has moved they are not castling any time soon so slow playing is better. Winning exchanges is still a reasonable thing to do though."
23,Nxh7,g5h7,r1bqkr2/ppp2ppN/2n5/b2n3Q/2BP4/8/P4PPP/RNB2RK1 b q - 0 12,"(?!) My thought here was that I'm winning an exchange by force, but this allows black to complicate the matter needlessly.

24,Nf6,d5f6,r1bqkr2/ppp2ppN/2n2n2/b6Q/2BP4/8/P4PPP/RNB2RK1 w q - 1 13,Only move. If Rh1 then Bxc4 wins a piece with the pressure still going.
25,Qe2+,h5e2,r1bqkr2/ppp2ppN/2n2n2/b7/2BP4/8/P3QPPP/RNB2RK1 b q - 2 13,The computer prefers 13. Nxf6+ Qxf6 14. Ba3. My play on move 12 was to win the exchange and I didn't see anything better so I was still going for my plan.
