1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Another quick jaunt up the Fast Ladder. Only, this time my opponent removed himself from the ladder before the game concluded, so there was no upward jaunt at all. C'est la vie. My opponent's 1. e4 is met by the Sicilian Defense."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Another quick jaunt up the Fast Ladder. Only, this time my opponent removed himself from the ladder before the game concluded, so there was no upward jaunt at all. C'est la vie. My opponent's 1. e4 is met by the Sicilian Defense."
3,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,"Normally I only place annotations after my own moves (in this case, after black's moves). But since I presumed to prey upon an opponent over 600 rating points below mine, I will try to also offer advice after some of white's moves, to pay him back, as it were, with instruction I might give a student in an over-the-board meeting. So I will start with this: White plays he Bowlder Attack. I see it over and over here on GameKnot. Such a surprisingly popular,  yet inferior move. Well, maybe players tire of the old 2. Nf3. However, the Sicilian is strong enough for black without handing quick and painless equalization. I would advise any up and coming players to stick with the stronger opening lines. The GameKnot Database is an excellent guide, for starters."
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 3,2. ... e6 gives that poor white bishop nothing to do and subsequently threatens to push to d4 with gain of tempo that should handily equalize for black.
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 3,"A good strong developing move, preparing an early white castle and also contesting d4. This should have been white's 2nd move. Of note, 3. Bc4 (reversing the move order) would still be inferior since that bishop would still have nothing to do."
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 4,Excellent. Contesting 4. ... d5 and pre-defending the pawn on e4 against the inevitable Nf6.
7,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 4,Excellent. Contesting 4. ... d5 and pre-defending the pawn on e4 against the inevitable Nf6.
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/2p5/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 4 5,"This pawn really wants to be on d4, clearing away the black c5 pawn and gaining the upper hand in the center. The pawn on e4 is safe enough without a second defender."
9,d3,d2d3,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/2p5/2B1P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"This pawn really wants to be on d4, clearing away the black c5 pawn and gaining the upper hand in the center. The pawn on e4 is safe enough without a second defender."
10,d6,d7d6,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2nppn2/2p5/2B1P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"However, while 5. ... d4 offered respectable chances for equalization, it does so at the cost of exchanging quite a bit of material. Given the disparity of our ratings, I decided to keep the position more complicated."
11,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2nppn2/2p5/2B1P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 6,"Excellent. King safety is paramount, and getting a rook to e1 couldn't hurt either."
12,d5,d6d5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2pp4/2B1P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,"And then changed my mind. Worse, this wastes the 5. ... d6 move losing a tempo for black - so much for handy equalization."
13,exd5,e4d5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2pP4/2B5/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,"This is where this bishop almost always wants to be in the Sicilian, but without taking a rest stop on c4 along the way."
14,exd5,e6d5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/2pp4/2B5/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,"This is where this bishop almost always wants to be in the Sicilian, but without taking a rest stop on c4 along the way."

16,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2n2n2/1Bpp4/8/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 9,Preparing to castle which will serve the dual purpose of getting the king off of the open e-file and of unpinning the c6 knight.
17,Re1,f1e1,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2n2n2/1Bpp4/8/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq - 3 9,Excellent.
18,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2n2n2/1Bpp4/8/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 4 10,"Hmm, development is roughly even and black has the stronger center and slightly more coordinated pieces. I might say black equalized even with the lost tempo on move 5."
19,Bf4,c1f4,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2n2n2/1Bpp4/5B2/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 b - - 5 10,"This is probably not a good move. I was looking around and suddenly realized that I had few good moves, and white's control of the center was better than I had credited him. This breaks that up a bit, but at the cost of doubling my pawns on the d-file. I reasoned that with an open c-file, I would launch a rook fusillade at the backward white c-pawn enticing it forward to allow one of my d-pawns to exchange for it. Still, a weak plan. In retrospect, I really should have played something like 10. ... a6 followed by 11. ... b5, and then maybe developed my queen's bishop."
20,Nd4,c6d4,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/5n2/1Bpp4/3n1B2/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 w - - 6 11,"This is probably not a good move.

21,Re5,e1e5,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/5n2/1BppR3/3n1B2/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q2K1 b - - 7 11,"In game, I told white that I liked his style. A bold attacker, not unlike myself. This was completely true. However, this move is not at all a good one. Sometimes one can be too bold. The rook on e5 is an easy target, as black is about to demonstrate. Much simpler and very much stronger is 11. Nxd5 which saddles black with doubled isolated pawns on d4 and d5. Moreover, it exchanges a pair of knights - when one plays a stronger opponent, finding equitable trades is simply taking weapons out of the hands of a stronger player. If you do it enough, you could very well earn a draw; a sound strategy when outgunned. Playing to win is great, but when the field is not level, every equitable exchange brings it back to more level than it was before."
22,Bd6,e7d6,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/3b1n2/1BppR3/3n1B2/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q2K1 w - - 8 12,"My opponent attacks boldly up the open file with 11. Re5?, but I'm ready to refute that and now white must give up the exchange or lose a piece."
23,Re8,e5e8,r1bqRrk1/pp3ppp/3b1n2/1Bpp4/3n1B2/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q2K1 b - - 9 12,"Another bold move. Perhaps white miscalculated that black would play 12. ... Rxe8, though after 13. Bxe8 Nxe8 white is still down a piece. Maybe white overlooked the black knight on f8 entirely, expecting 13. ... Qxe8? which would allow 14. Bxd6. In any case, as played, 12. Re8? gives up a full rook (I give it only one ? since the rook was doomed to lose the exchange anyway, so really, this simply gives up a piece). The best option for the rook was to just sit where it was. In fact, 12. Nxd4 is still adquate here."
24,Nxe8,f6e8,r1bqnrk1/pp3ppp/3b4/1Bpp4/3n1B2/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q2K1 w - - 0 13,"Black plays the move that white seems to have neglected to consider, gaining a rook."
25,Nxd5,c3d5,r1bqnrk1/pp3ppp/3b4/1BpN4/3n1B2/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q2K1 b - - 0 13,"Here the white bishop on b5 is under attack and only defended by the knight on c3. Moving the knight will lose the bishop. Worse, black is threatening 13. ... Bxf4. Now that black is ahead in material, white should be avoiding exchanges. Consequently, 13. Bd2 might be white's best alternative here."
26,Nxb5,d4b5,r1bqnrk1/pp3ppp/3b4/1npN4/5B2/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q2K1 w - - 0 14,"White gets a pawn on d5, but gives up his bishop on b5, and loses the chance to double black's center pawns."
