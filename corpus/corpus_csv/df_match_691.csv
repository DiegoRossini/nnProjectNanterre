It is played on the French lines but I don't remember being a common option during the Sicilian opening phase. 5...Bc5 or Be7 seemed (now, to me) more adequate. also, a6 is played very often here to avoid the next move, that white, wisely, uses to his advantage."

Just helping white with his plan. d5 was a must, even when that pawn might look like a weak one."

Did not see much better chances after the exchange on d6. White has achieved a clear superiority in just 7 moves! This shows how important is to know not only the openings theory but also the concepts of development, including the center."

Things like 14.Bg5, or h4 to get the bishop onto a3, or else f4 with e5 were just too much for me, so I tried to focus on the rest of the games of this round.
Hope some of you have learned a lesson: develop properly and do not leave your center exposed to an attack early in the game, it will mostly cost you the game!
Nicely played by laslandes!"
