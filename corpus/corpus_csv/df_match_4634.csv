From now on white has three possible plans for the middlegame:

a) castle queenside and attack black’s king by means of a pawn-storm
b) make use of the central pawn majority, with Bd3, Qc2 and Nge2
c) make a minority attack by the advance of the b pawn hoping to create weaknesses in black's queen side

Black on the other side has some counter-play in form of a minority attack on king side with the pawn push f5-f4, or exploit white weaknesses on c4 and e4

I'll try ""plan B"", with an eye for a possible  swindle back to ""plan A"""
