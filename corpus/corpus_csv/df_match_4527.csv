1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Hello! This is a game where I thought i was well of from the opening but followed a faulty plan and made a lot of errors and lost in the end. And what shall we do when we lose in a way that alomost disgust us? We take the whip and torment ourselves some more and hopefully learn a lesson!

The attack against the b-pawn is actually quite irritating as whites queens knight has no other defenders at the moment.

The other way to create pawn weaknesses is 12...Nxf3 but the idea looks a little suspect as white would get the important e5 square with gxf3 and eventually f4"

I had a fleeting thought that if i combined pressure against e3- and e4-pawns I could bottle up white for good and then induce some more weaknesses, but of course I didn't realize that i have no way to attack the e4-pawn more than once. And what about the rooks, where do they want to be? on the c-file, of course, so why block it? 

I was afraid that if I didn't move the knight, I would have to reply ...Bxf3 if white played h3. This is quite understandable I think, and this move might even be a good one, but my thought process went a little astray at this point.

The problem for black here is the light squared bishop. It has nowhere to go and ...Bxf3 is a bad trade as gxf3 followed by f4 obviously improves whites posiotion. Ideally black would like to exchange it with white's lsb, play knight to e5 (with the intention to go to g4 or c4) and if white plays b3 then exploit the c-file and c3-square."

During the game I remember thinking that White was cramped and I should avoid exchanges. But that's not really true as white is just tied defending the pawn weaknesses and is just about ready gain some activity. Now if we look the position we see that it is black who is sligthly cramped - the knight and bishop needs the same squares. And what purpose the LSB have anyway?"
