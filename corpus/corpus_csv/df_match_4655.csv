a) Bxd7 loses the rook to Nxh1 but the Zwischenzug Nd3+ forks the king and bishop to win yet another piece a forced sequence after 14.Bxd7?? Nd3+ 15.Kd1 only move 15...Nxb2+ 16.K moves Nxh1 as the b2 knight is temporarily protected by the threat Bxd4 to skewer the rook 

b) Nxg3 better from white's point of view, keeps the rook but exchanges the b5 bishop for the e5 knight

c) hxg3 even better as avoids the loss of the rook and opens a column to develop it, simultaneously keeps the knight centralized on e2

d) dxe5 also loses the rook so is worst than hxg3"
