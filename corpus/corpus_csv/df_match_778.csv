I think several of Black's key mistakes in this game were 1) move number twelve, when he didn't take precautions against the King being pinned and I was able to gain myself a Rook, and 2) leaving a lot of pieces unprotected and taking too many unnecessary risks. Like the knight on b4; that knight could have easily retreated to c6, but instead, Black moved the other knight forward into my territory. That knight was protecting the key square at d6; if that knight hadn't moved last turn, my queen wouldn't have been able to move to that square to check the king."
