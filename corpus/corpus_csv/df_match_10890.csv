2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The French Defence, delaying immediate central expansion in order to obtain a solid pawn on d5 and queenside counterplay. The major qualm I have with this opening is that it blocks in the Queenside Bishop. 
""I have never in my life played the French Defence, which is the dullest of all openings."" - Wilhem Steinitz"
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Claiming the center with both pawns.
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,The Paulsen Variation (named after Louis Paulsen)
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,The Paulsen Variation (named after Louis Paulsen)
6,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/1b1PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"The Winawer Variation, attempting to break up White's Queenside pawns."
7,e5,e4e5,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3pP3/1b1P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"The main line of the Winawer Variation. Until recently I normally played Bd2, the wonderful Fingerslip Variation, or Ne2, the Alekhine Gambit. But also until recently, I was a really bad player."
8,c5,c7c5,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/1b1P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"The Advance Variation (I don't know why they give it a new name after every move). It attempts to attack White's pawn center at the base, but also blocks in the dark-squared Bishop."
9,a3,a2a3,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/1b1P4/P1N5/1PP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"Black opts for the most common response. This gives up a Bishop for a Knight in a closable position, and doublers the White pawns. It also opens the b-file for White."
10,Bxc3+,b4c3,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/P1b5/1PP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"Black opts for the most common response. This gives up a Bishop for a Knight in a closable position, and doublers the White pawns. It also opens the b-file for White."
11,bxc3,b2c3,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,"Classical Variation. Brings another piece to bear against the center, developes the Queen to the 7th rank and defends the c-pawn. 6. Ne7 is more common."
12,Qc7,d8c7,rnb1k1nr/ppq2ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 7,"Classical Variation. Brings another piece to bear against the center, developes the Queen to the 7th rank and defends the c-pawn. 6. Ne7 is more common."
13,Qg4,d1g4,rnb1k1nr/ppq2ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P2Q1/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 2 7,"Attacks the g pawn. Still in book, surprisingly, as it seems to defy the accepted opening principle of not developing your Queen early."
14,f5,f7f5,rnb1k1nr/ppq3pp/4p3/2ppPp2/3P2Q1/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq f6 0 8,Defends the g pawn with the Queen. Much sharper (read: more fun) is cxd4.
15,Qg3,g4g3,rnb1k1nr/ppq3pp/4p3/2ppPp2/3P4/P1P3Q1/2P2PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 1 8,"8. exf6 Nxf6 9. Qf4 Qa5 (this targets the weak pawns, better than Qxf4 10. Bxf4) And White has given up a pawn to help Black with his developement."
16,cxd4,c5d4,rnb1k1nr/ppq3pp/4p3/3pPp2/3p4/P1P3Q1/2P2PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 0 9,"Finally leaving book, 8. Ne7 is better. I don't really like this move, as it undoubles Whites pawns for little compensation. Black can't even take the pawn because after 9...Qxc2 10. Bd2 Qc7 ( 10...g6, 10...Kf1 or 10...Kf2 11. Rc1 Qe4  12. Ne2, and Black is under developed with an overextended Queen. White's easy developement should compensate for the pawn.) 11. Bb5  Nc6 12. Ne2 and Black has difficulty developing because of the pin and the pressured g pawn."
17,cxd4,c3d4,rnb1k1nr/ppq3pp/4p3/3pPp2/3P4/P5Q1/2P2PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 0 9,Not 10. Qxg7? Qc3  11. Ke2 Rg8 (not Qxa1?? Qxh8 ) 12. Qxh7 Qxa1. 10. Bd2 defends the c3 square and threatens Qxg7.
18,Ne7,g8e7,rnb1k2r/ppq1n1pp/4p3/3pPp2/3P4/P5Q1/2P2PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 1 10,Not 10. Qxg7? Qc3  11. Ke2 Rg8 (not Qxa1?? Qxh8 ) 12. Qxh7 Qxa1. 10. Bd2 defends the c3 square and threatens Qxg7.
19,Bd2,c1d2,rnb1k2r/ppq1n1pp/4p3/3pPp2/3P4/P5Q1/2PB1PPP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 2 10,Not 10. Qxg7? Qc3  11. Ke2 Rg8 (not Qxa1?? Qxh8 ) 12. Qxh7 Qxa1. 10. Bd2 defends the c3 square and threatens Qxg7.
20,O-O,e8g8,rnb2rk1/ppq1n1pp/4p3/3pPp2/3P4/P5Q1/2PB1PPP/R3KBNR w KQ - 3 11,"!? Probably the best way to defend the pawn. 10... Rg8 is bad because it stops Black from castling Kingside. And 10...Ng6 looks bad after both 11. h4 which starts the ball rolling for a Kingside attack, and 11. Be2 which threatens a particularily painful pin."
21,Bd3,f1d3,rnb2rk1/ppq1n1pp/4p3/3pPp2/3P4/P2B2Q1/2PB1PPP/R3K1NR b KQ - 4 11,"Defends the pawn and developes. The White Bishops a seem rather akwardly placed, but it is well placed for an attack after the bayonet ...g4."
22,b6,b7b6,rnb2rk1/p1q1n1pp/1p2p3/3pPp2/3P4/P2B2Q1/2PB1PPP/R3K1NR w KQ - 0 12,"Prepares to fianchetto the Bishop, or use the a6-f1 diagonal, which is not closed off like the long diagonal."
23,Ne2,g1e2,rnb2rk1/p1q1n1pp/1p2p3/3pPp2/3P4/P2B2Q1/2PBNPPP/R3K2R b KQ - 1 12,"Gets ready to castle, or to attack the e pawn with Nf4."
24,Ba6,c8a6,rn3rk1/p1q1n1pp/bp2p3/3pPp2/3P4/P2B2Q1/2PBNPPP/R3K2R w KQ - 2 13,Tries to trade off Whites good Bishop for Black's bad one.
25,Nf4,e2f4,rn3rk1/p1q1n1pp/bp2p3/3pPp2/3P1N2/P2B2Q1/2PB1PPP/R3K2R b KQ - 3 13,Puts pressure on the e pawn. Also threatens to fork Queen and Rook with Nxe6.
