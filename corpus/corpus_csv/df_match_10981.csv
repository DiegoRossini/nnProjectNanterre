I had made mention of this game at the local chess club, and had foolishly put this move on the board, when our first board, who had been following along.. pipes up after a few minutes... ""That's incorrect"", and goes on to demonstrate that black can force a mate in  6 or 7 moves. I didn't bother to take notes at this point, knowing that I had just received some expert advice on a game in progress.. a very definite no-no. I didn't bother asking him what the correct move was for white, and didn't mention that I was still playing this game, from fear of being stoned by the membership! I do remember he mentioned Qg5  starts the mating sequence, and later that night that is the move I played next."
