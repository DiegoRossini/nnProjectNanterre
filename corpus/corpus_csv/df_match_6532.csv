1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Hi Team I thought this was an interesting game as I seem to make mistakes and offer pieces for little gain but as you will see works in my favour. Also it makes it better as it's one of my first team games. Feel free to offer your advice on where I did well or made mistakes. I would like to see where I could improve or how he could of stopped me.
