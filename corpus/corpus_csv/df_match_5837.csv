7,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqkbnr/2pp1ppp/p3p3/1p6/3PP3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"I reasoned that my Nb1 would probably get harassed if it moved to c3, so I planned moving it to d2 but didn't want to hem in my dsb.  This B has nothing much to bite on yet as the attack on the Q is easily foiled but would pin a N blocking the attack on the Q and could swap with a B doing the same.  If Black blocked with ...f6, that would weaken his kingside.  If Black left the B alone, it would be nicely placed."

17,O-O,e1g1,rn2kb1r/1bpqnpp1/p2pp2p/1p6/3PP2B/3B1N2/PPPNQPPP/R4RK1 b kq - 3 9,Memories of my first game of the season (my last annotation) persuaded me against castling long.

41,Qe3,e2e3,2r4r/1bpqn3/p2pNk2/1p3p2/3P4/3PQ3/PP3PPP/2R1R1K1 b - - 3 21,"! I loved this move and for the first time my opponent really sank into thought.  Up to now, I had used about 10 minutes more than him.  Over the next few moves I developed a handy cushion.  What I loved about it was that it was a logical progression from my previous play while being far from obvious and, at first sight, like so many small Q moves, seemingly innocuous.  The more I looked into it, the better it seemed - a sort of puzzle reset move."
