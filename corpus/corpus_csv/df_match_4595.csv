5,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3P4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,Choosing to exchange at once...
6,cxd5,c6d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,...and Black completes it.
7,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"The attacking line. If Black plays 4... P-K3, he loses the best feature of the Caro-Kann -- the ability to freely develop his QB."
8,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3p1b2/2PP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,4... N-KB3 guards the P and leaves the development of the B open.
9,cxd5,c4d5,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3P1b2/3P4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,With this exchange...
10,Qxd5,d8d5,rn2kbnr/pp2pppp/8/3q1b2/3P4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,...White forces the recapture with the Q.
11,Nc3,b1c3,rn2kbnr/pp2pppp/8/3q1b2/3P4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 6,Developing with tempo.
12,Qa5,d5a5,rn2kbnr/pp2pppp/8/q4b2/3P4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 7,Better is the simple retreat 6... Q-Q1. Both sides would have 1 piece developed and Black's game would be quite tenable.
13,Qb3,d1b3,rn2kbnr/pp2pppp/8/q4b2/3P4/1QN5/PP3PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 3 7,Forcing...
14,Qb6,a5b6,rn2kbnr/pp2pppp/1q6/5b2/3P4/1QN5/PP3PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 4 8,...yet another Queen move!
15,Nd5,c3d5,rn2kbnr/pp2pppp/1q6/3N1b2/3P4/1Q6/PP3PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 5 8,"If Black now tries 8... Q-QB3??? to keep the QNP defended, Whitte has 9 B-QN5!!! winning the Q!"
16,Qxb3,b6b3,rn2kbnr/pp2pppp/8/3N1b2/3P4/1q6/PP3PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 0 9,Practically forced...
17,axb3,a2b3,rn2kbnr/pp2pppp/8/3N1b2/3P4/1P6/1P3PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 0 9,..but now Black resigns. White threatens 10 N-B7 ch with a shakrukh or 10 N-N6 PxN 11 RxR winning the Exchange. 9... N-R3 sems to guard everything but White has 10 RxN!! PxR 11 N-B7 ch ending up a piece ahead.
