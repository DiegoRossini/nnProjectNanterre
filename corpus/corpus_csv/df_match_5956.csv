1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Righto...this is really for my opponent (a dear friend) and myself...but if there are others who want to comment thats fine. This game isn't particularly spectacular, but it was a game i didn't expect to lose so i'd been stewing over it. Anyway, here are my thoughts."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"this is the Scandinavian...an opening from Black that i typically hold in contempt because the obvious Qxd5 loses tempo to Nc3. This put me in the wrong kind of mood to face an opponent who had improved dramatically since the last time we had met.

I have later learned that the Scandinavian is respected in a lot of circles and can be played quite effectively by black. Another thing to learn."
3,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,I think my opponent makes a mistake here. He's giving up a pawn in hopes of a quick development to Nc6...but i think he weakens his Queenside a lot in the process. But it was a point i never got to prove....

7,dxc6,d5c6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2P2n2/8/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"I certainly considered Nf3 but I wanted to avoid positional, drawish four knights play. I'm drawn to Bb5 here because it has similarities to the Spanish, which i know pretty well...plus i always like the idea of pinning down a knight.

In retrospect...Nf3 is a better move because it exerts some influence over d4...which ended up being a strong point for my opponent later."

11,Ba4,b5a4,r1bqkb1r/1p2pppp/p1n2n2/8/B7/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 6,"this is his best move, i think. I have to answer the queen's threat on g2 so castling makes sense...but i realized at this point that if my bishop was driven off of the king diagonal I was going to have a helluva time driving the queen out of there.

Bottom-line, it was a great early queen placement by my opponent, exploiting the fact that his d-file was open and mine was not. An earlier Nf3 would have restriced that movement a bit."

However, it did mobilize his rook and get it to the semi-open d-file and pin the pawn to the queen."

I simply overlooked the rook's new position which made the following trade possible.

I also considered pawn to f4 to trap the rook. I ended up abandoning the first idea realizing that the gain in development wouldn't be worth the material lost and i abandoned the first because I (mistakenly) thought that the rook would have a safe escape on g3.

Not meaning to degrade Brandon's play...but at this point...my fatigue (it was hours past my normal bed time, was starting to show)"
29,Be3,g5e3,2k2b1r/4p1pp/p3pn2/1p6/6r1/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - - 1 15,"another good move. I wasn't willing to close off the d-file and un-double his pawns with a knight trade, so I knew i'd have to chase his knight away before i could do much."
