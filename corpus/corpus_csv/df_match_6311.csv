1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hello, everybody! It's been a while since I annotated a game here, now I've finally found the sufficient will to do another :-)

This is a nice game I've played from the 61st GK tournament. There wasn't much between me and two other players (my opponent in this game, corleone_to, and filinout) and this game was actually the decisive one that allowed me to capture first place in our group (all other games between the three of us were hard-fought draws)."

13...Nxe5 14.fxe5 Bxg3 is somewhat better, 15.Qxg3 Rh7 (which is probably too passive, even if it seems ok for now).

The careless 16...Ngf6? runs into 17.fxe6+ Kxe6 (17...Kg8!? 18.exd7) 18.Nf4+ and now 18...Kd6 19.Bb4+ Kc7 20.Ne6 wins the queen or 18...Kf7 19.Qb3+ Ke8 (19...Nd5 20.Nxd5) 20.R(either)e1+ Be7 21.Ng6.

Again, giving back material with the tricky 16...Nc5 is an option, where white actually can't take 17.dxc5? because of 17...Qxd3 18.cxd3 exf5 and black is up a pawn, if a bit tied up at the moment. White should probably continue the attack with something like 17.Qh3 and black seems forced to give the knight back anyway (17...Ne4 18.fxe6 Ke7 19.Bb4 Nd6 20.Qf5 Nf6 21.Nf4 or something, piling on the pressure) and play 17...exf5 18.dxc5 Ne7 19.Bc3 and white is much better.

16...e5? isn't any good either, 17.Qc4+ Ke8 18.dxe5.

I won't state it categorically, but 'tis likely that white missed a winning try with 15.Nxf7! Kxf7 16.f5!. Instead, black is able to relieve some pressure."
