1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"A ""Walking the Walk"" club game.  A notable aspect of this game is that black's king moved a total of ONE time the entire game.  Up until move 36 (the point at which white would have resigned in a non-club game), white's king moved 7 times.  That contrast along with a few other time-wasting and questionable moves by white played a large part in the game.  Black slowly developed a stronger position and then gained the initiative, probably over the course of moves 12 to to 20, with white's move 16 perhaps being the turning point."

Bc3 puts some general pressure on black's kingside, ...could perhaps influence black to castle same side, though at this point I'd be happy with either game.  also thought about Be3, and then bringing rook in behind. Passed on Ne4 to conserve pieces.  Plus that might have been playing in to an endgame that black may be working toward.  Is the Caro-Kann known for having a small middlegame?   ---around this time (moves 12 to 17), black perhaps comes to have a better position.  this by subtle moves on his part and subtle mistakes on mine (or not so subtle?).  how did black's better position come about?  ---I note that this move, 12. Bc3, does turn out to be no good and only wastes important time that could have been put to better use."

I expect black was no more concerned with my capturing the pawn than he would have been if I had stayed away from it (perhaps he wanted me to take it, and maybe the a-pawn as well).  having castled ""into trouble"" before, I note that my king is somewhat well positioned to move to the center or right (I realize the folly of this, now).  better to leave black's pawns alone here, ...to inhibit his heavy pieces?"
