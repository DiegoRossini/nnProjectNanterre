1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I keep using this system despite I know it is inferior against a strong player. But it is always fun to see how things get out...

3,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Finally something - and better, IMO - than Nc3! It is very dangerous to play against this."

6,e5,e7e5,rnb1kbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3qp3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"if Nc3, Bb5, a6, BxN, bxN is a likely outcome. Qa5 is a move I don't like."
7,dxe5,d4e5,rnb1kbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3qP3/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"Thank you white. You give me the castling rights, but without the queens the game will be interesting. As in fact was."
8,Qxd1+,d5d1,rnb1kbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNBqKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"The alternative, Qxe4+, is also playable. Black has attack, but I preferred this line."
9,Kxd1,e1d1,rnb1kbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNBK1BNR b kq - 0 5,"Developing + threatening, but the f pawn was to go on f4 anyway, sooner or later."
10,Bc5,f8c5,rnb1k1nr/ppp2ppp/8/2b1P3/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNBK1BNR w kq - 1 6,"Developing + threatening, but the f pawn was to go on f4 anyway, sooner or later."
11,f4,f2f4,rnb1k1nr/ppp2ppp/8/2b1P3/5P2/8/PPP3PP/RNBK1BNR b kq - 0 6,"...so I can exploit the big diagonal... though this path is no with no dangers, as we'll see. With the text move, I take advantage on the fact that the black bishop can't be easily kicked by pawns (c3-b4 is too costly for developement)."

13,Nf3,g1f3,rnb1k1nr/p1p2ppp/1p6/2b1P3/5P2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBK1B1R b kq - 1 7,It's always uneasy to play against this.
14,Bb7,c8b7,rn2k1nr/pbp2ppp/1p6/2b1P3/5P2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBK1B1R w kq - 2 8,It's always uneasy to play against this.
15,Bd3,f1d3,rn2k1nr/pbp2ppp/1p6/2b1P3/5P2/3B1N2/PPP3PP/RNBK3R b kq - 3 8,White has to be very careful with the diagonal.
16,Ne7,g8e7,rn2k2r/pbp1nppp/1p6/2b1P3/5P2/3B1N2/PPP3PP/RNBK3R w kq - 4 9,This knight is going to try to take advantage from the half pinned Nf3 and g2.
17,Nc3,b1c3,rn2k2r/pbp1nppp/1p6/2b1P3/5P2/2NB1N2/PPP3PP/R1BK3R b kq - 5 9,"I'll be glad about BxN. Now, the danger is f5, but BxN+, gxB, Nxe4, Re8, and the N is pinned, but no pawn can kick him, and f6 defends it, as Nd7 and Bd6, just in case, so no worry about that."
18,Ng6,e7g6,rn2k2r/pbp2ppp/1p4n1/2b1P3/5P2/2NB1N2/PPP3PP/R1BK3R w kq - 6 10,"I'll be glad about BxN. Now, the danger is f5, but BxN+, gxB, Nxe4, Re8, and the N is pinned, but no pawn can kick him, and f6 defends it, as Nd7 and Bd6, just in case, so no worry about that."

20,Nc6,b8c6,r3k2r/pbp2ppp/1pn3n1/2b1P3/4BP2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BK3R w kq - 8 11,"The ""worst"" one. But I was thinking on a tactic based on e4. Of course, if white goes f5, now I have to retire sadly on e7, since Nxe4 loses the piece."
21,Bd2,c1d2,r3k2r/pbp2ppp/1pn3n1/2b1P3/4BP2/2N2N2/PPPB2PP/R2K3R b kq - 9 11,"White missed his chance, sadly for him. Not that this was a bad move, but for..."

23,Nd5,c3d5,2kr3r/pbp2ppp/1pn3n1/2bNP3/4BP2/5N2/PPPB2PP/R2K3R b - - 11 12,"And this suggested me a ""great"" tactic: Nxe5, fxN, Nxe5, NxN, BxN, BxB, RxB, Nxf7, and black has open lines and pressure on the white king, who can't castle. BUT..."
24,Ncxe5,c6e5,2kr3r/pbp2ppp/1p4n1/2bNn3/4BP2/5N2/PPPB2PP/R2K3R w - - 0 13,"White finds a countertactic! Wow! I didn't even think on this move. ok. let's see: even if it seems better to keep the pawns together, I thought that after the storm it would be nice to be able to play c5, to keep the white's dsb off the action from b4."

27,Bxb7+,e4b7,2kr3r/pBp2ppp/1b4n1/4n3/5P2/5N2/PPPB2PP/R2K3R b - - 0 14,As expected.
28,Kxb7,c8b7,3r3r/pkp2ppp/1b4n1/4n3/5P2/5N2/PPPB2PP/R2K3R w - - 0 15,"Now I can recover the pawn. I'm not sure I've played the best way, maybe my advantage is not so great as if I had kept the tension. Anyway, the position is still good for me because white can't castle."
