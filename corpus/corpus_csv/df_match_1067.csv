9,Nbd2,b1d2,r1bqkbnr/ppp3pp/2n1pp2/3p4/3P1B2/2P2N2/PP1NPPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"Black's quiet developement provides me with a plus on e4. This is the consecuence of the Ng8 not being on f6, and the lsb being closed in behind his own pawns. Very long ago, I used to consider this a good setting for black, because it seems solid. Actually, it is cramped, and black has to know very well the few possible ways of developement he has."

20,Bd6,f4d6,r3k1nr/pppq2pp/2bbpp2/8/3P4/2P2NP1/PP1NQP1P/R3KB1R w KQkq - 1 11,"? BxN would have been better, so to divert my Q from the attack on e6, now more dangerous due to the pinning Bh3 (g3 causing black to lose a tempo was the key idea behind the whole thing). This seems fine, again, but..."
