1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"My opponent resigned on move 26 with a scathing note accusing me of playing like a computer.  He put me on ignore, not allowing any discussion on the subject whatsoever.  What is fascinating to me, is how he came to this conclusion as to me it seems like a very straightforward game.  So here are my thoughts on the game."

Now, I have played quite a few games on gameknot, my ratings graph alone will show that there is a very close match with the rating of the player vs the win or loss.  I had greatly enjoyed this game as I was losing quite a few games around then.  Saddened me that this player was such a poor sport.  I don't use computers to play my games, of course there is no way for me to prove it; but if you agree with me, can you let my opponent know?  His name is goffredob.  Thanks"
