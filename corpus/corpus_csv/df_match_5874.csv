3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Philador's Defence - not one I really like to go up against as White (personal preference) but then again, I do know that the infamous Legal's Mate can also arise from this position. With this in mind, my next developing  moves were obvious to me"

9,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp3pp1/2pp3p/4p3/2BPP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"! an open board favours the more developed side in the opening, so I had no qualms with this move!"
10,exd4,e5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp3pp1/2pp3p/8/2BpP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"Black decides to exchange... though I don't think this was the right move to play - Black is still behind in development! Nf6, Be7 or Bg4 would have been better."
11,Qxd4,d1d4,rnbqkbnr/pp3pp1/2pp3p/8/2BQP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 0 6,"Meanwhile, White is able to develop another piece off the back rank, and has no fear of being chased away by the knight because of Black's own pawn on c6."
12,Qe7,d8e7,rnb1kbnr/pp2qpp1/2pp3p/8/2BQP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 1 7,"?! Black develops his own queen, though to a strange square. I still like Nf6 or Bg4 for Black."
13,Bf4,c1f4,rnb1kbnr/pp2qpp1/2pp3p/8/2BQPB2/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 2 7,"I develop my last minor piece... and already has ideas for an attack. My last move was a big clue, but can you guess where the attack will come?"
14,Be6,c8e6,rn2kbnr/pp2qpp1/2ppb2p/8/2BQPB2/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 3 8,This must have been the intention behind Black's last move...
15,O-O-O,e1c1,rn2kbnr/pp2qpp1/2ppb2p/8/2BQPB2/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b kq - 4 8,"! Already, Black's in trouble - with all the pressure on the weak d6 pawn, something's got to give! Black's only option is to give up the pawn, because it cannot be defended no matter how hard Black tries!"
16,Bxc4,e6c4,rn2kbnr/pp2qpp1/2pp3p/8/2bQPB2/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/2KR3R w kq - 0 9,"?! Trading pieces in view of a powerful attack is understandable, but I'm not so sure about this move. After White recaptures with his queen, there would be two Black pieces defending d6, and two White pieces attacking it... but since Black's first defender is the queen, that fact doesn't matter. Furthermore, it allows me to keep my queen, which could be useful for an attack on the exposed king."
17,Qxc4,d4c4,rn2kbnr/pp2qpp1/2pp3p/8/2Q1PB2/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b kq - 0 9,"Nothing much Black can do in this situation really, but perhaps Nf6 would have been better? (sorry to sound like a broken record with the Nf6 move :P)"

19,Bxd6,f4d6,r3kbnr/pp2qpp1/n1pB3p/8/2Q1P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b kq - 0 10,"!? Of course... well, it seemed obvious at the time. The GK analysis machine prefers the rook capture, which would allow Rhd1 next move, and I did consider that, but I chose this move due to the tempo attack on the queen"
20,Qe6,e7e6,r3kbnr/pp3pp1/n1pBq2p/8/2Q1P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/2KR3R w kq - 1 11,"Black wants to exchange queens... Normally, I would avoid an exchange like that, but here I saw that the exchange could actually benefit me... and not just the queen exchange!"
21,Qxe6+,c4e6,r3kbnr/pp3pp1/n1pBQ2p/8/4P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b kq - 0 11,"With those two exchanges, White has now established a rook on the seventh rank and enjoys a positional, as well as a material advantage. Needless to say, I was feeling optimistic at this point"

27,Rc7,d7c7,r4knr/ppR3p1/2p1p2p/2n5/4P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/2K4R b - - 3 14,Forced if White wants to keep his influence on the seventh rank...
28,Nf6,g8f6,r4k1r/ppR3p1/2p1pn1p/2n5/4P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/2K4R w - - 4 15,"...but has he pushed too far? I thought so at first too, when I saw what Black was threatening (15...Ne8! wins the c7 rook) but it didn't take me long to find..."
29,Ne5,f3e5,r4k1r/ppR3p1/2p1pn1p/2n1N3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/2K4R b - - 5 15,"! Forced, but powerful all the same! Now if 15...Ne8 then 16.Ng6+ Kg8 17.Re7 Rh7 18.b4 works out great for White! Black ends up trying a different approach instead..."
