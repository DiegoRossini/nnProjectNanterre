1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I am Black. The person playing White was the highest rated person in this tournament. He ended up getting 1st, but I like this game because it reminds me I was the only person in the tournament who managed to beat him."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,The Benoni Defense. I immidiately challenge White's pawn.
3,d5,d4d5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2pP4/8/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"The strongest move. Moves like e3 and c3 are also okay, but they're passive and let Black get easy equality.
A worse move option for White is dxc5, which gives Black a slight advantage, and then it's White who is fighting for equality.
Also, White can play Nf3, which goes into an entirely different opening, if he doesn't want to study the Benoni."
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2pP4/8/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"I challenge White's pawn again. Forcing him to defend with e4 or c4. Other moves for White aren't good, because he moved his d-pawn twice, and must keep the pawn on d5 by defending with another pawn. Otherwise the tempi used advancing the d-pawn will be a waste."
5,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2pP4/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"This move is the sharpest, leading to an unbalanced sharp tactical game, while defending with e4 is more dull and drawish. I usually play Nf6 before I play e6 because it avoids the boring line e4, but since I was playing a much better player, I wouldn't have minded if he'd played the drawish e4."
6,exd5,e6d5,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/8/2pp4/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,I open my e-file I can use after I castle.
7,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/8/2pP4/8/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"This move stops White's pawn from advancing any further, although it isn't necessary right now, because if he advances I can play Qb6 and his pawn cannot be defended, because Bf4 leaves b2 hanging."
8,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/3p4/2pP4/8/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"This move stops White's pawn from advancing any further, although it isn't necessary right now, because if he advances I can play Qb6 and his pawn cannot be defended, because Bf4 leaves b2 hanging."
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/3p4/2pP4/8/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 5,Fianchettoing this bishop in the Benoni Defense is very important because I need to add to my control of the central dark squares.
10,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pp3p1p/3p2p1/2pP4/8/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,Fianchettoing this bishop in the Benoni Defense is very important because I need to add to my control of the central dark squares.
11,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pp3p1p/3p2p1/2pP4/4P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,"This is a very common position in this opening, although I thought Bg4 was better because it trades my passive bishop for White's centre-controlling knight."
12,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk1nr/pp3pbp/3p2p1/2pP4/4P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 7,"This is a very common position in this opening, although I thought Bg4 was better because it trades my passive bishop for White's centre-controlling knight."
13,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk1nr/pp3pbp/3p2p1/2pP4/4P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 7,"This is a very common position in this opening, although I thought Bg4 was better because it trades my passive bishop for White's centre-controlling knight."
14,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqk2r/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 3 8,"This is a very common position in this opening, although I thought Bg4 was better because it trades my passive bishop for White's centre-controlling knight."
15,h3,h2h3,rnbqk2r/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N2N1P/PP3PP1/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,"White stops Bg4, I should've played it the move earlier."
16,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N2N1P/PP3PP1/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 1 9,This bishop develops to d3 to defend the e-pawn.
17,Bd3,f1d3,rnbq1rk1/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2NB1N1P/PP3PP1/R1BQK2R b KQ - 2 9,This bishop develops to d3 to defend the e-pawn.
18,a6,a7a6,rnbq1rk1/1p3pbp/p2p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2NB1N1P/PP3PP1/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 10,"I am planning to play b5, giving me nice queenside control."
19,a4,a2a4,rnbq1rk1/1p3pbp/p2p1np1/2pP4/P3P3/2NB1N1P/1P3PP1/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 10,"This guy was much higher rated than I was, so he knew how to stop my plan."
20,Re8,f8e8,rnbqr1k1/1p3pbp/p2p1np1/2pP4/P3P3/2NB1N1P/1P3PP1/R1BQK2R w KQ - 1 11,Bd3 helped defend White's e-pawn.
21,O-O,e1g1,rnbqr1k1/1p3pbp/p2p1np1/2pP4/P3P3/2NB1N1P/1P3PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 2 11,The only good move I saw.
22,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bqr1k1/1p1n1pbp/p2p1np1/2pP4/P3P3/2NB1N1P/1P3PP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 3 12,The only good move I saw.

24,Qe7,d8e7,r1b1r1k1/1p1nqpbp/p2p1np1/2pP4/P3P3/2NB1N1P/1P3PP1/R1BQR1K1 w - - 5 13,"I like my queen here because it defends my weak d-pawn, and there weren't very many other moves in this cramped position."
25,Bf4,c1f4,r1b1r1k1/1p1nqpbp/p2p1np1/2pP4/P3PB2/2NB1N1P/1P3PP1/R2QR1K1 b - - 6 13,"I was worried about White playing e5 while my queen was in line with his rook. If he plays e5 now, then I can play Nh5 attacking the bishop and discovering an attack on his e5-pawn."
26,Qf8,e7f8,r1b1rqk1/1p1n1pbp/p2p1np1/2pP4/P3PB2/2NB1N1P/1P3PP1/R2QR1K1 w - - 7 14,"I was worried about White playing e5 while my queen was in line with his rook. If he plays e5 now, then I can play Nh5 attacking the bishop and discovering an attack on his e5-pawn."

28,Nh5,f6h5,r1b1rqk1/1p1n1pbp/p2p2p1/2pP3n/P3PB2/2NB1N1P/1P3PP1/R1Q1R1K1 w - - 9 15,I want to trade because White's actively placed bishop is better than my knight controlling unimportant squares.
