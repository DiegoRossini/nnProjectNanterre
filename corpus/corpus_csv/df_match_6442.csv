1,h3,h2h3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/7P/PPPPPPP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This starts off with the Clemenz Opening. This is rarely played in games with people of my rating, and basically gives a tempo to black."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/7P/PPPPPPP1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I start off with a powerful move, controlling the center and giving free space for my pieces. Knowing the opponents rating, I tried to go for the Scholar's Mate."
3,a4,a2a4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/P7/7P/1PPPPPP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,This... I do not know what this does. This basically gives me another tempo.
4,Bc5,f8c5,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/P7/7P/1PPPPPP1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"I start my attack on f7. If already fails with e3, I will at least have a good attacking piece out instead of my queen blocking where my knight will usually go."
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/P7/5N1P/1PPPPPP1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 3,Attacking the e-pawn i suppose.
6,e4,e5e4,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b5/P3p3/5N1P/1PPPPPP1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,This move chases the knight away when I want to get to f7 with my queen.
7,Ng1,f3g1,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b5/P3p3/7P/1PPPPPP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,"Retreats, but I thought Nh2 or Ne5 would be better."
8,Qf6,d8f6,rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/5q2/2b5/P3p3/7P/1PPPPPP1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 2 5,"I am set for the attack on f7. One move can mess this up, and there are a LOT of them."
9,g4,g2g4,rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/5q2/2b5/P3p1P1/7P/1PPPPP2/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"Since attacking with the knight failed. I think that this was attempted to get the bishop in there. I can easily block with d5 anyway. Still, there is checkmate next move..."
10,Qxf2#,f6f2,rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b5/P3p1P1/7P/1PPPPq2/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"Bxf7 would also have checkmated. This is not exactly the Scholar's Mate. That mate is typically four moves, with the same pattern of the bishop on the f7 diagonal and the queen also attacking the square from f3 or h5, and no other pieces are blocking the way of checkmate. This is a good strategy for winning games against low rated players quickly and efficiently, but otherwise NEVER play this opening. Be smart in defending against this, or end up like that..."
