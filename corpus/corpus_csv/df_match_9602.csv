11,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2p2/4pp1p/3P4/3P4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,Good - further weakens Black's pawn structure.
12,exd5,e6d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2p2/5p1p/3p4/3P4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,I think developing the kingside is a higher priority. I'm also not convinced this is the best square for the queen.
