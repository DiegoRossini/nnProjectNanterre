5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/p1pppp1p/1p4p1/8/2BPP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 3,"Oh no, disaster!  Now black receives not only Pg2 for free, but forks Rh1 and Nh3.  Rg1 or Rf1 ends with BxNh3, and black wins a knight and pawn for four points.

Pf3 would have defended against this, or Nf3 (the queen covers the interposing knight)."

10,a6,a7a6,rn1qkbnr/1bpp1p1p/pp2p1p1/4P3/2BP4/7N/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,The whole point behind Bb7 was to give black far reaching power across the center of conflict.  This pawn move does nothing.  BxPg2 was still black's best move.
11,c3,c2c3,rn1qkbnr/1bpp1p1p/pp2p1p1/4P3/2BP4/2P4N/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,Again white tempts black with BxPg2.  Taunting black with the tasty pawn.

If white moves the queen where it is not protecting f3, an Nf3+ fork lets black trade knight for Rg1 followed by BxBc1 for a free bishop.  White gets rapidly eviscerated."
