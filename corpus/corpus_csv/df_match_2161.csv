1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,The most common first move. I exclusively play e4 as White if I'm serious about the game.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Likewise, I've really grown to appreciate the Sicilian. For similar reasons, I suppose. I can be a little fluid in my first 3 moves as White after e4; and this is usually the case when I do Sicilian as well."
3,c3,c2c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"I encounter this line less often. This move inhibits Nc3 outright, allowing Black to seize d5-e4 easier."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"Likewise, the usual reply. But not unprepared for..."
5,e5,e4e5,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p1P3/8/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"A knight chase. Usually this would be poor on Black's part, but White's back rank remains untouched."
6,Nd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/8/2pnP3/8/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"If Bc4, then the chase is reversed after Nb6. If c4, d4 becomes less safe for White and e5 is compromised."
7,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/8/2pnP3/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,This is the main line as it is anyhow. White tries to displace the Sicilian with a solid pawn phalanx.
8,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/8/3nP3/3p4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,Black has hardly any reason to refuse.
9,cxd4,c3d4,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/8/3nP3/3P4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"Now e5 is protected, but hard to maintain due to none of White's stronger pieces being in play yet."
10,d6,d7d6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p4/3nP3/3P4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"Inviting exchange, and also opens the LSB, further deterring 6. e6!"
11,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p4/3nP3/3P4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,Finally!
12,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np4/3nP3/3P4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 7,Continuing development.
13,Bd3,f1d3,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np4/3nP3/3P4/3B1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 7,"Also not usually seen. Usually better are Bc4, Be2, or even a3, thusly preventing..."
14,Ndb4,d5b4,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np4/4P3/1n1P4/3B1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 8,Now the knights are joined and bullying White's queen-side.
15,Bb5,d3b5,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np4/1B2P3/1n1P4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 5 8,"White is clearly responding to Black now. Seeming to go for a more aggressive path, aiming to pin down one of the knights instead of diverting the bishop to c4 or e2 as earlier noted."
16,Qa5,d8a5,r1b1kb1r/pp2pppp/2np4/qB2P3/1n1P4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 6 9,"A bit more aggressive as well, but at this point I didn't feel as though losing the knight to a bishop exchange on c6 should concern Black anymore, not with the c pawn gone. Now White needs to seriously consider how to handle the bishop while paying extremely close attention to 9... Nc2+!!"
17,Nc3,b1c3,r1b1kb1r/pp2pppp/2np4/qB2P3/1n1P4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 7 9,Practically forced? This is the only move that addresses both above issues.
18,Bf5,c8f5,r3kb1r/pp2pppp/2np4/qB2Pb2/1n1P4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 8 10,"I didn't see how Black benefits from a6, nor did I see exchange as a real threat. I did see this move causing some serious harm to White's queenside, but I overlooked one saving move: O-O! Once played, all my pins and pressures against White effectively end on the spot...!"
19,Ba4,b5a4,r3kb1r/pp2pppp/2np4/q3Pb2/Bn1P4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 9 10,"-but they didn't seem to spot that one either! Worse, after that, Nd3+ becomes perfectly possible..."
20,b5,b7b5,r3kb1r/p3pppp/2np4/qp2Pb2/Bn1P4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 11,"First, I decide to bully the bishop even further."
