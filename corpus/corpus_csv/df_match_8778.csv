1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Here is a gamelet from a real-time rapidplay tournament I played in last week. My opponent and I were both on 4/4 so far - in this game someone's 100% score was going to end. The fact that my opponent was the top seed, with an ECF grade 49 points higher than mine, didn't help my optimism."
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I play my principal opening as Black, the French Defence."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Main line. White occupies the centre with a Classical Pawn Centre.
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Black's most usual response, challenging White's powerful-looking centre."
5,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,The Advance Variation of the French Defence.
6,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"An important move for Black: striking at the d-pawn. Black's overall aim in the Advance French is to target White's advanced central pawns, particularly the d-pawn, in an attempt to bring the d-pawn and then the undefended e-pawn down. 3...c5 is a good way of starting this."
7,c3,c2c3,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,White tries to solidify his advanced pawns.
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2ppP3/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,Building up the pressure on White's central pawns.
9,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2ppP3/3P4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,Countering Black's previous move.
10,Qb6,d8b6,r1b1kbnr/pp3ppp/1qn1p3/2ppP3/3P4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 3 6,Another attack on the d-pawn.
11,Bd3,f1d3,r1b1kbnr/pp3ppp/1qn1p3/2ppP3/3P4/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 4 6,"Before this move, I was planning Nge7 followed by Nf5 to bring up another attack on the d-pawn. However, now my inexperience really shows. Surely, I thought at this moment, this move blocks White's queen's defence of the d-pawn and loses that pawn! This would enable me to very quickly bring down White's over-extended central pawns, and win one into the bargain! I felt immense euphoria at being the beneficiary of such an error by a person rated 49 points above me.

However, I see you more experienced players looking on this position and shaking your heads with a knowing smile. You know what I have missed...as did I a few moves later."
12,cxd4,c5d4,r1b1kbnr/pp3ppp/1qn1p3/3pP3/3p4/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"Proceeding with my ""brilliant"" idea."

This was when the cold claw of fear gripped my heart. Maybe, just maybe, the top seed had noticed something I hadn't?"
15,Nxd4,f3d4,r1b1kbnr/pp3ppp/1q2p3/3pP3/3N4/3B4/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,"Snap snap snap. I have won a pawn! My opponent, younger than me, was looking at this position with a supreme poker-face.

17,Bb5+,d3b5,r1b1kbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/1B1pP3/3q4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 9,"With this eye-popping move, my opponent expressionlessly wins my queen. I didn't want to continue this game any more. I resigned on the spot. I could feel my face going through an interesting selection of pastel colours, as I gazed upon what is without a doubt the most embarassing moment of my chess career. Go on, readers, feel free to call me a complete idiot! The more comments you post the less likely it is that I will fall into this trap again!"
