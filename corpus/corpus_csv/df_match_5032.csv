1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was my first ever ""official"" OTB game. There were plenty of signs around my neck telling everbody I was a beginner - I kept forgetting to hit the clock after my moves, would often need to look at my opponents notation because I hadn't recorded the last few moves etc... It maybe wasn't the highest quality game, but I'm sure it has some instructive value it it somewhere."

8,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bqkb1r/pppn1ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 4 5,"Bolstering the d pawn and opening a line for the LSB. 5.Bg5 or 5.Bf4 seem like alternatives to prevent the DSB from being impeded, and may be better."

10,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/pppnbppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,Some time after I played this move I wondered if Bd3 may have been better. I think after this move may have been the first time I remembered to hit the clock!

12,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pppnbppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 3 7,At this point the game seems to be fairly balanced. It was about here where I thought I would have preferred White's LSB to be sitting at d3.
13,O-O,e1g1,r1bq1rk1/pppnbppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 4 7,At this point the game seems to be fairly balanced. It was about here where I thought I would have preferred White's LSB to be sitting at d3.

16,Bb7,c8b7,r2q1rk1/pbpnbppp/1p2pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N1PN2/PPQ1BPPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 2 9,A nice diagonal for black. Threatening 9... dxc4 (if 10.Bxd4 then ...Bxf3 11.gxf3 and white's king is not looking very secure).
17,Ne5,f3e5,r2q1rk1/pbpnbppp/1p2pn2/3pN3/2PP4/2N1P3/PPQ1BPPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 3 9,Avoiding the previously mentioned line. I think the exchange here is fine.

21,Bd3,e2d3,r2q1rk1/pbp1bppp/1p2p3/3pP3/2P1n3/2NBP3/PPQ2PPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 2 11,"I'd be interested to know if stronger players would have considered this move. Looking through the knight at e4 to take the h pawn with check. Black can avoid this, but his position doest look as sound after 12.Nxe4 dxe4 13.Bxe4 Bxe4 14.Qxe4 etc (not to mention the pawn that would be dropped) to be honest, this is the first time in the game where I have actually had a plan other than ""develop your pieces and try not to blunder""."
