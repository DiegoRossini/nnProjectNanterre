13,Bxf7+,c4f7,rn1qkb1r/pp2pBpp/8/2p3N1/4pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 7,This is the best move for white. Nxf7 would be wrong because of Qd4
14,Kd7,e8d7,rn1q1b1r/pp1kpBpp/8/2p3N1/4pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 1 8,There are perhaps two options Ke8 or Kc6. I chose Kc6 since it seems to be the most popular reply.
15,Be6+,f7e6,rn1q1b1r/pp1kp1pp/4B3/2p3N1/4pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 2 8,There are perhaps two options Ke8 or Kc6. I chose Kc6 since it seems to be the most popular reply.
16,Kc6,d7c6,rn1q1b1r/pp2p1pp/2k1B3/2p3N1/4pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 3 9,White recovers material for his queen.
17,Bxg4,e6g4,rn1q1b1r/pp2p1pp/2k5/2p3N1/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 0 9,White recovers material for his queen.
18,e5,e7e5,rn1q1b1r/pp4pp/2k5/2p1p1N1/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 0 10,There are two options for black to activate his bishop. e6 and e5 both seem quite common. White would lose his knight if he captured the e5 pawn. If the pawn were on e6 instead Nxe6 would be a mistake because of Qh4+.
19,Nf7,g5f7,rn1q1b1r/pp3Npp/2k5/2p1p3/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 1 10,Perhaps Qh4+ then exf4 would have been better. Qxg4 would be a mistake because of Nxe5+ forking king and queen.
20,Qf6,d8f6,rn3b1r/pp3Npp/2k2q2/2p1p3/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 2 11,Perhaps Qh4+ then exf4 would have been better. Qxg4 would be a mistake because of Nxe5+ forking king and queen.
21,Nxe5+,f7e5,rn3b1r/pp4pp/2k2q2/2p1N3/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 0 11,Perhaps Kd6 followed by Qxf4 is better.
22,Kc7,c6c7,rn3b1r/ppk3pp/5q2/2p1N3/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 1 12,Leaving the king where it is leads to Nd5+ losing the queen. Moving the king to b6 also leads to the knight moving to the same square. Moving to d6 now loses to Nxe4+
23,Nc3,b1c3,rn3b1r/ppk3pp/5q2/2p1N3/4pPB1/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 2 12,Leaving the king where it is leads to Nd5+ losing the queen. Moving the king to b6 also leads to the knight moving to the same square. Moving to d6 now loses to Nxe4+
24,Kd8,c7d8,rn1k1b1r/pp4pp/5q2/2p1N3/4pPB1/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 3 13,"Moving the queen to h6 or d6 leads to a fork of the king, queen and rook by Nf7+ There are no safe places for the queen. Qa6 stops immediate capture."
25,Nd5,c3d5,rn1k1b1r/pp4pp/5q2/2pNN3/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 4 13,"Moving the queen to h6 or d6 leads to a fork of the king, queen and rook by Nf7+ There are no safe places for the queen. Qa6 stops immediate capture."

27,Nf7+,e5f7,rn1k1b1r/pp3Npp/q7/2pN4/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 6 14,15.Nc7+ Kxf7 16.Nxa6 Nxa6. This is the line I expected. However white has other ideas. He can win my rook and lose nothing.

29,Nxh8,f7h8,rn2kb1N/pp4pp/q7/2pN4/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 0 15,Qxe6 would be a mistake because of Nc7+ so I develop a piece instead.
30,Qd6,a6d6,rn2kb1N/pp4pp/3q4/2pN4/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 1 16,Qxe6 would be a mistake because of Nc7+ so I develop a piece instead.

32,Na6,b8a6,r3kb1N/pp4pp/n2qB3/2pN4/4pP2/8/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 3 17,The bishop is no longer protected so white plays f5.

34,Nc7,a6c7,r3kb1N/ppn3pp/3qB3/2pN1P2/4p3/8/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 1 18,The game is already over I can't think of a better move white has all the initiative.
35,Nf7,h8f7,r3kb2/ppn2Npp/3qB3/2pN1P2/4p3/8/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 2 18,No chance of avoiding the loss of the queen. White is simplfying in order to increase his material advantage.
