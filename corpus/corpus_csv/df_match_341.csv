1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"One of those games which are lovely to play. White's king goes for a little walk, encouraged by the offer of a pawn and then a bishop, both of which he accepts and white resigns rather than get mated on move 20. Of course afterwards Fritz tells me how I could have done it quicker!"
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,I play my usual.
3,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/6B1/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 2 2,"Trompovsky attack (Ruth, Opovcensky opening) (A45) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trompowsky_Attack"
4,Ne4,f6e4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/6B1/3Pn3/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 3 3,"Although generally it is not a good idea to move pieces twice in the opening, here it is justified, as there is the attack on the bishop."
5,Bh4,g5h4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/8/3Pn2B/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 4 3,So the Bishop moves.
6,g5,g7g5,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/8/6p1/3Pn2B/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Hitting the bishop again.
7,Bg3,h4g3,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/8/6p1/3Pn3/6B1/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,"He retreats, although 4. f3 is more commonly played and scored better."
8,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppp1p/8/2p3p1/3Pn3/6B1/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,Attacking his centre.
9,f3,f2f3,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppp1p/8/2p3p1/3Pn3/5PB1/PPP1P1PP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,Attacking my knight.
10,Nxg3,e4g3,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppp1p/8/2p3p1/3P4/5Pn1/PPP1P1PP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,So I take.
11,hxg3,h2g3,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppp1p/8/2p3p1/3P4/5PP1/PPP1P1P1/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,He takes back.
12,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/pp1pppbp/8/2p3p1/3P4/5PP1/PPP1P1P1/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 1 7,I attack d4 again.
13,c3,c2c3,rnbqk2r/pp1pppbp/8/2p3p1/3P4/2P2PP1/PP2P1P1/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 7,He protects.
14,Qc7,d8c7,rnb1k2r/ppqpppbp/8/2p3p1/3P4/2P2PP1/PP2P1P1/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 1 8,Protecting c5 and attacking g3. Qb6 is strong here too.
15,Kf2,e1f2,rnb1k2r/ppqpppbp/8/2p3p1/3P4/2P2PP1/PP2PKP1/RN1Q1BNR b kq - 2 8,So he protects g3.
16,cxd4,c5d4,rnb1k2r/ppqpppbp/8/6p1/3p4/2P2PP1/PP2PKP1/RN1Q1BNR w kq - 0 9,I decided to open the position for my bishops.
17,cxd4,c3d4,rnb1k2r/ppqpppbp/8/6p1/3P4/5PP1/PP2PKP1/RN1Q1BNR b kq - 0 9,He takes back.

19,e3,e2e3,rnb1k2r/ppqp1pbp/8/4p1p1/3P4/4PPP1/PP3KP1/RN1Q1BNR b kq - 0 10,I think 10. d5 e4 11. fxe4 Bxb2 12.	Nd2 Bxa1 13. Qxa1 O-O is probably a better attempt by white - he has a pawn as compensation for being the exchange down. As played he gets torn apart.
20,exd4,e5d4,rnb1k2r/ppqp1pbp/8/6p1/3p4/4PPP1/PP3KP1/RN1Q1BNR w kq - 0 11,So opening it up more.
