1,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

I had another game with a long-standing nemisis known as The Dentist.  Do not be fooled by his current rating.  He reached an optimum of over 1400 and I still maintain he is capable of getting to 1500 were it not for the fact that he regularly visits Vietnam which may not have a good internet connection and therefore he has suffered a lot of timeouts.  Make no mistake, at the top of his game he is a serious threat and I have had one loss, a few low draws and several near misses against him - that is why I play against him unrated.  Just have a look at my annotations, ""In the Dentist's Chair and The Dentist has his Day to see why.  Thankfully since the loss I had against him, I have hardly allowed him to breathe and I just hope I can continue to crush him like I did in this game.  Here is how it happened: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17550343&rnd=0.45702334734048733.  I decided to deviate from my normal e4 and play something else.  This is f4 known as The Bird's Opening."

I am thinking about Concordborn's Sicilian MT in which I used a4 as a pawn break to beat Concordborn (Matthew).  I eventually got a decisive passed pawn on the a column and eventually went on to win the exchange.  Maybe I could utilise that plan in this game to good effect.
