1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"King's pawn game, Patzer opening.

I don't like this opening, as black can develop his pieces while chasing the white queen around the board.  It is useful against rank amateurs, who might respond with Pg6, thus losing the rook and pawn."
