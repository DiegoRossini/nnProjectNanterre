1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The game begins with a King pawn opening, where tactics can develop quickly for both sides."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Black chooses a Sicilian, an opening that provides the most fight to the move [1.e4]."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,This is the mainline of the Sicilian Opening.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,This has been a preference of mine lately. I like the center control provided by the knight and it also provides a shield against a future [Bf1-b5].
5,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,"This is a variation of the Sicilian, of which I do not know the name. I would call it a 3.Bc4 Sicilian. To me it looks like it will turn to an open Sicilian where the center opens up through pawn exchanges."
6,e6,e7e6,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,I choose a Paulsen pawn formation which has served me well against this type of opening. The text move has the advantage of blocking the bishop pressure at f7 and controlling d5 so that the b1 knight can not be developed there later.
7,g3,g2g3,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/2B1P3/5NP1/PPPP1P1P/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,"The text move is not good for white because it provides no benefits, but it does weaken the pawn structure king-side. A better idea is to play [4.0-0] instead, which if played then there is no worry about black playing [4...Qg5] to attack the g2 pawn. Normally the pawn is defended while the bishop remains at f1, but since the bishop has been committed to c4, protection of the g2 pawn must be considered. Notice how moving the g pawn also affects the knight at f3 which now must be protected, which keeps the queen tied to this duty, which takes away queen mobility."
8,Na5,c6a5,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/n1p5/2B1P3/5NP1/PPPP1P1P/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 5,"This is a move I tend to play against the bishop in this opening. The obvious idea is to exchange by NxB to obtain the bishop advantage (having both bishops, while the opponent does not). A small positional advantage can be obtained if white plays [5.Be2] due to the cramped position for white, and a tempo is gained because after the bishop retreat it is black who plays with the initiative - which allows black another move towards catching up in development."
9,d3,d2d3,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/n1p5/2B1P3/3P1NP1/PPP2P1P/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"Supporting the bishop, but allowing the exchange."
10,Nxc4,a5c4,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/2n1P3/3P1NP1/PPP2P1P/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,Black gains the bishop advantage with this move and will seek to exchange pawns later so the bishops can become more active.
11,dxc4,d3c4,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/2P1P3/5NP1/PPP2P1P/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,This pawn formation creates a sort of bind for black who has to work to remove the bind at some point.
12,d6,d7d6,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/3pp3/2p5/2P1P3/5NP1/PPP2P1P/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"This move serves many purposes: to keep the knight from developing to e5, to allow [...Ng8-f6] by protecting against [e4-e5], to protect the c5 pawn, and to obtain a little more space. The d7 pawn when left in place can be constrictive and may allow some successful knight attacks by white."
13,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/3pp3/2p5/2P1P3/5NP1/PPP2P1P/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 7,"Now white just needs to develop 3 pieces from the back rank (Q,B,N) for complete development. Black needs to develop (0-0,N,B,Q,B), and so must make each move count for the following moves."
14,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk1nr/pp2bppp/3pp3/2p5/2P1P3/5NP1/PPP2P1P/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 8,The text move is played to prevent the immediate [8.Bg5] which if played next would lose a piece for white [8.Bg5 Bxg5  9.Nxg5 Qxg5  10.Qxd6 Qe7]. So white must choose another move.
15,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqk1nr/pp2bppp/3pp3/2p5/2P1P3/2N2NP1/PPP2P1P/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 3 8,A good developing move.
16,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/3ppn2/2p5/2P1P3/2N2NP1/PPP2P1P/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 4 9,"Now [9.Bg5] is possible without losing a piece, but the text move is necessary so that black can castle and complete development. Black by playing the order bishop, then knight, is able to castle first without having to deal with any possible [BxN] exchange. Note that developing the bishop before knight is possible only because white can not play [Qd1-g4] to attack the g7 pawn - due to the knight blocking the queen line."
17,e5,e4e5,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/3ppn2/2p1P3/2P5/2N2NP1/PPP2P1P/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 9,An attacking move which does not look bad because after [9...dxe5  10.Nxe5] there is some pressure on the black position. The downside of this move is that after an exchange some central control is given up by white.
18,dxe5,d6e5,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/4pn2/2p1p3/2P5/2N2NP1/PPP2P1P/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 10,Notice there is no danger in a queen exchange for black because the queen is guarded by the bishop.
19,Nxe5,f3e5,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/4pn2/2p1N3/2P5/2N3P1/PPP2P1P/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 10,Notice there is no danger in a queen exchange for black because the queen is guarded by the bishop.
20,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/4pn2/2p1N3/2P5/2N3P1/PPP2P1P/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 11,"Black continues the plan for development. The position is about equal, with the difference of the open pawn structure for the white castle. Its not something that can be taken advantage of easily by black after the queen exchange, so white is okay."
21,Qxd8,d1d8,r1bQ1rk1/pp2bppp/4pn2/2p1N3/2P5/2N3P1/PPP2P1P/R1B2RK1 b - - 0 11,"Before the queen exchange material was even from a point count, but every exchange should start to favor black eventually because of having the bishop advantage. Better was [11.Qe2] to move the queen off the back rank and continue development, and to control the squares (e4,g4) to keep them from the f6 knight."
