1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hello all; just a quick blitz game that I found enjoyable. White sets up a formidable center and a complex-looking position develops. White has a lot of space to work with, but his position has weaknesses as a result of all his pawn advances, while Black is a little cramped, but solid. As is so often the case in blitz, time pressure eventually forces a hasty computation in a sharp position, leading to a fatal miscalculation. Enjoy!"
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"?! This is not any standard line I know of. More common are 2.Nf3 or 2.Nc3. With this move, White announces in no uncertain terms his desire to utterly control the center (and foreshadows a propensity for pawn-pushing)."

Both players have so far badly neglected their development, but White has a significant advantage in space, and very solid center control."

Better would be a more cohesive plan of attack, ideally utilizing the powerful White center pawns by castling and preparing e4-e5, rather than just pushing and pushing with no clear goal. Every pawn move White makes creates another weakness."

This move probably indicates that White is planning to push through the center, as he begins clearing the e-file for a Rook and allowing this Bishop to make its way over to g3 if needed."
