2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,allowing black to take free rein at my pawn on e4.
3,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,allowing black to take free rein at my pawn on e4.
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,allowing black to take free rein at my pawn on e4.

6,dxe4,d5e4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/4pP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,But prehaps I can win it back?
7,Ng5,f3g5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/6N1/4pP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,But prehaps I can win it back?
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/6N1/4pP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,Alas no.
9,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/6N1/2B1pP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 5,So I eye down f7.
10,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/6N1/2B1pPb1/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 6,One would think the only way to save the queen was to play Be2. But the beauty of this opening is it doesn't need the queen.
11,Qxg4,d1g4,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/6N1/2B1pPQ1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 6,Qxg4! so now we are underway. The psychological value of this move is not the only advantage to it. It is actually a very sound opening.
12,Nxg4,f6g4,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p5/6N1/2B1pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 7,Only square.
13,Bxf7+,c4f7,rn1qkb1r/pp2pBpp/2p5/6N1/4pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 7,Only square.
14,Kd7,e8d7,rn1q1b1r/pp1kpBpp/2p5/6N1/4pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 1 8,Only square.
15,Be6+,f7e6,rn1q1b1r/pp1kp1pp/2p1B3/6N1/4pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 2 8,"Ke8 would invite a draw by repetition. This being the point of the opening, white gets two pieces for the queen, better piece coordination, the chance to create a bind on black as well as great intuitive and development."
16,Kc7,d7c7,rn1q1b1r/ppk1p1pp/2p1B3/6N1/4pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 3 9,The beauty about the pawn being on c6 instead of c5 is that black needs to waste an extra tempo moving either his queen or king to avoid the queen/king fork.
17,Bxg4,e6g4,rn1q1b1r/ppk1p1pp/2p5/6N1/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 0 9,Black looks to prevent the fork at f7. Black doesn't realise I was never interested in Nf7.
18,Qe8,d8e8,rn2qb1r/ppk1p1pp/2p5/6N1/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 1 10,Black looks to prevent the fork at f7. Black doesn't realise I was never interested in Nf7.
19,Ne6+,g5e6,rn2qb1r/ppk1p1pp/2p1N3/8/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 2 10,The idea being to create a bind on blacks position by closing lines and preventing development.
20,Kb6,c7b6,rn2qb1r/pp2p1pp/1kp1N3/8/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 3 11,It's pretty cool that even though white has gambited his queen he is still able to play such defensive moves as these.
21,Nc3,b1c3,rn2qb1r/pp2p1pp/1kp1N3/8/4pPB1/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 4 11,It's pretty cool that even though white has gambited his queen he is still able to play such defensive moves as these.
22,Na6,b8a6,r3qb1r/pp2p1pp/nkp1N3/8/4pPB1/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 5 12,It's pretty cool that even though white has gambited his queen he is still able to play such defensive moves as these.
23,a3,a2a3,r3qb1r/pp2p1pp/nkp1N3/8/4pPB1/P1N5/1PPP2PP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 0 12,It's pretty cool that even though white has gambited his queen he is still able to play such defensive moves as these.
24,Qg6,e8g6,r4b1r/pp2p1pp/nkp1N1q1/8/4pPB1/P1N5/1PPP2PP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 1 13,All there is really.
25,Bh3,g4h3,r4b1r/pp2p1pp/nkp1N1q1/8/4pP2/P1N4B/1PPP2PP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 2 13,All there is really.
26,Nc5,a6c5,r4b1r/pp2p1pp/1kp1N1q1/2n5/4pP2/P1N4B/1PPP2PP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 3 14,Forcing me to trade knights and thus nullify my attack.
27,Nxc5,e6c5,r4b1r/pp2p1pp/1kp3q1/2N5/4pP2/P1N4B/1PPP2PP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 0 14,"f5! this may block the h3-c8 diagonal but it forces the queen to a more passive spot. Note that of all the squares available to black the queen is only safe on h5, f7 and e8 since any other square either loses the queen to a royal fork or a discovered attack."
28,Kxc5,b6c5,r4b1r/pp2p1pp/2p3q1/2k5/4pP2/P1N4B/1PPP2PP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 0 15,"f5! this may block the h3-c8 diagonal but it forces the queen to a more passive spot.

30,Qe8,g6e8,r3qb1r/pp2p1pp/2p5/2k2P2/4p3/P1N4B/1PPP2PP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 1 16,Taking the pawn with tempo.
31,Nxe4+,c3e4,r3qb1r/pp2p1pp/2p5/2k2P2/4N3/P6B/1PPP2PP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 0 16,Taking the pawn with tempo.
32,Kb6,c5b6,r3qb1r/pp2p1pp/1kp5/5P2/4N3/P6B/1PPP2PP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 1 17,I need to open lines for my bishop and this seemed a little more solid than d4.
33,d3,d2d3,r3qb1r/pp2p1pp/1kp5/5P2/4N3/P2P3B/1PP3PP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 0 17,I need to open lines for my bishop and this seemed a little more solid than d4.
34,e6,e7e6,r3qb1r/pp4pp/1kp1p3/5P2/4N3/P2P3B/1PP3PP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 0 18,? this was done to open lines for the bishop but the free protected passed pawn this creates is just too powerful.
35,fxe6,f5e6,r3qb1r/pp4pp/1kp1P3/8/4N3/P2P3B/1PP3PP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 0 18,Black is looking to trade pieces so that I will have no attack and his material advantage will be bigger.  Little does he know that one of the strategies of this opening is that white looks for any chance to trade knights for bishops.
