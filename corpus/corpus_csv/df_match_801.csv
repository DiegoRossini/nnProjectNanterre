1,b3,b2b3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Larsen opening, that I have played (but not mastered) a couple of times, but never with black."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"...and yet, I go for the risky e4, will have this pen pinned if not taking care of it properly. There is nothing wrong with it, but d4 is more relaxing, although it leaves the a1-h8 diagonal for the WB."
3,Bb2,c1b2,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/1P6/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"Nc6 is also normal here. Then white goes for e3 and then Bb5 pinning the defending N. It seems to me 2...d6 is weaker, as the white contested to it, but maybe I just played a horrible defence (most likely)"
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/8/1P6/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Nc6 is also normal here. Then white goes for e3 and then Bb5 pinning the defending N. It seems to me 2...d6 is weaker, as the white contested to it, but maybe I just played a horrible defence (most likely)"
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/3P4/1P6/PBP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"Now if 3...exd4; 4.Bxd4, Nc6 Black seems to be alright to me. In case of 4.Nf3, Nc6 same story."
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/3P4/1P6/PBP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"And I realized of the compromised situation after this move. So much for an ""experienced"" (limited) Larsen player of me."
7,dxe5,d4e5,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4P3/8/1P6/PBP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"At least, I get rid of the WB... if any compensation is to be gotten here."
8,Nxe5,c6e5,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4n3/8/1P6/PBP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"At least, I get rid of the WB... if any compensation is to be gotten here."
9,Bxe5,b2e5,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4B3/8/1P6/P1P1PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"At least, I get rid of the WB... if any compensation is to be gotten here."

11,Qxd8+,d1d8,r1bQkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4p3/8/1P6/P1P1PPPP/RN2KBNR b KQkq - 0 6,Also 7.Nf3 seems interesting (going for Ng5 when ready)
12,Kxd8,e8d8,r1bk1bnr/ppp2ppp/8/4p3/8/1P6/P1P1PPPP/RN2KBNR w KQ - 0 7,Also 7.Nf3 seems interesting (going for Ng5 when ready)
13,Nd2,b1d2,r1bk1bnr/ppp2ppp/8/4p3/8/1P6/P1PNPPPP/R3KBNR b KQ - 1 7,Also 7.Nf3 seems interesting (going for Ng5 when ready)
14,Bb4,f8b4,r1bk2nr/ppp2ppp/8/4p3/1b6/1P6/P1PNPPPP/R3KBNR w KQ - 2 8,"Blocking my expected square for my N, since I had in mind to defend e5 with f6, but it is far more active than leaving the BK on the 8th row."
15,O-O-O,e1c1,r1bk2nr/ppp2ppp/8/4p3/1b6/1P6/P1PNPPPP/2KR1BNR b - - 3 8,"Blocking my expected square for my N, since I had in mind to defend e5 with f6, but it is far more active than leaving the BK on the 8th row."

17,Ngf3,g1f3,r1b3nr/ppp1kppp/8/4p3/1b6/1P3N2/P1PNPPPP/2KR1B1R b - - 5 9,"As I said. White has a slight (or not that slight) advantage in development, but black has the pair of Bishops and an interesting attack on the WB castling."
18,f6,f7f6,r1b3nr/ppp1k1pp/5p2/4p3/1b6/1P3N2/P1PNPPPP/2KR1B1R w - - 0 10,"As I said. White has a slight (or not that slight) advantage in development, but black has the pair of Bishops and an interesting attack on the WB castling."

20,Nh6,g8h6,r1b4r/ppp1k1pp/5p1n/4p3/1b6/1P3NP1/P1PNPP1P/2KR1B1R w - - 1 11,"I can always faint the Ng4 here if needed, but doesn't lead to anything. Hope white does pay more attention to the jumper than it deserves."
21,Bg2,f1g2,r1b4r/ppp1k1pp/5p1n/4p3/1b6/1P3NP1/P1PNPPBP/2KR3R b - - 2 11,"Leaving the mentioned b7 undefended, but it seems alright so far. And yet, it really mad me feel it compromised black's attack because of the threats on that diagonal. but I must find compensation for my disadvantage and start attacking. Maybe 11...Bh3+ prior Be6 was better."

24,a5,a7a5,r6r/1pp1k1pp/4bp1n/p3p3/1b2N3/1P3NP1/P1P1PPBP/2KR3R w - - 0 13,Chaaarge!!

But it is an interesting position. I'd love some feedback from you , people. What do you see for Black? Can a victory be achieved somehow here?"
