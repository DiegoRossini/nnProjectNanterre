1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,at the beginning of the game my oponent was 100 ELO rating higher than me. i think it was around 1352~ for me 1480~ for him
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,please comment on my style of opening with the sicilian. i know i do not follow the proper lines but we all learn as we go.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2P1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,in games where white doesnt respond with Nf3 makes for my style to be easier. as i like to use the black bishop to defend e4  and i like to keep my d6 move to when the oponent moves out their black bishop.  please comment if this is bad :D im still learning much. and depending on if my oponents play d4 early i would rather they take dxc5 and open their middle if they are aggressive if not set up for king side attack is this good thinking?
