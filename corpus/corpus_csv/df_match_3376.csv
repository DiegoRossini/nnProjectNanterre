1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Basic e4 opening, the same opening I've played thousands of times before."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,Stalhandske replies with Alekhine's Defence... I am fairly familiar with this defense because I've played it pretty often myself.  This game was one of the first times I faced it with white and I was determined not to allow my pawns over extended in the center of the board...
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 2,I choose the Scandinavian Variation.  Just a simple statement letting my far superior opponent know early that I am not taking the bait and would rather develop my own pieces at my own pace.
4,e5,e7e5,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"I now have a Halloween Gambit transposition in my mind.  I figured I needed to make bold moves to take my opponent out of his comfort zone, of course taking him out of his comfort zone won't make him as uncomfortable as I am, and I'm aware of that at this stage of the game."
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"I now have a Halloween Gambit transposition in my mind.

6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,"He responds accordingly and we now have our third variation of the match, the Four Knights Game."
7,Nxe5,f3e5,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4N3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"And I take.  GK database always lists this as a mistake, but I've had several opponents blunder away winning positions all the way up to the end game when I've used this approach, it's like it is cursed for black!"
8,Nxe5,c6e5,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4n3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"He takes, and this Walk the Walk game has seen four different possible openings in the first four moves.  Is this incredible?  Quien Sabe?  But what I can say is you know the game isn't going well for you when you're proud of your transposition skills rather than your game play.  At least I took his Alekhine's Defence and turned it into what I wanted to play, right?"
9,d4,d2d4,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4n3/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,Or did I?  In the end his original ploy was to get me to stretch my pawns thin...
10,Ng6,e5g6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5nn1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,"Which, of course, I do... and in the process I handed over a knight in exchange for a pawn.  Can I get a mulligan?"
11,e5,e4e5,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5nn1/4P3/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"Which, of course, I do... and in the process I handed over a knight in exchange for a pawn.  Can I get a mulligan?"
12,Ng8,f6g8,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/6n1/4P3/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,Attempting to dominate the center.  A better move here might have been to develop my King's Bishop.  20/20 hindsight...
13,f4,f2f4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/6n1/4P3/3P1P2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,Attempting to dominate the center.  A better move here might have been to develop my King's Bishop.  20/20 hindsight...
14,d6,d7d6,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p2n1/4P3/3P1P2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,Staking a claim of his own...
15,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p2n1/4P3/2BP1P2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 8,"On second thought, maybe not.  My e-pawn did need an extra defender and using the Queen's Bishop to do so would have hindered development.  I think I out thunk myself."
16,dxe5,d6e5,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/6n1/4p3/2BP1P2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,"Simply recapturing, the thing about trying to gain an advantage by giving up material is you can't afford to lose any more."
17,fxe5,f4e5,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/6n1/4P3/2BP4/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 9,"Simply recapturing, the thing about trying to gain an advantage by giving up material is you can't afford to lose any more."
18,Nxe5,g6e5,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4n3/2BP4/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 10,"A gift?  Perhaps he pitied me and tried to cut me some slack?  Doubtful.  At this point he's like a shark that smells blood, only I haven't yet realized I'm bleeding..."
19,dxe5,d4e5,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/2B5/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 10,"I am now praying for a monumental blunder on his part.  Any time you find yourself praying, you're in trouble.  If he messes up here, say for instance going 10. ... f6, I can then play 11. Bf5+ Kxf5 and 12. Qxd8.  The only problem is that I'm not playing someone rated 1350 or so, unfortunately that is a BIG problem and I'm hinging to much hope on mistakes..."
20,Qh4+,d8h4,r1b1kbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/2B4q/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 11,See what I mean? The beginning of the end.
21,g3,g2g3,r1b1kbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/2B4q/2N3P1/PPP4P/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 11,"I realized my Bishop was hanging, it was really a solid move by Stalhandske, he has a tremendous advantage now and I cleared out all the center pawns for him, thus saving him the middle game work the Alekhine usually requires."
22,Qxc4,h4c4,r1b1kbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/2q5/2N3P1/PPP4P/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 12,En prise.
23,Bd2,c1d2,r1b1kbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/2q5/2N3P1/PPPB3P/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 12,Trying to clean house for an emergency O-O-O!!!
24,Bg4,c8g4,r3kbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/2q3b1/2N3P1/PPPB3P/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 13,"Whoop!  Hold it right there!  ""Ok"" I say, meekly."
