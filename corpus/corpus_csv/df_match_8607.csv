1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Hi everyone!  Does anybody get a sinking feeling when you think you have a lost game.  You wave the white flag and in a post-match analysis with your opponent he tells you there was a way out and when he does it seems so bally patently obvious.  Here is an old game against Coach Ion that only now can I bring myself to annotate it.  I play the Nimsovich-Rossilimo Attack of the Sicilian but guess who ends up on the defensive .........
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,3. Bb5+ - this is the start of the Nimzovich-Rossilimo Attack - this is about as aggressive as I get!
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,3. Bb5+ - this is the start of the Nimzovich-Rossilimo Attack - this is about as aggressive as I get!
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,3. Bb5+ - this is the start of the Nimzovich-Rossilimo Attack - this is about as aggressive as I get!
5,Bb5+,f1b5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 3,3. Bb5+ - this is the start of the Nimzovich-Rossilimo Attack - this is about as aggressive as I get!
