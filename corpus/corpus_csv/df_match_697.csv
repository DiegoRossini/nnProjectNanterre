1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This was a training game between me and hfsdo. Any constructive criticism to myself or my opponent is welcomed.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I like the originality of this opening, but as a beginner I would encourage following development rules until they become natural (i.e developing, center control, and king safety). This choice hinders development slightly as white now has to make more moves to fully develop his pieces."

4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/3B4/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 3,I am quite fond of playing g6 sicilians because I found that defending the king and developing are generally easier in these variations.

7,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/2p5/4P3/3B1N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 4,"Quickly getting the king to safety is important, and white has done a nice job of that so far."
8,Bg7,f8g7,r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/2p5/4P3/3B1N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 5,"This move misses the point of the opening. White's best intentions would have been to play c3 so that the bishop can back up to c2 and white would also get a chance to open up the center with the move d4. With this move, it is going to be difficult to mobilize the c and d pawns so that white can attack the center."

10,d6,d7d6,r1bqk1nr/pp2ppbp/2np2p1/2p5/4P3/2NB1N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 6,This move stops and pawn push to e5 ideas so that my knight can get to f6.
11,b3,b2b3,r1bqk1nr/pp2ppbp/2np2p1/2p5/4P3/1PNB1N2/P1PP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 6,"A very smart way to develop the dark squared bishop. However, white must be tactically aware since the g7 bishop may cause problems."
12,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/2p5/4P3/1PNB1N2/P1PP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 1 7,"White has played a fine opening so far. It may not be orthodox, but both sides still have several good ideas in the position."
13,Bb2,c1b2,r1bqk2r/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/2p5/4P3/1PNB1N2/PBPP1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 2 7,"White has played a fine opening so far. It may not be orthodox, but both sides still have several good ideas in the position."

15,Bb5,d3b5,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/1Bp5/4P3/1PN2N2/PBPP1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 4 8,"? I actually like what white was trying to do here. Trading bishop for knight may have been quite useful for white in order to try and open up the center with and e5 push. However, this move drops a pawn because of the pin on the c3 knight."
16,Nxe4,f6e4,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np2p1/1Bp5/4n3/1PN2N2/PBPP1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 9,"Before moving, it is important to try and identify the forcing responses (captures,checks) by the opponent that could end up winning losing material. Blunder checking every move will dramatically reduce these types of oversights."
17,d3,d2d3,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np2p1/1Bp5/4n3/1PNP1N2/PBP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 9,"?? Losing a pawn was not the end of the world, but this is. Another unfortunate oversight that now drops a piece."
18,Nxc3,e4c3,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np2p1/1Bp5/8/1PnP1N2/PBP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 10,"It is always smart to play on, even when down a piece. An opponent could very easily be caught off guard and make their own blunders."

25,a4,a2a4,r2q1rk1/p3pp1p/2pp2p1/2p5/P5b1/1PbP1N2/2P2PPP/1R1Q1RK1 b - - 0 13,It is tough to find a good move for white. Probably h3 was best just to try and get to kick the bishop and try to activate the queen and knights.
