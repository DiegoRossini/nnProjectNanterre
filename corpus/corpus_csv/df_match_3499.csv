1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This has fallen out of fashion a while ago because it theoretically allows black to equalize immediately with the tal gambit by 2...d5 however I had a specific variation in mind

4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,The opening begins with this strange looking gambit. I guess it could be something of reversed Budapest in which white has used the extra tempo to play f2-f4 and it is unclear weather this helps or hurts whites cause

11,Qxg4,d1g4,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2p3N1/2B1pPQ1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 6,"Though this may appear quite extraordinary for those who have not seen this particular line before I can say that this position has Infact been seen many a time before especially here on gameknot. Although there is still plenty of speculation As to the soundness of this sacrifice i can say my personal opinion is that it is sound and perfectly playable, providing white with adequate compensation for the queen,as well I know that quite a few other people who have done some work into this line have also attested to the general soundness of the queen sac. Actually this is probably whites most accurate move so far this game"

There are several possibilities at this point, though I feel that this may be the best bet for black, at this point we are still well within established theory"

The beauty of this gambit is that is that whites strategy is not usually about launching a fierce attack against the centre strewn king but instead white usually aims to restrict blacks pieces, especially the queen well white will look to maintain piece coordination. Because of this white can afford to make slow restricting moves as this one."

There were a number of principles developed for these types of positions, and one of those principles is that given the chance white should look for opportunities to exchange a knight for bishop, and here is a perfect opportunity to do so."

Having said that 16...Qe4+ 17.Kh1 g5 does give black very annoying unitive which is not something that white wants to allow, so maybe this is alright"
