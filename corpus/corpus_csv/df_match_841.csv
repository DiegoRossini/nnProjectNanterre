2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"The bishop gives white the opening advantage, since black can't play e5 but white can play e4."

8,c6,c7c6,r1bqkb1r/pp1npppp/2pp1n2/8/3P1B2/5N2/PPPNPPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Somewhat passive. Black can play c5, and in my view he should."
