1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hello and welcome to the next game in the Benoni Defense series between ptitroque and I. After being soundly drawn in the first game where I had the White pieces, I'm on the lookout for similar traps this time around. I'll skim over the beginning, since I've covered it before, and because there's a lot to cover in this game."

According to the literature I've seen, White now ""should"" win material with 9.e5, but the path to that outcome is far from clear."
17,e5,e4e5,rn1qk2r/pp1b1pbp/3p1np1/1BpPP3/5P2/2N5/PP4PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 9,"White now has an imposing center--but it's also very overextended, and his development is lagging."

20,Nh5,f6h5,rn1qk2r/pp1b1pbp/6p1/1BpPP2n/8/2N5/PP4PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 1 11,"My opponent said that he'd also looked at playing 10...O-O?! and sacrificing the Knight, which really gets quite wild. I agree with his assessment, though, that White should be able to hold on long enough to make his material advantage in that line felt, though."
21,Nf3,g1f3,rn1qk2r/pp1b1pbp/6p1/1BpPP2n/8/2N2N2/PP4PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 11,"I looked for quite a bit at 11.g4?! At first glance, it seems like the obvious move to make, but things are always much more complicated than they appear. Just as an example, one line (of very many) that I looked at goes: 11.g4?! Qh4+! 12.Kf1 Ng3+ 13.hxg3 Qxh1 14.e6 O-O 15.exd7. I chose the text move instead because I wanted to hold onto my center pawns if possible, and because now I have the opportunity to play g2-g4 without worrying about ...Qh4+. It's not obvious now, but this Knight will actually play a critical role in White's defenses for the rest of the entire game."

I finally decided that I can make Black give up some material, albeit at significant risk to my King. With this move, I threw away any chance of a quiet game. Hold on to your hats, because things are about to get wild."

Here I considered, rather than taking the Knight, things like 14.Bg5?! f6 15.e6!? which essentially leads to a position where half the pieces on the board are hanging, all at once. I couldn't begin to calculate it fully, so I went with the ""simple"" move you see here."

29,Kf1,e1f1,r2qr1k1/pp3pbp/6p1/2pPn2P/8/2N2N2/PP5P/R1BQ1K1R b - - 1 15,Forcing Black to spend a tempo if he wants to get his Knight off the file.
30,Qf6,d8f6,r3r1k1/pp3pbp/5qp1/2pPn2P/8/2N2N2/PP5P/R1BQ1K1R w - - 2 16,"So Black pins the Knight, of course, which is now barely defensible at all, yet responsible for covering four critical squares: h4, g5, e5, and d4."
31,Kg2,f1g2,r3r1k1/pp3pbp/5qp1/2pPn2P/8/2N2N2/PP4KP/R1BQ3R b - - 3 16,"Somewhat strangely, this is probably the safest the White King has been for several moves. Let's take stock of the situation briefly.

White is up a Knight for a pawn (two pawns soon). He also has a passed isolani on the fifth rank.

Black, for his part, has superior development, more active pieces in general, and a nasty-looking attack on the exposed White King. This, folks, is anyone's game."
32,gxh5,g6h5,r3r1k1/pp3pbp/5q2/2pPn2p/8/2N2N2/PP4KP/R1BQ3R w - - 0 17,"This is a sort of ugly move, but probably necessary, as I (as White) was really hoping for a chance to play h5-h6. The text also opens the g-file for possible use by both players against the others' King."
33,Rg1,h1g1,r3r1k1/pp3pbp/5q2/2pPn2p/8/2N2N2/PP4KP/R1BQ2R1 b - - 1 17,So naturally both players get on the g-file immediately. Black just has to be careful of the possible pins and get his King to h8 as soon as possible.
34,Qg6+,f6g6,r3r1k1/pp3pbp/6q1/2pPn2p/8/2N2N2/PP4KP/R1BQ2R1 w - - 2 18,So naturally both players get on the g-file immediately. Black just has to be careful of the possible pins and get his King to h8 as soon as possible.
