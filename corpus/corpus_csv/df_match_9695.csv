6,d5,d7d5,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/1B1pp3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,"Think. If aggressive early moves like this are likely to achieve any divident, they would be part of every black defence against Ruy Lopez (your opening sequence).  If you play only Ruy Lopez, you will recognise any non standard move as odd/questionable/needs analysis straight away. As we look, we see 1. it leaves Nc6 exposed to pin 2. the N and e5 vulnerable to Nxe5 3. white is ready for 0-0 4. black needs 3 moves for 0-0"
