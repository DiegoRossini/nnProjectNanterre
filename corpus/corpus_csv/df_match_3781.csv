He can't let his bishop just sit there because I'll play Bxf5 and damage his kingside pawns. But I decided to wait for now. I'm not sure I want to capture Bxf5 until after he's captured because he'll just castle queenside and have a path down the g-file to attack my king. Or, he might move the bishop to g4, and then I'll feel pressured to retreat the B back to e2."
