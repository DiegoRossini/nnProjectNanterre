1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"My usual opening - English, if i'm not mistaken. The idea is still the same as English - controlling the d5 square and focusing on claiming the white squares early."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"A usual retort. Controlling the black squares in the middle, usually followd by either 2.. Nc6 or 2.. Bc5"
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"Still focusing on the white squares. The reason why i love this opening is because its not directly confrontational, but sort of pre-emptive"
4,Bc5,f8c5,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,Black took the 2.. Bc5 approach. Looks like the start of trying to control the centre. Restricts my usual 3.d4 move.
5,e3,e2e3,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/2P5/2N1P3/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"Backing up for 4.d4 and at the same time supporting the lone pawn on c4 with my white bishop. However, this is a very slow move as it doesn't really develop my position and ultimately restricts the movement of my Black bishop"
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/2b1p3/2P5/2N1P3/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"Black has developed quite well here. He's now ready to castle early, and now has control over the d4 square and challenging control over e4 and d5 squares."
7,d4,d2d4,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/2b1p3/2PP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"This move has a few purposes. Firstly, i am now trying to gain control over the e5 square by attacking it and then later on bring forth my knight on f3. Also, i'm now allowing some breathing space for my black bishop if 4.. exd4 5exd4 Bg5"
8,exd4,e5d4,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/2b5/2Pp4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,Can't protect with the queen cos pawn on d4 is under threat.
9,exd4,e3d4,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/2b5/2PP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,Can't protect with the queen cos pawn on d4 is under threat.
10,Qe7+,d8e7,rnb1k2r/ppppqppp/5n2/2b5/2PP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,Can't protect with the queen cos pawn on d4 is under threat.
11,Be3,c1e3,rnb1k2r/ppppqppp/5n2/2b5/2PP4/2N1B3/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 2 6,"There's a reason why i picked this move. Right now, the centre is totally controlled by my pieces. d5 and e5 has two pieces controlling it and now i have mobility to a few of my key pieces. And now d4 is not really under too much threat as it has been eliviated by the bishop"
12,Bb6,c5b6,rnb1k2r/ppppqppp/1b3n2/8/2PP4/2N1B3/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 3 7,"I'm not sure if this was a good move, but now i plan on trying to trap the bishop"
13,Rb1,a1b1,rnb1k2r/ppppqppp/1b3n2/8/2PP4/2N1B3/PP3PPP/1R1QKBNR b Kkq - 4 7,Trying for b4
14,Nc6,b8c6,r1b1k2r/ppppqppp/1bn2n2/8/2PP4/2N1B3/PP3PPP/1R1QKBNR w Kkq - 5 8,d4 is now under threat. I need to protect my king as Be3 is the active pin on my king
15,Be2,f1e2,r1b1k2r/ppppqppp/1bn2n2/8/2PP4/2N1B3/PP2BPPP/1R1QK1NR b Kkq - 6 8,"At this point, i like to analyse the position of the board once a party has castled. I usually castle when i've got close to 100% mobility of my pieces. Right now, i have a bishop at optimal point (although c5 would ruin it). My bishops are active and out. And all i need to do is mobilise my knight to Nf3"
