1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,good morning (7 am when i annotated this :D). This is an irregular annotation for me as i have been playing black about 3:1 versus playing as white. i like a classic e4 opening being more a maverick player with the nimzowitcsh defense as black.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"my oponent replies with e5.   this was the strongest opponent i was facing after an 8 month stop, and my rating had dropped to its floor."
3,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,i like my tried and true opening that works well for me. i like an early exit of the white bishop and doing king side attacks. im a fan of playing f4 and doing early castles if allowed
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 3,sometimes i like to play d3 here but being one of my first games back i was also rusty. i find that playing nc3 more effective when black replies with nf6 on move 2.  holding the d pawn back also if your oponent makes a mistake in his opening can allow for a d4 instead and an instant opening of the board and aggressive frontal assault
5,d3,d2d3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 3,sometimes i like to play d3 here but being one of my first games back i was also rusty. i find that playing nc3 more effective when black replies with nf6 on move 2.  holding the d pawn back also if your oponent makes a mistake in his opening can allow for a d4 instead and an instant opening of the board and aggressive frontal assault
6,a6,a7a6,rnbqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p4n2/4p3/2B1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 4,anticipated reply once i block my bishop out sometimes. i think d5 is a stronger move for black players here. hence why my d3 is a mistake and why i prefer nc3.
7,a3,a2a3,rnbqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p4n2/4p3/2B1P3/P2P4/1PP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 4,i want to keep my white bishop on this diagonal its always nice to have it bearing down on the f pawn
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/P2P4/1PP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 5,hmm was expecting b5 here but i guess that was too plain and this was supposed to be a higher rated opponent i was facing. i guess i dont have to retreat my bishop.
9,c3,c2c3,r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/P1PP4/1P3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,"in hindsight i shouldve maybe played f4 here, but in the games i dont play nc3 i eventually send my knight to d2 so i thought c3 would prevent his knight from coming down and wouldnt stunt any of my long term king side attack plans"
10,d5,d7d5,r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1n2n2/3pp3/2B1P3/P1PP4/1P3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,d5! the importance of nc3 show itself! i decide to swap out pawns since im planning to castle soon and have 2 lanes open
11,exd5,e4d5,r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1n2n2/3Pp3/2B5/P1PP4/1P3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 6,"hmmmmmm unanticipated reply....  this fight has just been taken to me.  . i looked at the board i had nothing developped and my oponent was about to start coming in. hiding my bishop in a2 seemed way too passive.

he could end up with 2 knights on my queen side and my weak pawn line. or he can come out with his with LSB to attack my queen and maybe double pawn or weaken my king side pawns. he can bring out his DSB to c5 for some pressure with a fork possibility in future on f2.   my game is looking weak on move 6"
12,Na5,c6a5,r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p4n2/n2Pp3/2B5/P1PP4/1P3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 7,"hmmmmmm unanticipated reply....  this fight has just been taken to me.  . i looked at the board i had nothing developped and my oponent was about to start coming in. hiding my bishop in a2 seemed way too passive.

i also believe my opponent didnt anticipate this reply because he moved how i thought he would for the next 3 moves"
14,Nxc4,a5c4,r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p4n2/3Pp3/2n5/P1PP4/1P2QPPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 0 8,"i had looked about this far into the game, 5 ish moves ahead and was thinking this looked better than playing a2 on move 6.  my future plans was to  king side castle bring my DSB to f4 bring my other knight to d2 and on with the king side attack. it seems my opponent had different plans for me"

23,h3,h2h3,r2qr1k1/1pp2ppp/p2b1n2/3PP3/2P3b1/P1P2N1P/1P2Q1P1/RNB1K2R b KQ - 0 12,"hence why trying to kick the bishop wasnt good. Bf4 wouldve also probably been better to a castling. and way better than h3

this opponent was making me think here why did he leave his LSB hanging.     if i take the LSB, DSB goes bg3+ then my queen is dead.   damn almost died here.     

im so used to being the aggressor as white this is uncharted territory for me playing on the defense.  and if i castle the same thing happens with Bh2+"

30,Rad8,a8d8,3rr1k1/1pp2ppp/p7/3qb3/6b1/P1P2N1P/1P1NQ1P1/R1BK3R w - - 2 16,"hmmm this is looking VERY dangerous to me. i looked at  hxg4 and almost fell for it again!

just before i took his LSB i took a moment to make sure his queen couldnt do much. i was looking at   hxg4 followed by his Qxd2  replied by nxd2 and Rxd2 Qxd2  this wasnt possible so it felt safe to take his LSB.

but relooking at his queen was Very essential.    The assault wasnt coming from the front.    if i go hxg4 he replies 
Qb3+ leads to  Ke1    then Bg3+ kf1 blocking in my rook. then its Rxe2   Very bad state of game

man oh man i have only 1 possible reply i think after analysing it for a while i thought this was my best move and thought it to be epic."
31,c4,c3c4,3rr1k1/1pp2ppp/p7/3qb3/2P3b1/P4N1P/1P1NQ1P1/R1BK3R b - - 0 16,"the essence of chess.  a single pawn moving a single square changing a BIG deal on an entire board. leaving his queen and LSB hanging.  i was proud of myself but i couldnt celebrate too soon this wasnt over. 

Damn my opponents had many tricks and traps up his sleeves.

i could now see my Rook in the A file was hanging and my b Pawn because of the blind attack from the rook on my queen. and i saw 0 replies.

the thing i had in my favor was his 2 hanging pieces to maybe help me gain time."
