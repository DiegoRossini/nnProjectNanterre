Nf3 d6, the queen knight is often developed via d7 rather than c6, where it is in this game.  3. ...exd4 is the standard continuation, often leading to the two knights defense."

Notice that the move actually helps white complete his development.  8. ...Bh4 would've been better.  8. ...Bxf3 9. Qxf3 would also be good for white."
17,Bd2,c1d2,r2qk1nr/2p2ppp/p1p5/8/1b2P1b1/5N1P/PPPB1PP1/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 2 9,"Look at the position after white's 8th move and compare it to this one.  After white's 8th move it is black's turn to move.  What has happened between then and now?  The dark square bishop's have been removed (robbing black of the two bishops) and the white knight has moved from b1 to d2.  Black has accelerated white's development and done nothing about his own.  Always be suspicious about giving check, especially with a piece that's already been developed.  Ask yourself whether the move helps you opponent's development."

20,Bh5,g4h5,r2qk1nr/2p2ppp/p1p5/7b/4P3/5N1P/PPPN1PP1/R2QK2R w KQkq - 1 11,"White is about to complete his development, has an extra pawn, and I haven't even mentioned black's crippled queenside pawns.  The only way to compensate for such structual flaws is to attack.  White's advantage is most pronounced in the endgame, so white will generally encourage any further reduction in material."
