In this position It is bad for white to trade Knights on c6 while it s bad for black to trade Knights on d4. If white trades black will have strong pawn structure and if black trades it will waste a tempo for blackand white will just develop the Queen to the center."

8,Nxd4,c6d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3nP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,My opponent had chosen to trade Knights.I can say I am happy with this trade.
9,Qxd4,d1d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 5,So his Queen comes to c7 which would be better if she came the move earlier. Attacking c pawn.

12,e5,e7e5,r1b1kbnr/ppqp1ppp/8/4p3/3QP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 0 7,Attacking my queen that is fine but is it good leaving d5 square for my Knight?
13,Qd1,d4d1,r1b1kbnr/ppqp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 7,I retreated my Queen to d1. It s not a good move I can say.I could just take my Knight to d5 ignoring the attack.It would be good for me. He would have to play Qb8 and that would be very bad for black.(He wouldnt be able to take my queen because of the threat  Nxc7+ neither he  can take my cpawn cause then Qxe5+ and black would be in real bad situation.)

I want to start a pawn storm to  send his queen somewhere else Cause his Queen s eyeing c7 and that s where my Knight might like to go soon.As you can say there s not easy way for black to get rid of my Knight on d5 . He has to use his Bishop for that but it is not that easy Because He doesnt have that much time.
