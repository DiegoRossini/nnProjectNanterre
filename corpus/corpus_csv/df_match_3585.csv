It is, but in the opening, we should worry ourselves with the development of the pieces, and not play moves like this. Black is simply trying to stall his development but create a sort of position in which white cannot use the development. It is not a fully correct idea, and is very difficult to implement, since the attack is easier to play for white, and black's defense needs to be more carefully played.  3...Nf6 was my best choice."

As we can see, the d6 bishop is the good bishop, and it also controls the black's weak dark squares. So now white should take the opportunity and grab the bishop, getting an even bigger advantage in the line---10.Nxd6 Qxd6 11.b3 followed by a4, and now the black's weak dark squares will be under the attack. White has a clear advantage here."
19,Ng3,e4g3,r3k1nr/ppqn1ppp/2pbp3/8/3P2b1/P4NN1/1PP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 6 10,"White fails to take the opportunity, and now his advantage has become very little. One of the best ways to get a good position is to trade your knight for the opponent's bishop, especially in the open and dynamic pawn structures. A bishop's activity is by far the most ranged of the pieces. Sometimes it is a big pawn with a hat, but at others it is almost equaling a rook in power(13B/14R maximum controls). In the open position, bishops are favored, but in dynamic structures, we can now work on creating a favorable pawn structure."

It may not be so bad, but white has the c4 and d4 pawns attacking towards the queenside. If white can quickly get his queenside attack in, black is in big trouble. Certainly a kingside castling was much safer."

White is gaining more space on the queenside, and fixing the b7 pawn. Secondly, he is forcing the dark squared bishop to an exchange, which will weaken the dark squares, or to go backwards, where it is weaker. White intends to follow with b4 and b5."

Black has traded a key bishop for a weaker knight, and his dark squares are so weak after hxg3 and Bf4. White's attack obviously comes first."

White's intention is to activate his rook immediately, but in these types of position, it is almost always right to take with the h pawn. Firstly, white would need serious justification to weaken the central squares, and a major endgame disadvantage. Also, white is attacking on the queenside, so this makes no sense. Much better was hxg3. However, at least white takes back the piece, and this mistake is not as serious as the black's last move."

The black queen has only a5 as a safe square, and after b4 it will be trapped. So after Bf4, black is in big trouble. That is why .,..Nd5 was the best move, with a advantage for white, but a complex position."
