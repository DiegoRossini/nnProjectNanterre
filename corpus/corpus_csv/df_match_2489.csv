There are actually two reasons for this. First, it allows the dark-squared bishop to move out more easily. Second, the c3 pawn is guarding the b4 square, which is an excellent location for Black's knight. However, if Black has a bishop on d6, White has to be careful to not let his f pawn fall into the bishop's clutches! Considering it is not the case, I retake with my e pawn."
