1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Alex gave me a much harder time this time round in the Traxler.  I somehow managed to get my pawn back and then he embarked on an attack with a rook sacrifice.  Sadly for him the sac proved to be unsound and I went on to win the game comfortably after that.  Anyhow - we start the action on move 6 where Alex chose 6. Bc4."
