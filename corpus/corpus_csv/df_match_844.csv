1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"1. Nf3 is an interesting alternative to the conventional opening moves. Called the Reti opening, named after Mr Richard Reti.

2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,So I counter conventionally.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,"This move makes it a Reti, rather than, say d3 or g3 going into a King's Indian Reversed."
4,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"So I just protect my d5 pawn, rather than risk a Benoni reversed with d4-d5. e7-e6, also supporting the d pawn with e7-e6 is also perfectly playable, but blocks in the Bishop on c8."
5,g3,g2g3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2P5/5NP1/PP1PPP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,White heads towards a sort of King's Indian Reversed set up.
6,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pp1p/2p3p1/3p4/2P5/5NP1/PP1PPP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,I copy him - for now!
7,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqkbnr/pp2pp1p/2p3p1/3p4/2P5/5NP1/PP1PPPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,He completes the fianchetto. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fianchetto
8,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk1nr/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/3p4/2P5/5NP1/PP1PPPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,And so do I.
9,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqk1nr/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/3P4/8/5NP1/PP1PPPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"He takes - I very much like this move for black - it means my Nb8 can be developed at its best square, c6."
10,cxd5,c6d5,rnbqk1nr/pp2ppbp/6p1/3p4/8/5NP1/PP1PPPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,I take back.
11,O-O,e1g1,rnbqk1nr/pp2ppbp/6p1/3p4/8/5NP1/PP1PPPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 6,And what is this? He is allowing me to take control of the centre....
12,e5,e7e5,rnbqk1nr/pp3pbp/6p1/3pp3/8/5NP1/PP1PPPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,Which I immediately do...
13,d3,d2d3,rnbqk1nr/pp3pbp/6p1/3pp3/8/3P1NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,"Now this is looking more like a King's Indian Defence reversed, more than ever. White formation is also similar to the Dragon Variation of the Sicilian Defence. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Defence,_Dragon_Variation
Now against both those set-ups, an effective attacking set-up is f2-f3, Be3, Qd2, 0-0-0, h2-h4-h5, so ideally I would like to do something similar here, even though g7-g6 and Bf8-g7 don't really fit in with that plan."
14,Ne7,g8e7,rnbqk2r/pp2npbp/6p1/3pp3/8/3P1NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 8,For now I develop my knights.
15,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk2r/pp2npbp/6p1/3pp3/8/2NP1NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 2 8,The logical square for his Nb1.
16,Nbc6,b8c6,r1bqk2r/pp2npbp/2n3p1/3pp3/8/2NP1NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 3 9,And this one too.
17,Bd2,c1d2,r1bqk2r/pp2npbp/2n3p1/3pp3/8/2NP1NP1/PP1BPPBP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 4 9,"Now 0-0 is the natural move to play. After the game I looked up this position on the Gameknot databases. 9...0-0 is the only move on it. However, I had my idea, so I went with it."
18,f6,f7f6,r1bqk2r/pp2n1bp/2n2pp1/3pp3/8/2NP1NP1/PP1BPPBP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 10,"This seems crazy, to block in my Bg7, but I want my Bc8 on e6, and I don't want him to be able to attack it with Nf3-g5.
What do you think of the move f7-f6 dear reader? Would you have played it? Or would you have played 0-0? Or something else?"
19,Rc1,a1c1,r1bqk2r/pp2n1bp/2n2pp1/3pp3/8/2NP1NP1/PP1BPPBP/2RQ1RK1 b kq - 1 10,Normal development.
20,Be6,c8e6,r2qk2r/pp2n1bp/2n1bpp1/3pp3/8/2NP1NP1/PP1BPPBP/2RQ1RK1 w kq - 2 11,I continue with my plan.
