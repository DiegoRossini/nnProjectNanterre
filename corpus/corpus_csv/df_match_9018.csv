1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Hi everyone!  Here is another game where I have had oodles of luck!  In this game my opponent has me well under the cosh until he blundered the exchange.  At the time of this blunder my rating was 1698 and his was in the 1770's.  I only needed a draw to get my rating to 1700 so I offered him one and he declined - this turned out to be yet another stroke of luck as I was able to stave off his attack and in the endgame the extra material proved decisive and so instead of 2 points I gain 8.8 points putting my rating back into the 1740s!  The action unfolds with a Queen's Pawn Opening.

Would a pawn exchange on e4 have been preferable here?  If so there would have been the possibility of Glenda and Frere Lenoir lining up on the b8-h2 diagonal putting pressure on the h 2 square and leaving the possibility of a knight move to g4 to add still more pressure.  But this doesn't happen and a series of exchanges will leave me in Old Matey's shadow on the h file.
