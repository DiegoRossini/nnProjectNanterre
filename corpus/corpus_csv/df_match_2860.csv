1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"// I have to say that English is not my native lenguage so sorry if you can understand me.

I always start with 1.d4. With the london system. I dont like study so much theory and the london has less than other openings."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,The classical responde giving the control in the center with a pawn with the same idea than me.
3,Bf4,c1f4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P1B2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,my bishop go to a interesting square where will work in the h2-b8 diagonal. This a characteristic move in the london system.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3p4/3P1B2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,His knight go to c6. His idea will be play like chigorin defense with his bishop in g4 to stick my knight trying e5 ASAP.Anyway this is hard thanks to my bishop and pawn that overprotect e5. Besides Knight c6  has a problem the pawn in c7 is blocked and in these structures is important a pawn in c6 to give more squares to the queen and to keep the center.
5,e3,e2e3,r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3p4/3P1B2/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,I let my white bishop develop and consolidate my small but safe center.
6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3p4/3P1B2/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,Im just developing
7,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3p4/3P1B2/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,Im just developing
8,Bg4,c8g4,r2qkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3p4/3P1Bb1/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 3 5,"The first idea of his plan , he is trying e5 but he will never get it."
9,Nbd2,b1d2,r2qkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3p4/3P1Bb1/4PN2/PPPN1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 4 5,I want to capture with my knight in case of bxf3
10,e6,e7e6,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/3p4/3P1Bb1/4PN2/PPPN1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,He realised he couldnt do e5 so he consolidate his small center with e6
11,c4,c2c4,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/3p4/2PP1Bb1/4PN2/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,I start to attack his center. He hasnt the pawn in c6(so he cant do qb6) and my idea is attack the weak pawn in b7 because his white bishop is out of his pawn chain.
12,Be7,f8e7,r2qk2r/ppp1bppp/2n1pn2/3p4/2PP1Bb1/4PN2/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,First idea of my plan attack the weak pawn
13,Qb3,d1b3,r2qk2r/ppp1bppp/2n1pn2/3p4/2PP1Bb1/1Q2PN2/PP1N1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 2 7,First idea of my plan attack the weak pawn
14,Rb8,a8b8,1r1qk2r/ppp1bppp/2n1pn2/3p4/2PP1Bb1/1Q2PN2/PP1N1PPP/R3KB1R w KQk - 3 8,I think its a good move to avoid weaken the pawn chain. I dont like qc8(my tower in c8 will be a problem for black in the future) or qd7 because the queen will play less in these squares.
15,cxd5,c4d5,1r1qk2r/ppp1bppp/2n1pn2/3P4/3P1Bb1/1Q2PN2/PP1N1PPP/R3KB1R b KQk - 0 8,I wanna use my open C file.
16,Nxd5,f6d5,1r1qk2r/ppp1bppp/2n1p3/3n4/3P1Bb1/1Q2PN2/PP1N1PPP/R3KB1R w KQk - 0 9,I think exd5 maybe is safer and more positional but capturing with the knight is a good choice and more dynamic.
17,Bg3,f4g3,1r1qk2r/ppp1bppp/2n1p3/3n4/3P2b1/1Q2PNB1/PP1N1PPP/R3KB1R b KQk - 1 9,He is threating my important bishop so i retreat.
18,O-O,e8g8,1r1q1rk1/ppp1bppp/2n1p3/3n4/3P2b1/1Q2PNB1/PP1N1PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 2 10,Maybe unnecessary but i thought b4 square was a bit weak because 3 pieces of black could jump here.
19,a3,a2a3,1r1q1rk1/ppp1bppp/2n1p3/3n4/3P2b1/PQ2PNB1/1P1N1PPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 0 10,Maybe unnecessary but i thought b4 square was a bit weak because 3 pieces of black could jump here.
20,h6,h7h6,1r1q1rk1/ppp1bpp1/2n1p2p/3n4/3P2b1/PQ2PNB1/1P1N1PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 0 11,A wait move? or just a bit useless. It covers some jumps with weaken the castle.
21,Rc1,a1c1,1r1q1rk1/ppp1bpp1/2n1p2p/3n4/3P2b1/PQ2PNB1/1P1N1PPP/2R1KB1R b K - 1 11,Time to claim my open file.
22,Bd6,e7d6,1r1q1rk1/ppp2pp1/2nbp2p/3n4/3P2b1/PQ2PNB1/1P1N1PPP/2R1KB1R w K - 2 12,He porpuse me a change of bishop. Im not interesting to wait a change to open my h file because i wanted to play in queenside. Besides he has the pawn in c7 and not in c6 so i thought my bishop was worse than their.
23,Bxd6,g3d6,1r1q1rk1/ppp2pp1/2nBp2p/3n4/3P2b1/PQ2PN2/1P1N1PPP/2R1KB1R b K - 0 12,I gain a tempo. I wanted to put a knight in e5
24,Qxd6,d8d6,1r3rk1/ppp2pp1/2nqp2p/3n4/3P2b1/PQ2PN2/1P1N1PPP/2R1KB1R w K - 0 13,I gain a tempo. I wanted to put a knight in e5
25,Nc4,d2c4,1r3rk1/ppp2pp1/2nqp2p/3n4/2NP2b1/PQ2PN2/1P3PPP/2R1KB1R b K - 1 13,I gain a tempo. I wanted to put a knight in e5
