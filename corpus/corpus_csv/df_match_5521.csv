1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"""E4, best by test!"" - R. Fischer"
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Defends e5 and allows light bishop to develop; blocks development of dark bishop and loses some time as it is not developing a piece.  Better Nc6 or Nf6 (Petroff's defense).
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Defends e5 and allows light bishop to develop; blocks development of dark bishop and loses some time as it is not developing a piece.  Better Nc6 or Nf6 (Petroff's defense).
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,Defends e5 and allows light bishop to develop; blocks development of dark bishop and loses some time as it is not developing a piece.  Better Nc6 or Nf6 (Petroff's defense).
5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 3,"Rapid piece development, eyes naturally weak f7 square, allows for king side castling.  Other strong moves would include Nc3 (developing) and d4 directly challenging the center."
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 4,Strong move as it develops a piece and attacks white pawn in the center.
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 4,"Developing move that protects e4.  At first blush seems to blunder into 4. ... Nxe4  5. Nxe4 d5 with a piece fork.  However after 4. ... Nxe4 the intermezzo move 5. Bxf7+ Kxf7 6. Nxe4 gives white the advantage (white with lead in development, black unable to castle)."
8,d5,d6d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3pp3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"This move perhaps is motivated by a desire to challenge the center and/or the white light-squared bishop.  However it is a mistake for a few reasons.  First, it does not develop a piece.  Remember it is paramount to develop the minor pieces as quickly as possible in the opening.  Second, it is best not to move a piece (or pawn) twice in the opening unless there is a compelling reason.  Third, after 5. exd5 black will simply lose this pawn.  Much better would have been 4. ... Be7 preparing to castle or Bg4 setting up a pin against the white queen."
9,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3Pp3/2B5/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,Bxd5 also possible but why give up a well-placed bishop?
10,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3Pp3/2B3b1/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 6,Good developing move that pins the white knight and threatens e4 on the following move.
11,d3,d2d3,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3Pp3/2B3b1/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"There are a few options to meet the threat of e4.  Perhaps the strongest would be to ""put the question"" to the black bishop by playing h3.  However, if black then continues with e4 anyway, after hxg4 white's king-side pawns will be a bit disrupted.  I elected to play d3, which nullifies the threat of e4 and allows an exit for the dark bishop.  Another playable move would be Qe2."
12,Bb4,f8b4,rn1qk2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3Pp3/1bB3b1/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 7,"Strong developing move, pinning an important white piece protecting the d5 pawn and putting pressure on the center.  Threatens to win back the d5 pawn."
13,Bd2,c1d2,rn1qk2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3Pp3/1bB3b1/2NP1N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 2 7,"Develops the bishop and breaks the pin.  If 7. ... Bxc3  8. Bxc3 black can win the d5 pawn with Nxc5, but white will remain up a pawn after Bxe5."
14,O-O,e8g8,rn1q1rk1/ppp2ppp/5n2/3Pp3/1bB3b1/2NP1N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 3 8,Probably the best move.
15,O-O,e1g1,rn1q1rk1/ppp2ppp/5n2/3Pp3/1bB3b1/2NP1N2/PPPB1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 4 8,Completes development and improves king safety.
16,Nbd7,b8d7,r2q1rk1/pppn1ppp/5n2/3Pp3/1bB3b1/2NP1N2/PPPB1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 5 9,"Solid move, completing development and protecting e5 pawn."
17,Ne4,c3e4,r2q1rk1/pppn1ppp/5n2/3Pp3/1bB1N1b1/3P1N2/PPPB1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 6 9,Various playable moves including Re1 and h3.  This move was chosen to force trade down of pieces while maintaining the pawn advantage.
18,Bxd2,b4d2,r2q1rk1/pppn1ppp/5n2/3Pp3/2B1N1b1/3P1N2/PPPb1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 10,"This is black's strongest option and better than Nxe4.  Nxe4 would allow dxe4 where white supports the e5 pawn giving him a strong center.  After the played move Bxd2, white must decide between capturing with the knight he just moved and capturing with the queen."
19,Nexd2,e4d2,r2q1rk1/pppn1ppp/5n2/3Pp3/2B3b1/3P1N2/PPPN1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 10,"I have elected to avoid the doubled f pawns that could arise after 10. Qxd2 Bxf3.  It should be noted that doubled f pawns are not necessarily a weakness, and are often preferred by players such as Nigel Short.  One advantage for white would be the possibility of putting a rook on the half-open g file applying pressure towards the black king.  However, the doubled f pawns can make the white king vulnerable (not everyone is as expert at defending as Nigel Short, including me!) so I have captured with the knight."
20,a6,a7a6,r2q1rk1/1ppn1ppp/p4n2/3Pp3/2B3b1/3P1N2/PPPN1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 11,"This move prepares for b5, pressuring white's bishop.  However, the bishop will have a safe retreat to b3 anyway.  Black would be on the verge of winning back the pawn on d5 with a more aggressive move such as Nb6."
21,Bb3,c4b3,r2q1rk1/1ppn1ppp/p4n2/3Pp3/6b1/1B1P1N2/PPPN1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 11,"Black's prior move a6 allows white time to retreat the bishop, preparing for c4.  Another option would be to move the queen from behind the pin."
22,Re8,f8e8,r2qr1k1/1ppn1ppp/p4n2/3Pp3/6b1/1B1P1N2/PPPN1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 2 12,Moves rook to the center supporting e5 and helping prepare for possible push to e4 at some point.  Centralizing rooks and/or placing them on open or half-open files is a good general theme to remember after completing minor piece development.
