1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,An English played in the first round of the most recent GK tournament. Black nets an exchange but White manages to cook up some dangerous positions while down in material until the advantage proves too much.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"If you're ever going to play me and want to piss me off, play the English. Positional play is the hardest for me, I much prefer sharp tactical lines which are harder to find in this opening if your opponent doesn't want you to. That being said I believe that I have a winning record against the English..."
