1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi all! This is my second 90+45 tourney game. This time white engage a Stone Wall Defense or Berlin's Defense. I arrived very late to the match because previously I was on another chess tourney (from my University). My time was 45min left (from 90) when I sat down, so I played very fast to regain time (I almost didn't used my time, I tried to think all in my opponent's time, so I missed some good moves)"
2,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I didn't know my opponent, not even his chess rating (ELO), so I tried to play something I knew, but already with f5 I was a little lost (I haven't studied this yet), so I applied chess principles and pawn structure for the opening."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"2. c4 is one of the main line, the other one here is 2. g3 (which I didn't know)"
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppppp1pp/5n2/5p2/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"Not knowing the defense, I spotted that the d5 makes very difficult for black to make e5, so probably black will play with d5, then playing a fianchetto with the white bishop is a very good idea for two reasons: use of the h1-a8 diagonal, and for king side castle secure."
5,g3,g2g3,rnbqkb1r/ppppp1pp/5n2/5p2/2PP4/6P1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"Not knowing the defense, I spotted that the d5 makes very difficult for black to make e5, so probably black will play with d5, then playing a fianchetto with the white bishop is a very good idea for two reasons: use of the h1-a8 diagonal, and for king side castle secure."
6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp2pp/4pn2/5p2/2PP4/6P1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Incredibly e6 it's not the most played continuation, but g6 O.o (but it's the second main line, or the old one)
GM Nakamura, Kamsky and other great GMs follow the line with g6."
7,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqkb1r/pppp2pp/4pn2/5p2/2PP4/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 4,"Ok, Black could have played d5 or d6. Now he have played d5, it's a full Stone Wall defense, which I do know from before matches."
8,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp3pp/4pn2/3p1p2/2PP4/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,"Ok, Black could have played d5 or d6. Now he have played d5, it's a full Stone Wall defense, which I do know from before matches."
9,b3,b2b3,rnbqkb1r/ppp3pp/4pn2/3p1p2/2PP4/1P4P1/P3PPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,"Blunder! (I mixed lines). Now black could have played: 5. .. dxc4 and if 6. bxc4?? Bb4!+ 7. Nd2 Qxd4 with an early advantage for Black. (6. Nf3 cxb2 7. axb2 loosing a pawn in the very start of the game).
The main line was: 5. Nf3 dxc4 6. Nbd2 b5 7. a4 c6 8. axb5 cxb5 9. Nh4 Nd5 10. e4 fxe4 11. Qh5+ Kd7 12. Ng6 Qe8 13. Ne5+ Kd8 14. Qe2"

11,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pp4pp/2p1pn2/3p1p2/2PP4/1P3NP1/P3PPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"7. .. Qe7 is more played here (Black can queen-side castle), and Qe7 supports e6-e5"
12,Bd6,f8d6,rnbqk2r/pp4pp/2pbpn2/3p1p2/2PP4/1P3NP1/P3PPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 7,"7. .. Qe7 is more played here (Black can queen-side castle), and Qe7 supports e6-e5"

15,Bb2,c1b2,rnbq1rk1/pp4pp/2pbpn2/3p1p2/2PP4/1P3NP1/PB2PPBP/RN1Q1RK1 b - - 5 8,"8. Ba3 was another option here. I analyse both in the match, and yes, Black's black bishop is his best and very active bishop, so it's a good move to play Ba3 to exchange it, but I didn't do it because i'm used to play this kind of structure as white with Bb2, now it will follow several knights moves in order to stop e5 and put a knight over there."
16,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bq1rk1/pp1n2pp/2pbpn2/3p1p2/2PP4/1P3NP1/PB2PPBP/RN1Q1RK1 w - - 6 9,"Now Black threats e5, white MUST react immediately!"

20,Ne4,f6e4,r1b2rk1/pp1nq1pp/2pbp3/3pNp2/2PPn3/1P4P1/PB1NPPBP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 10 11,Black hurries to use e4 as white has used e5 square.
21,Ndf3,d2f3,r1b2rk1/pp1nq1pp/2pbp3/3pNp2/2PPn3/1P3NP1/PB2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 11 11,"Do not take the Knight! Black wants to play an attack to the king side, and taking Nxe4 it allows Black to take with f-pawn, making an open file for his rooks. Now White's plan (my plan.. xD) is to play: Nd3, Nfe4, f3, Qc2, Rae1 and a possible e4!, as my chess teacher tough me."
22,Rd8,f8d8,r1br2k1/pp1nq1pp/2pbp3/3pNp2/2PPn3/1P3NP1/PB2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 12 12,"Why for? 11. ..Rd8 is a very uncommon move. D-file is closed, better is Ndf6 (which allows black to play Bd7, Be8, Kh8, g5, etc). Other plan could be a queen side attack/stop, playing a5. Finally Black can always play Nxe5 to try to simplify."
23,Qc2,d1c2,r1br2k1/pp1nq1pp/2pbp3/3pNp2/2PPn3/1P3NP1/PBQ1PPBP/R4RK1 b - - 13 12,"The good spot for the queen. It allow c5 advance, it helps for a future engagement in e4 square, connect the rooks and now it's not in the ""line of fire"" of the Rd8."

25,Rae1,a1e1,r1b2rk1/pp1nq1pp/2pbp3/3pNp2/2PPn3/1P3NP1/PBQ1PPBP/4RRK1 b - - 15 13,"Nd3 was the other option, and it's the best one."
