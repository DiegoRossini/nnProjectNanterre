1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"My preference is 1.e4, however I absolutely respect almost all other first moves.  As Black many have caused me grief.  I especially have learned to respect 1.b4 the hard way!"
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"A possible French or Sicilian?  Seems BOTH are at least as popular as 1...e5, though most 1.e4 players might prefer 1...e5!"
3,d3,d2d3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,I have been scoring poorly with my Advance French lines and my Open Sicilian lines so let's go for the KIA or Closed Sicilian.  Actually I just took up the 3.d4 Sicilian stuff as White.  It has not gone well in the first few contests.  I have played the French Advance for many years and apparently Black has figured out everything.  Just comes down to the higher rated doing better....
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"French versus King's Indian Attack it is!  There's some theory. but you can almost play either side without memorizing lines or checking your chess book library.  I DO have a few King's Indian Attack books, but only John Emms' ""Attacking with 1.e4"" concentrates on the French Defense move order.  As of today, 10-11-2011, I think the book is still in print."
5,Nd2,b1d2,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/4P3/3P4/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,The standard KIA Knight deployment. On 3.Nc3 after 3...d4 4.Nce2 we get into the land of the Dunst Opening: 1.Nc3 d5 2.e4 d4 3.Nce2 with two extra pawn moves added.  After 4...e5 it is a standard Dunst position.
6,Bd6,f8d6,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3bp3/3p4/4P3/3P4/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,Interesting.  I have not used the KIA much until recently so every game offers a new vision of the opening.  My opponent is a reasonably strong player rated around 1800.  Statisitics say he is better than me so I am respecting 3...Bd6.  I assume he might like to enforce an ...e6-e5 advance soon.  Or perhaps he is planning ...f7...f5!?  Or a Semi-Slav pawn structure (French meets Caro...yuck...too solid!).
7,Qe2,d1e2,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3bp3/3p4/4P3/3P4/PPPNQPPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 3 4,"Initially (short range) this is indirect pressure on the d5 pawn mainly.  Without additional protection 5.exd5 might create issues.  Nevertheless, this is unlikely and long term I am strengthening e4 and committing to putting my Bishop on g2 or h3 since the Queen currently blocks the King's Bishop."
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2nbp3/3p4/4P3/3P4/PPPNQPPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 4 5,"Now 5.exd5 can also met with 5...Nd4.  Does not seem all that good, but it is pesky.  My guess is this would be a gambit of sorts.  I do not want to fall far behind in developing pieces as my King will need four moves to castle short and three to go long.  I do not want to go long on the castle because there is not much defensive or offensive firepower for my use on my Queen side at present."
9,Ngf3,g1f3,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2nbp3/3p4/4P3/3P1N2/PPPNQPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 5 5,Let's stop the ...Nd4 threat and develope another piece!
10,dxe4,d5e4,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2nbp3/8/4p3/3P1N2/PPPNQPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 0 6,Black releases some central tension...
11,dxe4,d3e4,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2nbp3/8/4P3/5N2/PPPNQPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 6,Can I get in 7.e5?
12,e5,e6e5,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2nb4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPNQPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 0 7,A Double King Pawn Opening type position has arisen on the board.  In my limited chess experience French players seem to rarely play an early ....e6-e5.  Viva la difference.  Je parle francais en pus en pus.  That is something to the effect of I speak a little (very little) French!  Don't fuss at me if it translate poorly.  That is exactly the point!
13,Nc4,d2c4,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2nb4/4p3/2N1P3/5N2/PPP1QPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 1 7,Well...I have to move the Knight to develop the Bishop unless I fianchetto.  So maybe I get the Bishop pair in an open position?  The Bishop is tied to the defense of e5.  I get a free pawn to munch if he moves the Bishop.  Now the open position is another story.
14,Be6,c8e6,r2qk1nr/ppp2ppp/2nbb3/4p3/2N1P3/5N2/PPP1QPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 2 8,Yep!  Bishop pair come to me.
15,Nxd6+,c4d6,r2qk1nr/ppp2ppp/2nNb3/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPP1QPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 8,Yep!  Bishop pair come to me.
16,cxd6,c7d6,r2qk1nr/pp3ppp/2npb3/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPP1QPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 0 9,And maybe a backward pawn on an open file to pile on.  If I were my opponent I would strongly consider an immediate ...d6-d5 advance.
17,c3,c2c3,r2qk1nr/pp3ppp/2npb3/4p3/4P3/2P2N2/PP2QPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 9,"What's the word...prophylaxis? In other words, keeping the Knight or any other Black piece off d4 for now.  Remember chess is dynamic.  May need to later advance the c3 pawn to stiffen the defense of another square later."
18,Nge7,g8e7,r2qk2r/pp2nppp/2npb3/4p3/4P3/2P2N2/PP2QPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 1 10,"This formation is similar to Black's Sveshnikov Sicilian formations and strongly suggests that ...f7-f5 now or in the near future is a good freeing move, but I still like ...d6-d5.  Perhaps a daring soul would play both pawn breaks? Which first I wonder?"
19,Be3,c1e3,r2qk2r/pp2nppp/2npb3/4p3/4P3/2P1BN2/PP2QPPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 2 10,10.Bg5 just runs into 10...f6 or 10...h6.  I would just as soon keep the Black Queen off b6 instead.
20,O-O,e8g8,r2q1rk1/pp2nppp/2npb3/4p3/4P3/2P1BN2/PP2QPPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 3 11,Yes... I know the Knight is usually not on e7 in the Sveshnikov.  It is better here on e7 as it helps facilitate either pawn break.
21,Qc2,e2c2,r2q1rk1/pp2nppp/2npb3/4p3/4P3/2P1BN2/PPQ2PPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 4 11,"Planning to attack on h7 if possible and clearing the diagonal for the Bishop.  The King's Bishop's first future square is undecided at present, but I do not seem to have enough time to fianchetto now."
