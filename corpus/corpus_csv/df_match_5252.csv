1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Hello!!!! This is a game that i played for a mini tournament i participate....I won the game with white in 30 moves and now i have black....I used to play with with white but i think i'm quite good with black too....So he started with e4..
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Lately i like to play c5...Sicilian is always good for black though used to play e5 in the past...
3,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p1P3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,e5 is not a very common reply and i think is not helping white very much...I like to play the Najdorf variation but now the best is Nc6.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p1P3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,So i played Nc6...I actually never played this variation in the past not even in a blitz game...
5,f4,f2f4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p1P3/5P2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,f4? Quite strange move i think again...Better would be Nf3..
6,d6,d7d6,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/2p1P3/5P2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,d6 i think is a nice and safe move for black playing this variation...What do you think?
7,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/2p1P3/5P2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,That seems logical...My king's side is still disorganized and i was thinking about g6 to do...
8,dxe5,d6e5,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/2p1p3/5P2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,But i decided to exchange the pawns...What do you think of that?
9,fxe5,f4e5,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/2p1P3/8/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,He took it...
10,Bg4,c8g4,r2qkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/2p1P3/6b1/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,I guess pushing his knight with that move will give me something good...
11,Qe2,d1e2,r2qkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/2p1P3/6b1/5N2/PPPPQ1PP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 2 6,For me this is a bad move...Is blocking his bishop.
12,Nd4,c6d4,r2qkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2p1P3/3n2b1/5N2/PPPPQ1PP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 3 7,Cause the knight threat is coming..
13,Qc4,e2c4,r2qkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2p1P3/2Qn2b1/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 4 7,He play Qc4 to protect the queen
14,Bxf3,g4f3,r2qkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2p1P3/2Qn4/5b2/PPPP2PP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 8,I took the knight and then it may come: ... 8. gxf3 Nxf3+ 9. Kd1 Nxe5 and threaten the queen...
15,Qa4+,c4a4,r2qkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2p1P3/Q2n4/5b2/PPPP2PP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 1 8,He played Qa4+ and check my King...
16,Bc6,f3c6,r2qkbnr/pp2pppp/2b5/2p1P3/Q2n4/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 2 9,But i repied with my bishop to protect the king and the bishop as well....Now he's down a piece...
17,Qc4,a4c4,r2qkbnr/pp2pppp/2b5/2p1P3/2Qn4/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 3 9,The c5 pawn is exposed...
18,e6,e7e6,r2qkbnr/pp3ppp/2b1p3/2p1P3/2Qn4/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 10,But now is not...The thought of playing g6 will not be only a thought..
19,d3,d2d3,r2qkbnr/pp3ppp/2b1p3/2p1P3/2Qn4/3P4/PPP3PP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 10,To open the line for the black bishop...
20,Qh4+,d8h4,r3kbnr/pp3ppp/2b1p3/2p1P3/2Qn3q/3P4/PPP3PP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 1 11,My queen should attack now...Also my knight is placed in a good square that may help my queen....
