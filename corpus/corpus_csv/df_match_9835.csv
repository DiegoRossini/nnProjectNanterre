1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game by me is by no means a perfect game. However I do play an excellent endgame where I have an advantage in space. Normally, having an advantage in space is not enough to win a game between equals. However, this game shows how to exploit a space advantage and convert it into a winning one. Here is the blueprint for doing that. I learned the following from Alec kine and capablanca who were amazing at exploiting the slightest of space advantages

converting an advantage of space into a win

Step 1:
you lock your opponent up. play moves that control more space and constrict your opponent even more. In general avoid exchanges, which usually only help your opponent ease his cramped position.

Step 2:
then push him into making a move that creates a weakness. you can do this by squeezing him into such a cramped position that he is forced into playing a move that creates space. However, in so he creates an opening for you to breakthrough.
Step 3:
you breakthrough with a sacrifice. Normally this does involve a sacrifice to breakthrough. However, open lines for your pieces then that is good too."
