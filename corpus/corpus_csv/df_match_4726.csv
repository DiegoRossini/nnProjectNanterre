1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"In this game, I play a speculative sacrifice. My opponent goes wrong and loses easily. I was dissappointed that the post-game computer analysis says my sac was not the best move in the position? What do you think dear reader?  Can anyone see what an independent search engine says is best in the position?"

Bd4 c5 12. Bxe5 dxe5 13. Nh3 e4 14. Nc4 Qxd1+ 15. Rxd1 O-O 16. h5 Be6 17. Nd6 Rab8 18. hxg6 hxg6 and a slight advantage to Black."

O-O-O O-O-O 16. Bd5 Qf8 17. Qxf8 Rhxf8 18. Ne6 cxd5 19. Nxg7 Kc7, again with slight advantage to Black. But now, what is Black to do about castling and developing the Bc8?"
