12,Nc6,b8c6,r1b1kb1r/pp1ppppp/2n5/q2nP3/3P4/8/PP1N1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 3 7,"Let's take a look to the position: white has the two central pawns under attack and right now they are very poorly defended. The knight d2 is pinned and closes the way to the bishop. Black has knights in good positions and looks very solid. However, he has the bishops closed by the pawn an their develop will be very slow. For this reason I think that here was better for black to move a pawn in order to open a diagonal for a bishop, like d6 or g5. The move played in the game is slow and is not a real menace for white center. Now I found the right strategy for this position, that is to try to have a rapid development and to open the central columns to take advantage of the better bishop's position."
