1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!  Here is another game from Beefyness's tourney which I lost.  I am calling this game an Expert Lesson because although my opponent's current rating is 1899, he had an optimum rating of 2076, therefore once an Expert, always an Expert!  This time I fell to a basic tactic, the skewer.  An inappropritate pawn push from me set it all up!"

This was Dave's suggestion in the chat in our next game which may well appear in the public gallery too!  Dave said ""I think my plan B would either be ...d5 to open up your black sq B.  The pawn on b5 doesn't need to move as it has enough protection for now.  You could also play ...Ra8 and attack down the a file either before or after the exchange of rooks.""  This move now allows a nasty exchange winning skewer with 24. Ba6."

Qxc8 - After the loss of the exchange I play on for a few more moves hoping to get a perpetual that did not materialise so I waved the white flag on move 32 after white blocked Glenda's spite check on c1.  What is the lesson here?  Do check and double check the effect a line opening move can have and if it does allow a tactic do make sure you can wriggle out of it, otherwise PRESS THE RESET BUTTON!
