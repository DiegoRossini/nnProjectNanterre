Bd2, unpinning the knight, is a move which is common among amateurs who have no theoretical knowledge when they face the Nimzo-Indian. Although the move is not a bad one, it is unambitious. The strategic aim of obtaining the bishop pair without conceding the doubled pawns fails, for after e.g. 4...Bxc3 5.Bxc3 Ne4, White does not get to keep both bishops, and fair trades are usually not in White's interests since White has an advantage in space."" 4. e3, 4.
