1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"A ""Walking The Walk"" club game.  Playing black vs battlefleet, yikes!  He opens with 1. d4.  I consider resigning here."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,trying something new. 1. ...Nf6
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,looks like a gran prix except with no advanced pawn for black.
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,4. ...b6.  seems a reasonable initial position for black.  good mobility and castling options in both directions.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,4. ...b6.  seems a reasonable initial position for black.  good mobility and castling options in both directions.

10,Bb7,c8b7,rn1qk2r/pbpp1ppp/1p2pn2/6B1/1bPP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,7. Bh4.  Here I consider g5 and then castling long.  But instead...

15,a3,a2a3,rn1qk2r/pb1p1pp1/1p2pn1p/2p5/1bPP3B/P1N1PN2/1P3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,8. a3

17,axb4,a3b4,rn1qk2r/pb1p1pp1/1p2pn1p/8/1PPp3B/2N1PN2/1P3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 9,9. axb4

I suppose I should be regretting not having the queen's knight developed by now.  that is really the theme of the game for black: TOO SLOW!!!"
21,Be2,f1e2,rn1q1rk1/pb1p1pp1/1p2pn1p/8/1PP4B/2P1PN2/4BPPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 2 11,11. Be2.

24,Rd8,f8d8,rn1r2k1/pb1pqpp1/1p2pn1p/8/1PP4B/2P1PN2/4BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 5 13,"14. ...Rd8.  A bad idea if I need the d-pawn pawn to continue to guard c6, which as shall be seen I will..."

26,d5,d7d5,rn1r2k1/pb2qpp1/1p2pn1p/3p4/1PPN3B/2P1P3/4BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 14,"white seeking to open things up.  but should have played Nc6 or e5?  opinions and comments please.  This is probably THE losing move.  I certainly want that pawn back on d7 a few moves later.  I am surprised I let those queenside pieces stay so bunched up.  had ideas of further knocking his pawns around, as little sense as that makes to me now!  Still, it's only the 13th move and I suppose I don't expect battlefleet to kill me quite as quickly as he does. Lesson: expect and play against the fast efficient play likely from a master!"
