1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"So d4 is a typical opening move for me. Few years ago i used e4 as my main opening, with no great success."
2,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"f5... The Dutch Defence, never face it on Gameknot before that game. I know some really good players that use it permanently against d4, with great success."
3,g3,g2g3,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/3P4/6P1/PPP1PP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"So my first thought is to go on with c4, but then i decided to fianchetto on my king's side, be more safe."
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/4p3/5p2/3P4/6P1/PPP1PP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"I think g6 is more common here, at least from what i saw from my blitz games. Maybe e6 is one of the main lines too, i don't know."
5,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/4p3/5p2/3P4/6P1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 3,Bg2 controlling the nice diagonal h1-a8.
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp2pp/4pn2/5p2/3P4/6P1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 4,"Nf6 seems fine, developing a piece."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppp2pp/4pn2/5p2/3P4/5NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 4,Nf3 protecting the d4 pawn and also the e5 square.
8,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp3pp/4pn2/3p1p2/3P4/5NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"d5!? I think that's not a really good move, as the e6 pawn is now hanging around! Also seems wortheless from the time that my opponent chose f5 for his first move. g6 and then Bg7 is a classical set up for the Dutch i think."
9,O-O,e1g1,rnbqkb1r/ppp3pp/4pn2/3p1p2/3P4/5NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 5,Finished with my King's protection and now time to organize the rest of my pieces.
10,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp4pp/4pn2/2pp1p2/3P4/5NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 6,"c5 is nice, at least i like it. But black should first be aware of his defence and then play c5."
11,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pp4pp/4pn2/2pp1p2/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 6,And c4. Taking on c5 doesnt help me. This pawn set up reminds me the Symmetrical (Austrian) Defence and the Tarrasch Defence from the QGD.
12,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkb1r/pp4pp/4pn2/3p1p2/2Pp4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,He took the pawn.
13,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqkb1r/pp4pp/4pn2/3P1p2/3p4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,And i took the pawn on d5
14,Nxd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/pp4pp/4p3/3n1p2/3p4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,He took it back with his knight.
15,Nxd4,f3d4,rnbqkb1r/pp4pp/4p3/3n1p2/3N4/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,And the same goes for me.
16,Bc5,f8c5,rnbqk2r/pp4pp/4p3/2bn1p2/3N4/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 9,Now black is developing his DS Bishop opening also space for 0-0. But after a while i noticed that black losses a pawn with that move.
17,Nxf5,d4f5,rnbqk2r/pp4pp/4p3/2bn1N2/8/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 9,Nxf5 and the pawn is gone. Now i am a pawn up and my set up is truly better. Finished with my King's defence and organizing an attack. If exf5 the knight on d5 is both threatened by my bishop and my Queen.
18,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp4pp/4p3/2bn1N2/8/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 1 10,0-0 is an option here but i said before few lines his e6 pawn is a problem on his set up.
19,Ne3,f5e3,rnbq1rk1/pp4pp/4p3/2bn4/8/4N1P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 2 10,"My knight goes back, a logical option i guess."
20,Nxe3,d5e3,rnbq1rk1/pp4pp/4p3/2b5/8/4n1P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 0 11,He took it opening the d file at the same time.
