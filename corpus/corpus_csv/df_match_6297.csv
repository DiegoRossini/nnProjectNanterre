1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hey everybody this is my first game against my first opponent.

As you can see, White plays e4. This is the King's Pawn Opening, the most popular first move for white with professionals and casual players alike. I even play it sometimes."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"1. ... c5 is the Sicilian Defense, the most popular move for black to play. However, even though it is the most popular chess opening, very few know how to play it with skill. Including me. By the way, I don't really like playing this opening anymore. Changed my mind since this game. But we play it differently anyway. And we'll see that soon."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"2. Nf3, white wants to promote his d-pawn to d4 without having to bring his queen out after 2. d4 cxd4 3. Qxd4 Nc6. Instead white tries playing 3. c3 dxc3 4. Nxc3, sacrificing a pawn for early development of the knight on b1. But I believe that this is not a huge advantage in development compared to the pawn lost."
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"Again, the most popular move to play, I know, predictable, but hey, you learn.

You might think that this would be the right time to play 3. Bb5+, and for some people it is, but Black has many choices with 3. ... Nd7, or 3. ... Bd7, or 3. ... Nc6. I'd play 3. ... Nd7 4. d4 Ngf6 5. Nc3 cxd4 6. Qxd4 e5 7. Qd3 h6 8. Be3 Be7, but hey, you know, whatever. ^_^ But it looks good, you know. But as white, you want more than that, you know? You know."
5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 3,"This move puzzles me. I almost cringe when I see this. Not because it's kinda noobish, well, yeah it's kinda noobish, but the part that frustrates me is that I can't see how to capitalize on this person's ""mistake"". It seems like a perfectly good opening to me, but then again, how is it?

Usually the masters say to play 3. d4, but this confuses me. I don't know. I really don't know."
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 4,"Looking at this again, I seem to think 3. ... Nc6 would be better, simply because, I don't know, it feels better."
7,Ng5,f3g5,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/2p3N1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 4,"Now this surprised me very muchly. I very don't like this opening if I was white. But since I was black, I'm good with it. White threatens 5. Bxf7+. Easily stopped."
8,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3ppn2/2p3N1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"And suddenly white is completely disadvantaged. I really don't know, I just don't know."
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3ppn2/2p3N1/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,White develops his knight onto a nice square.
10,h6,h7h6,rnbqkb1r/pp3pp1/3ppn1p/2p3N1/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"Shunting N off its g5. Pretty unnecessary, I just wanted to feel safe. But I should have just kept developing."
11,Nf3,g5f3,rnbqkb1r/pp3pp1/3ppn1p/2p5/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,The knight returns to his forces ashamed. His morale drops.
12,Bd7,c8d7,rn1qkb1r/pp1b1pp1/3ppn1p/2p5/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 7,The Monk gets ready for the Sunday service.
13,h3,h2h3,rn1qkb1r/pp1b1pp1/3ppn1p/2p5/2B1P3/2N2N1P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,Just an unnecessary pawn nudge. IMHO.
14,Nc6,b8c6,r2qkb1r/pp1b1pp1/2nppn1p/2p5/2B1P3/2N2N1P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 8,"Sir Lancelot is knighted, and marches into battle."

16,Be7,f8e7,r2qk2r/pp1bbpp1/2nppn1p/2p5/2B1P3/P1N2N1P/1PPP1PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 9,Pastor John calling for duty.

18,O-O,e8g8,r2q1rk1/pp1bbpp1/2nppn1p/2p5/2B1P3/P1NP1N1P/1PP2PP1/R1BQK2R w KQ - 1 10,The King must be safe!
