In the game I won, I immediately replied 2.g3 and he played mechanically dropping the a8 rook.  When he won, his play was far beyond my own.  I don't know what happens sometimes.  I feel bulletproof, but then along comes a player who sees the swiss cheese in my position.  I usually get dominated in the GK rated games and not in faster over the board play.  It does happen, but less frequently."

Perhaps having won once, he sees that my play can be strong when I omit reckless moves?

The b4 advance will open a diagonal for the c1 bishop, keeps the f8 bishop off of c5 for the time being, and is generally a thematic move in the English opening."

I had attempted to play these style of lines once against this player, but he attacked my queenside before I could get the attack rolling.  Here the center and queenside are sound for the moment though they can be attacked; he cannot immediately unravel them."

These moves seem to but do not actually force the concession of the f2-f3 pawn advance, and the move also seems to stall white's immediate plans kingside assault.  If 9...c6, 10.c5 does prevent 10...d5 but fails to prevent d5 entirely.  After 10...bxc5 black can continue to rip open the queenside with 11...cxb4 12.axb4.  Shredder evaluates this position as a miniscule edge to black, and I have to say I would not want to play the white pieces in this variation.  White seems to have no natural plans or even natural moves there, so that leaves us considering if not f3 then the exchanges either weaken the white center (9...c6 10.Ne2 d5! 11.Be3 dxe4), create a queenside attacking position that Shredder says favors white and avoids an isolated queen pawn(9...c6 10.Ne2 d5! 11.cxd5 cxd5 12.Nxd4 exd4 13.Qa4+), or leave white with an isolated queen pawn (9...c6 10.Ne2 d5! 11.cxd5 -hoping to retain the kingside attack lines- 11...cxd5 -denying the kingside attack lines- 12.exd5 Nxd5 13.O-O) which Shredder evaluates as merely equal.  I think both sides are fairly well suited to IQP play here except that the other line seems to offer white an edge.  White is suited to IQP play as no minor or major pieces have been traded, but so is black because he has a knight posted in front of the pawn preventing it from having the typical advantages used in IQP play: advancement, promotion, and attack; and black seems on the edge of being able to trade of the g2 bishop when general theory says that the side with the IQP should avoid trading minor and major pieces."

In these kingside advances black despite castling and making sound moves can find his entire kingside problematic.  White wants to attack the f6, g6, and h7 squares.  He will even sacrifice the f rook to do it if it promises a good attack.  The black moves c6 and d5 here would attack white in the center, but allow the immediate fxe5 which is not in white's plans but does undermine black's attack on d5 because the knight is forced to move.  I still think that c6 and d5 were pretty good moves for black, but probably not now.  Even so, black needs a central attack sooner or later as a central attack must be good for black as the attacking move f5 creates vulnerabilities in the white position that can be exploited.  The downside is that black may want to move his king away from the white attack and these moves will make the rest of the board less of a haven for the monarch."
