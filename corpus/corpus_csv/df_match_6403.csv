1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I have been experimenting with the English system in resent games. I like it because it requires very little opening memorization and it is very flexible. Meaning that it can be played against just about anything.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,one of the things that make the English a difficult system to play is the subtle strategies at play.

This move is bad. I played it because it threatens Qxb7 but playing Qxb7so early is rarely a good move in most positions. The reason why Qxb7 is almost always bad is because Black can place his rook on the b-file forcing the white queen to the edge of the board where it can possibly be trapped or taken out of play. As a result If white does decide to play Qxb7 then extremely accurate play is required to gain a plus from the extra pawn

Also the idea of 6. d3 is fine for black

6...h6 7.d4 exd4 8.Nxd4 Bxd4 9.Qxd4 Nc6 10.Qh4 0-0 11.0-0 Bf5 12.b3 Re8 13.Bb2 Ne4 14.Qxd8 Raxd8 15.Nd5 Nc5 16.Rfe1 Rd7 17.Rad1 =  

Perhaps the idea 6. d4!? exd4 7. Nxd4=/+ and the game is only slightly better of white because of his control over the center and space"

My thoughts about Qc2 were to play a2 followed by b4."

Black must think he has something here but if he continues on his present course he will find himself biting on granite. It is way to early in the game for these kind of tactics"

Black is coming quick and furious and has no justification for the weakness created on g5. 

...h6 is better to keep the knight out of g5."

I am sure Hansbro saw this but I think he underestimated the importance of his light bishop being gone."

My original intention was to play BxR but after Hansbro played ...Kg8 I smelt a trap. So I decided to play a in between move in order to give myself time to think about it. 

The problem of 13. BxR is that at this point white's control of the light squares is critical to the defense of the king."
