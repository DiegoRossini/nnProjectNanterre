12,exd4,e5d4,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/b7/2BpP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"from what I've seen, Black is safer when he doesn't take the pawn here. White isn't worried about his pawns, and will continue with rapid development in the hopes of getting a quick and strong attack on Black's position"
13,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/b7/2BpP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 7,usual...
14,Bxc3,a5c3,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/2BpP3/2b2N2/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,"?! Not so usual - Black usually takes with the pawn. It is good news for White though - checking the Database, White gets more wins out of this position"
15,Nxc3,b1c3,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/2BpP3/2N2N2/P4PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,"obviously forced, else Black wins the rook on a1"
16,dxc3,d4c3,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/2B1P3/2p2N2/P4PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 9,immediately applying pressure on the f7 square
17,Qb3,d1b3,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/2B1P3/1Qp2N2/P4PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 1 9,immediately applying pressure on the f7 square
18,Qe7,d8e7,r1b1k1nr/ppppqppp/2n5/8/2B1P3/1Qp2N2/P4PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 2 10,"Black chooses to defend with the queen. If he chose to defend with Qf6, I would have played 10.Bg5 Qg6 11.Rfe1 followed by 12.e5"
19,Ba3,c1a3,r1b1k1nr/ppppqppp/2n5/8/2B1P3/BQp2N2/P4PPP/R4RK1 b kq - 3 10,"In this line, however, Bg5 doesn't seem to get far after f6 (though perhaps it creates a weakness that White can exploit) so White places the bishop on an equally aggressive diagonal to harass Black"
20,d6,d7d6,r1b1k1nr/ppp1qppp/2np4/8/2B1P3/BQp2N2/P4PPP/R4RK1 w kq - 0 11,"This move seems natural enough... but there's a catch; Black likes to play, in the Evans Gambit, Na5, that helps to relieve some of the pressure on the f7 square. However, now Na5 can be met with Qa4+, forcing the knight to retreat back to c6 [well, ok, the queen isn't targeting f7 anymore, but he could pressure it again later on if he wishes to] Another option for Black here would have been Qf3"
21,Rfe1,f1e1,r1b1k1nr/ppp1qppp/2np4/8/2B1P3/BQp2N2/P4PPP/R3R1K1 b kq - 1 11,giving support to the e-pawn - perhaps a pawn push may be in order...
22,Qf6,e7f6,r1b1k1nr/ppp2ppp/2np1q2/8/2B1P3/BQp2N2/P4PPP/R3R1K1 w kq - 2 12,"wait, NOW he plays Qf3? actually, there is a good reason behind this - a pawn push to e5 could create all sorts of problems for Black - for one, d6 would be pinned to the queen, so it can't be taken. Secondly, White would threaten exd6, which attacks the pinned queen. This move seems to solve that problem - the queen moves out of a dangerous pin, keeps f7 covered and inhibits a pawn push to e5 (three defenders vs two attackers). However..."
23,e5,e4e5,r1b1k1nr/ppp2ppp/2np1q2/4P3/2B5/BQp2N2/P4PPP/R3R1K1 b kq - 0 12,"at first glance, this looks like a mistake - Hasn't White just given up his pawn? As I mentioned earlier, Black has more defence on the e5 square than White has attacking the e5 square"
24,dxe5,d6e5,r1b1k1nr/ppp2ppp/2n2q2/4p3/2B5/BQp2N2/P4PPP/R3R1K1 w kq - 0 13,Black doesn't see any problens with taking it...
25,Nxe5,f3e5,r1b1k1nr/ppp2ppp/2n2q2/4N3/2B5/BQp5/P4PPP/R3R1K1 b kq - 0 13,"What?! White gives up a pawn, and now he gives up a whole piece? True, the knight will be pinned but White will need more than one move to exploit that [f4 straight away, and White has just given away another pawn], by which time the pin can be broken with Ne7 or Be6...so what is White up to?"
26,Nxe5,c6e5,r1b1k1nr/ppp2ppp/5q2/4n3/2B5/BQp5/P4PPP/R3R1K1 w kq - 0 14,"now Black is six points up! [I wondered - very briefly - whether Black could get away with 13...Qxe5 14.Rxe5+ Nxe5 15.Qxc3 Nxc3 16.Qxc4... but in this line, White is a lot better in terms of space and development, despite being a pawn down...] If he had seen what would have unfolded after this, he may have considered Ne7 or Be6, which would have saved Black from the pressure that follows..."
27,Bxf7+,c4f7,r1b1k1nr/ppp2Bpp/5q2/4n3/8/BQp5/P4PPP/R3R1K1 b kq - 0 14,surprise! :) The f7 square wasn't as strong as Black had hoped!
28,Kd8,e8d8,r1bk2nr/ppp2Bpp/5q2/4n3/8/BQp5/P4PPP/R3R1K1 w - - 1 15,"The bishop was immune to both the knight (who was pinned) and the queen (14...Qxf7 15.Rxe5+ [and the king is forced away from the protection of the queen - the best way to cut the losses is;] ...Qe7 16.Bxe7 Nxe7 17.Qxc3 [and White is up two points]) Therefore, Black has to move his king. 14...Kd7?? 15.Qd5+! Qd6 16.Bxd6 cxd6 17.Rxe5 puts White with a piece up and a winning position (the passed c3 pawn can be rounded up easily) In view of all that, this move was forced"
29,Rad1+,a1d1,r1bk2nr/ppp2Bpp/5q2/4n3/8/BQp5/P4PPP/3RR1K1 b - - 2 15,Bringing in my last piece with tempo
30,Bd7,c8d7,r2k2nr/pppb1Bpp/5q2/4n3/8/BQp5/P4PPP/3RR1K1 w - - 3 16,"forced once again (Nd7?? Re8#) It seems that Black has slowed White's attack - the only way that White can continue the attack now is Rxd7 [not true, actually.. I'll explain next post], and White wouldn't want to try that, being so far back in material, surely? He would have to be crazy to do so!"
31,Rxd7+,d1d7,r2k2nr/pppR1Bpp/5q2/4n3/8/BQp5/P4PPP/4R1K1 b - - 0 16,"'well, it's a good thing I AM crazy or else this probably wouldn't work!' [Actually, there was a much more surer way in this position to secure an advantage in this position..16.Qxb7! Rc8 17.Rxb7 Kxb7 18.Qd5+ Qd6 19.Be6+ - White gets his material back, as well as ENORMOUS pressure on Black! The only thing White would have to watch out for is the passed pawn on c3, but still he'd definitely have the upper hand]"
