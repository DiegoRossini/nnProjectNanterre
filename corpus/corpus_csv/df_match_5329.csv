1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,An opening i'm not using anymore as my personal database shows a % of win higher for black.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Ruy Lopez opening was one of my favorite when the game was played. The White Bishop gets there to volunteerily get harassed by a6-b5 pawns and be re-routed on a better square (a4-b3-c2) which weakens slightly the black queenside and create holes for a counter-punch on a-file or get the center with maneuvers like c3-d4.

6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,Classical defense to exert pressure on e4 as 4.Bxc6 5. Nxe5 is countered easily by Qd4 and gives back the pawn on tempo.
7,c3,c2c3,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1B2p3/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,"Clearly planned the c3-d4 setup but its not a good time to play it. Black could play now 4...Nxe4 without being too much harassed with my pieces as the further retreat 5...Nd6 forces white to remove the Bishop or exchange it.

Better 4.0-0 to pursue the development of pieces and make it a trap on e4 for black."
8,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1Bb1p3/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 5,"Looks like a good development move, but in fact, this move gives back the edge to white. As white had previously shown their intent of d4 with the preparation move c3, it appear obvious the black bishop will be kicked of his square and that Bb6 or Bb4 still allows white a good control of the center via d4-e4 pawns. 

4...Be7 is more solid as it prevents potential pin on f6 and he won't be thrown away on squares his activity is almost useless."
9,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1Bb1p3/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 2 5,Natural development move.
10,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1Bb1p3/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 3 6,
11,d4,d2d4,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1Bb1p3/3PP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 0 6,"The idea 6.Bxc6 7.Nxe5 isnt good as e-pawns will be exchanged and open the position for black who has an advantage of development (3 minor pieces vs 2, that's the price to pay for the earlier c3 move)

This move claims the center as explained before."
12,exd4,e5d4,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1Bb5/3pP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 0 7,"I think this move was made automatically as it makes good sense to release pressure but also allows me a good center. 

Although, i think the retreat 6...Bb6 is better as 7.d5 is meeted by 7...Ne7 and forces white to defend the e4 pawn and get an advantage of space that black could counter sooner or later by trying to destroy the pawn chain d5-e4.

7.dxe5 isnt any better as one of the e-pawns will fall after knight capture and the other one will be isolated on the e-file which makes it tough to defend and needs all white resource to keep it."
13,cxd4,c3d4,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1Bb5/3PP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 0 7,The best move i guess.
14,Bb6,c5b6,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/1bn2n2/1B6/3PP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 1 8,The best move i guess.
15,e5,e4e5,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/1bn2n2/1B2P3/3P4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 0 8,Here a risky plan: Kick out the knight from d5 so i can push my pawns on the 5th row and create an outpost on the potentially weak d6 square. Alternate 8.Nc3 or 8.d5 are also possible.
16,Nd5,f6d5,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/1bn5/1B1nP3/3P4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 1 9,8...Ne4 is a better outpost as an eventual d5 can be met by Nxf2 and force the Exchange on f2.
17,Bc4,b5c4,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/1bn5/3nP3/2BP4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 2 9,Black is struggled in his pieces placement and white will try anything to achieve it.
18,Nde7,d5e7,r1bq1rk1/ppppnppp/1bn5/4P3/2BP4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 3 10,9...Nce7 is better because it doesnt allow 10.d5 to white and achieve their goal of getting d-e pawns on 5th row.
19,Bg5,c1g5,r1bq1rk1/ppppnppp/1bn5/4P1B1/2BP4/5N2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b - - 4 10,"A clear blunder. White's plan is to pin the knight so an eventual d5-d6 pawn advance will allow him at best a good outpost. Fact is: 10....d5 kills completely white's play and after 11.exd6 spatial advantage is almost gone.

Better is 10.d5 Na5 11.Bd3 to keep the center without being countered and accept the loss of a tempo by Bishop retreat."
20,Qe8,d8e8,r1b1qrk1/ppppnppp/1bn5/4P1B1/2BP4/5N2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - - 5 11,Probably the fear of the pin makes opponent missing ...d5. I won't do same mistake twice.
21,d5,d4d5,r1b1qrk1/ppppnppp/1bn5/3PP1B1/2B5/5N2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b - - 0 11,"More active is 11...Na5 to gain tempo on the bishop. 

When pieces are struggled like this and that you haven't a target big enough to claim a clear victory, develop your pieces actively and wait to complete the development befpre attacking as weak pieces will stay weak for a while and a too quick counter-punch can backfire to you as you opened squares to achieve it."
22,Nd8,c6d8,r1bnqrk1/ppppnppp/1b6/3PP1B1/2B5/5N2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - - 1 12,"More active is 11...Na5 to gain tempo on the bishop.

23,d6,d5d6,r1bnqrk1/ppppnppp/1b1P4/4P1B1/2B5/5N2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b - - 0 12,Achieved plan since Bg5: Outpost on d6. Alternate 12.Nc3 or Re1 are still possible.
24,cxd6,c7d6,r1bnqrk1/pp1pnppp/1b1p4/4P1B1/2B5/5N2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - - 0 13,"Maybe it was the best common sense move but I dont like it as it allows a definitive outpost at d6 for the pawn. Maybe they traded for materialistic reasons but 13.dxc7 gains a pawn but the outpost is lost and far more important than the gain of c7 as it paralyzes black activity for a while. 

I think 12...Nec6 or Ng6 is better. Maybe."
25,exd6,e5d6,r1bnqrk1/pp1pnppp/1b1P4/6B1/2B5/5N2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b - - 0 13,This knight has no future except targeting a pawn already protected. I still maintain 13.Nec6 or Ng6 idea.
26,Nf5,e7f5,r1bnqrk1/pp1p1ppp/1b1P4/5nB1/2B5/5N2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - - 1 14,This knight has no future except targeting a pawn already protected. I still maintain 13.Nec6 or Ng6 idea.
