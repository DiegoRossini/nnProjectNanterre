1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Here is a game I recently played in the Glasgow League.  Our opponents, Phones C are the strongest team in division 4, and in this match we (Polytechnic) were outgraded by about 150 points on the top 3 boards, and were about even bottom board.  So the odds were stacked against us, but we pulled off a fantastic 3-1 victory, putting us right into the mix for promotion, although it is only early in the season.  In this game I was black.  This game has mistakes on both sides; I have a bad habit of playing too fast over the board, which is the main reason I came out of my first season with a grade of 1251 (by Glasgow League standards my natural rating is probably around 1400).  I grind out a solid advantage in the middle game, miss a couple of golden chances (around moves 27 to 30) to convert the win, then move into a superior endgame where I completely throw away my advantage, leaving a game my opponent really should have been able to draw.  However, I set a crude trap which my opponent falls straight into, and promptly resigns.  Enjoy."

4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"My choice in this position.  2...Nc6 is probably more common, but I feel that gives white another chance to dictate the style of game, because after ...Nc6 white has a variety of options (Bb5; Bc4; Nc3; d4) whereas ...Nf6 railroads white into the Petrov, which I am quite comfortable with"
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 3,This move is quite common.  You can often tell a lot about a player from their opening choices.  This tells me my opponent prefers quieter games to the more tactical worlds of 3.d4 (best IMO) and 3.Nxe5.  On this occasion I was quite happy with that.
6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3pp3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"I think this is the most pro-active choice.  I used to play ...Bb4 here, but I have had my fingers burnt in that line before so I went for this; maybe not best, but my opponent responded ... strangely"
7,d3,d2d3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3pp3/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"I don't like this move for white because it allows me to play ...d4 (with tempo) and push a pawn wedge into his centre nice and early.  After the game my opponent informed me that he meets 1.e4 with the French, so he is comfortable with playing such positions, but as it happens I love facing the French (and have a great record against it) and I also enjoy playing with extra space"
8,d4,d5d4,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/4p3/3pP3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Natural move.  Of course I could have swapped queens with 4...dxe4, but this move is so obvious that I played it with no hesitation."

10,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/4p3/3pP3/3P1N2/PPP1NPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,"e5 was still hanging, and this develops while defending it."
11,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/4p1B1/3pP3/3P1N2/PPP1NPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 3 6,"This is white's best move IMO.  His Knights cannot really be improved (although Ng3 will be needed at some stage), LSB has no moves, and this is the natural square for the DSB."
12,Be6,c8e6,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1bn2/4p1B1/3pP3/3P1N2/PPP1NPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 4 7,"I briefly toyed with the idea of ...Bb4 , but it is not good because 7.c3 destroys my centre and the bishop will have to retreat in any case.  This is the best square for my ""good"" bishop"
13,a3,a2a3,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1bn2/4p1B1/3pP3/P2P1N2/1PP1NPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"Not quite necessary, black has no good way to place a piece on b4 any time soon"
14,Be7,f8e7,r2qk2r/ppp1bppp/2n1bn2/4p1B1/3pP3/P2P1N2/1PP1NPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,"breaking the pin, besides, where else is there for this bishop?  This also clears the way to castle.  I already prefer black here."
15,Ng3,e2g3,r2qk2r/ppp1bppp/2n1bn2/4p1B1/3pP3/P2P1NN1/1PP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 2 8,"The only sensible square for this knight.  On e2 it does nothing, on g3 it can swing to a nice outpost on f5.  White also need to get his LSB off the back rank, and since g3 entombs the Ne2, this is the only way to achieve that"

20,Bxf6,e7f6,r2q1rk1/ppp2pp1/2n1bb1p/4p3/3pP3/P2P1NN1/1PP1BPPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 11,The only sane recapture
