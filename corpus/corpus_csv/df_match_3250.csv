1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

This is my return challenge against Janet the Brigadier which was a marginal improvement on my other game with her - I still lost though, sigh and double sigh.  We ended up in a queen ending but alas, Queen Janet, the Wicked Witch of the West outpowered Queen Glenda by a long way!  So, how did this happen?  Well, here is the Gameknot Analysis version: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=18671614&rnd=0.48246097817512356.  I start off with 1. c4 which is the English Opening and Janet responds by pushing her pawn to f5."
