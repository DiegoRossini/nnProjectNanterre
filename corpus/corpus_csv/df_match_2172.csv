2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,I was surprised by my opponents 3rd move choice. Why because I am known for my expertise in the Benoni on Gameknot. As I have annotated well over 20 games on the subject!

7,d5,d4d5,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2pP4/2P5/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,I am going to the main lines.
8,b5,b7b5,rnbqkb1r/p2p1ppp/4pn2/1ppP4/2P5/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,!? another surprise move by my opponent that transposes into the benko lines.
9,Bf4,c1f4,rnbqkb1r/p2p1ppp/4pn2/1ppP4/2P2B2/5N2/PP2PPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,This game is going to explode into a furious fire of the epic kind.
10,a6,a7a6,rnbqkb1r/3p1ppp/p3pn2/1ppP4/2P2B2/5N2/PP2PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,This game is going to explode into a furious fire of the epic kind.
11,e4,e2e4,rnbqkb1r/3p1ppp/p3pn2/1ppP4/2P1PB2/5N2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,I stake chances in the middle while my opponent tries to crash through on the queen side.
12,Nxe4,f6e4,rnbqkb1r/3p1ppp/p3p3/1ppP4/2P1nB2/5N2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,I get two strong bishops for the pawn.
13,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqkb1r/3p1ppp/p3p3/1ppP4/2P1nB2/3B1N2/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 1 7,I get two strong bishops for the pawn.
14,exd5,e6d5,rnbqkb1r/3p1ppp/p7/1ppp4/2P1nB2/3B1N2/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 8,black is looking very good here though I sense that momentum is shifting slightly into my favor.
15,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqkb1r/3p1ppp/p7/1ppP4/4nB2/3B1N2/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 0 8,forcing me to give up the bishop pair but at a cost. The knight on d6 will be slightly undeveloped and the black LSB will be hard pressed to find active duty. But black retains the greatest plus which is his active queen pawns. I must be on my guard against squeezed off the board.

23,Bxh7+,d3h7,rnbq1rk1/3p1ppB/p2n4/1p1P4/2p5/5N2/PPQ2PPP/RN3RK1 b - - 0 12,a small but much needed king side weakness.
24,Kh8,g8h8,rnbq1r1k/3p1ppB/p2n4/1p1P4/2p5/5N2/PPQ2PPP/RN3RK1 w - - 1 13,seizing control of the e-file while preparing for operations on the light squares.

29,a4,a2a4,rnb2r1k/3p1pp1/3n1q2/pp1P4/P1p1B3/5N2/1PQ2PPP/RN2R1K1 b - - 0 15,! This greatly slows the queenside momentum to the point that I know longer fear the black pawns.

35,Qc1,c2c1,rn3r1k/3p1pp1/b2n1q2/p2P4/P1p1B3/1p2RN2/1P1N1PPP/R1Q3K1 b - - 1 18,My idea is to clear the dark diagonal for the queen to invade via g5. I will do this via Nb1-Nc3!
