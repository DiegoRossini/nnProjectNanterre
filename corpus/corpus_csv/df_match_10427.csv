1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The defining move of the French -- this is probably the first ""hypermodern"" opening, in the sense that it doesn't challenge white's claim to the center directly at first, but strikes back hard, and invites white to overextend."
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The defining move of the French -- this is probably the first ""hypermodern"" opening, in the sense that it doesn't challenge white's claim to the center directly at first, but strikes back hard, and invites white to overextend."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"This move is the strong point of the French defense -- either bypass it (the advance, 3. e5), capture it (3. exd4), or protect it (3. Nd2 or Nc3), but don't ignore it!"
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"This move is the strong point of the French defense -- either bypass it (the advance, 3. e5), capture it (3. exd4), or protect it (3. Nd2 or Nc3), but don't ignore it!"
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,I decide to develop this knight to its strongest square and defend the pawn.
6,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/1b1PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"This is known as the Winawer variation, and is very hard for white to deal with, as white's a long way from castling, black threatens to win the e-pawn, and it looks like white will be stuck with doubled pawns on the c-file.  What to do here?"
7,e5,e4e5,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3pP3/1b1P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,At least this protects the pawn.
8,Bxc3+,b4c3,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/2b5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"?!  This move is okay, but I was expecting c5.  Black normally waits to capture until white does something to drive the bishop away (like a3), but I suppose Will didn't want to give me the chance to play something like Bd2."
9,bxc3,b2c3,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/2P5/P1P2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"This move is a lot less effective now.  I see I can win a pawn (temporarily) with dxc5, but the idea of having tripled pawns doesn't really appeal to me.  I'd rather develop some pieces."
10,c5,c7c5,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/2P5/P1P2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"This move is a lot less effective now.  I see I can win a pawn (temporarily) with dxc5, but the idea of having tripled pawns doesn't really appeal to me.  I'd rather develop some pieces."
11,Qg4,d1g4,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P2Q1/2P5/P1P2PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 1 6,"A strong move, forcing g6 (anything else loses at least 2 pawns)."
12,g6,g7g6,rnbqk1nr/pp3p1p/4p1p1/2ppP3/3P2Q1/2P5/P1P2PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 0 7,Threatening a ridiculously powerful fork.  I actually looked to see if a double-rook sacrifice would get me anything here...
13,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk1nr/pp3p1p/4p1p1/2ppP3/3P2Q1/2P2N2/P1P2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 1 7,Threatening a ridiculously powerful fork.  I actually looked to see if a double-rook sacrifice would get me anything here...
14,Qa5,d8a5,rnb1k1nr/pp3p1p/4p1p1/q1ppP3/3P2Q1/2P2N2/P1P2PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 2 8,Threatening a ridiculously powerful fork.  I actually looked to see if a double-rook sacrifice would get me anything here...
15,Bd2,c1d2,rnb1k1nr/pp3p1p/4p1p1/q1ppP3/3P2Q1/2P2N2/P1PB1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 3 8,The answer is NO!  Bd2 seemed the best way to defend.
16,Ne7,g8e7,rnb1k2r/pp2np1p/4p1p1/q1ppP3/3P2Q1/2P2N2/P1PB1PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 4 9,A good way to get the knight into the game.  Also worth considering may have been Nh6 (tempoing the queen) followed by Nf5.
17,Be2,f1e2,rnb1k2r/pp2np1p/4p1p1/q1ppP3/3P2Q1/2P2N2/P1PBBPPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 5 9,"This is why I hate this variation of the French.  Look at my light-squared bishop.  Has a bishop ever looked more worthless?  Ever?

It makes a remarkable comeback..."
18,c4,c5c4,rnb1k2r/pp2np1p/4p1p1/q2pP3/2pP2Q1/2P2N2/P1PBBPPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 10,"Making sure the bishop stays bad for a long time.  Sure, I've got the bishop pair, but what to do with it??"
19,O-O,e1g1,rnb1k2r/pp2np1p/4p1p1/q2pP3/2pP2Q1/2P2N2/P1PBBPPP/R4RK1 b kq - 1 10,"At the very least, my king will be safe over here."
20,Nbc6,b8c6,r1b1k2r/pp2np1p/2n1p1p1/q2pP3/2pP2Q1/2P2N2/P1PBBPPP/R4RK1 w kq - 2 11,"Also, Will appears to be having trouble finding good things to do with his pieces."
21,Qf4,g4f4,r1b1k2r/pp2np1p/2n1p1p1/q2pP3/2pP1Q2/2P2N2/P1PBBPPP/R4RK1 b kq - 3 11,Maybe I can drum up a few threats on the kingside!  Qh6 followed by Bg5 looks strong...
22,h6,h7h6,r1b1k2r/pp2np2/2n1p1pp/q2pP3/2pP1Q2/2P2N2/P1PBBPPP/R4RK1 w kq - 0 12,Prevents that idea...
23,Qf6,f4f6,r1b1k2r/pp2np2/2n1pQpp/q2pP3/2pP4/2P2N2/P1PBBPPP/R4RK1 b kq - 1 12,"And this threatens the rook.  Of course it's easily parried, but I'm trying to disrupt black's plans, whatever they are."
24,Rh7,h8h7,r1b1k3/pp2np1r/2n1pQpp/q2pP3/2pP4/2P2N2/P1PBBPPP/R4RK1 w q - 2 13,This square allows black to keep his pawn on h6.
25,h4,h2h4,r1b1k3/pp2np1r/2n1pQpp/q2pP3/2pP3P/2P2N2/P1PBBPP1/R4RK1 b q - 0 13,"I figure if I'm going to have any chance at breaking through, a kingside storm is the way to go.  His pieces look pretty far from the kingside to me!"
