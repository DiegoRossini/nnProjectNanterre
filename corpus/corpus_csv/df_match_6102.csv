1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"One of my favorite openings for white, the glorious queens gambit."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,standard reply to the queen pawn opening.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,white sticks with the normal queens gambit opening
4,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,This is unorthodox for black
5,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pP4/3P4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,never a bad idea to trade pawns if you can get rid of the black D pawn and keep your own d and e
6,Qxd5,d8d5,rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pq4/3P4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"black takes back the pawn with the only thing that it can use, the queen"
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pq4/3P4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,white defends its d pawn which is under attack by blacks c pawn and blacks queen
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1b1kbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/2pq4/3P4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,black brings more firepower and puts more pressure on whites D pawn
9,Nc3,b1c3,r1b1kbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/2pq4/3P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 5,white decides to abandon the one-ups-man-ship.  Its never a bad idea to attack the queen.  This proves the theory that the queen should stay home until later in the game.
10,Qh5,d5h5,r1b1kbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/2p4q/3P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 4 6,The queen scampers away to a place which puts some mild pressure on whites king side.  Would have been much better for the queen to go home.
11,Nb5,c3b5,r1b1kbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/1Np4q/3P4/5N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 5 6,"When the queen is away, the white horse goes for a fork.  This is always a danger when the queen is away from home."
12,Kd7,e8d7,r1b2bnr/pp1kpppp/2n5/1Np4q/3P4/5N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 6 7,Black really had no good options to defend the fork. The king had to move which eliminates any possibility for black to castle.
13,dxc5+,d4c5,r1b2bnr/pp1kpppp/2n5/1NP4q/8/5N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQ - 0 7,"White sees an opportunity to take a pawn and also gives what is known as a ""discovered check"".  Black can not take back the pawn because he is in check."
14,Ke6,d7e6,r1b2bnr/pp2pppp/2n1k3/1NP4q/8/5N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 1 8,Black moves the king out of check and the game is deteriorating for black
15,Nc7+,b5c7,r1b2bnr/ppN1pppp/2n1k3/2P4q/8/5N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQ - 2 8,White succeeds in creating a fork after all
16,Kf6,e6f6,r1b2bnr/ppN1pppp/2n2k2/2P4q/8/5N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 3 9,Black king moves out of check once again.  The black king is in a very unusual place for this early in the game.
17,Bg5+,c1g5,r1b2bnr/ppN1pppp/2n2k2/2P3Bq/8/5N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 4 9,"White could have taken its bounty, but instead decides to rub salt into the wound."
18,Kg6,f6g6,r1b2bnr/ppN1pppp/2n3k1/2P3Bq/8/5N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 5 10,It gets worse and worse for black.  The king is having a nice trip around the board.
19,Nxa8,c7a8,N1b2bnr/pp2pppp/2n3k1/2P3Bq/8/5N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 10,White could have given another check with the Queen but since it wasn't checkmate then white decides its time to take the bounty.
20,e5,e7e5,N1b2bnr/pp3ppp/2n3k1/2P1p1Bq/8/5N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 11,Black pushes a pawn which does 2 things.  1) It makes it possible for black to threaten the white horse on the next move and 2) it opens up the black bishop 3) threatens the white pawn
