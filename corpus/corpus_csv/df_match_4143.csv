1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Most common moves as far as I'm concerned.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Most common moves as far as I'm concerned.
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"This is the Center Game, an opening that was another opening said to have been lost in the shadows of the Ruy Lopez. I will make sure that it comes back alive in this game if I can win (not that it matters if I win)."
4,Qf6,d8f6,rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/5q2/4p3/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,Throw this move into the waste-bucket! 2...exd4 is significantly better.
5,Be3,c1e3,rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/5q2/4p3/3PP3/4B3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 2 3,"Not the best effort, but still sufficient enough to solid development."
6,Nh6,g8h6,rnb1kb1r/pppp1ppp/5q1n/4p3/3PP3/4B3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 3 4,"Here's a poem: If a Knight's on the rim, it's future is grim; it's chances of survival are very slim. My advice: don't develop the Knight on the edge when the Queen is out; wait for the Queen to move away from the Knight's square, then move the Knight. Right now, I can win a point, but I think that it is too risky at this moment."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnb1kb1r/pppp1ppp/5q1n/4p3/3PP3/4BN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 4 4,"I continue my development, therefore."
8,Bb4+,f8b4,rnb1k2r/pppp1ppp/5q1n/4p3/1b1PP3/4BN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 5 5,No problem because of 5.Nc3. The problem is that I might not want to unpin the Kinght until my King is castled.
9,c3,c2c3,rnb1k2r/pppp1ppp/5q1n/4p3/1b1PP3/2P1BN2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"Certainly not the best. However, this doesn't mean that the Knight cannot develop. How I wish that I found d5 now?"
10,Ba5,b4a5,rnb1k2r/pppp1ppp/5q1n/b3p3/3PP3/2P1BN2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,"Well, I guess I could do that."
11,dxe5,d4e5,rnb1k2r/pppp1ppp/5q1n/b3P3/4P3/2P1BN2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"Well, I guess I could do that."
12,Qg6,f6g6,rnb1k2r/pppp1ppp/6qn/b3P3/4P3/2P1BN2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,"I believe that Black thinks that if I can win a pawn, he can win one when he wants."
13,Nbd2,b1d2,rnb1k2r/pppp1ppp/6qn/b3P3/4P3/2P1BN2/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 2 7,Now would be a good time to create space for my pieces.
14,O-O,e8g8,rnb2rk1/pppp1ppp/6qn/b3P3/4P3/2P1BN2/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 3 8,?! This move makes Black's Queen look absolutely ridiculous on it's spot. Perhaps Qe6 before castling could make things look better for Black.
15,g3,g2g3,rnb2rk1/pppp1ppp/6qn/b3P3/4P3/2P1BNP1/PP1N1P1P/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 8,Unreasonable. 8.Bc4 is preferred.
16,Nc6,b8c6,r1b2rk1/pppp1ppp/2n3qn/b3P3/4P3/2P1BNP1/PP1N1P1P/R2QKB1R w KQ - 1 9,"This move can be bothersome. If I played Bc4 then he played this move, it will be an absolute blunder! Better was 8...Qe6."
17,Nh4,f3h4,r1b2rk1/pppp1ppp/2n3qn/b3P3/4P2N/2P1B1P1/PP1N1P1P/R2QKB1R b KQ - 2 9,"So far, so good...temporary."
18,Qe6,g6e6,r1b2rk1/pppp1ppp/2n1q2n/b3P3/4P2N/2P1B1P1/PP1N1P1P/R2QKB1R w KQ - 3 10,"So far, so good...temporary."
19,f4,f2f4,r1b2rk1/pppp1ppp/2n1q2n/b3P3/4PP1N/2P1B1P1/PP1N3P/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 10,"I knew Black was going for 10...Nxe5. Therefore, I played this move. I am influenced to watch out for LS weaknesses."
20,f6,f7f6,r1b2rk1/pppp2pp/2n1qp1n/b3P3/4PP1N/2P1B1P1/PP1N3P/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 11,A disasterous blunder! Better was the simple 10...d6.
21,Bc4,f1c4,r1b2rk1/pppp2pp/2n1qp1n/b3P3/2B1PP1N/2P1B1P1/PP1N3P/R2QK2R b KQ - 1 11,Black should just play 11...Kh8.
22,Ng4,h6g4,r1b2rk1/pppp2pp/2n1qp2/b3P3/2B1PPnN/2P1B1P1/PP1N3P/R2QK2R w KQ - 2 12,"This move is a careless move that says,""I already played d6, and now I'll wait for that puny Queen to come after me."" Of course, that was off the hook compared to Kh8, losing less points."
23,Bxe6+,c4e6,r1b2rk1/pppp2pp/2n1Bp2/b3P3/4PPnN/2P1B1P1/PP1N3P/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 12,Good-bye Knight.
