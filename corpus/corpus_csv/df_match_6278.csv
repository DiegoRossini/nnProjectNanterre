1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I always play this as White, because I like open games and many books give this as the best opening move for beginners."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,My pet opening: the Scotch. This leads to very open positions as Black is more or less forced to trade off a pair of central pawns.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,My pet opening: the Scotch. This leads to very open positions as Black is more or less forced to trade off a pair of central pawns.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,My pet opening: the Scotch. This leads to very open positions as Black is more or less forced to trade off a pair of central pawns.
5,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,My pet opening: the Scotch. This leads to very open positions as Black is more or less forced to trade off a pair of central pawns.
6,exd4,e5d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Other options are weaker. 3...d6?! will leave Black without the option to castle: 4.dxe5 dxe5 5.Qxd8+ Kxd8 (5...Nxd8? 6.Nxe5 loses a pawn); 3...f6? weakens the pawn structure on the kingside; 3...Nf6?! gives white the opportunity of 4.d5, chasing the knight away from c6; and 3...d5?! also gives White the opportunity to take away Black's castling possibility: 4.Nxe5 Nxe5 5.dxe5 dxe4 6.Qxd8+ Kxd8."
7,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"White can also choose between two gambits, which I'm not familiar with: 4.Bc4 (the Scotch gambit) and 4.c3 (the Goering gambit)."
8,Nxd4,c6d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3nP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"?! From this moment on, I started to relax a bit as I knew I had an advantage. This move trades off Black's only developed piece. Many beginners think this is a good move as it forces the queen to come to the centre of the board, but in this case that is not a weakness at all. The queen can't easily be chased away and she keeps an eye on g7 (and a7). The same happens in the Sicilian after 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nxd4?! 5.Qxd4. The main line of the Scotch is 4...Bc5, with 4...Nf6 as another playable possibility."
9,Qxd4,d1d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"Probably best, stopping e5."
10,d6,d7d6,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Probably best, stopping e5."
11,Be3,c1e3,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/3QP3/4B3/PPP2PPP/RN2KB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"I was already expecting ...c5 to come in sooner or later and was planning to retreat the queen to d2 if ...c5 was played. So I got the bishop out to prevent it from being blocked in if my queen would retreat to d2. However, most sources recommend 6.Nc3 here, to keep options open regarding the placement of the dark-squared bishop."
12,c5,c7c5,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/3p4/2p5/3QP3/4B3/PPP2PPP/RN2KB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"?! My expectations (and hopes) came true! Black wants to chase away the queen from the middle of the board, but he weakens his pawn on d6 severely and also gives White full control of d5. From this moment on, my play was focused on the weakness of the d6 pawn."
13,Qd2,d4d2,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/4B3/PPPQ1PPP/RN2KB1R b KQkq - 1 7,I want to keep my queen on the half-open d file. I'm also planning to castle long.
14,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/3p1n2/2p5/4P3/4B3/PPPQ1PPP/RN2KB1R w KQkq - 2 8,"""A very good opening"", says my coach. And indeed, White already looks better here."

21,Bf3,e2f3,r2qk2r/1p1bbppp/p2p1n2/2p5/4P3/2N1BB2/PPPQ1PPP/2KR3R b kq - 5 11,"I don't understand this move, which was played without much thinking, if I remember correctly. Maybe he feared 12.e5 (which is not necessary because he can simply play 12...dxe5 13.Bxb7) or wanted to prepare b5 (which is not necessary either, because that move is already prepared by 8...a6 and 10...Bd7). If anyone does understand this move, please leave a comment."

23,Bf4,e3f4,1r1qk2r/1p1bbppp/p2p1n2/2p5/4PB2/2N2B2/PPPQ1PPP/2KR3R b k - 7 12,! Now the weakness of the d6 pawn is visible: it's attacked three times and defended once.

However, the computer likes 14.Qe2 better. 14...Qc8 is forced, afterwhich I can take on d6 (14...Nf6? is not goodbecause of 15.e5! and the knight has to retreat again because the d6 pawn is pinned to the queen and can't take on e5)."

30,O-O,e8g8,1r1q1rk1/1p2bppp/p2B1n2/2p5/4P3/2N2P2/PPPQ2PP/2KR3R w - - 1 16,? Losing the exchange. Best is 15...Bxd6 16.Qxd6 Qxd6 17.Rxd6 (other moves would lead to either losing material or putting black in a very defensive position).
31,Bxb8,d6b8,1B1q1rk1/1p2bppp/p4n2/2p5/4P3/2N2P2/PPPQ2PP/2KR3R b - - 0 16,Now I also had a psychological advantage as my opponent couldn't stand losing (at least not in this game). He started to play very fast. After thegame I heard him say that he would have had at least a draw if he hadn't blundered the exchange (a strange comment as he was already a pawn down before he made that blunder).
