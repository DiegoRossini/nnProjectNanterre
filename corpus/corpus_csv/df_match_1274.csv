Nxc3 8. dxc3 Qxd1 9. Bxd1 while also getting ready for the castle. This was the line chosen by my opponent, so it ""worked"", but didn't exactly lead to a good result. Better may have been 6.

Neither of these happened. Looking back, I'm not sure what I should have done differently here. B on d1 was trapped in by the P on c3 and the N on f3.
