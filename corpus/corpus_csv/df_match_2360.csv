1,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"White decides to contrast with the movie and open with e3. I rarely see skilled players attempting this opening, so of course I got a little nervous from the beginning."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"So I open the GK database and start analysing options I was comfortable with, starting here..."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Transposing into a queenside opening. I usually see varations of this in QGD.
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,So I decide to pull out Ron! And mostly just stick him there for most of that match.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/2N1P3/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 3,"White decides to contest d5-e4, rather than throw off the d5 pawn with c4 as per QG."
6,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p1b2/3P4/2N1P3/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 3 4,"I plan e6 anyway, so I may as well not block in the LSB."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p1b2/3P4/2N1PN2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 4 4,More development.
8,e6,e7e6,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p1b2/3P4/2N1PN2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,I continue with my plan.
9,a3,a2a3,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p1b2/3P4/P1N1PN2/1PP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,White decides Harry Potter is too much of an annoying kid to bother the king on b4. Probably true.
10,c5,c7c5,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp1b2/3P4/P1N1PN2/1PP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"And I fully transpose into my usual QGD play, since I'm most familiar with it on this type of board."
11,dxc5,d4c5,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2Pp1b2/8/P1N1PN2/1PP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,White accepts the Gambit.
12,Bxc5,f8c5,rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2bp1b2/8/P1N1PN2/1PP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,Expeliarmus!
13,b4,b2b4,rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2bp1b2/1P6/P1N1PN2/2P2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,No using Magic on mere Muggles!
14,Bd6,c5d6,rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/3bpn2/3p1b2/1P6/P1N1PN2/2P2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,Run away Harry!
15,Bb5+,f1b5,rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/3bpn2/1B1p1b2/1P6/P1N1PN2/2P2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 8,? - Not sure about the check. I preferred Be2...
16,Nbd7,b8d7,r2qk2r/pp1n1ppp/3bpn2/1B1p1b2/1P6/P1N1PN2/2P2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 3 9,"Now, if the bishop takes here, I can decide who captures back later, as opposed to Nc6 where if Bxc6+, the only move is bxc6."
17,O-O,e1g1,r2qk2r/pp1n1ppp/3bpn2/1B1p1b2/1P6/P1N1PN2/2P2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 4 9,White decides to take a break and move the kings away from danger.

20,Bg6,f5g6,r2q1rk1/pp1n1ppp/3bpnb1/1B1p4/1P1N4/P1N1P3/2P2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 7 11,"But I retreat the bishop here anyway, interested in seeing what White was planning."
