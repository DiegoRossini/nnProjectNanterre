1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The was one of a set of 6 games I played simultaneously with gm4u on Gameknot. He is someone I have played in over-the-board games. We had a couple of friendly games at a local pub. We won the first one, and I managed to draw the second, and I got the impression he was slightly better than me."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"So I reply with my usual, the Sicilian Defence."

4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/2P1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"White has been left with a ""hole"" on d4, which cannot be protected by pawns. This move makes d2-d4 by white less likely."
5,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/2P1P3/2N5/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 3,He develops his knight.

7,g3,g2g3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/2p5/2P1P3/2N3P1/PP1P1P1P/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,He decides to develop his bishop in the same way.
8,Bg7,f8g7,r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/2p5/2P1P3/2N3P1/PP1P1P1P/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,So I complete the maneuver started.

However there were some white wins against it, while there were none against e6. I also wanted to prevent him from playing d2-d4. I also already had thoughts of playing d6-d5 myself."
