3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Ok, this is a variation. He is trying to get a quick edge on me. The queen is not only backing up the knight, it is attacking d4. Maybe this setup calls for an early c3 with a d4 launch coming? I could also castle, or even b3 with fianchetto in mind. I don't want to let the development of black out run me here. I think I like the fianchetto, it gives me a nice kingside diagonal, backs d4, will prob cause opponent to d6, and I can still c3 and d4."

I see to things, my white bishop has become isolated somewhat, it will have to return to Bb2 I think. I think this may get messy quickly, I like the castle here."

Now I am in danger of losing the pawn, but he doesn't have the structure to grab it yet. But he may go Nh6, with a view to Ng3. I think I will retreat and then play h3. Priority moves in my mind are c3, Bb2 and then d3 or d4. Not sure what order yet."

If I move the d pawn, it really should be to d4. I think the fianchetto, followed by c3. But I am worried about the knight coming down kingside. A bishop attacking my horse now would prob be doing me a favor to be honest. Lets fianchetto and see how it goes."

I didn't expect that, d4 still looks good, but it will leave me down some, I need to play Rfe1 to shore up my defences.

Would make the trade worthwhile. I can see a way to mess his pawn structure up in the loss of the piece, but he would have to do that anyway. Actually, this could be intersting. I will go 2 down, but there will be some momentum. I really need to get my knight out of the way to let my rook do his job."
