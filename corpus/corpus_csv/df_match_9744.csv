3,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,i went with this move with the intention of clearing the middle of the board because i know he likes pawn center control
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 3,"just setting up a means to challenge the center again, not sure what hes going to do"

8,Nd4,c6d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/2BnP3/5N2/PPPPQPPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 4 5,"didnt think he was going to push it, but the next few moves are obv"
9,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/2BNP3/8/PPPPQPPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 5,"at this point i was happy, khalil is good with knights, i think getting one off the board is in my favor in the long run"
10,cxd4,c5d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/8/2BpP3/8/PPPPQPPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 6,"at this point i was happy, khalil is good with knights, i think getting one off the board is in my favor in the long run"
11,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/8/2BpP3/8/PPPPQPPP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 1 6,"not alot of real options here, so prepare for a long battle and make it clear which side im working with"
12,e5,e6e5,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/8/4p3/2BpP3/8/PPPPQPPP/RNB2RK1 w kq - 0 7,now he is setting up center
13,a3,a2a3,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/8/4p3/2BpP3/P7/1PPPQPPP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 0 7,"this was a fast played move, and not really in my favor, but in hindsight i was probably trying to protect the side I have to play on"
14,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/5n2/4p3/2BpP3/P7/1PPPQPPP/RNB2RK1 w kq - 1 8,"now hes setting up, and its clear his next few moves are going to get alot of pieces into action, when evaluating, figure him to look at different pieces for every next move, no single attacks now that my king is protected, also, i failed to open up the middle, so I must also set up, anticipate his set up to put the bishop into play soon"
15,d3,d2d3,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/5n2/4p3/2BpP3/P2P4/1PP1QPPP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 0 8,"when i made this move, i was planning on challenging his knight, i was willing to let the pawns control the bishops at this point and my standing knight may be the advantage"
16,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/pp1pbppp/5n2/4p3/2BpP3/P2P4/1PP1QPPP/RNB2RK1 w kq - 1 9,"hes not doing anything with that knight now, there is no protection on my king side, so i need to set up more, since I can run with free bishops I give it a shot"
17,f4,f2f4,r1bqk2r/pp1pbppp/5n2/4p3/2BpPP2/P2P4/1PP1Q1PP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 0 9,"and of course he protects the pawn center, i need to free up paths to get my pieces off the queen side, so i make the trade"
18,d6,d7d6,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/3p1n2/4p3/2BpPP2/P2P4/1PP1Q1PP/RNB2RK1 w kq - 0 10,"and of course he protects the pawn center, i need to free up paths to get my pieces off the queen side, so i make the trade"

22,Qb6,d8b6,r1b1k2r/pp2bppp/1q3n2/4p1B1/2BpP3/P2P4/1PP1Q1PP/RN3RK1 w kq - 2 12,"now im thinking hard for the first time, star this move for further discussion, i originally thought he wanted to put his king on the queen side, or force me to keep the d4 pawn at bay, i was originally planning to snub out the queen side by advancing all my pawns slowly and taking his knight at the first possible instance, my queen side is strong at the current time, and both my bishops are able to engage the king side when he castles, original plan was b4, expecting 12. b4, Bg4, 13. Qf2, O-O, 14. c3, trade queens and decent queen side position, but I knew he wouldnt let the queen trade happen so early, and I didnt spend enough time figuring out the alternatives, instead I tried to push his queen around by asking him to give up the center one way or another expecting 12. c3, dxc3, 13. Be3, queen to move.  Obv I didnt put alot of thought into it past this point, and didnt see the next move basically ruining my plan"
23,c3,c2c3,r1b1k2r/pp2bppp/1q3n2/4p1B1/2BpP3/P1PP4/1P2Q1PP/RN3RK1 b kq - 0 12,"I should have seen this coming, and how hard my bishop is in trouble.  At this point I think I may have just lost the game, and im scrambling to recover from the mistake.  If i dont move my queen and try to relieve pressure elsewhere, 14. ..., Bg4 and then im boned.  Qf2 (my original plan) is foolish, he takes my bishop and im still rocked, and if I try pressure elsewhere with h3 or the even worse b4, he still wins the bishop, only move is to take his bishop, and try to solidify position later"

I thought about this move for a while, and when I realized that, I was pretty happy with the outcome, and decided I would just take the loss of b2 in stride as it would improve my position queen side again when he takes the extra pawn, grats khalil"

If wanted to move Rf5 as well, but his current position is holding the bisop off the king side, but that would force points trade for the next few moves leaving me in a spot i didnt think I could recover from"
