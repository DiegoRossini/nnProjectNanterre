1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

When you look at your position, do you think, after playing every move, that you have covered all bases.  Think again because yet again, Henry and I end up being conquered by a Master with a rating north of 2300.  This time it is against my buddy Dave Rundle.  How did this happen?  Well, the title gives you a clue!  You can also follow gameknot analysis as follows:-   http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=16902271&rnd=0.048996459985547636        Back to the game - I start off with a rarity by my standards - 1. c4 which is the English Opening."
