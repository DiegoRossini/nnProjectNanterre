3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/5p2/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"5. f4 - I spent the last few moves establishing a huge pawn centre, similar to the 4 pawns attack against the Robatsch or Pirc Defense and developing my knight to c3, supporting the e pawn.  I will play my knight to f3, while black plays his bishop to g7 and then castles which is perfectly in line with the Pirc or Robatsch.  The Pirc Defense btw is d6 and the Robatsch Defense is g6 which is a very hypermodern way for black to defend against white's first move, e5."

This move also expands on the queenside.
