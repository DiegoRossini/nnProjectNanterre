However the ending is not that bad for black. White's extra pawn is doubled and on the king-side, where the king's are, and it is very difficult for white to exploit this extra pawn."

Black's knight has a tremendous square on c5, but white has the extra pawn. Chances are even. I considered retreating the queen to e6 now. I wondered if he would advance his queen again to d3 and we could just keep repeating the position and agree a draw. However I was very much aware that on board 3 and 4 we were heavily out-graded and stood very little chance. I would have to win if my team were to get anything out of this match, so I played...."

It can't take on e5 or c5 as it is pinned by the rook against the white queen, and it can't advance without losing his e4 pawn. The d4 pawn is now attacked by five pieces (2 pawns, a bishop, rook and a queen) and protected four times - so I am threatening to take it."

This is the key position. I looked at Qxa2 20. Ra1 Qb3 21. Qxb3+ Nxb3 22. Ra3 and at the time I thought I was losing the knight on b3. However I see now that in that position I can save it with c5-c4, or I can take on d4, which threatens his bishop on e3. This is clearly what I should have played, or maybe take on d4 first with my c pawn. Either way I think black would have had an advantage. However I tried another way, which just loses for me, although it looks very plausible!"

Of course, I saw that his bishop can drop back and hit my queen, but what of it? I can take on d4 with my bishop. He can't then recapture with his knight, as then I take back with the queen, give check and follow up with QxBd2 and I am a piece up. Of course he doesn't have to capture on d4, he could simply move his king, but then I move my queen, and if he takes my knight, I recapture with my queen. No problem there? Or is there?"
