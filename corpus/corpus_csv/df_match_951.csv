I knew that my opponent had played a delayed alapin ( 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. c3 )and the grand prix attack ( 1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 Nc6 3. f4 )  back in 2013 and thus had prepared a lot for those openings. Some lines I had looked at went all the way up to 11 moves or so. A direct alapin isn't what I prepared for, but I do have a friend who plays the alapin and thus I knew some theory of it. At this point I had no idea what was in store for me."

Here my friend would usually just play Bc4 which I'd meet with Nb6 after which he retreats his bishop to b3. Bc4 is not the main line, but it's interesting in its own rights although I think that black equalises a tad too easily in that variation. Nc3 isn't the main line for as far as I know as I believe Nf3 is more often played in which both sides have their chances. Here I was a little clueless as to how to handle the situation."

12,Nb6,d5b6,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/1nn5/4P3/3P4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 3 7,"I decide to play Nb6 rather then trade with Nxc3, which is probably a mistake. I was a little frightened of the pawn chain that follows since the plan of 6. Nxc3 7. bxc3 d6, immediately targeting that very pawn chain doesn't really work because of Maybe 8. exd6 Qxd6 9. Qxd6 exd6 that follows. d6 isn't a requirement, but it's one of the moves I'm used to when it comes to breaking the alapin pawnchain. I'm wasn't sure how to resolve that position and thus opted for Nb6. This is the last time these knights will get action in this game."

14,d5,d7d5,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/1nn5/3pP3/3P1P2/2N5/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq d6 0 8,"I looked at all kinds of moves here, but opted for d5. e6 is great and all, but my dark squared bishop will be rather weak due to his pawns being on the dark squares and if I ever want to play f6 then I might want to keep the e-pawn there. d6 was also an option with the intention of taking his pawn on e5, but it feels rather pointless after he recaptures fxe5. The logic behind d5 is essentially to develop my light squared bishop, play e6 and close the position. Not the most ambitious plan, but I said beforehand that I would be satisfied with a draw today against a much stronger opponent. Maybe that attitude is exactly what cost me the game. In chess it's often far better to be overconfident as your play gets more ambitious. Today I learned that you should never go into a game with the thought that a draw is fine."

I start thinking about 10. h3 Bh5 11. g4 Bg6 and realised I didn't like that position at all. White has so much space and it seems inevitable that he'll come crashing through in that position. Afterwards he told me he would never have played g4 since it seriously weakens his king safety, but I'm pretty convinced that he could get away with it."

24,Be7,f8e7,r2qk2r/1p2bppp/pnn1p3/3pP3/3P1P2/P1N1BQ1P/1P4P1/R3KB1R w KQkq - 1 13,"Probably a grave mistake looking back on it. It doesn't seem like a mistake at first, but I think it's clear that all the action will happen on the kingside. Better would probably have been Ne7 preparing for the knight to either get to g6 of f5 and then after that play Be7. The problem with Be7 is that my knights now have no way of helping in the onslaught that is about to happen. White will play things like Bd3, castle kingside, f5 and there's just too much pieces of him attacking that side of the board to hold. The logic behind Be7 was simple.  My bishop has to go to e7 or it will never develop. The logic is sound, but there were bigger priorities in the position. Even on just move 12 a mistake like this can easily be made, it's why I always try and play incredibly slow as to not overlook the dangers in a position and alter my play accordingly. Sadly I missed it entirely this time around."

Yes it stops f5, but f5 wasn't a big threat at this point yet. Better would probably have been f6, trying to create room for black or f5 after which g6 follows and the position is not too easy to break for White."

If I have to take then I can maybe try to castle afterwards and my rook on the f-file could create some issues for white. I was also looking at f5, but underestimated the strength of that move."

Black can obviously win the bishop here but against what price... gxe5 Qxg5. With future threats of Qh5+, Bh8, e6, etc. I couldn't find a way out for Black if I took the bishop. If I play some random move then Bxg6+ follows after which he'll take the pawn on f6 after hxg6 and I might as well resign at that point. fxe5 isn't exactly good either since it has the same idea of Bxg6+"
