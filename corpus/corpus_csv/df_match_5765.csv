7,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/8/2pP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,white can play e4 here but my experience has been that black can undermine the white center with ...e5 and ...c5
8,c6,c7c6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/8/2pP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"??
...e6 is better because your knight is better on f6. Also worht looking at for black is 4. ...a6 aiming to hold on to the extra pawn. If white is stupid enough to play 

5. Bxc4? e6 6. Nf3 b5! is perfect for black"

13,O-O,e1g1,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/8/1bBP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 3 7,I am not worried about 7. ...Bxc3 because I have a lead in development if you exchange now then you will only have one pieced developed.
14,Bxc3,b4c3,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/8/2BP4/2b1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,"Here is another game that I played that I think will be worth you looking at because I use the exact same pawn structure to win.

16,b5,b7b5,rnbqk2r/p4ppp/2p1pn2/1p6/2BP4/2P1PN2/P4PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 9,"?? This is the major cause of all your problems. It is easy to see why such a move is not that big of a deal because it drives the bishop back to d3. However, the irony is that the Bishop is better on d3 because it can support multiple attack from e4, c4, and a4. 

Also please remember in the future that flank attacks like this one will never succeed if you do not have control of the centre."
17,Bd3,c4d3,rnbqk2r/p4ppp/2p1pn2/1p6/3P4/2PBPN2/P4PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 9,?? dont move a piece twice in the openning. You should develop your other pieces before you think about putting a knight on d5.
18,Nd5,f6d5,rnbqk2r/p4ppp/2p1p3/1p1n4/3P4/2PBPN2/P4PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 10,?? dont move a piece twice in the openning. You should develop your other pieces before you think about putting a knight on d5.
19,Qb3,d1b3,rnbqk2r/p4ppp/2p1p3/1p1n4/3P4/1QPBPN2/P4PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 3 10,your attack on c3 is easily parried. Also noticed that I have defended with a purpose in that I am adding to my attack on b5 which will shortly fall when I play a4! As a result of A4 your knight on d5 will be undermined and will be forced to retreat.
20,Nd7,b8d7,r1bqk2r/p2n1ppp/2p1p3/1p1n4/3P4/1QPBPN2/P4PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 4 11,this was your last chance to castle and any hope of surviving the coming on slought.
21,a4,a2a4,r1bqk2r/p2n1ppp/2p1p3/1p1n4/P2P4/1QPBPN2/5PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 0 11,"The beginning of my attack

please notice several key factors that ensure that this attack will be decisive:

1. I have clear space advantage on this side of the board. 
2. I have more pieces attack b5 then you have defending it. 
3. My king and pieces are all safe and there are no direct threats present in my position."
22,b4,b5b4,r1bqk2r/p2n1ppp/2p1p3/3n4/Pp1P4/1QPBPN2/5PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 0 12,this attack on the clank does deal with the threat on b5 but I own the centre so...

25,Bxf4,c1f4,r1bqk2r/p2n1ppp/2p1p3/8/Pp1PPB2/1QPB1N2/5PPP/R4RK1 b kq - 0 13,I could ahve taken the pawn but as you can see this pawn is going now where so why take it now when you can take it later. With Bd6 I have ensured that your king is in the centre. This move follows advanced rules in positional play so I totally expected this one to be a superise for you.
26,bxc3,b4c3,r1bqk2r/p2n1ppp/2p1p3/8/P2PPB2/1QpB1N2/5PPP/R4RK1 w kq - 0 14,I could ahve taken the pawn but as you can see this pawn is going now where so why take it now when you can take it later.

17. Qxc3? Bd7! and black is defending"
33,Qb3,c3b3,r1bqk2r/5ppp/2p1p3/p7/n2PP3/BQ1B1N2/5PPP/R4RK1 b kq - 1 17,"I am prettry sure you saw

34,Ba6,c8a6,r2qk2r/5ppp/b1p1p3/p7/n2PP3/BQ1B1N2/5PPP/R4RK1 w kq - 2 18,I saw this too and at first I was thinking of 18. Bxa6 Rxa6 19. Qxa4 which is fine for white but it help you defend c6 because rook is on a6 and you are not being forced into making any more mistakes.
35,Qxa4,b3a4,r2qk2r/5ppp/b1p1p3/p7/Q2PP3/B2B1N2/5PPP/R4RK1 b kq - 0 18,!! This is the winning idea because it forces a massive exhange of pieces. Which is what you want to do if you have a material advantage
