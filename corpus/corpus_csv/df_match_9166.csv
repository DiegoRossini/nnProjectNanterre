1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!  I thought I would talk about a recent game I won in the Barmy Army Tournament.  Looking at the rating differential you would think it should be a piece of cake for me.  I was aware of my opponent's optimum rating, however - 1330.  Looking back through his profile he has an impressive array of wins over 1400  opposition and even a 1500  player.  In those games he either delivered checkmate or his opponents resigned on the grounds of ruinous loss of material.  His playing strength is therefore very similar to The Dentist - remember him, anyone?  Well, I did manage to beat NN in 18 moves - Glenda struck again, but there was a stage in the game where I took 2 days to come back with a move for the want of a plan.  I hope you have a good read as this is all about an unusual opening."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"3. c3 - this move is the Ponziani Opening, this opening is very rarely played at Master Level and is not that well known.  This move is intended to support d4, get dsb out onto e3 and then queen knight onto d2."

I did see in the database, however that somebody had played a3 and the suggested continuation was Nxe4 with at least equality for black and then I could get to see what my opponent's endgame play was like!  It didn't quite work out that way though!"

Over the next two moves we have some sensible development from white but in between that Frere Leblanc goes to g4 first to enable Glenda to deposit herself on d7 and then later on he will go to h3 to menace the f1 rook and then Glenda will land a nasty check on g4.
