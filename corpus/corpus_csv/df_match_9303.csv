17,Nxd7,e5d7,r3kbnr/pppN1ppp/1qn1p3/8/2BPp3/2B5/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 0 9,"Black has to recapture with the king, or move his queen.  The black queen has no safe squares and no significant chances of counter attack so the capture of the black queen was definately going to happen if he didn't capture with his king."
18,Kxd7,e8d7,r4bnr/pppk1ppp/1qn1p3/8/2BPp3/2B5/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - - 0 10,Forced!

21,dxe6+,d5e6,r4bnr/pppk1ppp/1q2P3/n7/2B1p3/2B5/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b - - 0 11,"Double check.  Black cant capture the pawn with his f7 pawn because of the check from the white queen.  Black cant block the check with Bd6 because of the check from the e6 pawn. Black has to move.  Only choices are ....Ke7 12. Qd7   or ....Ke8 12. Qd7   or Kc8... 12 Qd7 Kb8 13. Qd8  
Black resigned!!  This was a memorable victory because it was my highest rating I won against and it was a quick victory."
