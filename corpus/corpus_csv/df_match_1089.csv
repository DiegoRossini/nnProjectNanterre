7,f3,f2f3,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N2P2/PP2P1PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"This is a favorite of mine that I prepared for the Nimzo-Indian. The main idea is that the pawn on f3 supports an e4 push and an eventual g4 push to attack the king-side. The obvious drawback to this is that the g1 knight doesn't get to go to its natural square, but I can still route it to g3 via e2."
