1,c3,c2c3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/2P5/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The game begins with an unorthodox [1.c3], a move which can provide support for [d2-d4], but has the drawback of taking the useful c3 square from the b1 knight. The control point for white is d4."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/8/2P5/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"This move is the last book move for A00: the Saragossa Opening. The knight takes control of e4 to prevent the immediate move [e2-e4], thus controlling e4 and also d5."
3,h3,h2h3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/8/2P4P/PP1PPPP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"This move looks suspect and does not follow the theory of piece development. I begin to sense my opponent is playing with the idea of a hedgehog and it seems like there will be an over development of pawns before pieces, which I will try to take advantage of by correct piece play."
4,b6,b7b6,rnbqkb1r/p1pppppp/1p3n2/8/8/2P4P/PP1PPPP1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"I decide on an unorthodox, or perhaps modern type of play. The idea is to take immediate advantage of whites position. When [2.h3] was played, it weakened the pawn structure kingside, and it leaves g2 open to some pressure which will be applied by the bishop at b7. The pawn structure may suggest kingside castling for white, and the fianchettoed bishop plays well into this concept. Also the squares e4 and d5 will be further influenced by the bishop."
5,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/p1pppppp/1p3n2/8/8/2P1P2P/PP1P1PP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"My opponent develops into a hedgehog looking position. The text move adds more control to d4, but leaves the white squares e4 and d5 uncontested. Going by the adage of piece development, this move does not contribute to development for white. This gives black the chance for rapid piece development and the initiative."
6,Bb7,c8b7,rn1qkb1r/pbpppppp/1p3n2/8/8/2P1P2P/PP1P1PP1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,Continuing with piece development and controlling the center Reti style.
7,a4,a2a4,rn1qkb1r/pbpppppp/1p3n2/8/P7/2P1P2P/1P1P1PP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,A fourth pawn move is just bad for white. The text move does not contribute to development and does not offer any kind of attack or tactic. The move is questionable.
8,g6,g7g6,rn1qkb1r/pbpppp1p/1p3np1/8/P7/2P1P2P/1P1P1PP1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"I decide to develop a double fianchetto for the fun of it [?!], and because I am leaning towards a decision to castle kingside - due in part to the a4 pawn which could menace the queenside."
9,g4,g2g4,rn1qkb1r/pbpppp1p/1p3np1/8/P5P1/2P1P2P/1P1P1P2/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,White overlooks the bishop line of attack [?].
10,Bxh1,b7h1,rn1qkb1r/p1pppp1p/1p3np1/8/P5P1/2P1P2P/1P1P1P2/RNBQKBNb w Qkq - 0 6,[-/ ]
11,f3,f2f3,rn1qkb1r/p1pppp1p/1p3np1/8/P5P1/2P1PP1P/1P1P4/RNBQKBNb b Qkq - 0 6,"White attempts to trap the bishop, likely with a plan of recapture by the queen [Qd1-e2, Qe2-h2]."
12,Nxg4,f6g4,rn1qkb1r/p1pppp1p/1p4p1/8/P5n1/2P1PP1P/1P1P4/RNBQKBNb w Qkq - 0 7,It appears that this will work [!]. If [7.hxg4] then [7...e6  8.Qe7 Qh4  !]. Else if [7.hxg4 e6  8. Bh3 Qh4   9.Kf1 Qg3!? ] with uncertain results.
13,hxg4,h3g4,rn1qkb1r/p1pppp1p/1p4p1/8/P5P1/2P1PP2/1P1P4/RNBQKBNb b Qkq - 0 7,I decided to try another idea on the chance that it works [?!].
14,h5,h7h5,rn1qkb1r/p1pppp2/1p4p1/7p/P5P1/2P1PP2/1P1P4/RNBQKBNb w Qkq - 0 8,I decided to try another idea on the chance that it works [?!].
15,Bh3,f1h3,rn1qkb1r/p1pppp2/1p4p1/7p/P5P1/2P1PP1B/1P1P4/RNBQK1Nb b Qkq - 1 8,The text move is a mistake because it allows the exchange at g4 [?]. Better was [8.g5] keeping the h file closed.
16,hxg4,h5g4,rn1qkb1r/p1pppp2/1p4p1/8/P5p1/2P1PP1B/1P1P4/RNBQK1Nb w Qkq - 0 9,And now the bishop gains its freedom.
17,fxg4,f3g4,rn1qkb1r/p1pppp2/1p4p1/8/P5P1/2P1P2B/1P1P4/RNBQK1Nb b Qkq - 0 9,And now the bishop gains its freedom.
18,Bb7,h1b7,rn1qkb1r/pbpppp2/1p4p1/8/P5P1/2P1P2B/1P1P4/RNBQK1N1 w Qkq - 1 10,The text move does not contribute to whites positional strengths [?].
19,Na3,b1a3,rn1qkb1r/pbpppp2/1p4p1/8/P5P1/N1P1P2B/1P1P4/R1BQK1N1 b Qkq - 2 10,The text move does not contribute to whites positional strengths [?].
20,e6,e7e6,rn1qkb1r/pbpp1p2/1p2p1p1/8/P5P1/N1P1P2B/1P1P4/R1BQK1N1 w Qkq - 0 11,"And now black has created a hedgehog formation. This move opens lines for queen and f8 bishop. Even though black has not castled, very good attacking possibilities exist, while white has limited counter play."
21,d4,d2d4,rn1qkb1r/pbpp1p2/1p2p1p1/8/P2P2P1/N1P1P2B/1P6/R1BQK1N1 b Qkq - 0 11,The text is a move likely made with the idea of freeing the bishop. White has a porous pawn structure which allows black a lot of freedom for bishops and queen.
22,Qh4+,d8h4,rn2kb1r/pbpp1p2/1p2p1p1/8/P2P2Pq/N1P1P2B/1P6/R1BQK1N1 w Qkq - 1 12,The text is a forcing move - the king must take a walk and lose castling rights. This will tie down the rook on a1.
23,Kd2,e1d2,rn2kb1r/pbpp1p2/1p2p1p1/8/P2P2Pq/N1P1P2B/1P1K4/R1BQ2N1 b kq - 2 12,The text move allows a continued attack [?!]. Also possible is [12.Kf1 Qf6   13.Ke1] seeking a perpetual.
