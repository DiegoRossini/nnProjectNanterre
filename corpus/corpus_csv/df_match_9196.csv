1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Once again I'm playing one of my favorite first moves for white. I would say that I most likely play d4 most of the time. To be honest, I really wish this game was rated. Right about now I could use some rating points."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,One of the most usual and normal moves I usually see all the time. I'm usually picky about my second move because I usually like to avoid certain openings that I haven't seen in a while.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 2,"In some way it started to look like a Colle system, which I always look forward playing all the time. When I saw ....b6 played by my opponent, the only opening I could think of was the Queens Indian Defence. I like playing against that opening every now and then but I have my off days."

10,Bb7,c8b7,rn1qkb1r/pb1p1ppp/1p2pn2/2p5/3P4/2P1PN2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,Looking for play along the a8-h1 diagonal which is very common when playing b6. At this point I was going to go face the Queens Indian for sure.

I really didn't like this rook to be moved because I thought it would be hard for me to get the other rook into play. I could be wrong but at the time I wish the other rook was moved instead.
28,Rae8,a8e8,4rrk1/p1qn1ppp/1p1bp3/2p3B1/3PQ3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/R2R2K1 w - - 5 15,I didn't like that rook on the e-file so I moved my Queen to d3 to put some pressure along the d-file and also attack the Knight rather than the bishop because I know that would be the first piece my opponent would have to move first. Obviously my opponent saw that coming so he moved it out the way.
