6,e6,e7e6,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/3p4/2PP4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"I rather like this more than playing Nf6!? Because if he captures on d5 and I recapture with the knight, not only do I not have very much central control, but he can gain a tempo by advancing his e pawn."
7,a3,a2a3,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/3p4/2PP4/P3P3/1P3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"?! Wasted move, as it does is prevents my DSB from going to b4, which wouldn't be a big problem for him."
8,Bd6,f8d6,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2nbp3/3p4/2PP4/P3P3/1P3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"I'm not sure I liked that exchange for white. It did trade a side pawn for a center one, but it allows my to develop my LSB."
