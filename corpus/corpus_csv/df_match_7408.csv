1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"While not entirely sold on the French-style defense, I like it against the Three Knights opening as it frees the QN quickly."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"While not entirely sold on the French-style defense, I like it against the Three Knights opening as it frees the QN quickly."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"While not entirely sold on the French-style defense, I like it against the Three Knights opening as it frees the QN quickly."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"While not entirely sold on the French-style defense, I like it against the Three Knights opening as it frees the QN quickly."
5,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 3,"While not entirely sold on the French-style defense, I like it against the Three Knights opening as it frees the QN quickly."
6,d6,d7d6,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"While not entirely sold on the French-style defense, I like it against the Three Knights opening as it frees the QN quickly."
7,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"Threatening pressure on the KBP.  This move is weaker than 3. Bc4 as an attacking move since Black's QB is now free, but just fine for development."
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,Ensuring that all remains safe on the home front.
9,d3,d2d3,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4p3/2B1P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,Castle first and wait?  The mirrored pawns cut off the KB.
10,g6,g7g6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2p1p/2np1np1/4p3/2B1P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,Departing a touch from standard play.  I am not a huge fan of the Be7 move except against early bishop pressure.  I started experimenting with the fiancetto recently however so still don't have solid timing developing it.
11,Be3,c1e3,r1bqkb1r/ppp2p1p/2np1np1/4p3/2B1P3/2NPBN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 6,Prepares to advance the QP?
12,Bg7,f8g7,r1bqk2r/ppp2pbp/2np1np1/4p3/2B1P3/2NPBN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 7,"Look, I'm just saying, I think this wastes the move.  The alternative 8. d4 attack opens up the middle nicely for White, who has movement with his rooks."
13,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk2r/ppp2pbp/2np1np1/4p3/2B1P3/2NPBN2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 3 7,"Look, I'm just saying, I think this wastes the move.  The alternative 8. d4 attack opens up the middle nicely for White, who has movement with his rooks."
14,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/ppp2pbp/2np1np1/4p3/2B1P3/2NPBN2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 4 8,"Look, I'm just saying, I think this wastes the move.  The alternative 8. d4 attack opens up the middle nicely for White, who has movement with his rooks."
15,Qe2,d1e2,r1bq1rk1/ppp2pbp/2np1np1/4p3/2B1P3/2NPBN2/PPP1QPPP/R4RK1 b - - 5 8,"Look, I'm just saying, I think this wastes the move.  The alternative 8. d4 attack opens up the middle nicely for White, who has movement with his rooks."
16,Qe7,d8e7,r1b2rk1/ppp1qpbp/2np1np1/4p3/2B1P3/2NPBN2/PPP1QPPP/R4RK1 w - - 6 9,"Probably Black should move out the bishop first, possibly with exchange to weaken White's knight pressure.  However, this proves useful..."
17,Nd5,c3d5,r1b2rk1/ppp1qpbp/2np1np1/3Np3/2B1P3/3PBN2/PPP1QPPP/R4RK1 b - - 7 9,"If 10. ... Nb4 11. c3 Na6 and the Knight is sidelined, with 12. Bxa6 bxa6 doubling the edge pawns - yech.  Not that the current position is much better."
18,Nxd5,f6d5,r1b2rk1/ppp1qpbp/2np2p1/3np3/2B1P3/3PBN2/PPP1QPPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 10,"If 10. ... Nb4 11. c3 Na6 and the Knight is sidelined, with 12. Bxa6 bxa6 doubling the edge pawns - yech.  Not that the current position is much better."
19,exd5,e4d5,r1b2rk1/ppp1qpbp/2np2p1/3Pp3/2B5/3PBN2/PPP1QPPP/R4RK1 b - - 0 10,"If 10. ... Nb4 11. c3 Na6 and the Knight is sidelined, with 12. Bxa6 bxa6 doubling the edge pawns - yech.  Not that the current position is much better."
20,Nd8,c6d8,r1bn1rk1/ppp1qpbp/3p2p1/3Pp3/2B5/3PBN2/PPP1QPPP/R4RK1 w - - 1 11,"If 10. ... Nb4 11. c3 Na6 and the Knight is sidelined, with 12. Bxa6 bxa6 doubling the edge pawns - yech.  Not that the current position is much better."
21,d4,d3d4,r1bn1rk1/ppp1qpbp/3p2p1/3Pp3/2BP4/4BN2/PPP1QPPP/R4RK1 b - - 0 11,I prefer 11. c3 first both to back up this pawn advance and give the Bishop a flight square.
22,b6,b7b6,r1bn1rk1/p1p1qpbp/1p1p2p1/3Pp3/2BP4/4BN2/PPP1QPPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 12,Preparing for Bb7 to pressure the advanced QP.
23,Bg5,e3g5,r1bn1rk1/p1p1qpbp/1p1p2p1/3Pp1B1/2BP4/5N2/PPP1QPPP/R4RK1 b - - 1 12,12. ... Bf6 and the consequent exchange sacrifices the fiancettoed position.  This is cramped though.

29,Be7,g5e7,r1bn1rk1/p1p1Bpbp/1p1p2p1/1B1P1q2/3Pp3/5N2/PPP1QPPP/3R1RK1 b - - 1 15,"Queen exchange, or lose the Knight outright as moving the Queen gives Black time to move the Rook."
