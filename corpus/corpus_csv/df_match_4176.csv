1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The Ruy Lopez.  An opening I often choose as White, with normally plenty of tactical goings-on."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The Ruy Lopez.  An opening I often choose as White, with normally plenty of tactical goings-on."

6,a6,a7a6,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,"Not my usual choice of reply as I prefer to push my own development first with something like Nf6 (Berlin Defence) or Bc6 (Cordel or Classical Defence).  But 3. ... a6 is a popular choice, and while it seems a little slow and often-seen continuation Ba4 b5 Bb3 isn't very good for Black in my experience, a6 on its own is fine."
7,Bxc6,b5c6,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1B5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,"Ordinarily I'd capture towards the centre with bxc6.  This option gives Black the opportunity to more quickly develop, at the expense of a decent pawn centre.  Perhaps not worth it."

9,d3,d2d3,r1bqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1p5/4p3/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,? White is making some slow pawn moves that aren't doing much.

13,Be3,c1e3,r2qkbnr/1pp3pp/p1p2p2/4p3/4P1b1/P2PBN2/1PP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 2 7,"Prepares f5 to supposrt the bishop, which would force the exchange if White plays h3.  Perhaps this whole idea is weak."
