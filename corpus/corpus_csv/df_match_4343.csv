8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1pp1/2n2n1p/4p3/2B1P3/P4N2/1PPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 5,Nf6 Applies pressure to the pawn at e4.

15,Ba2,c4a2,r2qkb1r/ppp2pp1/2n1b2p/3np3/8/P2P1N1P/BPP2PP1/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 8,White's retreat to a2 allows me to comfortably develop in the center.

I did not want to return the knight to f6 and allow white to pressure on the queenside. I avoided b6 because I really wanted to attack white's kingside and b6 would put the knight out of position. Therefore I decided on Nf4."
