1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was a very lucky win. He comes up with a winning combination, but at a crucial moment, he quickly makes an instinctive capture. This turns out to be a mistake. I end up with two queens, trying to avoid a perpetual check, which I do. The question is - could he have played the final position better - could he have got a perpetual? Please let me know your thoughts dear reader!"

12,e5,e7e5,rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/3p1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2N1BP2/PP4PP/R2QKBNR w KQ - 0 7,He continues with the main line.
13,d5,d4d5,rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/3p1np1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N1BP2/PP4PP/R2QKBNR b KQ - 0 7,I close the centre.

18,Bh6,g7h6,rnbq1rk1/ppp2p1p/3p2pb/3Pp3/2P1Pn2/2NBBP2/PP1Q2PP/R3K1NR w KQ - 5 10,"This threatens Nxg2 again, but I am not sure it is correct. On the Gameknot opening databases Nxd3 and f7-f5 have been tried."

I did toy with the idea of Kb1 or Bc2 with the same threat. I will tell you after the next move, why I played Bf1 instead, but first now find black's next move!"
22,Bg7,h6g7,r1bq1rk1/pppn1pbp/3p2p1/3Pp3/2P1Pn2/2N1BP2/PP1Q2PP/2KR1BNR w - - 9 12,"Did you find it? The only other defence g5 runs into 12.g3	Ng6 13. h4	f6 14.	Nh3 and black is losing a pawn. If instead on 11. Bf1 I had played Kb1, then black could have played Nd-c5 with tempo first, attacking my Bd3. After I see to that threat, the final Nh3 is less strong as he can meet Nh3 with Bc8xh3. In the same way, if I had retreated my bishop to c2, he could have played Nb6 with tempo, as it attacks my pawn on c4, and again his Bc8 can capture on h3."
23,g3,g2g3,r1bq1rk1/pppn1pbp/3p2p1/3Pp3/2P1Pn2/2N1BPP1/PP1Q3P/2KR1BNR b - - 0 12,"I only considered taking on f4 very briefly. It is a usual pawn sacrifice in the King's Indian. White would give up his best minor piece, his dark squared bishop and black is ready to exploit the weak black squares. The position is so much easier to play for black. After 12. Bxf4 exf4 13.	Qxf4	f5, his knight has lovely squares on c5, e5 or f6."
