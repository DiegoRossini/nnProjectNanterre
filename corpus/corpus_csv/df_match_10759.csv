1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game is by no means perfect with mistakes from both sides. If you like sacks then there's plenty of them here. This has to go down as one of the most enjoyable games i've played just because of the way it was won. It just shows that some sacks are sound and others are just plain lucky.
I know nothing of the Silician and don't like playing against it either but that's not what this is about.
My comments are from my perspective so feel free to add further comments if you wish. 
hope you enjoy the game, however scrappy it gets :)"
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I'm not a fan of the Sicilian, but i know h6 is not very common. Not on move 2 anyway. Normally i'd expect Nc6 or e6, so h6 left me pretty optimistic. I suppose it stops me playing the knight to g5 or the bishop once it's developed but that does not concern me. Altho maybe it's just a waiting move to see what i'm going to do."

5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1pppp1/7p/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,I just play the Sicilian as normal.
6,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1pppp1/7p/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,I have to protect the pawn.

10,e5,e7e5,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1pp1/5n1p/4p3/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,Chases off my knight

15,Nxe5,f3e5,rnbq1rk1/pp1p1pp1/5n1p/4N3/1b2P3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 8,"I could have and probably should have played Bd2 this time, with blacks next move most likely to be d5 after this. To complete the line 9. Nxd5 Bxd2  10. Nxd2 Nxd5 11. exd5 Qxd5 and it's even.
But i always like to be on the attack as you'll see, and i'll take risks to keep it that way.
So i took the e pawn with my knight, with the intention that when it's chased off by the rook, i'll sack it on f7."
16,Re8,f8e8,rnbqr1k1/pp1p1pp1/5n1p/4N3/1b2P3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 1 9,Sure enough it is chased off. I could back it off and play Ng4!? but black just plays Nxe4 and gets the pawn back and also has the better position....
17,Nxf7,e5f7,rnbqr1k1/pp1p1Np1/5n1p/8/1b2P3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 9,So i decided that i would continue my attack anyway.

21,bxc3,b2c3,rnbqr3/pp1p1kp1/5n1p/8/4P3/2PB4/P1P2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 11,I have to retake. One advantage is that there are plenty of open files and diagonals for me to exploit and blacks king looks pretty vunerable.
22,Nxe4,f6e4,rnbqr3/pp1p1kp1/7p/8/4n3/2PB4/P1P2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 12,Nxe4?? This is a very bad move. It gives white the piece back. After 12.Bxe4 Qf6 13.Qh5  g6 14.Bd5  Ke7 15.Qxh6 white is clearly winning. If black took the Bishop after Bxe4 then Qf3  wins the rook.
23,Bc4+,d3c4,rnbqr3/pp1p1kp1/7p/8/2B1n3/2P5/P1P2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 12,"Fortunately for black and for the game in the end, i missed it and played Bc4 ?? throwing away the advantage. I was too busy concentrating on how to expose blacks king."

28,d6,d7d6,rnbq1k2/pp4p1/3pr2p/3Q4/2B1n3/B1P5/P1P2PPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 15,Bringing my rook across focusing on the strong e file which i intend opening at some point.
