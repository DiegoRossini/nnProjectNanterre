1. Identify the key elements that you need to have present in order to launch a successful attack
2. How to execute a successful attack?"
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,This is known as the counter gambit openning. The advantage from black's prespective is that he gains rapid development and good use of open lines.
3,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3pP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,very good! Bobervig plays to his strenghts and avoids playing into something he does not know.
4,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3pPb2/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"?? not so good Bobervig should have continued to develop pieces toward the centre. The game of chess is in many ways about time. In chess books this is often referred to as ""initative"" or ""tempo"". What this means is that the one who is ahead in development or ahead by a move. 

to remember this idea, think of is as if Bobervig just forfeited his turn. H3 has no value as a move because it does not threaten anything, develop a piece or challenge for the centre. Therefore, he might as well have waved his right to play and allow black to play two moves to his one. 

For the rest of this game bobervig is essentailly playing behind by two moves."

6,e6,e7e6,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3pPb2/8/7P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"I am not in the business of slaughtering but prompting growth. Therefore I play an inferior move to allow bobervig a chance to play things through. A better move is Nc6 develop a knight or C5 adding to my control of the center. However, 3. ...C5!? is risker becaue it invites 4. Bb5+

Here is a question for you? If black plays 3. ...C5!? and white replies with 4. Bb5+ what should be black's next move?"
7,a3,a2a3,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3pPb2/8/P6P/1PPP1PP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"Playing Nd7 here is a classical example of simple attacking dynamics 

Q.what is an attack?
A. An attack is the threat of winning material or checkmate. Most successful attacks begin with the simple plan of winning material i.e. a pawn. From there it builds to gaining control of open lines, superior space, winning minor pieces, winning major pieces and then finally winning the king. The number one reason for failed attacks is over estimating or going for more than what is possible. For example the odds of you winning a rook(major piece) within the first 20 moves is very rare. So set the goal of winning a pawn, as your first attacking objective. 

In this position I am threatening to win a pawn with ...Nxe5. So white is forced to defend the threat in order to keep the balance."

9,d4,d2d4,r2qkbnr/pppn1ppp/4p3/3pPb2/3P4/P6P/1PP2PP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,An ok move that supports e5 but in my opinon Nf3 is better.
10,c5,c7c5,r2qkbnr/pp1n1ppp/4p3/2ppPb2/3P4/P6P/1PP2PP1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"!! This is a great move that puts alot of pressure on white's centre. 

The attacking dyanmic at play here is that black is threatening to win space."
11,c3,c2c3,r2qkbnr/pp1n1ppp/4p3/2ppPb2/3P4/P1P4P/1P3PP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,"?? This is wrong on several fronts
1. it hinders the white knight by denying it.s natural developing sqaure
2. too many pawn moves, white need to get his pieces out. Does he expect to win the game with just his pawns?
Better is Nf3 which defense the centre and develops a piece.

If after 6.Nf3 is 6. ...cxd4 good to play for black, give a supporting line to support your answer?"
12,Qc7,d8c7,r3kbnr/ppqn1ppp/4p3/2ppPb2/3P4/P1P4P/1P3PP1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 7,"...Qc7 is following simple attacking dyanmics. Also please note the influence that the e5 pawn has had on my king side. My kingside is completely undeveloped. So my goal as black is to attack e5 by undermining it with cxd4 and create some space to place my king side pieces. The idea of queen side castling is too risky because I have already weakened c7,g7,and h7 by playing ...c5."
13,Bb5,f1b5,r3kbnr/ppqn1ppp/4p3/1BppPb2/3P4/P1P4P/1P3PP1/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 7,good bobervig is finally moving his peices out! this is a great pin that slows black's developmet down a bit.
14,Ne7,g8e7,r3kb1r/ppqnnppp/4p3/1BppPb2/3P4/P1P4P/1P3PP1/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 3 8,Looking to find a home on c6. From there is puts a lot of pressure on d4
15,Nf3,g1f3,r3kb1r/ppqnnppp/4p3/1BppPb2/3P4/P1P2N1P/1P3PP1/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 4 8,very good develops a peice and supports the centre.
16,Nc6,e7c6,r3kb1r/ppqn1ppp/2n1p3/1BppPb2/3P4/P1P2N1P/1P3PP1/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 5 9,"?? there is no way that this will work because half his army is still at home. The rule is do not attack until you have completed your development. 

This is a great place to talk about the KEY ELEMENTS of a successful attack.

1. Piece superiority in the area of attack
2. Space advantage in the area of attack
3. control of open lines in the area of attack
4. Harmonious communication between pieces in the general area of attack

In this case white plays the attacking move 9.b4. For him none of the key elements exist. However, the situation is the exact opposite for black!

1. Black has piece superiority-3 pieces to white 1 that directly influence the c5 sqaure
2. Black clearly has a space advantage on the queen side
3. there is no open lines in the area so this is equal for both sides( this is the only thing that black does not have)
4. Black's pieces are in harmony- Black has 4 active pieces in the area of attack verses white's 1 piece. 

So if black has 3 out the 4 conditions then..."

This leads us to the next phase: How does one execute a successful attack. Here is the step by step process:
1. Create threats
2. Increase your space advantage by marshalling all or most of your pieces to attack squares that force your opponent to push pawns up to create weaknesses
3. Restrict the mobilty and influence of your opponents pieces
4. force through a breakthrough that usaully results in a mating attack on the king or massive lost of material. 

In this position I execute the first step in the attacking plan. My threat is to win a pawn via ...axb4"
