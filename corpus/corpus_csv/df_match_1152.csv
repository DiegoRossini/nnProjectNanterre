13,g4,g2g4,r1bq1rk1/pppnbppp/4pn2/3p4/3P1BP1/4PN1P/PPPN1P2/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 7,"Good, black seeks for counterplay on the queenside."

26,g6,g7g6,r1bqnrk1/3nbp1p/4p1p1/p2pP1N1/1ppP1BPP/2P5/PPQN1P2/R3KB1R w KQ - 0 14,"I need more support to the N in order to play h5. My attack is far from solid, here."
