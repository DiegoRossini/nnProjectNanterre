As I see it, it's almost certain that the black bishop would be exchanged for my knight so I don't have to force it. I wanted to play that before black plays Nbd7, cause then he would have the Qa5 move. Now if the black Queen goes to a5, I will take on f6 and black will have a bad pawn structure."

26,Nbd7,b8d7,r2q1rk1/pp1n1pp1/2b1pn1p/8/2BP3B/P1P2P2/2Q3PP/R3K1NR w KQ - 1 14,The treat here is 15. 0-0 Bxf3 16. Rxf3 Qxc4 winning a pawn. So I had to defend or move my bishop. I didn't played Qd3 cause I thought that there would be many pins after some rook goes to d8. So I decided to move the bishop and I needed it to be behind my queen so that I can manage a mate attack or something in the future. Thats why I played it on a2.

However, I had thought that I might sacrifice the a4 pawn. It, at least, means that black had spent one more move with his bishop before placing it on b5. Move that I might use to attack."
