It immediately questions whites presence in the centre, so from move 2 they're having to think for themselves a bit."

5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"The most common choice, anticipating 3. Nxd5 and following that with 4. c4, building a central presence. If white defends the pawn with 3. c4 black can gambit a pawn with c6 or e6, which leads to long-term problems for white. It's not really a clever idea on whites part."

Whether this is worth a whole pawn is something no-one can prove for sure. But fingers crossed i can make a case for it in this game by winning."

Ultimately white never really develops an opportunity to mount an effective attack on it.  I can easily move king whatshisname to the relatively safe a8 square if needed; the fact white has traded off their White sq. bishop helps its security there."

Nxe4 13. fxe4 Bxe4 to win back the pawn, but then if white goes 14 Ng3! the most likely continuation is exd4 15. Bd2 d3+ 16. Kh1 dxc2 17. Qg4+ f5 Bxa5 fxg4 19. Nxe4 which means black has traded a knight for three extra pawns, but with an atrocious pawn formation that aint worth it. Another is 12. Bxe4 13. fxe4 exd4 (13. Nxe4? loses to 14. Qd3! Nf6 15. Qf5+.) 14. Nxd4 Re8 15.c3 Rxe4 16. b4 Qc7 17. bxc5 Ng4 18. g3 Nxe3 which wins the pawn back for a big piece trade-off. 12. Bb6 keeps the game positional and unclear to white what they should do next."

A 'safe' move like 13. c3 gives me options like Nxe4 14. fxe4 bxe4 15. Rxf7 Qd5! Which gives me good chances. Who knows what else could have happened, we're past the games database now. To me that feels a bit like leaving my cuddly home and going camping, where for some reason certain people find it funny to spray fires with deodarent."
