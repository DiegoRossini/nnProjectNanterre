1,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"hmmm bad luck for me.. its not the e4 move but its f4.. In some variations of the french defence, The winawer as example f4 is playd in a later state.. therefore i still replied with e6 with keeping the possibility in gaining that position open"
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Still possible. But Also kept in mind that there is a good change that we wont end up in a french defence variation.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/5P2/5N2/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Still possible. But Also kept in mind that there is a good change that we wont end up in a french defence variation.

5,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/5P2/4PN2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"Okay, well in the french defence the e pawn normally goes to e4 instead. So maybe its time to drop that idea for black. however as said before.. the pawn position that you go for in the French Defence, also looks strong here. So I just proceed with that way of developing."

10,Bd6,f8d6,r1bqk1nr/pp3ppp/2nbp3/2pp4/5P2/4PN2/PPPPB1PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 4 6,b3 gives white the opportunity to set the white dark bisschop on the long diagonal.

However, this migt take some time.. My dark bisschop is attacking the f4. When he plays e4 white will lose the defence on f4. I also want a to let my white bisschop go to a better square. I prefer to do so without blocking other options. Bisschop looks strong on b7 but on the other side.. there is a lot material in the way for that long diagonal. Also the knight on f3, is overprotected. On a later state, I also want some options to do something on white queenside of the board.. therefore I do believe that the move a5 makes sense. If I can push that pawn fun further on the a file.. It might give white holes. If I get it to a3 it also might irritate white darks bisschop. Plus, I leave the option to move my light bisschop to a6. 

It might be a bit odd to make the move cause the idea to make some brakes in the white pawn structure.. However.. to do that quick, white needs to weaken his pawn structure a bit more."

I think whites idea is to go to g3 or h5 and attack on my kingfile. Specially when I castle. I do have enough faith in my own position to handle this attacking idea at this point. + I also need to bring my king into a save position.

The knight is developed now, disadvantage point of it, its blocking the diagonal but Nb5 looks like a good move for white.. I want to keep my dark square on the at this point silly looking diagonal. So I have want to avoid white knight to come to b5. easiest way is to play Ba6 here. But often, I do prefer a counter attack"

The main threat is going for the e3 square here. Cause of black is attacking the pawn on e3, white probably needs to defend the pawn. Bd1 looks a bit weird.. Same as Nd1, both options will make the Rook on a1 looks imprisoned. Same counts for Bc1. but for Bc1, also counts that the strong placed bisschop left its diagonal."

At this point, look how important it was to play a5 instead of Bb7 right away. This saved me one tempo and Ba6 looks attractive now."

At this point, look how important it was to play a5 instead of Bb7 right away. This saved me one tempo and Ba6 looks attractive now. However, the e3 square is defended by the queen.. I do have a center brake here cause of that.. the square d4 is defended twice.. 1, the Knight on f3, 2 the pawn on e3. ( the e3 pawn has to leave the square that I want for my Knight ) I also uses the disadvantaged side of the whites 10th move (Nc3). 2 options here: Ba6 or the center brake.. Well easy decision for me."
