1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This is my first attempt at an annotation so any constructive criticism would be welcomed. I have enjoyed and benefited from other annotations and this is my attempt to return the favour. I am no expert on openenings and so will leave most of my comments until a little later on in the game

I like this move as it either forces whites queen onto a black square restricting it's movement, or white can block the attack with his knight. If his knight doesn't move I can move the bishop to g5 to help defend the f7 pawn"

At this point the Gameknot database has 2 games, one where black wins and one white, so I guess the game is evenl;y balanced, though I prefer blacks position, the white queen seems awkwardly placed to me and whites dsb isn't going anywhere fast"
