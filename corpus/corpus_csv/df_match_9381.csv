it was an untimely move and playing it at the point that I did contributed to the loss , but the idea was sound . My queen was definding d5 . In the event that your c4 pawn takes (and it did) my dpawn the queen would be brought the same diagonal as my king , with that diagonal open to my king , your light squared bishop could ( if the bishop were defended then win my queen .... but the move was definitely premature and wasted time in this particular game"
