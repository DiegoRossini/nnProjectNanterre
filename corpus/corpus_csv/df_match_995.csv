1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The oldest move in the book. I prefer d4 over e4, but it's a matter of personal taste. e4 suits his preferences far better."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The Sicilian. Knowing Bert, I figured we'd be playing the Alapin variation. It's an interesting anti Sicilian weapon that you don't see all that often these days, but it's an opening that has been played by players of all levels for decades."
3,c3,c2c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"And we're playing the Alapin. The Alapin is also sometimes refered to as the anti-Sicilian. It's a pain in the ass to play against if you're not familiar with the main lines and if black somewhat cooperates than it can quickly transpose into main lines of different openings. For example it could transpose into a main line of the advanced French Defense if black responds with d5 which was long thought to be the best move after 1. e4 c5 2. c3 d5 3. e5. It can also transpose into a main line of a declined Smith Morra gambit if white plays the most popular move Nf6 via 1. e4 c5 2. c3 Nf6 3. e5 Nd5. Playing e6, which prepares d5 is arguably the most solid response by black, but is also closely related to the French defense and thus very often transposes into it. There are more examples, but I think you can catch the gist. The Alapin is used to draw Sicilian players into openings they're not familiar with and as a result often proves fatal for unprepared players. Both sides have to know the core ideas behind the transposition they'll move into."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,I choose for the Nf6 variation since I'm not confident in my ability to win against my opponent in an advanced French. The rest from here is known theory so I will not bother annotating the next few moves.
5,e5,e4e5,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p1P3/8/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"The first move that's not maintheory. The maintheory would follow with 5. Nf3 Nc6 6. cxd4. for as far as I'm aware. There's probably theory around this move as well, but I tried to ask myself, why is Bc4 not the main move? And it occured to me that the knight on d5 is easily attacked. The reason is because we get to play Nb6, chasing away the bishop and putting the knight on a pretty good square."

10,Nb6,d5b6,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/1n6/4P3/2Bp4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 6,The other option in the gameknot database Bd3 has rather bad results. This is the only real option for the bishop in my opinion.

12,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/1nn5/4P3/3p4/1BP5/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 4 7,"After this move I'm sort of in the dark for as far as theory goes. It probably continues with d6, though after that I'm not sure if I'd want to develop the dark squared bishop via a fianchetto. Also an extra note which I thought of a week after playing this game: I could have played dxc3 which a lot of lower rated players most likely would have done and which I seriously considered mind you. However that allows Nxc3. After which white has an overwhelming lead in development and enough space in my opinion to do something with it. dxc3 Nxc3 Nc6 and white is doing just fine. In this position White can even got as far as consider the move f4 in my opinion and really cramp Black's position. Either that or Nf3 d6 Bf6. Black can't respond with dxe5 because of Nxe5, targeting the f7 square. Nxe5 Bxe5 is probably needed after that. Then it's questionable what Black plays. The trade of queens means a centralised rook on an already vulnerable position so it's most likely not the answer. Developing the light squared bishop probably gets met with Nb5 threatening a fork and really pouring on the pressure. e6, trying to develop the dark squared bishop has the same problem. Then there's f6, chasing away the bishop, but it can just retreat and then continue it's attack with the Nb5 combination later. That is of course but one variation, black isn't forced to play d6 after all, but I think you get my point when I say that white gets adequate compensation."
13,cxd4,c3d4,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/1nn5/4P3/3P4/1B6/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 7,"e6! According to my opponent it's not the most active nor most played variation. If someone could be so good to inform me what the most popular reply is, you'd have my gratitude. The position reminds me of some strange French defence. Black has to be incredibly careful here because the f7 pawn is rather weak and white might have ideas of f4."
14,e6,e7e6,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/1nn1p3/4P3/3P4/1B6/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 8,"e6! According to my opponent it's not the most active nor most played variation.

15,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/1nn1p3/4P3/3P4/1BN5/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 8,"Developing another piece and watching over the e4 and d5 square. The pin of Bb4 seems good, but I have my doubts wether or not I can afford to wait a move to undermine his center."
16,d6,d7d6,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/1nnpp3/4P3/3P4/1BN5/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 9,"I was considering to play d5, but I think a trade has to be forced here. If white develops solidly then black's position will eventually get too cramped and his light squared bishop will become a nightmare. Also it's hard for my knights to reach the other side of the board right now where they'll eventually be needed. if a trade is forced then my knights will probably get a little more room to move so that I can eventually develop my light squared bishop. I anticipate Bf4 developing a minor piece as well as aiding in the dxe issue."
17,Bf4,c1f4,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/1nnpp3/4P3/3P1B2/1BN5/PP3PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 1 9,"As anticipated, probably the best response."
18,dxe5,d6e5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/1nn1p3/4p3/3P1B2/1BN5/PP3PPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 0 10,Bxe5 wouldn't work because of f6 so this is the correct way to recapture. Now the queens are staring at each other.
19,dxe5,d4e5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/1nn1p3/4P3/5B2/1BN5/PP3PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 0 10,Bxe5 wouldn't work because of f6 so this is the correct way to recapture. Now the queens are staring at each other.
20,Qxd1+,d8d1,r1b1kb1r/pp3ppp/1nn1p3/4P3/5B2/1BN5/PP3PPP/R2qK1NR w KQkq - 0 11,"This might not be neccesary, but I think his queen was going to prove stronger then mine in the end. The plan is 11. Rxd1  Bb4 12. Nf3 O-O 13. O-O After that I can start working on moving my knight on b6 so that eventually I can play b6 and Bb7."
21,Rxd1,a1d1,r1b1kb1r/pp3ppp/1nn1p3/4P3/5B2/1BN5/PP3PPP/3RK1NR b Kkq - 0 11,"At this point it was time to asses the position. Bert told me that he was quite pleased about his position, but that he doesn't like his dark squared bishop which indeed isn't too great. I think Black's position is quite decent and rather easy to play. The plans for both sides should be to finish development and improve our bad pieces. In my case it's my bishop on c8, in his case his bishop on g4. The position is in my opinion slightly in favor of white because black has a hard time gaining presence in the center, but black's position is really solid and thus hard to break through."
22,Bb4,f8b4,r1b1k2r/pp3ppp/1nn1p3/4P3/1b3B2/1BN5/PP3PPP/3RK1NR w Kkq - 1 12,"Pinning the knight and developing to a good square. Bc5 targets the weak f2 square, but Black has no presence to take advantage of it so I chose Bb4 instead."
23,Bg5,f4g5,r1b1k2r/pp3ppp/1nn1p3/4P1B1/1b6/1BN5/PP3PPP/3RK1NR b Kkq - 2 12,"Questionable in my opinion, but it has its merits. Black could grab a pawn here but it gets met by Rd8 checkmate. Aside from setting up that obvious little trap there's more merit to this, namely getting his bishop to a better square. I decide to get my king to safety."
24,O-O,e8g8,r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/1nn1p3/4P1B1/1b6/1BN5/PP3PPP/3RK1NR w K - 3 13,"Didn't see this one coming, but it fits our vision to always play for a win.. I'm not sure how this attack would work, but it'll be interesting to see how he pulls it off. I think adding more pawns to the attack is too dangerous, but probably neccesary if you go all-out. His king has already become quite a bit more vulnerable now though. I think it was better for white to just develop and play some positional chess ( though that's the type of chess he dislikes and I'm best at ).  It's not quite clear how black should proceed from here."
25,f4,f2f4,r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/1nn1p3/4P1B1/1b3P2/1BN5/PP4PP/3RK1NR b K - 0 13,"Didn't see this one coming, but it fits our vision to always play for a win..

It not only attacks the bishop with the intention of giving him doubled pawns, but also frees the a4-e8 diagonal for my bishop to move into after Bd7. After that my rooks will be connected and I can maybe punish his questionable king safety. Black should be better here."
27,Bc2,b3c2,r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/1n2p3/n3P1B1/1b3P2/2N5/PPB3PP/3RK1NR b K - 2 14,Moving the bishop out of the way.
28,Bd7,c8d7,r4rk1/pp1b1ppp/1n2p3/n3P1B1/1b3P2/2N5/PPB3PP/3RK1NR w K - 3 15,"A mistake on my part in my opinion. I should have taken his knight, created an isolated pawn on c3 and then I should have played this move. This move gives him the time to play Ne2."
