Things are even worse after a deep think though. The lines get a bit sharp but are worth looking at. The continuation will be axb5, cxb5, Nd4 after which Black can branch:

1. ... Bc6?!, Naxb5, Qd7 (Qb6??, Ra6!) Nxc6, Nxc6, Nd4 with a lost position
2. ... Nc6, Naxb5, Qb7, Nxc6, Bxc6, Rxa7!, Rxa7,  (Bxg2, Rxb7, Bxb7 shouldn't give enough compensation for the queen) Nxa7, Qxa7, Bxc6+"
