1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was a fun one. Playing against a 1600+ opponent for the first time here at Gameknot, I not only held my own, but walked away with a victory. I think that the key to winning this one was my edge in development, as that allowed me to make multiple threats in quick succession that my opponent just couldn't match."
