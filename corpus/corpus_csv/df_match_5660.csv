1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Is this rook sac really sound? In this game my opponent sacrificed a rook early on. Although black seems to not have enough compensation, I was unable to find a way to consolidate and lost quickly. Has anyone seen this sacrifice before? Also - where did I go wrong? The post-match computer analysis doesn't record any mistake by me until the last few moves, when it is clearly lost for me - although it claims - perhaps wrongly - that the sacrifice was a mistake. Your comments would be most welcome!"
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,So black defends against my queen's pawn with the Indian defences
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,I continue with the most commonly played move
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Black shows an indication to play the King's Indian or Grunfeld Defence
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,And I continue with the most commonly played move.
6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,And black plays the Grunfeld
7,f3,f2f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3p4/2PP4/2N2P2/PP2P1PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"This is a quirky, rarely played move. Someone played it as white against me. In the first game I met it, I lost, and I adopted it for a while, and enjoyed some successes with it. I am not sure that I would still play it against an equally rated opponent. My opponent was then rated about 1600, and I played it in a ""give him a chance"" frame of mind. Perhaps my lose can be traced to this move?"
8,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/5np1/2pp4/2PP4/2N2P2/PP2P1PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"This is the best reply, which has scored well for black."
9,dxc5,d4c5,rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/5np1/2Pp4/2P5/2N2P2/PP2P1PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"pxd5 seems to transpose into the normal exchange variation of the Grunfeld, where f3 is not normally played. dxc5 scores better in the Gameknot opening databases."
10,d4,d5d4,rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/5np1/2P5/2Pp4/2N2P2/PP2P1PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,d4 is the only move in the database
11,Nb5,c3b5,rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/5np1/1NP5/2Pp4/5P2/PP2P1PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 6,and in the same way Nb5 is the only move in the database
12,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pp2pp1p/2n2np1/1NP5/2Pp4/5P2/PP2P1PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 7,"White won both the games on the database when black played the alternative e5, although I am not convinced that e5 is not playable."
13,e3,e2e3,r1bqkb1r/pp2pp1p/2n2np1/1NP5/2Pp4/4PP2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 7,Again e3 is the only move on the database.
14,e5,e7e5,r1bqkb1r/pp3p1p/2n2np1/1NP1p3/2Pp4/4PP2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 8,"There is one game with pxe3 on the database, but white won it. e5 is the only other move on the database."
15,exd4,e3d4,r1bqkb1r/pp3p1p/2n2np1/1NP1p3/2PP4/5P2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 8,"Again, the only move on the World database of Gameknot."
16,Nxd4,c6d4,r1bqkb1r/pp3p1p/5np1/1NP1p3/2Pn4/5P2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 9,White won both the games with exd4
17,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqkb1r/pp3p1p/5np1/1NP1p1B1/2Pn4/5P2/PP4PP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 1 9,"Now there are two games in the database with this position. Pomes Marcet, J… (2390) vs. Martinez, A. (2220) continued with Be7 and a draw. Nestorovic, Dej… (2424) vs. Misailovic, Neb… (2335) continued with Bxc5 10. Nxd4 exd4 11. Bd3 and black eventually won. But I thought ""Hang on, if he takes on c5 I can just win the rook on a8""."
18,Bxc5,f8c5,r1bqk2r/pp3p1p/5np1/1Nb1p1B1/2Pn4/5P2/PP4PP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 10,"But he did take on c5. The post-game computer of Gameknot records this as a mistake, and gives white an advantage of +2.2 now."
19,Bxf6,g5f6,r1bqk2r/pp3p1p/5Bp1/1Nb1p3/2Pn4/5P2/PP4PP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 10,So I did grab the material.
20,Qxf6,d8f6,r1b1k2r/pp3p1p/5qp1/1Nb1p3/2Pn4/5P2/PP4PP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 11,he retakes the bishop of course.
