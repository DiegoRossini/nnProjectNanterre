1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The English opening. I couldn't find any games that my opponent previously played so I didn't know what he would play. I had prepared an opening for e4 and d4, but not for c4. I don't know the theory behind it, but it's a pretty interesting opening."

Yes it's probably main theory in the English ( I haven't checked yet ), but it feels so meek. I suppose this is because I myself play the queen gambit which of course starts with d4 and thus I'm not accustomed to the entire d3 idea."

This move isn't necessarily the best move, but I decided that I didn't want to allow my opponent to be in his comfort zone any longer so i tried breaking open the center.

Not only are you blocking the good diagonal of White's light squared bishop, giving it less scope but you also make d3 a target in the future.Yes you get a little center control due to it, but I don't consider it adequate compensation."

20,Qd8,d5d8,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2n3p1/2p5/4P3/3P1NP1/PP3PBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 11,"I was pondering on retreating to d7 or d6, but I didn't want to obstruct my bishop and if Qd6 is played then he gets Bf4 with tempo which I didn't want to allow so I opt for retreating to d8."
21,Rb1,a1b1,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2n3p1/2p5/4P3/3P1NP1/PP3PBP/1RBQ1RK1 b - - 2 11,"Another questionable move in my opinion, not because it's bad but because there are better alternatives. The idea behind Rb1 is simple. My bishop on g7 is attacking the pawn on b2 and as a result his dark squared bishop can't develop, so he plays Rb1 so he can develop it in the future. That being said Qc2 accomplished the exact same thing, but also threatens the c5 pawn and develops his queen so I don't understand why he didn't just play Qc2."
22,Nb4,c6b4,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/2p5/1n2P3/3P1NP1/PP3PBP/1RBQ1RK1 w - - 3 12,This move ensures I win a pawn since it attacks both a2 and d3 which got weakened as a result of the previous e4 move and he can't defend both. That being said I do still need to be careful when I win a pawn since the knight can become a a subject to pins/skewers and whatnot if it for example were to take on d3.
23,Be3,c1e3,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/2p5/1n2P3/3PBNP1/PP3PBP/1R1Q1RK1 b - - 4 12,Questioning my pawn on c5 and preventing Nxa2 due to Bxc5 which gets my knight in awkward position where it has trouble with retreating.

I was thinking whether or not I could get away with for example Nxd3 but for some reason I didn't end up playing it. Maybe because I was scared of moves like Qc2 Nb4 Rfd1 but looking back to it, it isn't much to fear. The idea behind b6 is to not only protect c5 and a a result make his dark squared bishop less valuable, but also to play Ba6 if he would play d4. Example: 13. d4 Ba6 14. Re1 Nd3 15. Rf1 Nxb2 16. Re1 Nd3. It doesn't win a lot of material for Black, but it's something White will have to be wary of for quite some time."
25,Ne1,f3e1,r1bq1rk1/p3ppbp/1p4p1/2p5/1n2P3/3PB1P1/PP3PBP/1R1QNRK1 b - - 1 13,"Not a big fan of this move, but it's understandable why he played it. He wants to avoid Nxd3 by defending it as it would give up the little center control he had. That being said, a knight on e1 isn't a lot to be scared of."
26,Nxa2,b4a2,r1bq1rk1/p3ppbp/1p4p1/2p5/4P3/3PB1P1/nP3PBP/1R1QNRK1 w - - 0 14,After a long time of thinking I capture on a2. I was calculating stuff along the lines of 13. Ne1 Nxa2 14. e5 Rb8 15. Qa4 Nb4 16. Qxa7 but found that it isn't really an issue. The White queen isn't helping in his defense over there and I'll be able to win the pawn on e5.

The reason being because it blocks of the escape of the White queen and maybe it'll be possible in the future to win the queen. The queen would have nowhere to run after Ba6. Bf5 is played to target the weak d3 pawn which is logical enough I suppose.
31,Qxa7,a4a7,1rbq1rk1/Q3ppbp/1p4p1/2p1P3/1n6/3PB1P1/1P3PBP/1R2NRK1 b - - 0 16,This might be an inaccuracy on my part and I wonder if Ba6 isn't better.

He needs to make these type of moves since, if he waits I'll capture the d-pawn, then win the e-pawn, trade everything off and you're suddenly down in an endgame with 2 pawns down. Even if it means trading off, White's strong bishop, he cant' just turtle up and do nothing."

Not only was Bxe4 probably better, but maybe I could have just played Nxd3 here. I didn't go for it since I was a little scared off creating a weakness on the g-file, but looking back on it this isn't that big of a deal considering the limited amount of pieces White would have left. I also would be up 2 pawns, meaning an easy endgame."
