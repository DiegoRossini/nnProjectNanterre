1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game was very exciting. At each move I was looking forward to what my opponent would have done. I don't know if it is tactically brilliant; but it was exciting to explore the different tales which the chessboard could tell, depending on each move."

18,b6,b7b6,r1bq1rk1/p3npbp/1pnpp1p1/2p5/4PP2/2NPBNP1/PPP3BP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 10,"I was more used to 9. Nd4, 9. ... a6 and 9. ... Rb8. The point is probably to defend c5 in order to advance in d5, but the black must be careful with that diagonal. Seemingly this is a book move, so I won't protest about that."
19,Qe1,d1e1,r1bq1rk1/p3npbp/1pnpp1p1/2p5/4PP2/2NPBNP1/PPP3BP/R3QRK1 b - - 1 10,"The queen might choose d2, however if the Black plays d5, he threatens d4, and one must think of a good position for the bishop. This might be d2. Moreover, I can choose to play: 10. ... d5 11. exd5 exd5 12. Bd2 Re8 13. Rf2 Nf5 14. Re2."
20,Ba6,c8a6,r2q1rk1/p3npbp/bpnpp1p1/2p5/4PP2/2NPBNP1/PPP3BP/R3QRK1 w - - 2 11,Unexpected. The bishop leaves the diagonal unguarded to pin the d-pawn. I would have played 10. ... d5.
21,g4,g3g4,r2q1rk1/p3npbp/bpnpp1p1/2p5/4PPP1/2NPBN2/PPP3BP/R3QRK1 b - - 0 11,"This might come somewhat unprepared, especially because the Black is about to play d5, and then there will be less chances to attack on the side. However, I needed a bit more space to maneuver, and I played Qe1 to use the e1-h4 diagonal, after all!"

24,Qd7,d8d7,r4rk1/p2qn1bp/bpnpp1p1/2p2pN1/4PPP1/2NPB3/PPP3BP/R3QRK1 w - - 2 13,"Usually one takes with g. In this particular case, however, I couldn't wait to boast my bishop with a longer diagonal. The Nc6 is pinned."

26,gxf5,g6f5,r4rk1/p2qn1bp/bpnpp3/2p2pN1/5PP1/2NPB3/PPP3BP/R3QRK1 w - - 0 14,I think that taking by e eliminates one weakness.
27,Bd2,e3d2,r4rk1/p2qn1bp/bpnpp3/2p2pN1/5PP1/2NP4/PPPB2BP/R3QRK1 b - - 1 14,I have no interest in taking in f5 at the moment. e6 is a more attractive target. It has become *the* target.
28,Nd4,c6d4,r4rk1/p2qn1bp/bp1pp3/2p2pN1/3n1PP1/2NP4/PPPB2BP/R3QRK1 w - - 2 15,"Well, this was truly unexpected. I thought the Nc6 was pinned."

The big threat of the Black now is Dc6-g2#. From g3 the Queen controls g2. However, Qf2, which also controls g2, cannot be played, since the Black would threaten mate in h1."
34,b5,b6b5,r5k1/pb1qn1bp/3pp3/1pp2pN1/3n1PP1/2NP2Q1/PPPB3P/2R2RK1 w - - 0 18,"The Black spotted another weakness: the e2 square, where the knight might fork the royal couple."

18. gxf5 Ndxf5 19. Qg4 Bd4+ 20. Rf2 Ng6 21. Re1 Re8 22. Nce4 Rf8 23. a4 Bxf2+ 24. Nxf2 e5 25. axb5 exf4 26. Bxf4 Nxf4 27. Qxf4 Qxb5

I don't know. For the moment Kf2 solves the problem of the fork, but even more importantly, it prepares Rg1. Without a counterattack, the Black is bound to open the lines and slaughter the white soldiers!"
36,e5,e6e5,r5k1/pb1qn1bp/3p4/1pp1ppN1/3n1PP1/2NP2Q1/PPPB1K1P/2R2R2 w - - 0 19,"The computer is unhappy again: â€¦ h6 19. Nh3 Nf3 20. g5 hxg5 21. Be3 b4 22. Nd1 g4 23. Ng5 Nxg5 24. fxg5 Kf7 25. Bd2

The point of e5 is opening new lines. However, this might have been more effectively prepared with Rf8.
You have to think that at each move the threats b4, Qc6, e5, d5, Rf8, must be accurately calculated... the risk is terribly high!"
