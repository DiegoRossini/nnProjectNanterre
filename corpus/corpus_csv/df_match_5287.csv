1,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Van't Kuijs opening (A00), is a opening that does not give out central control. (For anyone that does this opening: You can still play it, but you have to perform an entire opening sequence that helps you gain control of e4,d4, e5, d5.)"
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/8/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,best opening move performed by black
3,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2B5/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,I didn't like this move and the reason is that your opponent wouldn't magically play the f-pawn on their second move. It is suicidal.
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/2B5/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 3,Tackles the bishop's line.
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/2B5/4PN2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 3,The usual knight developement. A correct play.
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/2B5/4PN2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 4,"The play is even, with nothing to risk."
7,h4,h2h4,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/2B4P/4PN2/PPPP1PP1/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,White played a ridiculous move that wastes time. The correct move was 4.d4.
8,Bd6,f8d6,r1bqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/2nbp3/2p5/2B4P/4PN2/PPPP1PP1/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 5,I didn't like this move too much. 4...d5 was a better opportunity for advancement
9,Ng5,f3g5,r1bqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/2nbp3/2p3N1/2B4P/4P3/PPPP1PP1/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 5,White decided to mess up my ability to castle on his next move or probably had his knight tempt my queen (which is not going to happen).
10,Nh6,g8h6,r1bqk2r/pp1p1ppp/2nbp2n/2p3N1/2B4P/4P3/PPPP1PP1/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 3 6,"I spotted 6.Nf7, but it isn't really necessary. Better was 5...Ne5!."

21,h6,h5h6,r1bqk2r/pp1p1p1p/4p1pP/2p2nN1/5P2/3B4/PPPP1PP1/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 11,The pawn is trapped and White is forced to find strong developement options or he will slowly crumble.
