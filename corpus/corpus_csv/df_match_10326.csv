This is my first annotated game. I assume that my audience has some intermediate knowledge of the opening, so I do not go into theory, mostly strategies and concrete variations. This is just a practice run against a weaker opponent. My future games will be played and annotated much better."

I should have exploited this with an immediate ..d5. I did not, and he should have went with an immediate e4. He does not, however, and the game soon shifts in black's favor."
