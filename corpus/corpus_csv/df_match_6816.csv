17,Nxe5,f3e5,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/1nn5/4N2b/8/1BNP3P/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 9,"And here it comes. Since this was a correspondence game, White must have calculated the long forced sequence before making this move. But that doesn't make it any less impressive. White is sacing the Queen just to drag out the Black King to the middle of the board. There isn't a direct, forced mate but White knows that Black would have to relinquish a great deal of material to save his King."
18,Bxd1,h5d1,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/1nn5/4N3/8/1BNP3P/PPP2PP1/R1BbK2R w KQkq - 0 10,Not capturing the Queen would have been better but how can you resist the adventure? Objectively speaking even after 9...Nxe5 10. Qxh5 White has a very good position. But now we are in for a treat.
19,Bxf7+,b3f7,r2qkb1r/ppp2Bpp/1nn5/4N3/8/2NP3P/PPP2PP1/R1BbK2R b KQkq - 0 10,What now? Capturing the Queen with 12. Bxd8 would give up the attack and White would find himself a piece down.

The best way to remove this threat would have been giving back back the Queen with 14...Qxg5 but after 15. c3+ Ke3 16. fxg5 followed by 17. 0-0, the Black King still doesn't make it home safe and sound."

30,Nd4,c6d4,r2q1b1r/ppp2Bpp/1n6/6B1/3nNP2/3Pk2P/PPP3P1/3R1RK1 w - - 3 16,"Not the best defense but even at the most stubborn defense, 15...Bb4, White still manages to mate. Black's idea is to exchange this Knight for a Rook in hopes that the reduced material won't be enough for mate. He guessed wrong."
31,Rde1+,d1e1,r2q1b1r/ppp2Bpp/1n6/6B1/3nNP2/3Pk2P/PPP3P1/4RRK1 b - - 4 16,16. Rfe1+ is one move quicker but a little more dry.

36,Ke3,e2e3,r2q1b1r/ppp3pp/1n6/6BB/4NP2/3Pk2P/PPP3P1/5RK1 w - - 2 19,It seems the King is on his way back to safety and Black is a lot of material up.
