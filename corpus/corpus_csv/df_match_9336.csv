1,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Bird opening, nothing says it's not a good opening (well, ok a bit less than 1.e4 but a good opening).
Danielsen plays 1.f4"
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"A good answer. For example, it's difficult for White to build a stonewall.

With 1...c5, it's more a close opening.
If Black prefers attack 1....e5 is powerful (gambit From) and Black takes the hand."
