23,Re1,f1e1,rnbqr1k1/5pbp/pp1p1np1/2pP4/P3P3/2NB1N1P/1P3PP1/R1BQR1K1 b - - 1 12,"An interesting idea of doubling the rooks on the e file in order to put preasure on e4. However, such a moves signal to me that I should switch my attack."
24,Ra7,a8a7,1nbqr1k1/r4pbp/pp1p1np1/2pP4/P3P3/2NB1N1P/1P3PP1/R1BQR1K1 w - - 2 13,"An interesting idea of doubling the rooks on the e file in order to put preasure on e4. However, such a moves signal to me that I should switch my attack."

26,Rae7,a7e7,1nbqr1k1/4rpbp/pp1p1np1/2pP4/P3PB2/2NB1N1P/1P3PP1/R2QR1K1 w - - 4 14,my opponent has done a good job in preventing the e4-e5 break. Which leaves me to be thinking about creating another weakness.
27,Nd2,f3d2,1nbqr1k1/4rpbp/pp1p1np1/2pP4/P3PB2/2NB3P/1P1N1PP1/R2QR1K1 b - - 5 14,"Defends e4 and sets up a samish system for white. For those who do not know what a samish system is it is the pawn structure extending from g2 to d4. The key feature is the pawn of f3 which ensures that the nature of the game progresses along quieter lines. 

This type of set up is ideal for this game because the black rooks remain locked behind a wall of pawns."
28,Nh5,f6h5,1nbqr1k1/4rpbp/pp1p2p1/2pP3n/P3PB2/2NB3P/1P1N1PP1/R2QR1K1 w - - 6 15,another reason why it is good for white to play h3 early is to avoid this exchange of the bishop.
29,Bg5,f4g5,1nbqr1k1/4rpbp/pp1p2p1/2pP2Bn/P3P3/2NB3P/1P1N1PP1/R2QR1K1 b - - 7 15,Not Be3 when black does not have to pay for forcing me to move my bishop. This creates a weakness and blockaids the bishop on g7.

32,Bf8,g7f8,1nbqrbk1/4r2p/pp1p1pp1/2pP3n/P3P3/2NBB2P/1P1N1PP1/R2QR1K1 w - - 2 17,If this is the best that black can do then he may have to rethink his plan.

39,Ne2,c3e2,1nb1rbk1/3qr2p/pB1p1pp1/3P3n/PpN1P3/3B3P/4NPP1/R2QR1K1 b - - 2 20,a big blunder that gives up a rook for very little in return.

42,Rxe4,e8e4,1nb2bk1/3q3p/pB1p1pp1/3P3n/PpN1r3/7P/4NPP1/R2QR1K1 w - - 0 22,and black resigns. My plan was to play Nd4.
