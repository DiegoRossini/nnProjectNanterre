1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

I missed a chance late on in the endgame to nail my opponent.  This was by means of a sacrifice, namely a backward pawn.  I did not consider the sacrifice because I was worried about giving my opponent a passed pawn so I completely dismissed the idea.  I should have looked a little further into it before doing this as I found out from Coach Ion in a post-match feedback.  I will start the commentary on move 6 since in this Tournament 5. Bxf7+ has been the popular move."

Qa1+ - spent about two or three days trying to ascertain the best place for Henry to go or whether I should block the check with my knight.  I did not like Kh2 because if that black rook could safely land on the h column then that lsb could unleash a devastating discovered check.  If I took the bishop then the Wicked Witch could land on h1 with a really nasty check and then Henry would walk straight into a mating net on the f or g columns.  In the end I decided that f2 was the best place because at least the g3 pawn would be doubly defended and I then found a way to screen off the Wicked Witch's power on my back rank.
