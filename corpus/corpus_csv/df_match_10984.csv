1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The most common response, but this is new territory for me as white -- I usually play the Vienna game."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The most common response, but this is new territory for me as white -- I usually play the Vienna game."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"The most common response, but this is new territory for me as white -- I usually play the Vienna game."
4,Qf6,d8f6,rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/5q2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"?  Unusual, for sure, but I didn't see an immediate way to exploit it, so I just went ahead and developed..."
5,Bc4,f1c4,rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/5q2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,"Again, not what I was expecting.  Black is cementing d4 (possibly for a knight), but has only his queen developed and just made a hole on d5."
6,c5,c7c5,rnb1kbnr/pp1p1ppp/5q2/2p1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,"Again, not what I was expecting.  Black is cementing d4 (possibly for a knight), but has only his queen developed and just made a hole on d5."
7,O-O,e1g1,rnb1kbnr/pp1p1ppp/5q2/2p1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 4,"Maybe this is premature, but again, I just figured on gaining a large developmental advantage.  Maybe, however, d3 was better here."
8,d6,d7d6,rnb1kbnr/pp3ppp/3p1q2/2p1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 5,Giving me the d5 outpost for my knight.
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1kbnr/pp3ppp/3p1q2/2p1p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 5,...so I prepare to grab it.
10,Ne7,g8e7,rnb1kb1r/pp2nppp/3p1q2/2p1p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 6,"Challenging d5, and this is the only logical square to develop the knight with the queen on f6."
11,d3,d2d3,rnb1kb1r/pp2nppp/3p1q2/2p1p3/2B1P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 6,Threatening Bg5.
12,h6,h7h6,rnb1kb1r/pp2npp1/3p1q1p/2p1p3/2B1P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,"?!  This is definitely premature; I don't know why I played this.  Perhaps I thought that after Nxd5 Bxd5, it's nice to have a pin on the b-pawn?  Still, many moves (such as Be3 or Re1) were better."
13,Nd5,c3d5,rnb1kb1r/pp2npp1/3p1q1p/2pNp3/2B1P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 7,"?!  This is definitely premature; I don't know why I played this.  Perhaps I thought that after Nxd5 Bxd5, it's nice to have a pin on the b-pawn?  Still, many moves (such as Be3 or Re1) were better."
14,Nxd5,e7d5,rnb1kb1r/pp3pp1/3p1q1p/2pnp3/2B1P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,Black's dark-squared bishop is very bad.
15,Bxd5,c4d5,rnb1kb1r/pp3pp1/3p1q1p/2pBp3/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,Black's dark-squared bishop is very bad.
16,Be7,f8e7,rnb1k2r/pp2bpp1/3p1q1p/2pBp3/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 1 9,Black's dark-squared bishop is very bad.
17,c3,c2c3,rnb1k2r/pp2bpp1/3p1q1p/2pBp3/4P3/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 9,This doesn't really make much sense here -- White needs to be getting his remaining pieces into action.
18,Qg6,f6g6,rnb1k2r/pp2bpp1/3p2qp/2pBp3/4P3/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 1 10,"With the transparent threat of Bh3.  Rather, with the threat that I underestimate, of Bh3."
19,Re1,f1e1,rnb1k2r/pp2bpp1/3p2qp/2pBp3/4P3/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq - 2 10,"Seems logical enough, but I don't realize that after something like Bh3 11. g3 Bg4, the pin on the knight is very strong, and with the queen there as well, I will be tied to the knight's defense."
20,Nc6,b8c6,r1b1k2r/pp2bpp1/2np2qp/2pBp3/4P3/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQR1K1 w kq - 3 11,This move makes the bishop on d5 look silly -- so much for my phantasmal positional advantage.
21,Be3,c1e3,r1b1k2r/pp2bpp1/2np2qp/2pBp3/4P3/2PPBN2/PP3PPP/R2QR1K1 b kq - 4 11,"?  I don't realize it now (or ever, until it's too late), but the e3 square needed to remain open so that the rook could rush to e3 and help defend the knight if necessary."
22,O-O,e8g8,r1b2rk1/pp2bpp1/2np2qp/2pBp3/4P3/2PPBN2/PP3PPP/R2QR1K1 w - - 5 12,"Getting his king out of the center before starting tactics -- usually a good move, but in hindsight, I don't know if I would've bothered here."
23,d4,d3d4,r1b2rk1/pp2bpp1/2np2qp/2pBp3/3PP3/2P1BN2/PP3PPP/R2QR1K1 b - - 0 12,"?  Again, Bh3 is too strong for black, and white does nothing to address that here.  As a result, this is going to wind up hurting me a lot more than it hurts him -- it's long been said that a flank attack is best met with a counterattack in the center, but I need to be playing some defense here..."
24,Bh3,c8h3,r4rk1/pp2bpp1/2np2qp/2pBp3/3PP3/2P1BN1b/PP3PPP/R2QR1K1 w - - 1 13,"!  This allows black a big advantage.  At this point, I realized my huge oversight, and wondered if it was too late!  I knew it would take some good defense and some luck to get out of this!"
25,g3,g2g3,r4rk1/pp2bpp1/2np2qp/2pBp3/3PP3/2P1BNPb/PP3P1P/R2QR1K1 b - - 0 13,"Oh, that knight looks AWFUL now!"
26,Bg4,h3g4,r4rk1/pp2bpp1/2np2qp/2pBp3/3PP1b1/2P1BNP1/PP3P1P/R2QR1K1 w - - 1 14,"Oh, that knight looks AWFUL now!"
27,Bxc6,d5c6,r4rk1/pp2bpp1/2Bp2qp/2p1p3/3PP1b1/2P1BNP1/PP3P1P/R2QR1K1 b - - 0 14,"Plowing ahead with my ""central counterattack"".  Yeesh."
