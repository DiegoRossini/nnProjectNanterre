I use the Sicilian reguarly, or at least since my coach hammered it into me. I used to play 1...e5. My coach, a 2nd catagory player rated in the high 1900's, taught me the Sicilian. He said the only way to beat it was to learn it. At that time, I had been having a losing streak against the Sicilian."

I haven't played it in any real matchs, only in fun ones. Super Ninja is a personal friend of mine, so we were joking around with this game. If this is a real opening, can someone please notify me of it? Please and thank you."
