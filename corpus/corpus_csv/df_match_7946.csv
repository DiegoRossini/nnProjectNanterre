1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I am putting this on for advice and comments from better players. I always play e4 opening but so far I have struggle with the Sicilian defence. Any tips are welcome

This is a very intriguing position to my inexperienced eyes, what is the strategy for White from here? King side attack or Queen side? Castle King side or Queen side?"

13,Qd2,d1d2,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPPQ1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 3 7,I move my Queen to prepare for a Queen side castle. The idea at this stage is to attack Black's king side with pawns to open up the king's cover. Black's Queen side still had all pieces firmly hemmed in so he had to castle king side. Question: Is this the best position for White's Queen against the Sicilian defence? It would be good to discover a square similar to d6 for the Black Queen in the Caro Kann defence. Any thougths are welcome

I am usually loathe to trade a bishop for a knight, but in hindsight, I should have allowed the trade as then Black would only have his DSB developped... Oh well, I did just the opposite"
