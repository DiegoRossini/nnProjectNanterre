This technique is reminiscent of the technique I used against a 1753 player in one of Jo's Successful Endgames annotated a few months ago.  Frere Leblanc controls the a2-g8 diagonal.  Whether white trades bishops or moves the bishop away, there is no stopping Glenda from making a reappearance two moves down the line and cleaning up the last two white pawns and turning her attention to the white king.  Hope you have had a good read!  Bye for now.  Joanne"
