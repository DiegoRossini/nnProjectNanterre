If I take on h6, his Q is invited into the heart of my defence and is difficult to shift.  If White takes on g7, the K prevents the Q from approaching without further preparation.  I launch a counter-attack, gaining space on the Q-side.  If I withstand the attack on the kingside, this will give me a long term advantage."

23,O-O,e1g1,1r1q1r2/p3ppkp/2npbnp1/1pp5/4P3/2NP2PP/PPPQNPB1/R4RK1 b - - 3 12,"Deterred by my last move from castling long, or as always planned?"
