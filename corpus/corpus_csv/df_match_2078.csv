1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"White is opening with 1.e4, wich says a little bit about his style. Most e4-players like open, tactical positions.."
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I'm heading for my normal response to 1.e4; the Caro-Kann.
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Ok, white chooses for the Advance-variation of the Caro-Kann. By advancing his e-pawn to e5, he's gaining space, and in meanwhile he's countering my development."
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Ok, white chooses for the Advance-variation of the Caro-Kann. By advancing his e-pawn to e5, he's gaining space, and in meanwhile he's countering my development."

6,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pPb2/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"First of all, my bishop needs to get out of the back rank. f5 is a good spot to take a rest.
By playing 3. ... Bf5, we're reaching the Short-variation in the Advanced Caro-Kann."
7,Bd3,f1d3,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pPb2/3P4/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 4,"All book-moves. These are ""natural"" opening-moves. We now see that white takes control of the most black squares in the center, and black controls the white center-fields."
8,Bxd3,f5d3,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pP3/3P4/3b4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,"All book-moves. These are ""natural"" opening-moves. We now see that white takes control of the most black squares in the center, and black controls the white center-fields."

12,Nd7,b8d7,r2qkbnr/pp1n1ppp/2p1p3/3pP3/3P4/3Q1N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 2 7,"I played this move to get a response ready for the case white plays Qb3, threatening to take my b-pawn. If white does that right now, I have the answer Qb6. After a possible exchange of queens, my knight would be nicely placed on b6."
13,O-O,e1g1,r2qkbnr/pp1n1ppp/2p1p3/3pP3/3P4/3Q1N2/PPP2PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 3 7,Bringing his King to safety; normal procedure..

16,Ne7,g8e7,r2qkb1r/pp1nnpp1/2p1p2p/3pP3/3P1B2/3Q1N2/PPP2PPP/RN3RK1 w kq - 2 9,"I'm leaving my options open.. This knight can go to g6, as well as f5 and c6 (once the c-pawn is advanced)."

The thing is, I can't let him play 10. c5, because my black bishop would be enclosed."
18,dxc4,d5c4,r2qkb1r/pp1nnpp1/2p1p2p/4P3/2pP1B2/3Q1N2/PP3PPP/RN3RK1 w kq - 0 10,"So, let's make some room for my pieces ! See how the important d5-squares is coming free ? That would be a nice outpost for my knight !"
