2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,My usual.
3,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Sensible answer.
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"Surprising move number one of the Budapest. Instead of retaking, black poses white a little dilemma."
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,White chooses the so-called wisest answer: ignore the pawn and develop.
6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3P4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"This is the Icelandic. Black, instead of retake the pawn, sacrifices one instead, for a quick developement."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3P4/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"White doesn't take the bite. Here, a lot of little tactics can be performed by white starting with Bb5+, and after black blocks the check, dxe6 forces black to open the f column."
8,exd5,e6d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"After Nxd5, c4 is strong and makes white win a tempo."
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,Instead of c4. This knight is dangerous on b5 in some circunstances.
10,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/1b1P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,"Here, black has some material to work with: Ne4 is now possible, and Qe7+ supports the bishop and controls the e column. Nevertheless, black has to be very careful about his dsb's future."
11,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p2B1/1b1P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 3 6,White returns the compliment.
12,c6,c7c6,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/2p2n2/3p2B1/1b1P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"This move kind of delays my developement, but it opens the way for my dsb to c7, guards b5 from B or N, frees my Nf6 from the defence of d6 (once Nf3 is unpinned)..."
13,Qe2+,d1e2,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/2p2n2/3p2B1/1b1P4/2N2N2/PPP1QPPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 1 7,"White takes the initiative, returning me my own plan. No panic."
14,Be6,c8e6,rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/2p1bn2/3p2B1/1b1P4/2N2N2/PPP1QPPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 2 8,"This bishop can be attackable by: the f pawn (no, because it is blocked), Nc5 or Nf4 (none of them is likely to reach those squares any soon, or White's lsb, after h4 and Bh3. I have plenty of time to act before that."
15,Bd2,g5d2,rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/2p1bn2/3p4/1b1P4/2N2N2/PPPBQPPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 3 8,"White unpins his knight, preventing my Ne4."
16,c5,c6c5,rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/4bn2/2pp4/1b1P4/2N2N2/PPPBQPPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 9,"I made a clumpsy attempt to move the game on. I knew I left a hole in b5, but after Qb5+, I would have to choose among Qd7, and the more intriguing Nf-d7, since after Qxb7, Ndb6 blocks the white queen very badly."
17,dxc5,d4c5,rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/4bn2/2Pp4/1b6/2N2N2/PPPBQPPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 9,"Of course not Bxc5, since after Qb5+ I'll lose the bishop. 
I considered here Qa5 to be a good move. 

Some lines I explored:

9.	...		Qa5. If white goes 
10.	Nb5		Bxd2+
11.	QxBd2	Qd2+ and here, white must think about how to retake, since
12.	Nxd2		Kd7, and black has compensation for the pawn, and is about to press hard on white's N and Pawn. On the other side, if
12.	Kxd2, trying to save a tempo for castling, 
12.			Ne4+, forcing white to defend f2 with the king, and threatening c5.  
Again, after Kd7 and a6, black's asset improves drastically. For example:
13.	Ke3		Kd7
14.	b4		a6
15.	Nd4		Nc6 etc, with a decent game. 

Or:
9.	...		Qa5
10.	Nd4!		Kd7, with a lot of ways for white to proceed. 

Other possible black moves are:

Qe7 (10. Qb5+, Qd7...)
Nc6
d4!? (10. Ne4 looks good, because it defends c5 and if... 10. ..., NxN 11. QxN, and black is free to play Bxc5, since after 12. Qxb7?, Bd4, 13. Qb5+, Nd7, 14. Ne5?, Qe7..."
18,Qa5,d8a5,rn2k2r/pp3ppp/4bn2/q1Pp4/1b6/2N2N2/PPPBQPPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 1 10,Now I would have played another one. I just did not see all.

With cold mind, I can see that Nc6 was much better. This one was in the hope that white would take b7. 
I actually wanted to provoke white to get into c6."
21,Qxa5,b5a5,r3k2r/pp1n1ppp/4bn2/Q1Pp4/1b6/2N2N2/PPPB1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 11,"My reasoning must have been right. White didn't want to play my game, and went for simplification. I don't know if he wants to exploit Nb5, but this allows BxB+, and either ways white takes it,  black can shield and even treat something on the e column, one castled."
