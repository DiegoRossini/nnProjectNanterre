1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This is probably one of my better wins though White did throw it away at the end.  I had some fairly interesting plays this game.  Lets start with the typical opening.  e4
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,My typical response to e4 after I learned to play the Sicilian back 4 years ago.
3,b4,b2b4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/1P2P3/8/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,The wing gambit the only gambit that I can recall of the top of my head for the Sicilian defense.  I believe the idea is for white to try to keep his d-pawn.  White should be able to almost always form the ideal pawn center with this opening.  I see no reason to not accept this sacrifice.
4,cxb4,c5b4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/1p2P3/8/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,white plans on opening the file for his rook and allowing the development of the dsb to the a3-f8 diagonal where it plays influence on the development of the e pawn due to the somewhat undermining Bxf8 Kxf8.  I decided that I don't like that plan so instead I decide to start my move on the center and develop if axb4 with the move e6.
5,a3,a2a3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/1p2P3/P7/2PP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,white plans on opening the file for his rook and allowing the development of the dsb to the a3-f8 diagonal where it plays influence on the development of the e pawn due to the somewhat undermining Bxf8 Kxf8.

6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/8/1p2P3/P7/2PP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,A decent reply white gains the center for now with d4 next move and forces me to expend the tempo I gained from whites axb4.
7,axb4,a3b4,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/8/1P2P3/8/2PP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,A decent reply white gains the center for now with d4 next move and forces me to expend the tempo I gained from whites axb4.
8,Bxb4,f8b4,rnbqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/8/1b2P3/8/2PP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,A decent reply white gains the center for now with d4 next move and forces me to expend the tempo I gained from whites axb4.
9,c3,c2c3,rnbqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/8/1b2P3/2P5/3P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,A decent reply white gains the center for now with d4 next move and forces me to expend the tempo I gained from whites axb4.
10,Be7,b4e7,rnbqk1nr/pp1pbppp/4p3/8/4P3/2P5/3P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,I decided on this move because I wanted to set a solid defense with a Scheveningen style structure for black.  Whites central pawns will end up marching at some point via e5 or d5.  So I plan on having my bishops in a defensive style for the moment and what for my chance to counter attack.
11,d4,d2d4,rnbqk1nr/pp1pbppp/4p3/8/3PP3/2P5/5PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,Attempting to get white to play e5 so d6 can come with a possible pawn exchange not to mention if I can get my knight set up on d5 could be good for me.  The downside to this move order is white has the potential to increase the squeeze on black.  Example being e5 Nd5 c4 Nc7 where black plans d6 or d5 in order to break things open.
12,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqk2r/pp1pbppp/4pn2/8/3PP3/2P5/5PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 7,Attempting to get white to play e5 so d6 can come with a possible pawn exchange not to mention if I can get my knight set up on d5 could be good for me.

13,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqk2r/pp1pbppp/4pn2/8/3PP3/2PB4/5PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 7,Adopting my counterattacking structure. I feel fairly flexible with this set up.
14,d6,d7d6,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/3ppn2/8/3PP3/2PB4/5PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 8,Adopting my counterattacking structure. I feel fairly flexible with this set up.
15,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/3ppn2/8/3PP3/2PB1N2/5PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 8,"I want to get my king away from potential checks along the e8-a4 diagonal though Bd7 was also possible I have the idea of possibly moving my bishop to b7 instead to attack d5, and put pressure on e4.  Keeping the flexibility alive."
16,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/3ppn2/8/3PP3/2PB1N2/5PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 2 9,"I want to get my king away from potential checks along the e8-a4 diagonal though Bd7 was also possible I have the idea of possibly moving my bishop to b7 instead to attack d5, and put pressure on e4.

17,O-O,e1g1,rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/3ppn2/8/3PP3/2PB1N2/5PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 3 9,Taking back control of the b5 square though I feel that my pawns will be weak after my eventual b5.

21,Re1,f1e1,r1bq1rk1/1p1nbppp/p2ppn2/8/3PP3/N1PB1N2/5PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - - 1 11,? in hindsight I forgot about the pin on the a8 rook though I didn't have a whole lot of choice I could have played b6 first maybe.  The point being I want to get my bishop into the action and fast.

23,Nxb5,a3b5,r1bq1rk1/3nbppp/p2ppn2/1N6/3PP3/2PB1N2/5PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - - 0 12,Now white must expend a tempo to keep the knight.  I haven't lost my passed pawn as of yet. which I would believe blacks advantage at the moment.

27,c4,c3c4,r4rk1/1bqnbppp/p2ppn2/8/2PPP3/N2B1N2/5PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - - 0 14,My idea was to exchange on d4 or have the possibility of playing Nc5 to attack whites bishop on c3 and possible win the e4 pawn.  If white decides to close down the center with d5 I can play Nc5 and eventually have the plan of f5 to bust open the center.

30,Rab8,a8b8,1r3rk1/1bqnbppp/p2p1n2/4p3/2PPP3/N2B1N2/1B3PPP/R2QR1K1 w - - 2 16,I feel that having the potential to attack the bishop on b2 could be good for me. I also have the possible plan of unbalancing the position which you will see in a few more moves.

34,Nc5,d7c5,1r3rk1/1bq1bppp/p2p1n2/2n5/2PNP3/N2B4/1B1Q1PPP/R3R1K1 w - - 1 18,My knight finally comes to the c5 square where it has a threat on the d3 bishop and the possible plan of Nxd3 Bxe4 or Nxe4.
