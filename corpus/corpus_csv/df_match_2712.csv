20,Ne5,c6e5,r2q1rk1/pp1bppbp/3p1np1/4n3/4P3/2N3PP/PPP1NPB1/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 11,With a threat of coming in on c4

13. Kh1 Nh6 14. g4 Bxg4 15. hxg4 Qxg4 with advantage to white, who won in 48 moves. Payen, Arnaud (2280) vs. Seres, Lajos (2450) continued with Qc5 13. Rb1 Rac8 14. Kg1 Nc6 15. Qd2 b5 16. Bb2 Ne5 17. Nd4 draw agreed. We found another way to end the game."

28,Nfg4+,f6g4,r1q2rk1/pp1bppbp/3p2p1/4n3/4P1n1/1PN3PP/P1P1NPBK/R1BQ1R2 w - - 7 15,"Black throws in the check again, and a draw is agreed. Now I tested this position on the weak chess computer, Ludochess, which plays at about 1900. It thought that black is better, and rather than taking this draw, Qc5 gave black an advantage of 0.6
What do you think dear reader? Is black really better in this position? Has anyone got a stronger computer to check it on?
