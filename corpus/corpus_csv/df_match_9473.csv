Nf3 Black can run into some problems; if Black trades he will allow White to develop his Knight.  Also, e6 is now dangerously weak.  Some of the traditional problems of moving the f pawn (weakening the King's position) are, however, diminshed since White has already opened the f file."

As with the previous comment, I don't think this move is necessary.  ... b6 seems preferrable, since it threatens White's overextended pawns and might let your Bishop into the long diagonal.  Be7 also seems worth considering, allowing you to castle."
