1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"A relatively cleanly-fought blitz game, one of my proudest efforts against an 1800+ player (I play white).  Although I ""won"" this game, it was a very draw-ish finish, and with a slight time disadvantage black resigned (perhaps losing interest)."
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Although I have been playing queen's-pawn openings exclusively, I still feel I am stabbing in the dark for sound move order."

6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"This move was particularly murky to me.  I'm sick of black playing Bb4 and removing my Nc3 from the board, but I don't know if this is right in this position."
7,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,"This move was particularly murky to me.  I'm sick of black playing Bb4 and removing my Nc3 from the board, but I don't know if this is right in this position."
