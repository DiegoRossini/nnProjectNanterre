I am certain any constructive criticism would be welcomed"

3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/2N1P3/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"It's very early to move the queen. This can help black as he can develop with tempo by attacking the queen as he develops his pieces

Not surpisingly this takes us out of the Gameknot database. It puts pressure directly on the d5 pawn, black has 3 options, d4 which is likely to bring blacks queen out (and so should probably be avoided for the moment). e6 which will block in his lsb and Nf6 which not only defends the pawn but also allows Bg4 which will get whites queen out into the open and mean that black will then be able to gain an advantage in development"

6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/1pp1pppp/p4n2/3p4/8/2N1PQ2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 2 4,Black chooses the sensible development option
7,b4,b2b4,rnbqkb1r/1pp1pppp/p4n2/3p4/1P6/2N1PQ2/P1PP1PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"A rather premature pawn rush. This move weakens white, specially in the centre. It also makes it more difficult to castle queens side. this is a problem because the minor pieces on the kings side aren't developed and the only sensible place for the g1 knight at the moment is e2. This needs d4 and Bd3 before it becomes feasible. However even then the white queen is left a little exposed. 

The b pawn is undefended and isn't doing much where it is.

In my opinion this loses white the initiative. Better would be d4 or possibly b3,..Bb2 allowing white to castle queenside"
8,c6,c7c6,rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p1p2n2/3p4/1P6/2N1PQ2/P1PP1PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"Black has the initiative here but has wasted it a little and even caused problems for himself with this passive move. The d5 pawn doesn't need any more defence, and now the b8 knight has only one option to develop. On the positive side black has opened a small diagonal to a5 for his queen. 

Better would have been Nc6 or e5, which pressures the centre where both sides are currently weak on black squares. It also forces white to do something with his b4 pawn which would maintain blacks initiative"
9,Bb2,c1b2,rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p1p2n2/3p4/1P6/2N1PQ2/PBPP1PPP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 1 5,"The only sensible option for the dsb, however the pawn on b4 is looking a little lonely.

White is now ready to castle and can regain the initiative as black is going to take at least two moves  before he can castle"
10,e5,e7e5,rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1p2n2/3pp3/1P6/2N1PQ2/PBPP1PPP/R3KBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"This is a good move for black, it lays a claim on the centre and keeps the lines open for both bishops, it also pressures b4 forcing white to react"
11,Qg3,f3g3,rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1p2n2/3pp3/1P6/2N1P1Q1/PBPP1PPP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 1 6,"Threatens the e5 pawn but more importantly pressures g7 which means that black can't take b4 with his bishop or he will lose the ability to castle kings side. This is a problem for black as none of his queen side pieces are developed and when they are, castling on that side would leave the king a little exposed due to the pawn structure. 

Black needs to be careful now or white can regain the initiative. An option for black is to finachetto his dsb with g6,...Bg7 but that will delay castling by one move"
12,e4,e5e4,rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1p2n2/3p4/1P2p3/2N1P1Q1/PBPP1PPP/R3KBNR w KQkq - 0 7,"Black wants to keep his e pawn but may have overstretched himself in the process and further delayed his development. Qe7, Qc7, or Qd6  were other options. Nd7 would also defend the pawn but would block in blacks lsb completely"
13,Qe5+,g3e5,rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1p2n2/3pQ3/1P2p3/2N1P3/PBPP1PPP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 1 7,White is going nowhere with this. He really should get his king safe and complete his development first. Whites lsb is a problem now as the only place it can go is e2 blocking in the knight
14,Be6,c8e6,rn1qkb1r/1p3ppp/p1p1bn2/3pQ3/1P2p3/2N1P3/PBPP1PPP/R3KBNR w KQkq - 2 8,I think black had a better option here of Be7 which allows him to castle next move

White should have castled or developed his king side which is looking rather sorry for itself.

One of the basic guides in the early game is not to move the same peice twice. White has already done this with his queen and knight. Black has only done it with his e pawn"

Another option would be g6, allowing Bg7 later meaning black could castle"

Better is Bxf6"
