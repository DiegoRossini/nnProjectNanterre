1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is just a regular, innocent game."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Black replies.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Knight moved to f3 to attack Black's e-pawn.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,Black's knight moved out to protect.
5,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,This move was made to attack the weakest link; the f-pawn.
6,d6,d7d6,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,Black moves d6 so he can bring out his bishop to pin the knight on f3.
7,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,White develops his other knight.
8,Bg4,c8g4,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/2B1P1b1/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,As expected. White's knight is now pinned.
9,Nxe5,f3e5,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4N3/2B1P1b1/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,Nxe5 is a very risky move. It leaves the queen exposed for attack but Legal knew his opponent couldn't resist the urge to capture White's queen.
10,Bxd1,g4d1,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4N3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BbK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"Black falls for the trap. White is now easily prepared to unleash a devastating attack. A better move would be Nxe5, then Qxg4 for some compensation followed by Nxc4 and black would be winning."
11,Bxf7+,c4f7,r2qkbnr/ppp2Bpp/2np4/4N3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BbK2R b KQkq - 0 6,This is the first step.

13,Nd5#,c3d5,r2q1bnr/ppp1kBpp/2np4/3NN3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/R1BbK2R b KQ - 2 7,This is called the legal mate. It is a trap that involves the sacrifice of the queen. This is the game that engraved Legal's name in chess history.
