1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I was WAY behind in this game due to an early blunder-- a simple pawn fork I overlooked that cost me a piece.  This game is an excellent example of how you shouldn't give up when you are behind.  At one point, I was down 5 points and was still fortunate enough to win the game.
