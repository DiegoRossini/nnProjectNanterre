1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Personally, I prefer 3. Bb5 for more of a Ruy Lopez approach, but this is a good alternative and accomplishes the same goal: develops the piece and prepares for castle. As Hicks points out and as I tell my over-the-board students: the best opening moves accomplish multiple goals!"

6,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,"The Giuoco Piano, in which the goals are for white:  to take control of the center with a d4 push. White must choose if he does it right now--4. d4 to get a lead in development (despite the loss of the pawn)--or if he prepares it with moves like 4. c3 or 4. b4. White may also forget about the d4-push, and play a quieter line, by supporting the center with 4. d3. But these are too conventional for white's tastes..."
7,b4,b2b4,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/1PB1P3/5N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,"!? - Instead, white elects to go for an Evans Gambit, in which the goal is to trade a pawn for better center position."

12,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/b3p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/P2P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 3 7,"!? - A good move since the pawn on c3 makes e4 difficult to defend, and ideally would allow black to castle as well..."
13,Ba3,c1a3,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/b3p3/2B1P3/B1P2N2/P2P1PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 4 7,"However, as many people will tell you, offense is the best defense. Ignoring the attack on e4, white invites black to take it, knowing that this opens the e-file for the white rook, giving him a positional edge! This move also prevents black from castling, which will become a problem later in the game."
