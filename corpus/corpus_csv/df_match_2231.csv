1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi Everyone!

Ok, not quite the lady at Flambards but nevertheless, Cristiana certainly ended up as Lady Bountiful at the end of this game.  She was playing her mentor, Skorpio47 (aka Klaus) in a Walking the Walk and Learning to Run Welcome MT and she managed a Master Draw against him.  So, I want to learn from Cristiana's experience and just see how she did it.  This MT was a themed tournament called The Dutch Defense.  So, how did she do it?  Well read on......"
