1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was my first game in a tournament in which I played OTB some 4 months ago. My opponent was considered much stronger than I, as you can see from the ratings. Nevertheless, I felt confident that I could put up a good fight, since I was getting back in shape after a period of sloppy play and I always play well at that tournament (last year I had won the B-section, so I was allowed to participate in the A-section this year). My opponent started off with 1.d4. Earlier in my chess career I was unhappy with that, but now that I've discovered a nice opening against it, that's not the case anymore."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"And there we are: the Benko Gambit. In the main line, which we will see in this game, Black gives up a pawn for nice open lines on the queenside and pressure on the weak White pawns. This game, at least the first part, will be instructive to see themes occurring often in the Benko Gambit."

The normal move here is 11.Nf3, after which 11...Ng4 is not very popular, but at move 12 (usually after 11...O-O) 12.h3 is one of the main moves. There are a lot of subtleties in the move order here, but I don't know them exactly. Any Benko expert care to help me out? At least in this game, it will all come down to a transposition. IN another game at this tournament against a 1800 player, the opponent played 11.Ne2. I got crushed in 30 moves in a near-perfect game by my opponent, I didn't even play badly there."
