1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Black chooses a Scandanavian Defence out of his Anglo-Indian beginning. This somewhat-unconventional variation (more standard is 2...g6) has the advantage of delaying Bg2 if White takes on d5 (3.cxd5 Qxd5 and now 4.Nf3 is basically forced), and preparing for a strong attack on the kingside between ...Qh5 and ...Bh3."

5,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/8/6P1/PP1PPP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,?! 6.h3 is more easily defensible and prevents ...Bg4. The text indicates that White is hoping to castle kingside in short order (whereupon a pawn on h3 would be easily picked off).

12,Bg4,c8g4,r3kb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/7q/6bP/5NP1/PP1PPPB1/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 7,"Both players continue development. Black has a nasty attack and lots of space, whereas White feels very cramped and now his d-pawn is pinned, as well. Kingside castling is looking more and more dangerous, but on the other hand his queenside is almost entirely undeveloped."

15,d3,d2d3,2kr1b1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/7q/6bP/2NP1NP1/PP2PPB1/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 8,Letting out the Bishop and offering a modicum of defense for the d-pawn--though e2 is not exactly the most reliable defender.
16,e5,e7e5,2kr1b1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/4p2q/6bP/2NP1NP1/PP2PPB1/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 9,"Black marches forward, making more space for himself, letting his own DSB into play and threatening to march on the WK."
17,Be3,c1e3,2kr1b1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/4p2q/6bP/2NPBNP1/PP2PPB1/R2QK2R b KQ - 1 9,White defends against ...Bc5 and attempts to relegate Black's QN to defense of a7.
18,e4,e5e4,2kr1b1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/7q/4p1bP/2NPBNP1/PP2PPB1/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 10,"!? This pawn, of course, cannot be won, since White's d-pawn is pinned. However, I think this move is stronger after 9...Bb4, developing, connecting the Rooks and preventing White from touching that pawn at all."
19,Ng5,f3g5,2kr1b1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/6Nq/4p1bP/2NPB1P1/PP2PPB1/R2QK2R b KQ - 1 10,"Another option was 10.Nh2, but I decided to keep the BQ from shifting over to the queenside, while threatening to win e4."

21,Bxc6,g2c6,2kr1b1r/ppp2ppp/2B2n2/6Nq/6bP/2NpB1P1/PP2PP2/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 11,"There are three big things to notice. First, once on e2, Black's pawn will have no clear path to the last rank; it will act as a bit of a shield for the WK, and it will be more easily won than it would be on the d-file, backed by the Black Rook. Secondly, the b7 pawn and d8 Rook are only defended by the Black King, and are therefore weak. Thirdly, after ...dxe2, the WQ will be fighting the BR for control of the d-file. Armed with this knowledge, White sets a trap with 11.Bxc6."
22,dxe2,d3e2,2kr1b1r/ppp2ppp/2B2n2/6Nq/6bP/2N1B1P1/PP2pP2/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 12,"?? Black misses White's trick, thinking that he must respond to the attack on his Queen, and preoccupied with his dangerous pileup on d1. Correct was 11...bxc6 12.f3 dxe2 13.Qxe2 Bd7 14.O-O-O with an unclear, but probably equal, position."

24,Kxb7,c8b7,3r1b1r/pkp2ppp/5n2/6Nq/6bP/2N1B1P1/PP2pP2/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 13,"Black's cohesion is significantly better than White's, but White is up a lot of material--if he can make it count. Unfortunately his KR is trapped in a tiny, useless box, and his QN is indirectly pinned by virtue of his Queen on d8--if White moves the Nc3, Black has ...Bb4+! followed by ...Rxd8."

29,Nxf3,g5f3,3Q1b1r/pkp2pp1/5n1p/7q/7P/2N1BNP1/PP2pP1R/R3K3 b Q - 0 15,"White breaks the ""pin"" on his Knight, freeing it to capture on e2, as well as defending b4 against any future Bishop aggression."

32,Ng4,f6g4,5b1r/pkp2pp1/7p/8/3Q2nP/2N1BqP1/PP2pP1R/R3K3 w Q - 2 17,"?! This is okay, but activating the Bishop would be far better. Now the BQ is tied to this Knight's defense, and Black's kingside pieces are no closer to helping the cause than they were before."
33,Rh3,h2h3,5b1r/pkp2pp1/7p/8/3Q2nP/2N1BqPR/PP2pP2/R3K3 b Q - 3 17,Black attempts to dodge the incoming artillery. I think 17...Bd6 would have been much better; he desperately needs to get his last two pieces out.
34,Kc8,b7c8,2k2b1r/p1p2pp1/7p/8/3Q2nP/2N1BqPR/PP2pP2/R3K3 w Q - 4 18,Black attempts to dodge the incoming artillery. I think 17...Bd6 would have been much better; he desperately needs to get his last two pieces out.
35,Nxe2,c3e2,2k2b1r/p1p2pp1/7p/8/3Q2nP/4BqPR/PP2NP2/R3K3 b Q - 0 18,"Finally, this pawn can be collected. The White pieces breathe a collective sigh of relief."
36,a5,a7a5,2k2b1r/2p2pp1/7p/p7/3Q2nP/4BqPR/PP2NP2/R3K3 w Q - 0 19,? ...Bb4+ doesn't accomplish anything anymore. 18...Bd3 would be a vastly superior move.
