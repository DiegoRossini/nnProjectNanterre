1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!  That Expert Victory continues to elude me like a butterfly.  I end up being a pawn up from Move 5 onwards and carry this advantage right through to the conclusion of the game.  So, how was it that I am still jstevens1 and not TheBlackQueen?  Well, unfortunately my rook was on the wrong side of my passer in a rook ending.  So, how did all this happen?  Well, read on and follow the Gameknot Analysis on this link: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=21355770&fb=1&rnd=0.6279427368148152"
