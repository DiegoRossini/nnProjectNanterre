1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!  My first post-Xmas annotation and what a way to start with a win!  I am playing in a mini-tournament with people in my own rating bracket which is a real test of whether that 1700  rating belongs to me or not.  Actually I have got off to a reasonable start, winning 2 games and drawing one.  Those wins pushed my rating above the 1750 mark for the first time in my chess career.  Here is the latter of the two."

If you are a pawn down in an endgame and you VOLUNTARILY exchange down into a pure K & P endgame, let me tell you three things, it is SUICIDE, SUICIDE, SUICIDE!  This proves to be so because you are many times more likely to fall into a zugzwang (your turn to move but whatever move you play worsens your position i.e. losing material or allowing your opponent to checkmate you) than if you have another piece on the board.  Now here is how, you, with the material advantage, can exploit such play."
