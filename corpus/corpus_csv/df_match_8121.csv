1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

I am happy to announce a welcome victory with an emphatic ending.  The last time I ended up delivering checkmate was on 08-Dec-08, that was a couple of months before I ended up having lessons on mounting mating attacks from Freddy, the Master Mater.  Well, hopefully it is starting to filter through.  Here I am playing The Dentist who has returned from another sabbatical."
2,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,1. ...... Nc6 - Nimzowich's Opening.
3,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 2,"2. ...... f6 - this move looks rather weak as it opens up the Fool's Mate diagonal and deprives the king knight of his normal square f6.  Mind you, Master Freddy played it in a game against a player near his own rating so it can't be too bad here!  One word of caution is that Freddy did lose that game http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=10328022&mv=7&rnd=0.25780495819961885 but whether that was the losing move is open to debate!"

Be3 - first a sneaky line up behind the steed staged by Fou Lenoir on the Wicked Witch of the West - may gain a useful tempo here should black play e5.  Notice the line up of Fou Leblanc and Glenda on g8 - this will also be extremely useful to me later on.
