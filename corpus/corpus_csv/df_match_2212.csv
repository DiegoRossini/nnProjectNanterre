It is true that the isolated d5-pawn is a passed pawn, which is usually an asset in the endgame, but here there are still many pieces on the board, and the d4-square is controlled by White. With inaccurate play on the latter's part, the d5-pawn  could become a real asset for Black, but objectively it must at this  stage be regarded as more of a liability. The other important aspect of the pawn structure is that White has a queenside majority, which potentially can yield an outside passed pawn."
