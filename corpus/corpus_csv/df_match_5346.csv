1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game was originally intended to be a fun random inter-team game that doesn't matter.  So I just played any random move I saw without much thought.  And as it turns out, it's probably the greatest game I've ever played.  There's nothing to be proud of by winning over a lower rated opponent, but what makes this game amazing is the moves that were played.  
According to computer analysis, my opponent played a ""perfect"" game, and I was the only one to make a ""mistake"".  And yet I still won.          

I know using computer engine analysis afterward to help analyze this game is kind of cheap, but if you were to seriously look at the position after 17. Nxg5, and try to analyze it yourself (and figure out the forced win), the position is so complex your mind will blow.  Personally I spent at least 6 hours just playing the game from move 21 to the end, and afterward I spent 2-3 hours analyzing it before I gave up amid the complexities and used a computer engine.  And what I found was shocking.  I played the computer from move 17 onwards and eventually (with take-backs) won several times, and after every variation, it would take the computer a long time before it figured out that it was black was in fact losing. Eventually, the computer was still refusing to say that 17. Nxg5 was winning for white, and at best said it was a draw.  I seriously hope it wins, but may still be a draw, and such complexity is beyond my comprehension."
