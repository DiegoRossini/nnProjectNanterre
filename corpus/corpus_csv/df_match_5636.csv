7,Ba4,b5a4,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"White also has the possibility of playing 4.Bxc6 dxc6, going into the exchange variation. (Note that 5.Nxe5?! is not very strong because Black wins his pawn back with 5...Qd4 and has a comfortable position)"
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,"I hoped for 5.O-O so I could play the Open Ruy Lopez with 5...Nxe4 but unfortunately my opponent didn't allow that and instead wentfor a slow, positional approach."

The other possibility is 5...d6 but I didn't like the idea of closing in my dark-squared bishop that way."

It seems slow, but surely it has its merits. White can now play 8.Be3 without having to worry about 8...Ng4. White also has the long-term plan of an attack on the kingside and this pawn move gives white the possibility of moving the f3 Knight via h2 to g4."

I suppose it's played to provide Black with te option of playing ...c5 but I'm not sure if there are also other ideas behind this move. Does anyone have any suggestions? Anyway, I copied the idea from those other games because I was not sure what to do."

In many Ruy Lopez games, the b1 Knight goes to d2 and f1 to take part in the kingside attack via e3 or g3 and, if possible, f5."

It does prevent d4 but on the other side it gives White the strong d5 square (he can't use it right now, but this may become a factor in the future) and also prevents Black from playing ...d5 himself. Maybe 13...c6 was preferable, to prepare ...d5. It does close in the light-square bishop for the moment, but that piece is biting on granite anyway."

Black had to weaken his King's position by playing 14...g5 15.Bg3 to release the pin on his Knight because now White gets a large, probably even winning, advantage by playing 15.Ng4!, winning at least a pawn and weakening the Black King's position anyway."
