3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Take the middle; fair enough.
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2p2n2/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"If 3. e5, then Nd5 anchors the middle for Black for a bit.  3. ... Ne4 seems too risky, even if 4. f3 weakens the King-side for White a bit."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2p2n2/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 3,"Not 3. ...d5, where 4. e5 drives the knight back to d7 (4. ... Ng4 is chased by 5. h3)."

8,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/2pp1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,Must castle to free the Queen-side for action.  The fiancetto is the fastest way to accomplish this.

10,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/2pp1np1/8/3PPB2/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,"White is fully developed on the most standard lines, barring castling.  Black is relatively undeveloped, especially hampered by the Queen's knight, but quite safe for the mean time."

Not necessarily a bad idea, but perhaps castling first was in order, forcing Black to move out, where he has few options."
