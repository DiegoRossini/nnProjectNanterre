1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Every chess player experiments with openings at sometime. We all search for the one opening that will give us a big advantage the majority of the time. Well, their ain't one! Once you learn that and play for equality and maybe a minimal advantage or initiative the sooner you'll move on to solid chess. I myself learnt that when playing the color black here. I was trying to hard to pull off swindles and turn the tide towards black's favor. 

When learning an opening its important to understand its goals and purpose. The opening here is King's Gambit, Falkbeer Counter Gambit. 

The Falkbeer is a hard opening to understand for lots of intermediate players. --- more on this after the opening moves."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,King's Gambit. Whites usual goal here is to open up the f file for his rook after castling short. If he can exchange a center pawn of white's for the f pawn all the better.
3,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,King's Gambit. Whites usual goal here is to open up the f file for his rook after castling short. If he can exchange a center pawn of white's for the f pawn all the better.
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"The Falkbeer Counter Gambit. Black is gambiting a pawn, e5, for  positional advantages. He hopes to undermine the purpose of white's opening by not taking the f pawn and not allowing the file to be half open for white's rook.

He is offering (gambiting) his e pawn. Taking this pawn is considered unsound for white due to 3.....Qh4 and the old beginners type trap - 4.g3,  Qxe4ch  5. white blocks with Q, B or N on e2......QxR. The alternative for white being a king move and the loss of castling with a poor position."
5,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3Pp3/5P2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,The sound way to play against the Falkbeer. White will gain a tempo if Qxd5 and white plays Nc3. The black queen will have to move again.
6,Qxd5,d8d5,rnb1kbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3qp3/5P2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"This isn't the best move for black. Stronger is e4, advancing the center pawn and giving white problems to solve. The pawn can be supported by f5 and also Nf6. The pawn at e4 takes away Nf3, the usual and best placement of the knight.  If white plays the version of the King's gambit where this is a standard move then white is out of his comfort zone."
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1kbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3qp3/5P2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,Gaining tempo (time) as black must move the Q again.

11,Be2,f1e2,rnb1kbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4q3/8/2N5/PPPPB1PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 6,Thats 4 Q moves. Striking at the undefended g pawn.

13,Bf3,e2f3,rnb1kbnr/ppp2ppp/8/6q1/8/2N2B2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 3 7,Defending the pawn.  A tactic here could be Nf3 ignoring the pawns safety. If Qxg2 then Rg1 gives white a strong attack on his Q side.  Another similar tactic is 7. d4 and now if Qxg2 then Bf3 again with open lines for a king side attack for white.
14,Bd6,f8d6,rnb1k1nr/ppp2ppp/3b4/6q1/8/2N2B2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 4 8,"Instead black could of played Qh4. Yes this doesn't get you the rook due to the knight being on e2. After g3 black could play Bxg3 (if the knight wasn't there) and after h2xg3 the Q takes the rook. Maybe that's why white put the Knight there.  But moving Qh4 does force white to play g3 as Ng3 gets you the rook after BxNch. 
g3 weakens the castled position of white if he was to castle this side. So its a prophylactic type move."
