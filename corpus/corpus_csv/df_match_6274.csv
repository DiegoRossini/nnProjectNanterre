1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I've decided I want to play the Caro-Kann defence because I see the masters play it and I like the sort of game it leads up to... lots of maneouvring and such. I'm afraid it's one of those ones where you have to get the timing just right for things to work though. A lot of the openings are like that nowadays. Another opening I like for Black, retorting 1. e4 is 1. ... d6, the Pirc defense, often followed by 2. ... Nf6 3. ... g6 4. ... Bg7 5. ... 0-0. I like it because up to that point it's hard to make a mistake. But from then on things get more complex. That's why I'm sticking to Caro-Kann."

3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Believe it or not, some people actually play 2. c4 here instead. And it's actually a very formidable opening, in my opinion. Leads to 2. ... d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. cxd5 Nf6 5. Nc3 Nxd5 6. Nf3 and White has a very good game. 2. c4 is called the anti-Caro-Kann defence and 2. ... d5 is called the anti-anti-Caro-Kann defence, believe it or not! If you don't, google it! Go ahead! Pretty ridiculous really. But I can see where they're coming from. Instead, a better response to 3. exd5 is 3. ... Nf6 4. d4 cxd5 5. Nc3 g6 and Black has got a more playable game."
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"The advance variation. I do not like this for Black. I don't know why, I just don't like the sort of game it brings about. I like more 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7, leading to a more interesting game, in my own opinion.

3. f3 is interesting as well, to say the least. Leads to 3. ... e6 4. Be3 Nf6 5. e5 Nfd7 and White has a lot of space. Also Black's c8 Bishop is hemmed in. 3. f3 is the Tarkatower fantasy variation."

Leads to 6. ... h5 7. Bxc6+ bxc6 8. Qa4 and black is in trouuuuuble. So maybe 3. ... c5 isn't that great after all. Depends how smart White is. :)"
7,c3,c2c3,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pPb2/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"(!?) This move surprised me a bit. Is this a normal variation? Because I haven't encountered it before. I guess it transposes later on, but I usually expect something like 4. Bd3. But I reckon the best thing to do if you don't know the opening is to do what you'd usually do in the regular opening. If what he does doesn't hamper that, of course."

Maybe even 6. ... c5. Very aggressive. 7. Nf3 Nc6 8. 0-0 Qb6 9. a3! cxd4 10. cxd4 Nge7 and White has the advantage again. So maybe not. 9. a3! stops the knight from moving to b4, and gaining tempo from threatening the Queen. I thought that was a genius move, too, by the way."
