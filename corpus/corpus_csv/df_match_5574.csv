1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

I hope you are all having a nice weekend.  After coming on the wrong end of a tactical melee in my previous annotated game at least The Beginner got one tactic right in her game against a Class A 1800+ player called Jean-Pierre.  I drew my MT game with him as white so it was nice to get a win with the black pieces over him.  I played against The Vienna Opening which I remember trying out against Coach Ion without too much success.  The gameknot analysis link to the game is as follows:- http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15246679&fb=1&rnd=0.599032368192871.  The moves of this opening are e4 e5 and Nc3 rather than Nf3."
