1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

So many times have my Expert and Master buddies have said how patient they have been when they have been trying to press home advantages or even deal with slight disadvantages when playing me.  Well, this time it is my turn to be the higher rated opponent here.  I end up playing against the Sicilian Dragon.  I try to break through but meet stubborn resistance and at one stage my opponent (whose optimum rating was 1562) had very much the better of it.  He slipped up very late on in the game and allowed me to win 2 pawns.  I sacrificed those two pawns to exchange into a K & P ending.  Henry had the final say and I got my first rated win in about 3 weeks."
