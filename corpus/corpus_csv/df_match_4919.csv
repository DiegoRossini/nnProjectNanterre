5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,I guess I thought being aggressive would mean I dictate the game. Being white I wanted to use that tempo advantage to stop you running rings around me. It didn't work! From now on I'll save this aggressive style for lower rated players I think.
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,"After the exchange on d4 I feel I am in quite a good position here. Nice centre control, and both bishops free to move whereas one of yours is blocked in."

12,Bd7,c8d7,r2qkb1r/pp1bpppp/2np1n2/8/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 3 7,Looking back this move makes no sense to me. I suppose I was just thinking lets get all the minor pieces developed.
13,Bg5,c1g5,r2qkb1r/pp1bpppp/2np1n2/6B1/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 4 7,Looking back this move makes no sense to me. I suppose I was just thinking lets get all the minor pieces developed.
14,Qa5,d8a5,r3kb1r/pp1bpppp/2np1n2/q5B1/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 5 8,"Good  move from you, pinning the knight down and threatening the bishop. I think maybe you were hoping for the upcoming exchange on f6, giving you the bishop pair. Since this game, I've found out that in grandmaster play trading a bishop for a knight isn't seen as a good move. Here though, I'm sure I thought that the bishop and knight were worth exactly the same."
15,Bxf6,g5f6,r3kb1r/pp1bpppp/2np1B2/q7/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 8,Well at least you have the doubled up pawns here. I never got the chance to take advantage though!

17,O-O,e1g1,r3kb1r/pp1bpp1p/2np1p2/q7/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 1 9,Finally I castle. My king is quite safe (for now).
18,Qc5,a5c5,r3kb1r/pp1bpp1p/2np1p2/2q5/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 2 10,"Forcing me to do something about the double threat to my knight on d4, as well as my bishop on c4."

20,bxc6,b7c6,r3kb1r/p2bpp1p/2pp1p2/2q5/2B1P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 11,Trying to keep the bishop where it is to maintain at least some centre ground. But maybe retreating the bishop to d3 or e2 would have been better.

Instead of moving the knight towards the kingside to help out against your upcoming onslaught, i decide to put it on the rim of the board on the queenside! My thinking must have been just to get your queen away from the centre but this is really a poor move, the knight is now useless for the rest of the game."
24,Qa5,c5a5,r3kb1r/p2bpp2/2pp1p2/q6p/N1B1P3/1P6/P1P2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 2 13,"I'm preoccupied with trying to force a retreat from your queen. I guess I was thinking pawn to b4 after moving the knight on a4 out of the way, but this is a lot of effort to go to just to get your queen back a couple of squares."

In fact, even a bishop sacrifice from you here (Bxh3) may not be the worst idea because it leaves my king wide open to attack."
