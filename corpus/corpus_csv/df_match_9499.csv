1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!  I have been watching a very interesting game played by my mentor, Ionadowman against a strong 1700  player.  Ion won this game by creating an imbalance through a brilliant counter sacrifice on h4 which caused his advanced pawns to break through to queen.  I really need to develop this part of my game.  The only time I have sacrificed material on gameknot is when I am already heavily up in material and I have done this to stamp out any remnants of counterplay by my opponent.  This is something altogether different.  I hope I can learn something from this."

Maybe there are possibilities of a kingside attack but black must be very watchful of action down The Fool's Mate Diagonal, particularly from the enemy queen in the opening.

This formation is his favorite response to the English Opening. Having had some affinity with the Dutch Defence, this is a very aggressive line. A good example of the way the game can develop is cormel vs ionadowman, played a couple of years ago."

Ion now develops his queen knight, temporarily blocking in his lsb, but I do not think his opponent can take advantage of this. I suppose if Ion plays Be6 before Nd7 then white can play his knight to g5 and if the bishop goes to f7 it will be swapped off.  Mind you, in closed positions knights can be better than bishops.

Ion stated that this is the beginning of a strategic dichotomy: White bases his chances on Q-side play; Black aims directly at White's King. Both side have chances. Although I like Black's game, I would have no objection to playing the White pieces in this sort of position."

Suddenly all thoughts of direct mating attacks have gone caput.  The material balance remains the same but white has a healthy pawn majority on both sides of the board.  Remember, if the material count stays the same with nearly all the pawns, the major pieces and one set of minor pieces swapped off the game may well be drawn.  Note - king and minor piece cannot mate lone king, 2 pawns are 2 potential queens which can quite easily mate a bare king."

Yes, Ion has sacrificed his knight for two pawns restoring the material count as the white h pawn cannot be saved.  White plays 36.

Ion stated that ""Black's 34th came as a surprise even to me - and I played it! Fact is, I was about to play something like 34...Ke7 and happened, rather idly, to glance at 34...Nxg3. Of course that move is quickly seen as hopeless, but suddenly the alternate capture came to mind, with the rook follow-up (as played). Clearly White's h-pawn cannot be protected, Black establishes a mobile majority of his own on the K-flank, and White has a possible skewer (...Rh1) to attend to. Such were the consequences of White's 34th move. The whole game is transformed. Good enough for me!"""
