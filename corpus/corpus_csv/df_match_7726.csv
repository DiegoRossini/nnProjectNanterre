1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"A real live case!  So I just had to share it.  This game is from Samsara's 45th Tournament, which is progressing quite nicely so far.  I started cautiously with 1. d4, planning to play a strategic game, and so it proceeded for a while, till an opportunity presented itself."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,Black's most flexible response.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Apparently aiming for the Nimzo-Indian, one of Black's strongest openings."
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Apparently aiming for the Nimzo-Indian, one of Black's strongest openings."
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"I take a side-step from the mainline Nimzo, inviting either the Bogo-Indian (3...Bb4) or the Queen's Indian (3...b6)"
6,b6,b7b6,rnbqkb1r/p1pp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Black opts for the Queen's Indian, a double-edged opening in my experience: I don't think I have a good record either with it or against it!"
7,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/p1pp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2PP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"Normal, I think, is 5...Be7.  This move doesn't seem as strong as if White had already played Nc3 but I could be wrong..."
8,Bb7,c8b7,rn1qkb1r/pbpp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2PP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"Normal, I think, is 5...Be7.  This move doesn't seem as strong as if White had already played Nc3 but I could be wrong..."
9,Be2,f1e2,rn1qkb1r/pbpp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2PP4/4PN2/PP2BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 5,"Normal, I think, is 5...Be7.  This move doesn't seem as strong as if White had already played Nc3 but I could be wrong..."
10,Bb4+,f8b4,rn1qk2r/pbpp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/1bPP4/4PN2/PP2BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 3 6,"Normal, I think, is 5...Be7.  This move doesn't seem as strong as if White had already played Nc3 but I could be wrong..."
11,Nbd2,b1d2,rn1qk2r/pbpp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/1bPP4/4PN2/PP1NBPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 4 6,"Given the choice, I develop the N to d2, where it is defended by my QB rather than a pawn that would be doubled, leaving an isolated rook's pawn."
12,Ne4,f6e4,rn1qk2r/pbpp1ppp/1p2p3/8/1bPPn3/4PN2/PP1NBPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 5 7,"Black initiates tactics rather than castling or developing another piece.  Understandable in the position but dubious, I feel."
13,O-O,e1g1,rn1qk2r/pbpp1ppp/1p2p3/8/1bPPn3/4PN2/PP1NBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 6 7,I unpin my Nd2 and get my K to safety.
14,f5,f7f5,rn1qk2r/pbpp2pp/1p2p3/5p2/1bPPn3/4PN2/PP1NBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,"Black strengthens control of the long diagonal by weakening the squares around his King.  Again, to my eye, this looks dubious, but I seem to remember it's a fairly standard pawn structure in the Queen's Indian."
15,a3,a2a3,rn1qk2r/pbpp2pp/1p2p3/5p2/1bPPn3/P3PN2/1P1NBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,White pushes back at Black's intruders
16,Be7,b4e7,rn1qk2r/pbppb1pp/1p2p3/5p2/2PPn3/P3PN2/1P1NBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 1 9,"After the exchange, advances and retreats, White is further ahead in development."
17,Nxe4,d2e4,rn1qk2r/pbppb1pp/1p2p3/5p2/2PPN3/P3PN2/1P2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 9,"After the exchange, advances and retreats, White is further ahead in development."
18,Bxe4,b7e4,rn1qk2r/p1ppb1pp/1p2p3/5p2/2PPb3/P3PN2/1P2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 10,"After the exchange, advances and retreats, White is further ahead in development."
19,Nd2,f3d2,rn1qk2r/p1ppb1pp/1p2p3/5p2/2PPb3/P3P3/1P1NBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 10,"After the exchange, advances and retreats, White is further ahead in development."
20,Bb7,e4b7,rn1qk2r/pbppb1pp/1p2p3/5p2/2PP4/P3P3/1P1NBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 11,"After the exchange, advances and retreats, White is further ahead in development."
21,Bf3,e2f3,rn1qk2r/pbppb1pp/1p2p3/5p2/2PP4/P3PB2/1P1N1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 3 11,Another typical Queen's Indian move that contests the centre but leaves the black squares looking weak and maybe isn't as strong as Black hopes.  The pawn can't take the hanging pawn on c4 because it's pinned against the Bb7.
22,d5,d7d5,rn1qk2r/pbp1b1pp/1p2p3/3p1p2/2PP4/P3PB2/1P1N1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 12,Another typical Queen's Indian move that contests the centre but leaves the black squares looking weak and maybe isn't as strong as Black hopes.  The pawn can't take the hanging pawn on c4 because it's pinned against the Bb7.
23,b3,b2b3,rn1qk2r/pbp1b1pp/1p2p3/3p1p2/2PP4/PP2PB2/3N1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 12,"White nevertheless defends the pawn, preparing to develop his QB to b2, with the longer term aim of exploiting that long black diagonal."
24,O-O,e8g8,rn1q1rk1/pbp1b1pp/1p2p3/3p1p2/2PP4/PP2PB2/3N1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 13,"The game is beginning to look like the long strategic struggle I'd originally envisaged.  White's position may be slightly stronger, with Black's QN and QR still at home, but there's not much in it."
25,Bb2,c1b2,rn1q1rk1/pbp1b1pp/1p2p3/3p1p2/2PP4/PP2PB2/1B1N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 2 13,"The game is beginning to look like the long strategic struggle I'd originally envisaged.  White's position may be slightly stronger, with Black's QN and QR still at home, but there's not much in it."
26,Bf6,e7f6,rn1q1rk1/pbp3pp/1p2pb2/3p1p2/2PP4/PP2PB2/1B1N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 3 14,Black opposes White's B on the black diagonal.  Our positions are nearly symmetrical.
27,Rc1,a1c1,rn1q1rk1/pbp3pp/1p2pb2/3p1p2/2PP4/PP2PB2/1B1N1PPP/2RQ1RK1 b - - 4 14,This move threatens to open up the c-file and provide attacking avenues for White.
28,c5,c7c5,rn1q1rk1/pb4pp/1p2pb2/2pp1p2/2PP4/PP2PB2/1B1N1PPP/2RQ1RK1 w - - 0 15,Black responds with another symmetrical move but I think he should have got that N out by now.
29,Qe2,d1e2,rn1q1rk1/pb4pp/1p2pb2/2pp1p2/2PP4/PP2PB2/1B1NQPPP/2R2RK1 b - - 1 15,"With this, White hopes to exploit the weakling on e6 and the empty f7 square.  He also prepares to centralise the other rook and maybe double on the c-file."
30,Qe7,d8e7,rn3rk1/pb2q1pp/1p2pb2/2pp1p2/2PP4/PP2PB2/1B1NQPPP/2R2RK1 w - - 2 16,Another symmetrical move by Black but White is two tempi up...
