In any case, I don't immdiately see the reason for it. Sure, in many openings white likes to post a knight or bishop on b5 and black often likes to play a6 to prevent that, or to drive away the white piece. I don't see that white can make any terribly strong threats on b5 yet, and black could hold a6 to drive off the white piece if white plays there. Maybe 3. ... Nf6 to prepare to catle, or 3. ... d6 to open up the other bishop. Still, I go with the masters on this one."

Bishops like to jump into the fray, preferably from a safe distance, but they don't like to hide behind their own pawns. At least to my way of thinking. Still, it's popular in the DB. And now the DB has 2,447 games with this position, and 2,403 of them say to play 4. ... d6. But, 43 grandmasters say otherwise and suggest 4. ... b5. This denies c4 to white, a square that otherwise could be a strong outpost for a bishop. It also signifies a clear intent to play on the queenside. Other than that, I don't see any benefit, and maybe would have thought 4. ... d6 was better. Who am I to argue with grandmasters?"

On black's 4th move, the DB had the position heavily in favor of black (22 wins for black vs. 14 for white, with 7 draws).
