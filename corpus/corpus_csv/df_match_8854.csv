2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Here, the ""winning"" move for white is d5. It puts me under a real pressure, since black cannot allow white to go to b5 with one of its minor pieces. The only time I faced an opponent who went for it, I was crushed in a dozen games. Black doesn't have to take fxe5, and if white takes dxc6, black has to play, very oddly, bxc6, otherwise Nb5, and related moves are overwhelming. Maybe this is not completely accurate, or oversimplified, I admit."

With 11. h3, I better think in how to defend, and normally I can (I have a good knight jump due to the pin of the d4 pawn in front of the white queen. It always worries white...)."

Anyway, there are some compensations here: 
I can take the d pawn with my rook. 
After the check, I can simply retire my king to b8. It IS in danger, but my attack is going on. 
After the lsb moves, I can jump with my knight to g4, adding material to my attack."
