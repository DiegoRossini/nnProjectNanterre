1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is a game which I played against kraken during ""karlo715's mini-tournament IX"".

This game featured an opening which I had never seen before [Patzer (C20)], and this unfamiliarity caused me to play aggressively from the start. Furthermore I believe my inexperience with this opening threw my opponent off his game, causing the fatal 5.Qg5? mistake."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,My reply to the opening was one that I thought would counter the opening well enough to get me through to the endgame. Post-game computer analysis disagrees and suggested Nc6 instead.

If 4.Nh3 denied me the acquisition of one of his pawns, it was a fatal move, because of the now certain capture of his queen. I don't know what caused my opponent to overlook these scenarios, but am now fairly certain it was because of my 2... Qf6, which he probably never had seen before, making him blunder into 3.g4?. 

I thought this would be a game that would be nice to annotate, because it is one that made me think very hard, called for creativity in the opening instead of a memorized one  and it would demonstrate the danger of using uncommon openings, as the responses are not all given, forcing some blunders early into the game that can be fatal."
