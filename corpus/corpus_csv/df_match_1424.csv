1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This is one of those heavily-analyzed King's Indian Defense variations.  It is called the Gligoric-Taimanov system in ECO E92.  It often produces very dynamic games with chances for both sides. And the field can shift from queen-side to king-side or can exist on both sides simultaneously.  This game shows how a heavy queen-side attack can shift suddenly to the king-side.
