19,Nde2,d4e2,rnb1k2r/1pq1bppp/p2p1n2/4pP2/4P3/1BN5/PPP1N1PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 10,"From here, the N can move to c3 to support the other N when it has gone to d5.  Alternatively it can go to g3 to defend e4 and, potentially, go via h5 to g7 or f6.  These options seem more flexible than those arising from 10. Nf3."

His pieces are reasonably well placed for action on either wing at this point but the bishops exploit their long range potential in the direction of the kingside.  So a kingside attack it is...

Possibly another wasted move or proper completion of development before undertaking decisive action?"
