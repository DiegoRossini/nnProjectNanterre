1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Queens pawn.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"While we agreed to play the Benoni, Elyhim indicated opening with the knight in this fashion disguises the opening and allows for variation."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,White moves to control the center. Provides little indication of black's intent.
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Still disguising the Modern Benoni, but leaving the option to transition it other openings."
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,White develops the knight and protects his central position.
6,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Now we are clear, full on Benoni."
7,d5,d4d5,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2pP4/2P5/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"White does not want to exchange a flank pawn for a central pawn, so advances"
8,exd5,e6d5,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/5n2/2pp4/2P5/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,Take
9,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/5n2/2pP4/8/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,Take
10,d6,d7d6,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3p1n2/2pP4/8/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"This would appear to give white an advantage. D6 appears to be a weak pawn that white will attempt to capitalize on, without success."
11,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3p1n2/2pP4/8/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,Normal development.
12,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pp3p1p/3p1np1/2pP4/8/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,Black prepares the DSB for fianchetto. This bishop appears to be key to this defense.
13,Bf4,c1f4,rnbqkb1r/pp3p1p/3p1np1/2pP4/5B2/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 7,"White opens up the attack on d6, perhaps a bit too soon."
14,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/5B2/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 8,Black continues his plan for the DSB powerhouse.
15,Qa4+,d1a4,rnbqk2r/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/Q4B2/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 3 8,"Seemed like a good idea, but in actual practice helps black develop the weak bishop and loses a tempo."
16,Bd7,c8d7,rn1qk2r/pp1b1pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/Q4B2/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 4 9,"Black defends and threatens. However, the pawn on b7 is now weak."
17,Qb3,a4b3,rn1qk2r/pp1b1pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/5B2/1QN2N2/PP2PPPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 5 9,"Queen retreats and threatens b7. In addition, shores up the d5 defense. Elyhim warned me of his intent to advance the b pawn at this point in the game."
18,b5,b7b5,rn1qk2r/p2b1pbp/3p1np1/1ppP4/5B2/1QN2N2/PP2PPPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 10,Black responds with an advance.
19,a3,a2a3,rn1qk2r/p2b1pbp/3p1np1/1ppP4/5B2/PQN2N2/1P2PPPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 10,"I debated moving Nxb5 here instead and perhaps should have made that move, but it left the d5 pawn vulnerable and I did not want to give up the central pawn. In addition, I wanted to stop the b5 advance based on discussion Elyhim had with me regarding his goal here. The a3 and b5 pawn stay in this position for the remainder of the game, cramping the Queen side white pieces quite a bit."
20,c4,c5c4,rn1qk2r/p2b1pbp/3p1np1/1p1P4/2p2B2/PQN2N2/1P2PPPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 11,"Threatening the white queen, black is intent on advancing the Queen side pawns."
