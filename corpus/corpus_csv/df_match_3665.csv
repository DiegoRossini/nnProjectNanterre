1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Recently I have seen 2. Nf3 being tried but because black's strong support on d5 coupled with white's weak e pawn it can hardly be recommended.
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Recently I have seen 2. Nf3 being tried but because black's strong support on d5 coupled with white's weak e pawn it can hardly be recommended.

4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,This is not white's best move as he does have better moves to fight for an advantage. The best move is the main line move 3. Nc3. The other common move 3. E5 posses no problems for black. Now The problem with game move is that black gets great use of the c-file and strong centre pawns and active bishops. Plus white exchanges a centre pawn for a flank pawn which is not advisable. The drawback for black is the weakness on the light squares.

6,cxd5,c6d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,The result is an unbalanced pawn structure with white on the queenside. So typical themes are a4-a5 or b4- b5 creating strong point on c5.
7,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"There was a time when this move was considered the end of the caro-kann. However, since then black has found valueable resources to defend and even fight for a win. What is blacks saving grace? Dxc4 and then attack the isolated d pawn."
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,It is important for black that d5 remain under his control at all times. Another good option for black is ...e6 when 5.Nc3 Nf6 6. Bg5 transposes to the QGD semi tarrash defense. But here to black is ok after 6. ...Be7.
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 5,"? This is exactly what white is hoping black would do. This is athematic caro kann move but does little to prevent white's plans on the queen side. I t is recommended that the LSB remain close to home and gaurd the weakened light squares. I would recommend clarifying the center with 5. ...dxc4 6. Bxc4 e6 allowing for Bd6 and castling. Remember what I said at the beginning, black must have control of d5 at all times. After 5. ...Bf5 he loses it."
10,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p1b2/2PP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 3 6,"? This is exactly what white is hoping black would do. This is athematic caro kann move but does little to prevent white's plans on the queen side. I t is recommended that the LSB remain close to home and gaurd the weakened light squares. I would recommend clarifying the center with 5. ...dxc4 6. Bxc4 e6 allowing for Bd6 and castling. Remember what I said at the beginning, black must have control of d5 at all times. After 5. ...Bf5 he loses it."
11,Qb3,d1b3,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p1b2/2PP4/1QN5/PP3PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 4 6,a good move that puts a lot of pressure on d5 and hits at the weak b7 pawn. Take note how white is taking full advantage of the light square weakness on blacks queen side. This is a major theme in this variation of the caro kann.
12,dxc4,d5c4,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/5b2/2pP4/1QN5/PP3PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 0 7,?? This losses a pawn after 7. Bxc4! e6 8. Qxb7. Best is either 6. ...Qb6 or Nbd7
13,Bxc4,f1c4,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/5b2/2BP4/1QN5/PP3PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 0 7,White's advantage is getting clearer now that d5 under his control.
14,Bg6,f5g6,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/5nb1/8/2BP4/1QN5/PP3PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 1 8,very bad. Black is in serious danger of getting overrun on the queen side. 7. ...e6 was necessary in order to make room for castling and developing the DSB. Black committed to sins #1 moving a piece twice #2 abandoning the centre. Black's play here seems to suggest that he has played the caro kann in the past but I wonder if he is familiar with the exchange variation. The key to defending here is controlling c6 and d5.
15,Qxb7,b3b7,rn1qkb1r/pQ2pppp/5nb1/8/2BP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 0 8,?? White correctly understands that c7 is the critical square but i think he thought that Nc7 forking the king and rook wins the rook. Unfortunately for him this move saves rook because Nb5 block Ba6! Winning the rook on c8. The right idea to attack c7 is 9. Bf4!!wins after 9. ...Rc8 10.Ba6(threat win the rook) Rxc3 11.bxc3 Be4 12. Qxa7 is huge for white.
16,Nbd7,b8d7,r2qkb1r/pQ1npppp/5nb1/8/2BP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 1 9,?? White correctly understands that c7 is the critical square but i think he thought that Nc7 forking the king and rook wins the rook. Unfortunately for him this move saves rook because Nb5 block Ba6! Winning the rook on c8. The right idea to attack c7 is 9. Bf4!!wins after 9. ...Rc8 10.Ba6(threat win the rook) Rxc3 11.bxc3 Be4 12. Qxa7 is huge for white.
17,Nb5,c3b5,r2qkb1r/pQ1npppp/5nb1/1N6/2BP4/8/PP3PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 2 9,?? White correctly understands that c7 is the critical square but i think he thought that Nc7 forking the king and rook wins the rook. Unfortunately for him this move saves rook because Nb5 block Ba6! Winning the rook on c8. The right idea to attack c7 is 9. Bf4!!wins after 9. ...Rc8 10.Ba6(threat win the rook) Rxc3 11.bxc3 Be4 12. Qxa7 is huge for white.
18,Rc8,a8c8,2rqkb1r/pQ1npppp/5nb1/1N6/2BP4/8/PP3PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQk - 3 10,The rook is safe no and black suddenly springs to life.
19,Bf4,c1f4,2rqkb1r/pQ1npppp/5nb1/1N6/2BP1B2/8/PP3PPP/R3K1NR b KQk - 4 10,"?? Most young players think that brazen attacking moves defend, this is rarely works in practice. Strong players always defend their pieces so 10. Be2 Be4 11. Qxa7 bxg2 12. Bf3 bxh1 13. Bxh1 is most likely a draw because of white's superiority on the light squares."
20,e5,e7e5,2rqkb1r/pQ1n1ppp/5nb1/1N2p3/2BP1B2/8/PP3PPP/R3K1NR w KQk - 0 11,The main counter attack for black in this type of caro kann. This wins the c4 bishop.
21,dxe5,d4e5,2rqkb1r/pQ1n1ppp/5nb1/1N2P3/2B2B2/8/PP3PPP/R3K1NR b KQk - 0 11,"? 11. ...Be4! 12. Qxa7 Rxc4 wins a bishop for a pawn. However, developing the bishop at the expense of the white king is not a bad idea. It is just not as direct."
22,Bb4+,f8b4,2rqk2r/pQ1n1ppp/5nb1/1N2P3/1bB2B2/8/PP3PPP/R3K1NR w KQk - 1 12,"? 11. ...Be4! 12. Qxa7 Rxc4 wins a bishop for a pawn. However, developing the bishop at the expense of the white king is not a bad idea. It is just not as direct."
23,Ke2,e1e2,2rqk2r/pQ1n1ppp/5nb1/1N2P3/1bB2B2/8/PP2KPPP/R5NR b k - 2 12,?? as bad as it looks 12. Nc3 was the best defense.
24,Rxc4,c8c4,3qk2r/pQ1n1ppp/5nb1/1N2P3/1br2B2/8/PP2KPPP/R5NR w k - 0 13,White is done but opening the lines to your king is suicide. Best is 13.Rd1.
25,exf6,e5f6,3qk2r/pQ1n1ppp/5Pb1/1N6/1br2B2/8/PP2KPPP/R5NR b k - 0 13,White is done but opening the lines to your king is suicide. Best is 13.Rd1.
26,Rxf4,c4f4,3qk2r/pQ1n1ppp/5Pb1/1N6/1b3r2/8/PP2KPPP/R5NR w k - 0 14,O-O is most likely faster.
27,fxg7,f6g7,3qk2r/pQ1n1pPp/6b1/1N6/1b3r2/8/PP2KPPP/R5NR b k - 0 14,Maybe 14. Rd1 was more active defense.
28,Qe7+,d8e7,4k2r/pQ1nqpPp/6b1/1N6/1b3r2/8/PP2KPPP/R5NR w k - 1 15,Good finish to a well fought game for both players.
29,Kd1,e2d1,4k2r/pQ1nqpPp/6b1/1N6/1b3r2/8/PP3PPP/R2K2NR b k - 2 15,Good finish to a well fought game for both players.
