A bolt from the blue... but one that Bob must have planned well in advance: his queen being otherwise imperilled."" John credited me with too much foresight but I do love this move, inspired as it was by Nigel Short's Bishop sacrifice on f2 in his 17th game against Kasparov, which I had witnessed live at the Savoy.
I felt a Rook sac might be on, maybe when the Bishop came to f1, but it would be too well covered by White's Rooks and I was still undeveloped on my Queen side, so I could not bring my other Rook into the attack.  Then I saw that if I could entice the King away from h2, the pawns fell and White's King might get mated.  So I looked at Rf2.  With the threat of mate on h2, White had to take.  Even if the King didn't get mated, I should recover the piece when White had to block check on f3... Incidentally, when I played through the game on my computer, it played Rf2 instantly."
