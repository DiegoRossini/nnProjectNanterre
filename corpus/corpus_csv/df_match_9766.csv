Instead Black should have developed normally, as a Knight or a Bishop on g5 is easily countered with ...Be7 or ...h6 (with tempo this time)."

7,dxe5,d4e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/3p3p/4P3/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"This just gives up the pawn. If there was a gambit-like aspiration behind it, it doesn't appear to work, because even though after 5. exd5 White's pawns are far enough forward that they have the potential to become targets, Black has no  concrete way of attacking them. They completely dominate the center and force Black's Knights on to less than ideal squares. And, even if White ends up having to give back one of these pawns, he remains ahead in material!"

9,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/7p/3PP3/8/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,Another wasted tempo. And this one takes one of the Knight's precious squares away from it.
10,a6,a7a6,rnbqkbnr/1pp2pp1/p6p/3PP3/8/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,Another wasted tempo. And this one takes one of the Knight's precious squares away from it.
11,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/1pp2pp1/p6p/3PP3/8/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"It wouldn't be abnormal to play 6. c4 here. In fact, I think White should have played it before Nc3. It contributes to the center, which could be very hard to defend due to its advanced nature."
12,Nd7,b8d7,r1bqkbnr/1ppn1pp1/p6p/3PP3/8/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 7,"Normally, Knights are supposed to be developed before Bishops, but when the only square the Knight can go to blocks the Bishop, it is usually wiser to develop the Bishop first. As Black's two pawn moves have severely restricted his Knights, he should worry about getting his Bishops to active squares first. Moves like ...Bg4, ...Bb4, and ...Bc5 should be Black's first priority. Especially the moves that pin the Knights, because he's already squandered away two full tempos and pawns. He should first try to restrain, and then try to undermine White's center."
13,Bf4,c1f4,r1bqkbnr/1ppn1pp1/p6p/3PP3/5B2/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 3 7,"7. Be3 was also possible, but this allows White to play defensively with Bg3 if the need arises. Of course, by not playing Be3, White has chosen to the pawn on f2 vulnerable. However, that pawn doesn't really need to be defended as White will be able to castle in two moves, and Black can't take advantage of its vulnerability fast enough."

(I didn't cover it in the last comment because it happened here). While White is happy to play his Bishop to g3 for defence, Black is suddenly able aim his guns at the center with ...Bg7. Also, he gets to kick off his pawn storm with a tempo! It's a good thing that White hasn't committed to castling yet, because now he can castle queenside and punish Black's choice not to wait to play g5 until White had committed."
15,Bg3,f4g3,r1bqkbnr/1ppn1p2/p6p/3PP1p1/8/2N2NB1/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 8,"I think White would have been safer by playing 9. h4 where the Bishop has some guarantee of its safety.

However, White has decided to blow apart the center for a reason: He wants to punish Black for his utter lack of development. It looks like it would have been stronger to first apply pressure to the center via h4 and then moves like Bc4, Qe2 and O-O-O, but this isn't bad."

If Black takes the pawn on h4, then White will get a key foothold into the position with his Bishop. However, if Black chooses to advance the pawn to g4, then the c1-h6 diagonal will open up for White's Bishop or Queen to use later. White's dark-squared Bishop can get the same foothold by playing from g3-f4-g5 if he decides that's how he wants to continue. Either way, Black's position gets more dangerous."

Instead of playing Bd3 right away, I think that White should play 15. b4! booting the only contention of d3 out of its spot, and allowing the Bishop to remain on the board after Bd3."
