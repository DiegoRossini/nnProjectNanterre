1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Ding-a-ling!  Time for Round 2 against Grundnorm in the Beafyness tourney.  I get a seemingly reasonable position as white but then a pawn push on the queenside pushes my pieces back and later on black has a decisive pawn majority which nets him a passed pawn.  I try to get my pieces to pile up on it but I do not get the chance to take it free of charge.  The position of the black rook and the Wicked Witch of the West provide the final denouement for me.  I decide to kick off with d4 as I played e4 against him in a recent unrated game and lost so I thought I would mix things up.
