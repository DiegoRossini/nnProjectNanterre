This game catches my immediate attention because White plays King's Gambit.  Watch it."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Black tries the Ruy Lopez leading for White to try the King's Gambit:
3,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,And there it is! I am immediately focused on this game regardless of what player is on what side.  This is a tried and true King's Gambit from White against the weak Ruy Lopez! How more exciting can this get now? In the King's Gambit White takes incredible risk to overpower Black using the common Ruy Lopez. I hate common Black Defenses.  I am for White at this point!  White is doing the century old Gambit! Will it be declined or accepted?
4,exf4,e5f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Accepted!
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,Standard! For the King's Gambit Accepted! (or King Bishop to Queen Bishop Four!)
6,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,Black is hoping to pin King Knight to the Queen!
7,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/2B1Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,The King's Bishop is coming out to place.  I'd be worried about the pin and what to do to make life harder for Black. You can bring out the knight or the bishop or both but we must pay attention to what happens now...
8,Be6,c8e6,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3pb3/8/2B1Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,In this scenario I'd have taken the Black Bishop right away since it would mess up the Black 0-0 area.  What does white do?
9,Be2,c4e2,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3pb3/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPPB1PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 5,He backs off! And he should be ATTACKING hard and fast in the King's Gambit!
10,Be7,f8e7,rn1qk1nr/ppp1bppp/3pb3/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPPB1PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 6,It looks like a reasonable move for Black at this time to develop without problem. Why not? When you use the King's Gambit you ATTACK and never stop ATTACKING. White retreated and now Black is opening safely.
11,O-O,e1g1,rn1qk1nr/ppp1bppp/3pb3/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPPB1PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 5 6,"Seems ""safe"" but now Black is attacking. A King's Gambit does not always require an immediate 0-0. Especially when the attack is failing."
12,g5,g7g5,rn1qk1nr/ppp1bp1p/3pb3/6p1/4Pp2/5N2/PPPPB1PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,Common to reinforce that f4 pawn.
13,d4,d2d4,rn1qk1nr/ppp1bp1p/3pb3/6p1/3PPp2/5N2/PPP1B1PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,White is trying to just develop now.  He already retreated from the ATTACK to the DEFENSE.
14,h6,h7h6,rn1qk1nr/ppp1bp2/3pb2p/6p1/3PPp2/5N2/PPP1B1PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,More reinforcement.
15,c4,c2c4,rn1qk1nr/ppp1bp2/3pb2p/6p1/2PPPp2/5N2/PP2B1PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,More opening up.
16,Nf6,g8f6,rn1qk2r/ppp1bp2/3pbn1p/6p1/2PPPp2/5N2/PP2B1PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 9,More Black development.
17,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qk2r/ppp1bp2/3pbn1p/6p1/2PPPp2/2N2N2/PP2B1PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 2 9,More White development.
18,Bg4,e6g4,rn1qk2r/ppp1bp2/3p1n1p/6p1/2PPPpb1/2N2N2/PP2B1PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 3 10,Okay. Now White needs to do something else besides...
19,b3,b2b3,rn1qk2r/ppp1bp2/3p1n1p/6p1/2PPPpb1/1PN2N2/P3B1PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 10,THIS! Can you see the move White should have done instead?
20,Nc6,b8c6,r2qk2r/ppp1bp2/2np1n1p/6p1/2PPPpb1/1PN2N2/P3B1PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 1 11,Nothing wrong with Black continuing to develop while White sits in arears!
