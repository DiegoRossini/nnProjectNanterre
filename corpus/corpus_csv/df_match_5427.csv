5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,I have no idea if this is book or not. It certainly requires a continuation gambit after 4. dxe5 or else accept an inferior position without queens and in light of the game it's probably fair to say that there is a distinctive lack of compensation.

11,Bc4,f1c4,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/2BpP3/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 1 6,Not exactly the prettiest of moves or one I'd even remotely considered to be honest. The kingside light squares prove to be very rickety following this. I considered trying to outright punish the weird looking f6 with e6 but eventually decided to just continue with basic development and pressure whilst letting black's weaknesses win the game for me.

13,O-O,e1g1,rn1qkbnr/ppp3pp/5p2/4P3/2BpP3/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 1 7,"This move pretty much finishes things though they were only headed one way regardless to be honest. The light squares are now completely indefensible. Much more sensible was Nc6. Qc7 with the idea of forcing white to resolve the tension in the pawn structure is falling short against exf6, Nxf6, e5, Ng8, Bf4, where black's pieces are all still asleep with white ready to finish the game. The continuations with Nc6 are much less dramatic with White simply intending to improve his position with Bf4 and Re1 before capturing on f6 and playing e5 N.B The idea of Bf4 is to prevent a swap off of queens after exf6, Qxf6 in the future and keep the most amount of firepower on the board to exploit black's weaknesses."

Comments are much appreciated so thank you to the contributor to that detail"

Qh5+ has pointed out to me the move Bf7+ which I'm actually rather annoyed with myself for missing. Nethertheless Black's position does pretty much fold here so it's easy to see winning lines and not press in searching for alternatives
