1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"In my opinion, the hardest chess games to play, from the psychological standpoint, are those where you've already missed a clear-cut chance to win the game. You feel that you must win now in order to expunge the earlier mistake, but putting yourself under extra pressure only makes it easier to make further mistakes. I've chosen a tennis theme for this annotation because the 2010 Wimbledon Championships were played while the game was in progress, and this made me reflect on how the game was not unlike a tennis match, with ""break points"" being missed by both sides."

In essence, it's a rally in which both sides are making sure the other never has the opportunity to grab the e-pawn, or at least, can't take much advantage by doing so."

A logically motivated move, as the bishop is denied g4 and so seeks development on the other diagonal, putting pressure on White's currently underdefended pawn on e4.
