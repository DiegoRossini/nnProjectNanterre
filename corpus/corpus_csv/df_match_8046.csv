1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I do not have much experience playing against the dutch. I played Bf4 cuz it seems natural and aims at a weak point in blacks defense(c7). I also did not like the prospect that my bishop would be blocked by it's own pawns so I developed it out side the pawn chain.

6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppppp2p/5np1/5p2/3P1B2/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,The heart of black's counter attacks are through e4.
7,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/ppppp2p/5np1/5p2/3P1B2/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,The disadvantage of playing e3 is that it becomes an attacking point for black via f5-f4.
8,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppppp1bp/5np1/5p2/3P1B2/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,Developing the bishop to it's optimal spot and slowing down black's development by preventing the immediate castling
9,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqk2r/ppppp1bp/5np1/5p2/2BP1B2/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 2 5,Developing the bishop to it's optimal spot and slowing down black's development by preventing the immediate castling
10,d5,d7d5,rnbqk2r/ppp1p1bp/5np1/3p1p2/2BP1B2/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 6,I had planned for this so I was not surprised that Biggie played it. From my prespective it makes the center more static leading to a more quiet game.
11,Be2,c4e2,rnbqk2r/ppp1p1bp/5np1/3p1p2/3P1B2/4PN2/PPP1BPPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 1 6,This is a typical move by me where I put immediate pressure on the centre.
12,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1p1bp/5np1/3p1p2/3P1B2/4PN2/PPP1BPPP/RN1QK2R w KQ - 2 7,This is a typical move by me where I put immediate pressure on the centre.
13,c4,c2c4,rnbq1rk1/ppp1p1bp/5np1/3p1p2/2PP1B2/4PN2/PP2BPPP/RN1QK2R b KQ - 0 7,This is a typical move by me where I put immediate pressure on the centre.
14,Nh5,f6h5,rnbq1rk1/ppp1p1bp/6p1/3p1p1n/2PP1B2/4PN2/PP2BPPP/RN1QK2R w KQ - 1 8,I am not sure exactly what black was thinking here but it is too aggressive. I am a guy that like to keep a clean pawn chain so  I will not allow an exchange on f4.
15,Be5,f4e5,rnbq1rk1/ppp1p1bp/6p1/3pBp1n/2PP4/4PN2/PP2BPPP/RN1QK2R b KQ - 2 8,This is a good reply to black's last move as it leaves white with greater control of the centre.
16,Nd7,b8d7,r1bq1rk1/pppnp1bp/6p1/3pBp1n/2PP4/4PN2/PP2BPPP/RN1QK2R w KQ - 3 9,"black rightly avoids the exchange of bishops because he gets no real advantage from it. White however, achieves that positional advantage of a nicely central knight."
17,cxd5,c4d5,r1bq1rk1/pppnp1bp/6p1/3PBp1n/3P4/4PN2/PP2BPPP/RN1QK2R b KQ - 0 9,With this capture white completely owns the centre. As well it give white space to create attacking chances along the b2-g8 diagonal.
18,Nxe5,d7e5,r1bq1rk1/ppp1p1bp/6p1/3Pnp1n/3P4/4PN2/PP2BPPP/RN1QK2R w KQ - 0 10,very nice pawns!
19,dxe5,d4e5,r1bq1rk1/ppp1p1bp/6p1/3PPp1n/8/4PN2/PP2BPPP/RN1QK2R b KQ - 0 10,very nice pawns!
20,f4,f5f4,r1bq1rk1/ppp1p1bp/6p1/3PP2n/5p2/4PN2/PP2BPPP/RN1QK2R w KQ - 0 11,?? a clear blunder that weakens the king side for very little in return. I am not quite sure what black had in mind with this move.
21,Nc3,b1c3,r1bq1rk1/ppp1p1bp/6p1/3PP2n/5p2/2N1PN2/PP2BPPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 1 11,? An OK move but perhaps too risky in the fact that it allows black to open the f file for his rook. Much better is 11.E4 and it will be hard for black to draw. I am guilty of playing too passively.
22,Bg4,c8g4,r2q1rk1/ppp1p1bp/6p1/3PP2n/5pb1/2N1PN2/PP2BPPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 2 12,Black increases his control of the  f file.
23,O-O,e1g1,r2q1rk1/ppp1p1bp/6p1/3PP2n/5pb1/2N1PN2/PP2BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 3 12,?? This was my last chance to play the advantageous e4. I wanted to hold a semi balance on the f file and feared that my king would get stuck in the centre. playing e4 is clearly better after which black has his work cut out for himself to open the f file.
24,fxe3,f4e3,r2q1rk1/ppp1p1bp/6p1/3PP2n/6b1/2N1pN2/PP2BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 13,! this forces the exchange of rooks and black losses any hopes of controlling the f file.
