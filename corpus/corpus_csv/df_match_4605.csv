1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

It has been a while since I have annotated a game.  I have been writing up some memoirs of my friendship with a lady called Rita who died of breast cancer last year.  I am now putting the finishing touches on the memoirs so hopefully I will be able to. a. Get some closure from the death, although I will never forget about her, b. Move faster, c. annotate more games.  Anyhow, here I am, up against an IM called Hexs (Hector).  After 1. e4, he responded with e6 which is the French Defense.  Gameknot analysis is provided here:-http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=16540036&rnd=0.7359081799218419.  Just 3 innaccuracies from myself proved decisive."
