1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,something i thought was a little different as i've never played it before also mainly because i'd lost a really embarassing game after someone played b4 as white on move 8 and i wanted to avoid repeating the experience - even at the cost of delaying playing e5. if anyone does no the correct continuation (C5 perhaps?) could they please correct me.

15,e4,e2e4,r1bq1rk1/1ppnppbp/3p1np1/p7/2PPP3/2N2NP1/PP3PBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 8,transposing into something like a sicilian
16,c5,c7c5,r1bq1rk1/1p1nppbp/3p1np1/p1p5/2PPP3/2N2NP1/PP3PBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 9,transposing into something like a sicilian
17,b3,b2b3,r1bq1rk1/1p1nppbp/3p1np1/p1p5/2PPP3/1PN2NP1/P4PBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 9,"a bit quesitonable, wouldn't Be3 be more sound? two bishops pointing at the same flank and all that?"
18,cxd4,c5d4,r1bq1rk1/1p1nppbp/3p1np1/p7/2PpP3/1PN2NP1/P4PBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 10,a fantastic position! asthetically beautiful. identical pieces except knights which are symetrical around the h1-a8 diagonal and marginally different pawn structures! perhpas thats what drew me to play this move as it isn't all that strong in its own right. Yes it centralizes the knight and starts making a bid for the f3 and g4 squares BUT it gives white the oppertunity to win tempo with f4 and also to create a rather dashing pawn formation. the main idea behind this of course being Bg4 as a substatial threat after f4 is played. (or Ng4 meaning something must stay back to protect e3).
19,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bq1rk1/1p1nppbp/3p1np1/p7/2PNP3/1PN3P1/P4PBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 10,a fantastic position! asthetically beautiful. identical pieces except knights which are symetrical around the h1-a8 diagonal and marginally different pawn structures! perhpas thats what drew me to play this move as it isn't all that strong in its own right.

21,a4,a2a4,r1bq1rk1/1p2ppbp/3p1np1/p3n3/P1PNP3/1PN3P1/5PBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 11,"? whilst this halts any queenside advance i think black is making fairly clear his intentions lie in piece play on the kingside and there might have been more productive moves made here- Bf4 or Bg5 may have cost black a little more. as would ideas such as Be3, follwed by Qd2 challenging the fianchetto."
22,Qb6,d8b6,r1b2rk1/1p2ppbp/1q1p1np1/p3n3/P1PNP3/1PN3P1/5PBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 12,not much of a threat really - black is planning to unveil his knights and open up an attack from the bishop on the D knight and the unprotected c knight behind it- white has the resource Ndb5 or Ncb5 here and the drama is essentially over
23,Be3,c1e3,r1b2rk1/1p2ppbp/1q1p1np1/p3n3/P1PNP3/1PN1B1P1/5PBP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 2 12,a little too greedy perhaps? Neg4 is now strong for black
24,Nfg4,f6g4,r1b2rk1/1p2ppbp/1q1p2p1/p3n3/P1PNP1n1/1PN1B1P1/5PBP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 3 13,?? objectively the wrong knight move here. Neg4 is much stronger as it readies e5.
25,Nd5,c3d5,r1b2rk1/1p2ppbp/1q1p2p1/p2Nn3/P1PNP1n1/1P2B1P1/5PBP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 4 13,now black must loose time and run away home to protect e7
26,Qd8,b6d8,r1bq1rk1/1p2ppbp/3p2p1/p2Nn3/P1PNP1n1/1P2B1P1/5PBP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 5 14,"a poor use of the extra tempi. a more agressive move such as Qd2 might have been more interesting, presumably this is in preparation for f4, so that after Nxe3, Rxe3 (NOT Nxe3?) the black queen cannot threaten via b6"
27,Re1,f1e1,r1bq1rk1/1p2ppbp/3p2p1/p2Nn3/P1PNP1n1/1P2B1P1/5PBP/R2QR1K1 b - - 6 14,"a poor use of the extra tempi. a more agressive move such as Qd2 might have been more interesting, presumably this is in preparation for f4, so that after Nxe3, Rxe3 (NOT Nxe3?) the black queen cannot threaten via b6"
28,Nxe3,g4e3,r1bq1rk1/1p2ppbp/3p2p1/p2Nn3/P1PNP3/1P2n1P1/5PBP/R2QR1K1 w - - 0 15,"played perhaps a little too early, but the knight is in danger of getting hemmed in if it stays there much longer, and the threat on the fianchetto posed by the black squared bishop is a little disconcerting."
29,Nxe3,d5e3,r1bq1rk1/1p2ppbp/3p2p1/p3n3/P1PNP3/1P2N1P1/5PBP/R2QR1K1 b - - 0 15,a waste of time by black- what can the bishop do here that it couldn't have done from c8? pretty much nothing.
30,Bd7,c8d7,r2q1rk1/1p1bppbp/3p2p1/p3n3/P1PNP3/1P2N1P1/5PBP/R2QR1K1 w - - 1 16,a waste of time by black- what can the bishop do here that it couldn't have done from c8? pretty much nothing.

32,Nc6,e5c6,r2q1rk1/1p1bppbp/2np2p1/p7/P1PNP3/1P2N1P1/5PBP/1R1QR1K1 w - - 3 17,"black tries to apply some non-existant preasure, but more importantly softens up b4 for a knight landing"

34,Qc8,d8c8,r1q2rk1/1p1bppbp/2np2p1/p7/P1PNP3/1P4P1/2N2PBP/1R1QR1K1 w - - 5 18,with designs on the white bishops - playing the line that white opted not to play earlier by allowing the Bishop on e3 to have been taken.
35,h4,h2h4,r1q2rk1/1p1bppbp/2np2p1/p7/P1PNP2P/1P4P1/2N2PB1/1R1QR1K1 b - - 0 18,"why not f4>? arent pawns strongest with the last one in the chain touching the edge? similarly this prevents the strong formation of pawn chain from h to e towards the centre of the board, effectively isolating the e pawn"
36,Bh3,d7h3,r1q2rk1/1p2ppbp/2np2p1/p7/P1PNP2P/1P4Pb/2N2PB1/1R1QR1K1 w - - 1 19,"giving black the option to join up his pawns on c and d- had i been playing white i would have preferred to keep the knight there longer - it's in no hurry to move and is nicely central. any threat from e5 could be countered with this move with the gain of a pawn perhaps due to the discovered attack from the queen on the d file. however the knights stationing wasn't without cost, the queen and other knight were needed there constantly and white it seems would prefer to free up the pieces than keep the outpost"
