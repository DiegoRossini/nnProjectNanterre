1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I am starting with d4. I like that kind of games.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,Nf6 the most popular move.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,c4 follows. I do not like Nf3 right now.
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,And g6 the second most popular after e6. As black i play e6.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,Nc3 is logical. And now we will play the Kings Indian Defence or the Gruenfeld Defence.
6,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"And here is the Kings Indian Defence, an open that i dont like that much playing against it."
7,e4,e2e4,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,e4 continuing the main line.
8,c5,c7c5,rnbqk2r/pp1pppbp/5np1/2p5/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,And then c5. That not usual reply here and i was quite surprised as i found it unexpected. Here d6 or 0-0 were the main replies.
9,d5,d4d5,rnbqk2r/pp1pppbp/5np1/2pP4/2P1P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,So my d5 here is logical. What do you think?
10,d6,d7d6,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2pP4/2P1P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,So d6 here.
11,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2pP4/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,Nf3 is the best move here continuing the delopment.
12,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2pP4/2P1P1b1/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 7,Another unexpected move here i think. Maybe better was 0-0.
13,Be2,f1e2,rn1qk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2pP4/2P1P1b1/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 7,"Be2 is a fine move, unpinning the queen too."
14,Qb6,d8b6,rn2k2r/pp2ppbp/1q1p1np1/2pP4/2P1P1b1/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 4 8,And Qb6 gets us out any theory i guess (according to my knowledge).
15,O-O,e1g1,rn2k2r/pp2ppbp/1q1p1np1/2pP4/2P1P1b1/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 5 8,"0-0 is fine here, maybe Qc2 or Bf4 would be fine too."
16,Nbd7,b8d7,r3k2r/pp1nppbp/1q1p1np1/2pP4/2P1P1b1/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 6 9,"Flexible move, helps the f6 square, pressing on e5 and also maybe he'll play 0-0-0 later (who knows)."
17,Na4,c3a4,r3k2r/pp1nppbp/1q1p1np1/2pP4/N1P1P1b1/5N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 7 9,"Maybe that was a blunder, i do not know, what do you think? Qc2 may be better or Bg5??"
18,Qc7,b6c7,r3k2r/ppqnppbp/3p1np1/2pP4/N1P1P1b1/5N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 8 10,He puts it back.
19,h3,h2h3,r3k2r/ppqnppbp/3p1np1/2pP4/N1P1P1b1/5N1P/PP2BPP1/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 10,"h3 , i wanted to get rid of his bishop on g4."
20,Bxf3,g4f3,r3k2r/ppqnppbp/3p1np1/2pP4/N1P1P3/5b1P/PP2BPP1/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 11,Takes it.
