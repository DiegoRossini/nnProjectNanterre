18,Bd7,c8d7,r2q1rk1/pp1bppbp/2np1np1/8/2BNP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3K2R w KQ - 5 10,This little rook move is what brought the Dragon back into the limelight of Grand Master play.

It's still hard finding anything that would work for White here. 13.Be2 is the only move, and now after 13...Nxf3 14.Bxe2 Bxb5 15.Nxb5 Rxb5, black has a very pleasant position, recovered the pawn and is en route to a heavy attack."

The forced lines goes like this 15.Nxe4 Bxb2+ 16.Kb1 Bxa3+ 17.Bb3 Bxg4. White is 3 pawns down but at least has some counterplay against the scatter black pieces and his king is slightly safer.

34,Rxb1+,b8b1,5rk1/p2bppbp/3p2p1/q7/2B3P1/2P1BQ2/P1P4P/1rKR3R w - - 0 18,The tactical refutation of white's last mistake. Now c3 is again undefended and the king is forced on the open b-file under black's line of fire.
35,Kd2,c1d2,5rk1/p2bppbp/3p2p1/q7/2B3P1/2P1BQ2/P1PK3P/1r1R3R b - - 1 18,"White must have thought he was going to get mated if he took the rook. 18.Kxb1 Qxc3. However he missed the defensive move 19.Kc1 and there is no mate so black has to be satisfied with taking some of the material back. 19...Qb2+ 20. Kd2 Qb4+ 21.Kc1 Bxg4, winning white's queen."
36,Qxc3+,a5c3,5rk1/p2bppbp/3p2p1/8/2B3P1/2q1BQ2/P1PK3P/1r1R3R w - - 0 19,Now all of white's pieces start dropping off.
