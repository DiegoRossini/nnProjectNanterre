Game drawn! Although 9K is a pawn ahead, he has no realistic winning chances. The d-pawn is firmly blockaded and Black is unable to activate his king to assist in advancing that extra pawn up the board. 

  My respect for the CM9k program grew as the match progressed. CM9k particularly impressed me with its tenacious defensive skill.  

In the crucial game 3 I blew my chances to win, but credit is due to 9K for making a win a very tough assignment. In the last game (Game 4), 9K outplayed me in the opening for the first time in the match and then skillfully neutralized my attempts to mount a come-back. My hat is off to a great program!!!"
