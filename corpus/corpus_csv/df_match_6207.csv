1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"King's Pawn Opening.

Seeks control of d5/f5 and opens diags for Q and KB."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Black does the same, beckoning an open game. Anything other than 1. ... e5 beckons what is called a ""semi-open"" game."
3,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"King's Gambit.

White sacrifices a pawn to gain advantage of the centre with a later d4, and wants to aim at the square f7, usually by placing Bishop on c4. I do this in the game."
4,exf4,e5f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"King's Gambit Accepted.

Black usually accepts the gambit. Also possible is 2. ... d5 3. exd5 e4 4. d3 exd3, and either of 5. Bxd3 or 5. Qxd3. I prefer Qxd3."
5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 3,"Bishop's Gambit.

I prefer playing this opening rather than the usual 3. Nf3 simply because I like feeling like a classical player. Anyone knows that the most beautiful games come from this opening. I'm a real kingside attacker also, so this really suits my style of play."
6,Bc5,f8c5,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b5/2B1Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 4,"(?) Not a good move, allows me to grab the centre.

He could have gone 3. ... Qh4+ right away, and after 4. Kf1, White gains a tempo with 5. Nf3. This is enough to sacrifice castling the King, and usually tends for sharper more tactical lines, as seen in this game.

Also possible is 4. ... Nf6, to which I reply 5. Nc3, to defend the e4 pawn."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b5/2B1Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 4,"(?) Preventing 4. ... Qh4. Better was 4. d4, straight away, as Black can now retort 4. ... Nf6, and he has corrected his position."
8,d6,d7d6,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3p4/2b5/2B1Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"(?) Not a good move, allows me to take the centre with"
9,d4,d2d4,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3p4/2b5/2BPPp2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,", and now Black has lost his f4 pawn also. This is no longer a gambit, but a considerably advantageous position for White. A lot of the results of a game can be predicted by the beginning, if both players are quite competent."
