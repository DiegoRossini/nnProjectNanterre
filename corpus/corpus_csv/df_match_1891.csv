4,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"He answers with the Symmetrical/Austrian Defense, an uncommon variation of the QG Declined, according to my research and I myself encountered it the first time since playing the QG opening."
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"I continue with Nf3 to strengthen d4 and e5. In addition, I wanted to begin with the development of my minor pieces, which is why I was hesitant of cxd5."
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2pp4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,"So far, he mirrored everyone of my moves."
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2pp4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 4,Further development...
8,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p4/2Pp4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"An exchange of pawns, leaving me with a centred knight."

10,dxc4,d5c4,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/8/2pN4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,In my opinion not the best move. e5 would've forced the retreat of the knight as well as opening the path for his bishop... Instead he allows me to take over control of the centre with e5 + opening the path for my white bishop to attack his c-pawn.
11,e4,e2e4,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/8/2pNP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"Now comes said move, forcing me to step back and propose the queen exchange."
