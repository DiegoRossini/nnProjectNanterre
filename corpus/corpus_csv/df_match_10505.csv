3,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Blackmar Deimler Gambit. I decide to present an opening that has both risk and opportunity, offering chances for tactics."
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Black declines the gambit and makes clearance for developing the bishop. It appears to be a fairly solid approach to the opening.
5,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"Transposing into a French Advanced position which will slow the g8 knight down by taking away the f6 square. Black suffers the usual problems inherent to the French, the bad bishop, and in this case the retarded knight."

10,Nge7,g8e7,r1bqk2r/ppp1nppp/2n1p3/3pP3/1b1P1P2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,Black develops a piece as best able in the confined pawn structure.
