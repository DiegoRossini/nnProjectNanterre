1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,King's Pawn opening.
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,The caro-kann defense
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Standard move grabbing the centre.
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,standard book move
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"The advance variation of the caro-kann (3. e5) is the most popular move here presently. My opponent chose 3. Nc3, the 2nd most popular move here. 3. Nc3 is a perfectly good attempt for white to fight for an advantage."
6,dxe4,d5e4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/3Pp3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,standard move
7,Nxe4,c3e4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/3PN3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,standard move
8,Nd7,b8d7,r1bqkbnr/pp1npppp/2p5/8/3PN3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,Nd7 is the modern variation. Former world champion Karpov played Nd7 frequently. The other main move is Bf5 (the classical variation). I play both variations. I don't really have a preference.
9,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pp1npppp/2p5/8/3PN3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,standard move
10,Ngf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1npppp/2p2n2/8/3PN3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 3 6,standard move. Black would like white to exchange Knights allowing his d7 knight to move to f6.
11,Bd3,f1d3,r1bqkb1r/pp1npppp/2p2n2/8/3PN3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 4 6,I was happy to see Bd3. It allows me to capture on e4 and bring the knight from d7 to f6 to threaten the bishop. I think 6. Ng3 might be better for white. White may be moving the same piece twice in the opening but its good here. It makes black's development difficult.
12,Nxe4,f6e4,r1bqkb1r/pp1npppp/2p5/8/3Pn3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,developing the light squared bishop to the most logical spot.
13,Bxe4,d3e4,r1bqkb1r/pp1npppp/2p5/8/3PB3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,developing the light squared bishop to the most logical spot.
14,Nf6,d7f6,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/8/3PB3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 8,developing the light squared bishop to the most logical spot.
15,Bd3,e4d3,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/8/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 8,developing the light squared bishop to the most logical spot.
16,Bg4,c8g4,r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/8/3P2b1/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 3 9,developing the light squared bishop to the most logical spot.
17,c3,c2c3,r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/8/3P2b1/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 9,"protecting the pawn. Bxf3 and pawn/queen capture allows black to capture d4, winning a pawn."
18,e6,e7e6,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/8/3P2b1/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 10,"protecting the pawn. Bxf3 and pawn/queen capture allows black to capture d4, winning a pawn."
19,h3,h2h3,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/8/3P2b1/2PB1N1P/PP3PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 10,asking a question to the bishop. Where do you want to go?
20,Bh5,g4h5,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/7b/3P4/2PB1N1P/PP3PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 11,Both retreat and capture I think is ok. I played Bh5 so not to give white the bishop pair.
21,g4,g2g4,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/7b/3P2P1/2PB1N1P/PP3P2/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 11,I was expecting 0-0
22,Bg6,h5g6,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pnb1/8/3P2P1/2PB1N1P/PP3P2/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 12,"double pawns but a half open file in return. h3 pawn seems weak needing protection from rook,"
23,Bxg6,d3g6,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pnB1/8/3P2P1/2P2N1P/PP3P2/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 12,"double pawns but a half open file in return. h3 pawn seems weak needing protection from rook,"
24,hxg6,h7g6,r2qkb1r/pp3pp1/2p1pnp1/8/3P2P1/2P2N1P/PP3P2/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 13,"double pawns but a half open file in return. h3 pawn seems weak needing protection from rook,"
25,Bg5,c1g5,r2qkb1r/pp3pp1/2p1pnp1/6B1/3P2P1/2P2N1P/PP3P2/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 13,"This move stops black playing Nxg4 hxg4 Rxh1 winning material. At the time I thought the best move was g5. White would followup with Qc2 or Qe2, Bd2 and then 0-0-0. This may or may not be better than the actual game."
26,Qb6,d8b6,r3kb1r/pp3pp1/1qp1pnp1/6B1/3P2P1/2P2N1P/PP3P2/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 14,Move attacks b2 and renews Nxg4 (hxg4 Rxh1)
27,Bxf6,g5f6,r3kb1r/pp3pp1/1qp1pBp1/8/3P2P1/2P2N1P/PP3P2/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 14,can't stop both threats. Needs to take.
