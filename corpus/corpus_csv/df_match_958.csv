1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"we are currently playing our 12th game where my opponent broke the ice on our 10th game. with a nice checkmate, i have to say, i overlooked drastically in over confidence, after our track record with each other."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"and after that win he was able to hold me back for 45 moves as white until it came down to 1 pawn being 1 square ahead of his king. the series continues. its already brought me 2 nice annotations.

this is not our 11th game, this was about our 3rd game in the series while we were still freshly met opponents"
3,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,"early in our series, and usually against new opponents when i play as white, i tend to stick with what we all know i like and am comfortable with, the bishops opening."
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 3,"i wasnt well accustomed to my opponents highly defensive play that he showed in our later games. Why im saving this game is it brought a nice ending sequence of a 10 move forced mate which i created a puzzle with.  and so i wanted to also save the game, before it fades away to where i cannot see it anymore, in memory of what created the puzzle"
