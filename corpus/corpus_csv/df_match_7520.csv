1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Here is a game between me and my buddy Bob Jacobs.  At the end of the game, no doubt you will think, with me a clear pawn up, I should have breezed it.  Not so simple, I felt that his heavies and dsb did a real good containing job of my passers and I was worried about my king safety so hence my decision to concede a low draw and err on the side of caution.  But I could so easily have lost that game as I got my usual bad dose of middle game passivitis.  How did this happen?  Read on."
