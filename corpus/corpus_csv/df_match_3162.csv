1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Typically against 1.d4 I'll play either 1...d5 then c6 looking to head into a Slav or possible transition into the Noteboom variation, or Nf6 then e6 looking to play either the Nimzo Indian or Benoni depending on White's setup. I noticed that my opponent seemed fond of the London setup, so I decided to reply with Nf6 and then a c5-thrust."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"Typically against 1.d4 I'll play either 1...d5 then c6 looking to head into a Slav or possible transition into the Noteboom variation, or Nf6 then e6 looking to play either the Nimzo Indian or Benoni depending on White's setup.

3,Bf4,c1f4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P1B2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 2 2,"This move is certainly playable, but puts little immediate pressure on Black. White is looking to control e4 with the bishop developed out of the pawn triangle with prospects of a kingside attack starting with Ne5."
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/3P1B2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"An immediate e5 is obviously out of the question, but I decided to find a way to immediately challenge White over the center. 2...e6 opens the diagonal to develop the bishop to support c5."
5,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/3P1B2/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,White works on building the strong pawn triangle and opening his LS bishop.
6,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/3P1B2/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"And Black thrusts forward from the flank into the center to challenge the development scheme. I've found that immediately challenging fans of the d-pawn systems (London, stonewall, etc) seems to be quite favourable as you steer them away from familiar waters (while I, myself, am quite fond of fighting through a semi-open c-file). If White takes the pawn, I simply develop the bishop with recapture."
7,c3,c2c3,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/3P1B2/2P1P3/PP3PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,White completes his triangle.
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/2p5/3P1B2/2P1P3/PP3PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,And Black delays capturing to develop the Queen's Knight to it's natural square behind the c-pawn.
9,Nd2,b1d2,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/2p5/3P1B2/2P1P3/PP1N1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 2 5,"White continues to develop his Queen's pieces - the Nd2 supports the center and scheme well, flexing his muscle over e4/c4."
10,cxd4,c5d4,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/8/3p1B2/2P1P3/PP1N1PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,And Black initiates the exchange in accordance with his strategy.
11,exd4,e3d4,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/8/3P1B2/2P5/PP1N1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,White could have also captured with the c-pawn but e-pawn takes is probably better for maintaining imbalance and limiting options for Black's LS Bishop's development.
12,a6,a7a6,r1bqkb1r/1p1p1ppp/p1n1pn2/8/3P1B2/2P5/PP1N1PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,"Butting out the elbow to start gaining space on the queenside with b5, limiting the scope of White's LS Bishop and allowing for the queenside fianchetto of Black's."
13,Bd3,f1d3,r1bqkb1r/1p1p1ppp/p1n1pn2/8/3P1B2/2PB4/PP1N1PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 1 7,"The most aggressive square available to the bishop - if White can displace Nf6 it becomes quite powerful when supported by a Queen on c2, and may support a future knight hop to e4/c4."
14,b5,b7b5,r1bqkb1r/3p1ppp/p1n1pn2/1p6/3P1B2/2PB4/PP1N1PPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 0 8,Black continues with the intended scheme of development.
15,Ngf3,g1f3,r1bqkb1r/3p1ppp/p1n1pn2/1p6/3P1B2/2PB1N2/PP1N1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 8,White finally gets the King's Knight into the game - signaling a possible intent to castle kingside.
16,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/3pbppp/p1n1pn2/1p6/3P1B2/2PB1N2/PP1N1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 9,"Black can delay developing the King's Bishop no longer if he wishes to castle with White. Be7 is the only square that makes any sense in this position, supporting the knight and central pawns."
17,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk2r/3pbppp/p1n1pn2/1p6/3P1B2/2PB1N2/PP1N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 3 9,"Perhaps White intended this to support a potential g4 push (which could be met with h3), but if he was afraid of Ng4 this move was misguided as the strong Qc2 would have completed development while still eliminating Ng4 through Bxh7."
18,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/3pbppp/p1n1pn2/1p6/3P1B2/2PB1N2/PP1N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 4 10,"Perhaps White intended this to support a potential g4 push (which could be met with h3), but if he was afraid of Ng4 this move was misguided as the strong Qc2 would have completed development while still eliminating Ng4 through Bxh7."
19,h3,h2h3,r1bq1rk1/3pbppp/p1n1pn2/1p6/3P1B2/2PB1N1P/PP1N1PP1/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 10,"Perhaps White intended this to support a potential g4 push (which could be met with h3), but if he was afraid of Ng4 this move was misguided as the strong Qc2 would have completed development while still eliminating Ng4 through Bxh7."
20,d5,d7d5,r1bq1rk1/4bppp/p1n1pn2/1p1p4/3P1B2/2PB1N1P/PP1N1PP1/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 11,"I debated on this move for some time (also possible was 10...Nd5 11.Bg3 Bb7 12.Qc2 f5 but I wasn't too keen on the idea of playing with a weak d-pawn). d5 I felt was stronger for gaining territory in the center/queenside and controlling the e4/c4 squares, and the option of exchanging bishops on d6."
21,Qe2,d1e2,r1bq1rk1/4bppp/p1n1pn2/1p1p4/3P1B2/2PB1N1P/PP1NQPP1/R4RK1 b - - 1 11,"Another option would have developed the Queen to c2 where it seems to be a bit more influential, but White decided to pile up on e5 (that's two pieces and a pawn supporting Ne5)."
22,Bb7,c8b7,r2q1rk1/1b2bppp/p1n1pn2/1p1p4/3P1B2/2PB1N1P/PP1NQPP1/R4RK1 w - - 2 12,"Developing the last minor piece. While it is blocked at the moment by the pawn on d5, it does support it and the diagonal may open in the future."
23,Ne5,f3e5,r2q1rk1/1b2bppp/p1n1pn2/1p1pN3/3P1B2/2PB3P/PP1NQPP1/R4RK1 b - - 3 12,"The expected Ne5, exerting strong pressure into Black's territory."
