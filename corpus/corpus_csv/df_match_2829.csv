1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"As you will also peer on throughout the game, we have been picking up several messages from the Chess Mailroom about which piece is better, Bishops or Knights. After many nights of disastrous fighting, the answer has sneakily turned up in this game, but please don't comment or give the answer away now, otherwise..."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Gold starts with the Sicilian Defence. This defence gives best results for Black but if Fevil plays properly, then he stands a chance. 

Personally, nowadays I do not usually play 1. ... e5 as after 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4!? leaves me in confusion facing the Scotch Opening (as you will see on the next slide and on my annotation after my next annotation, 'The Brick Wall'). The only correct move would've been 3. ... exd4 but after 4. c3 things get awkward. 

Opening with 1. c5 can get Black several options to attack and counterattack."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"!? Fevil plays a Gambit for control in the centre. Most juniors might think: ""How absurd for a grandmaster,"" since after 2. ... cxd4 3. Qxd4 White gets an early queen, that can be easily chased away with such things like 3. ... Nf6! etc. 

The reason is, after 2. ... cxd4 White follows with 3. c3! and as I said, things get in a muddle then. A national game went: 1. e4 c5 2. d4!? cxd4?! 3. c3! dxc3!? 4. Bc4 cxb2? 5. Bxb2 5 ... e5 6. Bxf7+! Kxf7 7. Nf3 Nc6?? 8. Ng5+ Ke8 9. Nc3 Bb4 10. Qb3 Bxc3+!? 11. Bxc3 d5!? 12. exd5 Nf6 13. O-O Nxd5 14. Bxe5!? Nxe5? 15. Rfe1! Qxg5 16. Qxd5 Bf5?? 17. Rxe5+! Kf8 18. Rxf5+! Qxf5 19. Qxf5+! Ke8 20. Re1+ Kd8 21. Qf7!! Rb7?? 21. Qe7+ Kc8 22. Rc1# 1-0

I would personally play 2. ... d6! defending the c-pawn and controlling the centre, without risking the pawn."
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"As I said, 2. ... d6! is strong as it defends the c-pawn and allows open lines for Black's LSB, and it also controls the centre. The only snag is that Gold's DSB is blocked, but can be opened up at anytime with g6. 

At this time, both players have got a share of the centre, but that's for now. What about later? Who will get all the land, and who'll be squeezed in to his castles? Only one way to find out, read on!"
5,d5,d4d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2pP4/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"Fevil lunges into the centre. Gold lunges into a pot of boiling water. His knight has lost his potential home. ""The d-pawn must be removed!"""
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/2pP4/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,Black attacks the e-pawn and eyes the d-pawn suspiciously.
7,Bb5+,f1b5,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/1BpP4/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 4,"White swoops in with a nasty check. Since 4. ... Nc6 fails to 5. dxc6 and 4. ... Nfd7 fails in developing terms, the only answer seems to be 4. ... Bd7 or 4. ... Nbd7."
8,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bqkb1r/pp1npppp/3p1n2/1BpP4/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 3 5,"The knight gets himself out of the tangle into an even bigger tangle. Now, the knight is stuck, and so is Black's LSB.  And if the bishop takes the knight with check, then: ""Here we go with all the fuss and quarrels about Bishops vs. Knights."
9,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/pp1npppp/3p1n2/1BpP4/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 4 5,"Theoretically, this seems to be a good move in developing terms. The negative point is that White is ignoring the fact of 5. ... a6! which forces the Bishop back, which cannot seem so serious, can it? The thing that holds the debate is that after 6. Bc4?! b5! the bishop must retreat, which fails in developing terms. But, more of the less, White should not play the innocent 6. Bxd7+? as White would have swapped of one of his best-placed pieces for a knight which hasn't yet opened his eyes."
10,a6,a7a6,r1bqkb1r/1p1npppp/p2p1n2/1BpP4/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,"Black tackles the bishop. Will it retreat, or take the knight? And which way?

6. Ba4?? is blundered, as after 6. ... b5! the bishop will have to retreat to b3, following 7. Bb3 c4! which nets the bishop."
11,Bc4,b5c4,r1bqkb1r/1p1npppp/p2p1n2/2pP4/2B1P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 6,"?! The bishop does retreat down the long diagonal to a difficult square. A bishop on c4 can threaten f7 when the d5-pawn has been cleared off. Using tactical ideas (and opinions), the bishop could've been there on move 2. Has it been delayed?

0002 C4
Delayed until 0006. We apologise.
Ran by Bishop. Formed of 5 coaches.

There's another reason too, that it is pretty dubious. Look what happens next..."

14,g6,g7g6,r1bqkb1r/1p2pp1p/p2p1np1/2pPn3/4P3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 8,"Now for a bit of developing and describing. Look at this...

The knight on c3 is the only one out and about for white, but he's staring at his own pawns. The bishop on e2 has fallen off the sofa, and all the rest of the pieces are still sleeping in bed, waiting for the alarm clock to ring on move 10 (with the exception of the d & e-pawns, who've set off yesterday for late 'knight' hunting. Don't worry, it's just a joke)

For Black, the bishop on f8 is just about to come out, and so is the bishop on c8! That leaves just the major pieces snoozing, though. They're the wrinklies, but Gold's a winner!"
