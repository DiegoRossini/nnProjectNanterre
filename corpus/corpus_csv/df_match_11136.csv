6,exd4,e5d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/2Pp4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"gives white a headache, he needs to take on d4 because its hindering his b knight. This breaks up white's pawn structure"
7,exd4,e3d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"Now we're back to the Queens Gambit situation but without e pawns.  This leaves both sides open, but white is slightly more so, giving black a little initiative"
8,Bb4+,f8b4,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/1bPP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"taking advantage of whites open king to develop a piece with tempo, white must get out of check"
9,Bd2,c1d2,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/1bPP4/8/PP1B1PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 2 5,"more tempo, but not very much development.  I need to get those knights out"

12,dxc4,d5c4,rnb1k1nr/ppp1qppp/8/8/1bpP4/8/PP1BBPPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 0 7,"pin on e2 bishop, otherwise this would give white an opportunity to get better developed and give him more space"

24,Be6,c8e6,r4rk1/ppp1qppp/3bbn2/B7/2QP4/P4N2/1P2BPPP/RN3RK1 w - - 1 13,"should have been played three moves ago, black bishops are strong and central but the knight will be mourned, it is a big miss so early in the game"
