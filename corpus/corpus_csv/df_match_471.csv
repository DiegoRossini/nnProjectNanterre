1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was played in the National League - 4NCL, Division 3 North, Pool D."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,A Sicilian.
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,He opts for a closed variation.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,Keeping my options open...
5,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/1Bp5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 3 3,Signalling that he is playing a Grand Prix attack sort of set-up. I think I should have played Nd4 here attacking the Bishop. It was played out of habit - I normally I meet this move after 2. Nf3 and if Nd4 white can exchange knights.
6,e6,e7e6,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/1Bp5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 4,"This is what I played, as I play it in the variation 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5."
7,f4,f2f4,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/1Bp5/4PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 4,"White missed the chance to play Bxc6, with a good game."
8,Nge7,g8e7,r1bqkb1r/pp1pnppp/2n1p3/1Bp5/4PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 1 5,This is fine for black now.
9,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkb1r/pp1pnppp/2n1p3/1Bp5/4PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 5,The normal developing move.
10,a6,a7a6,r1bqkb1r/1p1pnppp/p1n1p3/1Bp5/4PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,The logical follow-up to my previous moves.
11,Bxc6,b5c6,r1bqkb1r/1p1pnppp/p1B1p3/2p5/4PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,He takes.

13,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkb1r/1p1p1ppp/p1n1p3/2p5/4PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 7,The usual place to put his king in this variation.
14,d6,d7d6,r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1npp3/2p5/4PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,I see that 7...Be7 is more usual

16,g6,g7g6,r1bqkb1r/1p3p1p/p1npp1p1/2p5/4PP2/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 9,"Be7 is more common, but this seems playable."
17,Ne2,c3e2,r1bqkb1r/1p3p1p/p1npp1p1/2p5/4PP2/3P1N2/PPP1N1PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 9,"I think white is planning on putting his pawns on black squares, c3 and d4, to give his Bc1 more scope and to restrict the movements of my Bg7. It is not a bad plan, although Qe1 seems to be the only move for white in my opening database."
18,Bg7,f8g7,r1bqk2r/1p3pbp/p1npp1p1/2p5/4PP2/3P1N2/PPP1N1PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 10,The usual square for this bishop
