I won't comment much early on, as not much happens in terms of mistakes. I like Benoni games in OTB format, not so much for correspondence chess. It is just enough theory with the right amount of flair added to create my own entertainment value. Basically the idea of it is exchanging my c pawn for the d pawn with proper support. But neither side can get careless."
