12,d6,d7d6,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2np1n2/1N2p3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"Almost forced, black now has the d6 square defended by his queen and his dsb"

16,Ne7,c6e7,r1bqkb1r/pp2nppp/3p4/1N1Pp3/8/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 9,Probably the best option however blacks dsb now cannot develop without moving another piece first
17,c3,c2c3,r1bqkb1r/pp2nppp/3p4/1N1Pp3/8/2P5/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 9,"Opens the line to a4 for my queen, note that there is a nice line to the king - a4-e8, I did consider c4 but felt that restricted my lsb too much"
18,a6,a7a6,r1bqkb1r/1p2nppp/p2p4/1N1Pp3/8/2P5/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 10,threatens mate with Nxd6. Black is under some severe pressure now and will surely have to lose material to save the game
