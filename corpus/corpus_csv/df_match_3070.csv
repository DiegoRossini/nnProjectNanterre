1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is a great game with immediate aggression from White, that once started could not be stopped. Only continued forced Check moves kept me alive.
There were many places where the wrong aggressive play would have backfire into a Checkmate against me. 

I thought I would try to understand the King gambit by playing it"

4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"declined...OK, I'll just play it as if it was taken"
5,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4PP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 3,which is this move
6,d6,d7d6,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/4PP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,maybe I'll sacrifice my bishop to eliminate his castle option

8,Bg4,c8g4,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/2B1PPb1/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,but then what...
9,c3,c2c3,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/2B1PPb1/2P2N2/PP1P2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"This will constrict my bishop, but my queen can keep pressure on"
10,Nf6,g8f6,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4p3/2B1PPb1/2P2N2/PP1P2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 6,this doesn't change my plan
11,Bxf7+,c4f7,r2qkb1r/ppp2Bpp/2np1n2/4p3/4PPb1/2P2N2/PP1P2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,I went for it
12,Kxf7,e8f7,r2q1b1r/ppp2kpp/2np1n2/4p3/4PPb1/2P2N2/PP1P2PP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 0 7,forced

I took a couple of days to calculate the next move.

Advancing the f pawn for check was enticing, hoping he would go to h5 for a triple fork.
Even taking my knight COULD work out...

That move would have been risky---I found several ways for this to backfire into a checkmate for myself.
Bishop taking that pawn was would have been the best counter to that move, but other responses were shaky for me as well."

and having this bishop diagonal open is crucial in the long run"

22,Kxf5,g6f5,r2q1b1r/ppp3p1/2n2n1p/3ppkN1/8/1QPP4/PP4PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 0 12,"hmmm, if he had left that hanging pawn there, he probably would have taken it eventually..."
23,Nf7,g5f7,r2q1b1r/ppp2Np1/2n2n1p/3ppk2/8/1QPP4/PP4PP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 1 12,"Now the fork is available
I was worried that I was taking out a rook that might not threaten anytime soon.
Would have been better off getting my pieces out?

IF I can continue play, this play will be worth it"
