1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I always do this with white nowadays.
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Typical response.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,And this.
4,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Semi-slav. This was the moment I started thinking.. 'OK, now the computer is going to murder me'."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,Pretty standard development.
6,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2p5/3pp3/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Pretty surprising. Had to think now where to put my knight after dxe5 4...d4. I was initially planning for 5. Nb1, but I just felt that this was back sliding."
7,dxe5,d4e5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2p5/3pP3/2P5/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,What else? I had seen that I will lose this pawn anyway so it was a case of thinking 'where is the best place for the knight after Qh5+ an Qxe5?'
8,d4,d5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2p5/4P3/2Pp4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,As forseen.
9,Ne4,c3e4,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2p5/4P3/2PpN3/8/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 5,I decided at this moment that if Qh5 i could go Nd2 and block the check. Then after Qxe5 I would play Ndf3 and fork queen and pawn.
10,Qa5+,d8a5,rnb1kbnr/pp3ppp/2p5/q3P3/2PpN3/8/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 6,But after the check Nd2 would be asking for a passive position. It (the computer) could develop further with Bb4 and tie me down.
11,Bd2,c1d2,rnb1kbnr/pp3ppp/2p5/q3P3/2PpN3/8/PP1BPPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 3 6,When playing the computer I always try to force the issue.
12,Qxe5,a5e5,rnb1kbnr/pp3ppp/2p5/4q3/2PpN3/8/PP1BPPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,Equal on material again but the computer has gained two very good bishops. I had an small suspicion that something had already gone wrong.
13,Ng3,e4g3,rnb1kbnr/pp3ppp/2p5/4q3/2Pp4/6N1/PP1BPPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 1 7,I felt this was forced. Defending it with Qc2 would be asking for trouble because of Blacks active bishops. (Bf5 for example)
14,Qd6,e5d6,rnb1kbnr/pp3ppp/2pq4/8/2Pp4/6N1/PP1BPPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 2 8,Stepping away from my tempo gaining Nf3.
15,Qc2,d1c2,rnb1kbnr/pp3ppp/2pq4/8/2Pp4/6N1/PPQBPPPP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 3 8,I didn't want black developing his bishops to excellent squares later so I thought this move was good. Also defends c4 and prepares 0-0-0 (my initial plan - from which I chickened out of completely).
16,Nf6,g8f6,rnb1kb1r/pp3ppp/2pq1n2/8/2Pp4/6N1/PPQBPPPP/R3KBNR w KQkq - 4 9,Defends some light squares in the middle of the board.
17,Nf3,g1f3,rnb1kb1r/pp3ppp/2pq1n2/8/2Pp4/5NN1/PPQBPPPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 5 9,I was happy with my knights at this point. They re controlling most of the centre. Still developing though.
18,c5,c6c5,rnb1kb1r/pp3ppp/3q1n2/2p5/2Pp4/5NN1/PPQBPPPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 10,"Quite a strong (and annoying) pawn wedge there. But I thought I would undermine this later with Rd1 and e3. In hindsight I should have gone 0-0-0 next but I was too concerned about having a safe king on the kingside. Almost a flaw, almost falling into a category of closed-mindedness."
19,Ne4,g3e4,rnb1kb1r/pp3ppp/3q1n2/2p5/2PpN3/5N2/PPQBPPPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 1 10,"On this move I spent a long time. I thought about Nf5, Bxf5 and Qxf5 threatening Qc8+ but didn't think it led anywhere. I thought about 0-0-0 and chickened out. I think my decision in the position just came back to the strategy of forcing moves against the computer. I noticed c5 weakened the h1-a8 diagonal and I had hazy, distant plans of g3 and Bg2 and Bf4. At the time this seemed very active, it centralised my queen and gave me options on the kingside."
20,Nxe4,f6e4,rnb1kb1r/pp3ppp/3q4/2p5/2Ppn3/5N2/PPQBPPPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 11,Moving the queen would lose a tempo so this is forced.
