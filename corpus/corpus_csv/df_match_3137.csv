1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This move has been played against me a few times however I don't believe that it is the strongest response in this line.  Much better is to defend the d pawn by either c6 or e6.

5,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/3P4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,By play this move Black gives White two extra tempo allowing White to develop two pieces while Black has to pull his queen back.  Retaking with the knight is better.

7,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3q4/3P4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,Black's plan of following this move up with Bg7 then 0-0 is a bit weak.  White is going to build on the d4 pawn which is going to leave the Blacks dark squared bishop without any reall work for sometime.

11,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/8/3P1B2/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,Black is way behind on development here so the plan of undeveloping one of two pieces (with one piece being the badly placed bishop) is not very sound.  He needs to develop some additional pieces.

This bishop is guarding the critical h5 square, not to mention, is one of the few developed pieces that he can play with.
