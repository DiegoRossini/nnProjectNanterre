1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game does have a bit in it. The development of the Sicilian defence, which I feel is pretty sound. A sacrifice that was executed incorrectly (thankfully) and a forced mate."
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The start of the French defence. The French is a solid and resilient opening, though it can result in a cramped game for Black in particular the opening. Black often gains counterattacking possibilities on the queen side while White tends to attack the king side."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"The Sicilian is usually played 1. e4, c5 however i was thinking of playing the french when I started the match."

5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"Named after Mark Taimanov. Black develops the knight to a natural square and keeps his options open regarding the placement of his other pieces. One of the ideas of this system is to develop the bishop to b4 or c5. White can prevent this by 5.Nb5 d6. Taimanov's idea was to play 5...a6 (preventing Nb5) followed by ...Nge7 and ...Nxd4. Then when White recaptures with the queen, Black can attack it with ...Nc6, gaining time. A more popular setup involves ...Qc7, ...a6 and ...Nf6: this is often called the Paulsen Variation."

9,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,"Alot of players play a6 from here i personally feel this is an unnecessary move (there is nothing wrong with it, just my opinion) as per previous note the idea is to play a6 after Nb5, so no need to play this at the moment therefore other lines can be explored."
10,d6,d7d6,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2npp3/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,This now prevents Bc5/b4 without Nb5 so a6 will now be a move that can be used to move Nb5 or Bb5 with tempi if presented.

This offers excellent counter attacking chances as well as scope for creativity. The pawn center of d6-e6 gives Black control of the critical d5 and e5 squares and retains flexibility to break in the center with either ...e5 or ...d5."
