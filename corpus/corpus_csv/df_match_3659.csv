2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I am not aware of any particular name for this King's Pawn Game. More common is for White to bring his LSB out before blocking it in with d2-d3.

6,d6,d7d6,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"? Why spend two moves to play d2-d4? Now White has a Scotch Game position, except he's behind by a move. Wasting time like this in the opening is terrifically dangerous; better was 4.Nc3, 4.Be3 or 4.Be2 (of course, simply playing 3.d4 would have been good, too!) It's important, at all stages of the game but especially the opening, to ask ""why am I playing this move? What does it contribute to my longterm goals?"""

Better was 8.Be3."
16,Nc6,d4c6,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4p3/4P3/2PQ3P/PP3PP1/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 1 9,"Both sides continue to develop pieces to natural positions and prepare to castle. Black's Bishop is quite restricted but should be able to find play on the kingside, whereas White's Queen is in the awkward position of being the only defender for e4."

Rather than equalize, Black has given himself a significant central/kingside pawn majority in exchange for a bit of material. After 12.Qxd8+ Rxd8 13.Bxe7 Kxe7 (keeping the Black pieces centralized and preparing to double on the d-file), White has a Bishop for two pawns. Black's pieces are slightly more active, but I don't think the compensation is enough, as Black has no immediate threats."

It's important to note that castling is frequently a strong maneuver, but it is not objectively correct in all circumstances. Being a piece behind, Black should be keeping the King and Knight centralized to assist in the pawn push; there is no danger of a mating attack yet from the stagnant White pieces, whereas Black *must* play more energetically to have any chance of success."
