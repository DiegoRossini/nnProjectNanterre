1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I am playing d4 against my silican opponent in hopes of finding an edge before my oppents tactics hit me. My opponent is the honorable Saitek Maestro Master Chess Computer, which is set to level 3. I am not giving my opponent a rating because I only know of the maximum rating of 2200 elo for it. I included some annotation from Fritz7, noted as the source where applicable."

8,exd5,e6d5,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/5n2/2pp4/2P5/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Positional advantages for white at this point are that the f8 bishop is bad, and the b8 knight is limited to d7 or a6. Disadvantages for white are the weak pawn at d5, the minority queenside, a certain lag in piece development. White needs to move the f1 bishop, which requires e4, which requires Nc3. Black advantages are the queenside majority and castling before white after Be7. Disadvantages for black are the cramped position and the positional disadvantages of the b8 knight and f8 bishop."

White will have to keep in mind the x-ray attack on the a1 rook and the potential for an unguarded b2 pawn in that line of attack."

16,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkb1r/1p3p1p/p2p1np1/2pP4/4PBb1/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 9,Fritz:last book move.  Me: MC applies a pin which can be refuted. The question is which is better the knight or bishop?
