I like the Stonewall because you can follow your script pretty much disregarding what black is doing, and also because I've got a decent grasp on what I'm supposed to do during the midgame.  However, this game shows how cramped white's queenside pieces can be with the Stonewall."

I'm in good position, particularly in the center, but I don't know what to do with black's soon-to-be fianchetto'ed position.  My usual plans call for a subsequent Bd3 and then sacrificing the bishop at h7, but since that's out of the question I should have worked to further control the center and to develop my queen's knight."
