1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I wanted to look at this game, mostly because of the opening. It could have led to a closed sicilian or grand prix, which I know very well. The middlegame had some very complex analysis that even masters would find it tough to evualuate and make good moves. 

Im analyzing in my head to get better visualization. Consulted opening ex for white move 3.If I missed something tell me; the analysis is very tough."

5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/2p5/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"White may have played this with the intention that if black captures, as he would in most open sicilians, white may recapture and strike the rook at h8. So 3...cxd4 4.Qxd4 Nf6 5.e5 but black could have 5...Nc6, and looking at a few queen moves that save the pawn, 6.Qf4 seems to be the only playable move. After 6...Nh5 there could be some complicated play that appears to slightly favor white. 6.Qe3 is losing the pawn by 6...Ng4."
6,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk1nr/pp1pppbp/6p1/2p5/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"This move is often played 3rd move in hyper accelerated dragon by 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 g6 3.d4 Bg7!? as an interesting idea. If white captures 4.dxc5, he loses a center pawn. Black may choose to regain by 4...Qa5+ if he wants, or keep developing, as the pawn isn't going anywhere soon. By the move order Nc3, black threatens to win a pawn. The line 4.dxc5 Qa5 will win the pawn back, and white's position seems worse after 5.Bd2 Qxc5, but it 6.Nd5! is a very strong move, giving white multiple threats to work with, many involving forks on c7. The pawn on b2 is just a decoy, as 6...Bxb2 loses to 7.Bb4 Qc6 8.Bb5 and black can give up."
7,e5,e4e5,rnbqk1nr/pp1pppbp/6p1/2p1P3/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"A good move would have been to take the pawn. If he does, black does not need Qa5 right away to get the pawn back.
@chizzo83 yes, Nf3 enters into theory, but why allow black to go into a perfectly acceptable position when he has made a less than optimal move? dxc5 grants white a small advantage already, and its only move 4...@excile no, dxc5 is the best move in this position, with white getting a much bigger advantage than all other moves. AlmostALL masters would play dxc5. Your variation of Bg7 hands over the advantage immediately, and fails to punish white for his inaccurate move. *in master games, nearly 50% of the time white wins in this variation. Black has a mere 20% at most."
8,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqk1nr/pp1pppbp/6p1/4P3/3p4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,The way to win. 5.Qxd4 Nc6 is it.
9,Qxd4,d1d4,rnbqk1nr/pp1pppbp/6p1/4P3/3Q4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 0 5,A good of a move as any.

12,Bxe5,g7e5,r1bqk1nr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/4b3/8/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,"Slightly inaccurate, as now the valuable bishop is exposed and allows white time. Even up a center pawn, black does not want to allow white any positional gains."
13,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqk1nr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/4b3/8/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 7,"7...Bxc3+ is actually something to look at. 8.bxc3, and black has avoided losing a tempo, and has doubled whites pawns. Although this may seem very little compensation for the loss of the nice bishop, black can now try to cover up his weaknesses by using his rapid development and center majority, his greatest weapon. Moves like Qa5, Nf6 with a well timed d5 or e5 may be potent. @excile I am fully aware of the strength of the black square bishop. But dont treat this like it is a normal sicilian, so dont use normal sicilian rules. The gaining of time, plus the extra pawn, makes Bxc3+ a reasonable idea, and should be considered.Concrete analysis instead of using general principles says that Bxc3 is okay."

The loose bishop and the knight behind it signals that a tactic is in play. b4 is a bad move, and accomplished nothing. I should also say that white would have been better off doing nothing and passing with 13.Kh1, rather than play b4. It opens up all sorts of possibilities in the position, but for black. I would even look at moves like e4. There are too many lines to go through, all of them with possibilities going for black. @excile Its time to ignore general principles about developement FOR NOW. After black settles the tactics he can develop. Tactics beat general princples, and black has potential tactics."

One line goes 14...Be6 15.Bxe6 fxe6 16.Bxf6 Bxf6 17.Nb5 where white wins a pawn. But if black plays 16...Rxf6, he will be hitting the Nf3, which may distract white from Nb5, for example 17...Qe7 white should not capture the pawn."
