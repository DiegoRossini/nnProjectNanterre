7,dxe6,d5e6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4Pn2/8/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"Not as strong as other moves, but still it will help white's position later."
8,Bxe6,c8e6,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4bn2/8/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Not as strong as other moves, but still it will help white's position later."
9,h3,h2h3,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4bn2/8/8/5N1P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"Not as strong as other moves, but still it will help white's position later."
10,Bd6,f8d6,rn1qk2r/ppp2ppp/3bbn2/8/8/5N1P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,I have no other good square to get the bishop out. Both in c5 or b4 it will be easily and usefully kicked away by white.
11,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qk2r/ppp2ppp/3bbn2/8/8/2N2N1P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 6,"Instead of protecting my bishop pair with a3 (avoiding Nb5), I go for the typical ""Icelandic Threat""."

13,d4,d2d4,rn2k2r/ppp1qppp/3bbn2/8/3P4/2N2N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"White falls for it. Now black has to choose whether if to go for the pawn with Bxh6+, taking advantage of the fact that if white shields with the bishop, apparently Bxg2 wins a piece, that seemed good, but what after white shields with the dsb? I could leave him an useful semiopen column to his advantage in the future."
14,Bc4+,e6c4,rn2k2r/ppp1qppp/3b1n2/8/2bP4/2N2N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,So I played this one.
15,Be3,c1e3,rn2k2r/ppp1qppp/3b1n2/8/2bP4/2N1BN1P/PPP2PP1/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 2 8,Obviously. Here you can see why h3 wasn't such a bad move.
16,Bxf1,c4f1,rn2k2r/ppp1qppp/3b1n2/8/3P4/2N1BN1P/PPP2PP1/R2QKb1R w KQkq - 0 9,"Well: there is a chance that he retakes with the rook - better for me, I thought - or with the king."
17,Rxf1,h1f1,rn2k2r/ppp1qppp/3b1n2/8/3P4/2N1BN1P/PPP2PP1/R2QKR2 b Qkq - 0 9,"So I though this was better for me, because of..."
18,Bf4,d6f4,rn2k2r/ppp1qppp/5n2/8/3P1b2/2N1BN1P/PPP2PP1/R2QKR2 w Qkq - 1 10,"It looks promising, doesn't it?"
19,Qd2,d1d2,rn2k2r/ppp1qppp/5n2/8/3P1b2/2N1BN1P/PPPQ1PP1/R3KR2 b Qkq - 2 10,"Ok, but in fact... what will happen? White will castle queenside, and I will have nothing. This starts to look suspicious. I have to find an alternate plan, but where?"
20,O-O,e8g8,rn3rk1/ppp1qppp/5n2/8/3P1b2/2N1BN1P/PPPQ1PP1/R3KR2 w Q - 3 11,"At a loss, I castled. Instead of developing. Maybe trying to castle queenside would have been wiser."
21,O-O-O,e1c1,rn3rk1/ppp1qppp/5n2/8/3P1b2/2N1BN1P/PPPQ1PP1/2KR1R2 b - - 4 11,"I'll dreamed to redirect my forces against the enemy's king, but with no solid plan. It was a mistake, since white does have one."

25,Bh4,g5h4,rn3rk1/ppp1qpp1/3b1n1p/8/3P3B/2N2N1P/PPPQ1PP1/2KR1R2 b - - 1 13,"Tempting me to go g4, to sacrifice. I am not sure, but I preferred not to risk too much."

27,Nd5,c3d5,r4rk1/pppnqpp1/3b1n1p/3N4/3P3B/5N1P/PPPQ1PP1/2KR1R2 b - - 3 14,"Qe6 or Qe4 were good to analyze, but not on a blitz, for me..."
