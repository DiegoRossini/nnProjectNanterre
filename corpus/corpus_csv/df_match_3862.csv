1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was a fun blitz game I played some time ago and I happened to grab the pgn, so you guys get to enjoy it! Please bear in mind that this was five-minute blitz--poor decisions were made on both sides. I stick to a book I'm familiar with, since there's time pressure to consider, and we get into a very delicate Sicilian with a lot of action all across the board, finally culminating in a frightening sequence of missed opportunities as our clocks run out."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Black obliges me with the Sicilian.
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"I prefer open positions in time pressure, so I go straight for it."
4,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3pP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"2. d4 gives me the psychological advantage (or so I like to think) of being able to play this move. It would be risky to keep the Queen out so early, of course, but I think the aggressive posture was worth the tempo."
5,Qxd4,d1d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"2. d4 gives me the psychological advantage (or so I like to think) of being able to play this move. It would be risky to keep the Queen out so early, of course, but I think the aggressive posture was worth the tempo."
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 1 4,Developing with tempo.
7,Qd1,d4d1,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 2 4,"I'm behind a little in development but I'm confident in my ability to catch up. Black still has pawns to move before he can get his Bishops out. I considered playing 4. Qa4 briefly, but decided to err on the side of caution."
8,Qc7,d8c7,r1b1kbnr/ppqppppp/2n5/8/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 3 5,The intent behind this move isn't particularly clear to me. It doesn't threaten anything in particular and doesn't help Black get his Bishops developed. Perhaps my early Queen action is already provoking my opponent into rash behavior.
9,c4,c2c4,r1b1kbnr/ppqppppp/2n5/8/2P1P3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"Black is giving me a chance to constrict his position, so I jump on it. This move has the additional benefit of preventing ...Nb5 from being any kind of threat (aiming at c2). I think 5. f4 would have been strong here as well."
10,e6,e7e6,r1b1kbnr/ppqp1ppp/2n1p3/8/2P1P3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,Freeing the Bishop and preparing for an eventual ...d5.
11,Nf3,g1f3,r1b1kbnr/ppqp1ppp/2n1p3/8/2P1P3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,I need to get on with my development before I fall inextricably far behind.
12,b6,b7b6,r1b1kbnr/p1qp1ppp/1pn1p3/8/2P1P3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,Black plans to fianchetto his LSB while giving the half-open c file to his Rook and Queen.
13,a3,a2a3,r1b1kbnr/p1qp1ppp/1pn1p3/8/2P1P3/P4N2/1P3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"? This was not the best choice; continuing my development with 7. Be2 or 7. Be3 would have been fine. The text avoids the potential for isolated, doubled c-pawns, but that probably wasn't a realistic concern."
14,Bb7,c8b7,r3kbnr/pbqp1ppp/1pn1p3/8/2P1P3/P4N2/1P3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,Logical.
15,Nc3,b1c3,r3kbnr/pbqp1ppp/1pn1p3/8/2P1P3/P1N2N2/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 8,Continuing to develop while defending the e-pawn.
16,a6,a7a6,r3kbnr/1bqp1ppp/ppn1p3/8/2P1P3/P1N2N2/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 9,"Black prevents Nb5, which would drive his Queen from c7, but I can't really afford to be running my pieces all around yet anyway."
17,Be3,c1e3,r3kbnr/1bqp1ppp/ppn1p3/8/2P1P3/P1N1BN2/1P3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 9,"Continuing to develop as fast as I can, as well as putting pressure on the b6 pawn."
18,Bc5,f8c5,r3k1nr/1bqp1ppp/ppn1p3/2b5/2P1P3/P1N1BN2/1P3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 10,Black offers a trade and starts preparing to castle.
19,Be2,f1e2,r3k1nr/1bqp1ppp/ppn1p3/2b5/2P1P3/P1N1BN2/1P2BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 3 10,"This isn't the best place for my Bishop in the long run, but under the circumstances I like this move. I allow Black to double my e-pawns at the cost of his Bishop, but I'm now ready to castle into a very safe spot and I have my sights set on e5 and Black's d-pawn."
20,Bxe3,c5e3,r3k1nr/1bqp1ppp/ppn1p3/8/2P1P3/P1N1bN2/1P2BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 11,"Doubles the pawns, but now my Rook will have a nice half-open file to work on."
21,fxe3,f2e3,r3k1nr/1bqp1ppp/ppn1p3/8/2P1P3/P1N1PN2/1P2B1PP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 11,"Doubles the pawns, but now my Rook will have a nice half-open file to work on."
22,Nge7,g8e7,r3k2r/1bqpnppp/ppn1p3/8/2P1P3/P1N1PN2/1P2B1PP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 1 12,I don't see a reason for Black to avoid 11...Nf6 here unless he's planning ...f5.
