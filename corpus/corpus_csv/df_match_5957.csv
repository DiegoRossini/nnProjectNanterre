1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,One d4 opening. We'll see if this person wants to play it badly enough to face the Dutch Stonewall.

3,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,I guess not. Time to transpose into a Sicilian.
4,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"I don't remember if I've written how little I've ever played the Sicilian, or against it. But my theory is that someone that wants to play a controlled, Q-pawn game isn't naturally comfortable in a wild Sicilian. Then again, I'm not very comfortable in a wild Sicilian, which is why I play conservative Sicilians -- if such things exist.
 
I've played in one mini-tournament where the theme was the Scheveningen. And I'm finishing another Sicilian-themed mini-tournament where I've used the Taimanov Sicilian in my games. That's what this should transpose to."

The move I was originally worried about here was Qd3, because if I trade knights and bishops, then I'm looking at Bf4 at some point, and it'll be even harder to get the knight out and keep protecting my pawn on d6. But I decided if he plays Qd3 here, I can try Ng3."
