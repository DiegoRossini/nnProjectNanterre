16,Qb6,d8b6,rnb1k2r/pp3ppp/1q3B2/2bp4/8/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 9,"!!!!! Black does not recapture! At first, I think he has blundered. But then I realise that he can play 9...Bxf2 . Then after 10. Kd2 Qd4  or Qe3 . Either way, I escape to c2, and then I think I can squirrel away into the queenside. But I didn't really feel safe with that. What can I do to stop him? Firstly, 9.Na4 or Nxd5 suggest themselves, but they don't really stop the attack I have just detailed. I see now that I SHOULD HAVE PLAYED 9.Bd4, blocking the attack and sneaking away with the material too! But at the time I saw no way of stopping the attack, so I hoped that it would not be fatal and played the greedy move 9.Bxg7."
