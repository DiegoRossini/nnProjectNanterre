1,b4,b2b4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/1P6/8/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is a league game played in 2003. I am putting in on GameKnot because I feel that the game overall (especially opening) is very instructive and shows a good recipe for Black against this rare opening. My opponent was a strong master candidate and one of a few prominent Sokolsky players in Croatia. Fortunately for me, I played against another proponent of this opening (interestingly, also a strong MK) a relatively short while before this game so I had some experience to rely on. I was a clear underdog but had accumulated enough wins against strong players by that time to be relatively confident in myself."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/1P6/8/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"This move is one of the 2 main continuations (the other one is 1...d5). The idea is that Black is willing to give his e pawn for White's b pawn, but for compensation he will get good development and some central pressure."
3,Bb2,c1b2,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/1P6/8/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"This is the position that Black intended with 1...e5. Black has a slight lead in development, and eventually Be5 will have to move (losing another tempi) or be exchanged for a Knight (giving Black a pair of Bishops)."

7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4B3/1b6/5N2/P1PPPPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,"Last move both players played moves that are ""mandatory"" (the most natural). This allows maximum flexibility regarding the middlegame - but now choices have to be made, which will define the later play. 5.c3 is possible here, but then after 5...Ba5; 6.d4, d5; 7.e3, Ne4 Black is in great shape and even has a slight advantage. The main problem is that White is passive so can't really play for a win."

10,d5,d7d5,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/5n2/3pB3/1b6/4PN2/P1PP1PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQ - 0 6,"The most active move, taking advantage of the chance to occupy the centre. In my first Sokolsky game I played 5...Nc6 and had a good game (lost in heavy time trouble in an equal ending), but in analysis I concluded that Black should play c5 before Nc6, thus gaining more influence in the centre. This game was a good chance to see how this idea will work in practice. 5...d6 is also OK but a little passive."
11,Be2,f1e2,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/5n2/3pB3/1b6/4PN2/P1PPBPPP/RN1QK2R b KQ - 1 6,"Preparing to castle and free the d pawn to move. Since Black will likely play Bg4, e2 is the best place for the Bishop."
12,Bg4,c8g4,rn1q1rk1/ppp2ppp/5n2/3pB3/1b4b1/4PN2/P1PPBPPP/RN1QK2R w KQ - 2 7,"And here it is. In the analysis of the previous game I concluded that this position is great for Black. Actually it is objectively equal but Black has active piece play and a clear plan, qualities that I like in my positions :)"
13,O-O,e1g1,rn1q1rk1/ppp2ppp/5n2/3pB3/1b4b1/4PN2/P1PPBPPP/RN1Q1RK1 b - - 3 7,"And here it is. In the analysis of the previous game I concluded that this position is great for Black.

15,c4,c2c4,rn1q1rk1/pp3ppp/5n2/2ppB3/1bP3b1/4PN2/P2PBPPP/RN1Q1RK1 b - - 0 8,"Staking a claim in the centre, but also allowing Black to open the d file for himself. After some thought I decided to ignore it for now and finish development."
16,Nc6,b8c6,r2q1rk1/pp3ppp/2n2n2/2ppB3/1bP3b1/4PN2/P2PBPPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - - 1 9,This is the situation I mentioned earlier. White either has to retreat the Bishop (losing time) or lose it to a Knight (giving the Bishop pair advantage to Black). In either case I like Black's position.
17,Bb2,e5b2,r2q1rk1/pp3ppp/2n2n2/2pp4/1bP3b1/4PN2/PB1PBPPP/RN1Q1RK1 b - - 2 9,"Here I was calculating 9.Bf6, Qf6; 10.cd5!?, Qa1; 11.dc6, bc6 and decided that this is pretty unclear, but since Black is an exchange up and has a pair of Bishops it is looking promising enough."
18,Re8,f8e8,r2qr1k1/pp3ppp/2n2n2/2pp4/1bP3b1/4PN2/PB1PBPPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - - 3 10,"Starting to pressure the central files. The idea is to play Qd6 (to keep protection of both d5 and Nf6) and Rad8 to maximize the pressure. All Black's pieces are coordinated and concentrating on this part of the board. Meanwhile, White still has to catch up with development. This is why I think Black has a slight practical edge here, although to be fair the position is still objectively even. Time spent from the clock: 4 minutes"

If Black was passive or White equally active, this would not be a weakness."

23,Qb3,d1b3,r2qr1k1/pp3ppp/2n5/2pn3b/1b6/1Q2PN1P/PB1PBPP1/RN3RK1 b - - 2 12,"A solid multipurpose move - getting away from Bh5, allowing 13.Nc3 without break-up of pawn structure, potentially threatening b7 and clearing d1 for a Rook if necessary."
24,Qd6,d8d6,r3r1k1/pp3ppp/2nq4/2pn3b/1b6/1Q2PN1P/PB1PBPP1/RN3RK1 w - - 3 13,"Still following the game plan while additionally defending b7 (13.a3, Ba5; 14.Qb7??, Rab8). Time spent: 7 minutes"
25,Na3,b1a3,r3r1k1/pp3ppp/2nq4/2pn3b/1b6/NQ2PN1P/PB1PBPP1/R4RK1 b - - 4 13,"?! I think White knew this was not best, but since he was the favourite in this game he didn't want to allow mass exchanges - 13.Nc3, Bc3 (13...Nc3?!; 14.dc3 with Rad1); 14.Bc3 (14.dc3, Nf4=), Nc3; 15.Qc3, Bf3; 16.Bf3 and the game is most likely a draw. Time spent: 17 minutes"

28,Rxe2,e8e2,r5k1/pp3ppp/2nq4/2p4b/1b3P2/NQ3N1P/PB1PrPP1/R4RK1 w - - 0 15,"?? White started to lose his composure. Relatively best is 15.g4 (15.Rfe1, Re1; 16.Re1, Na5 and 15.Be5, Ne5; 16.fe5, Qa6! with advantage for Black), Bg4; 16.hg4, Qf4 and the position is unclear. Black has compensation for the piece but probably not more than that."
