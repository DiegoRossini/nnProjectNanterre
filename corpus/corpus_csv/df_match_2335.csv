1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,My normal move
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I was a little surprised to see this since most people at higher levels now play 1...Nf6
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Moving on to my favorite, the Queen's Gambit"
4,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Slav Defense, my least favorite defense to play against after 2. c4. This is the most popular response for Black next to 2...e6"
5,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3P4/3P4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,My team members give me a hard time for playing this opening. There's nothing wrong with it except that it's tame and often drawish. Sounds like my perfect opening
6,cxd5,c6d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Black naturally takes back with the pawn
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3p4/3P4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,Just normal development
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 5,Just normal development
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 5,"This is where I had my first think of the game. Black's goal is to capture the knight on f3 and damage White's pawn structure. If I take with the e-pawn, my d-pawn is now isolated. Taking with the g-pawn is an option but it would be harmful if White were to castle Kingside.

However, this isn't the strongest move in this position"
10,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p4/3P2b1/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 4 6,"This is where I had my first think of the game.

12,Qc7,d8c7,rn2kb1r/ppq1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P2b1/1QN2N2/PP2PPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 6 7,"Black loses a pawn right away. I was expecting 6...b6 in which I'd respond with 7. Ne5, where White seems to have a good position."
13,Nxd5,c3d5,rn2kb1r/ppq1pppp/5n2/3N4/3P2b1/1Q3N2/PP2PPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 7,Attacking the Queen and opening the line for the other Bishop

17,Qb3,d5b3,rn2kb1r/ppq2ppp/4p3/8/3P2b1/1Q3N2/PP2PPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 1 9,"Also possible is 11. Nd2, planning 12. f3 to drive the bishop away but that move is much more passive. This is the most natural way of blocking the check."
18,Nc6,b8c6,r3kb1r/ppq2ppp/2n1p3/8/3P2b1/1Q3N2/PP2PPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 2 10,"Also possible is 11. Nd2, planning 12. f3 to drive the bishop away but that move is much more passive. This is the most natural way of blocking the check."

23,Bxb4,d2b4,r3k2r/ppq2ppp/2n1p3/8/1B1P4/1Q2Pb2/PP3PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 12,"I sat on this one for about 8 minutes. I was looking at the possible benefits and consequences of 12. gxf3 Bxd2+ 13. Kxd2. White has a damaged pawn structure and a king in the center but also now has the two Bishops and more open lines for his pieces. In the end, I decided to go the safe route"
24,Nxb4,c6b4,r3k2r/ppq2ppp/4p3/8/1n1P4/1Q2Pb2/PP3PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 13,White's queen now blocks Black from castling Kingside for now.
25,Qxb4,b3b4,r3k2r/ppq2ppp/4p3/8/1Q1P4/4Pb2/PP3PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 13,White's queen now blocks Black from castling Kingside for now.
26,Bd5,f3d5,r3k2r/ppq2ppp/4p3/3b4/1Q1P4/4P3/PP3PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 1 14,Moving the Bishop away and keeping pressure on g2
27,Bb5+,f1b5,r3k2r/ppq2ppp/4p3/1B1b4/1Q1P4/4P3/PP3PPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 2 14,The best move. This allows White to develop the Bishop without having to worry about 14... Bxg2
28,Bc6,d5c6,r3k2r/ppq2ppp/2b1p3/1B6/1Q1P4/4P3/PP3PPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 3 15,White slowly puts pressure on the Bishop. It know is pinned to the King and the Queen

30,Rc8,a8c8,2r1k2r/ppq2ppp/2b1p3/1B6/1Q1P4/4P3/PP3PPP/2R1K2R w Kk - 5 16,? I feel that this move lets Black off a little bit. Sure the Queen will be able to move out of the pin but now 16. Bxc6+ bxc6 would give Black a weaker pawn structure on the Queenside.
31,O-O,e1g1,2r1k2r/ppq2ppp/2b1p3/1B6/1Q1P4/4P3/PP3PPP/2R2RK1 b k - 6 16,? I feel that this move lets Black off a little bit. Sure the Queen will be able to move out of the pin but now 16. Bxc6+ bxc6 would give Black a weaker pawn structure on the Queenside.
32,Qd7,c7d7,2r1k2r/pp1q1ppp/2b1p3/1B6/1Q1P4/4P3/PP3PPP/2R2RK1 w k - 7 17,Black's Queen escapes from the Rook on c1 and White will eventually have to move the Bishop on b5.
