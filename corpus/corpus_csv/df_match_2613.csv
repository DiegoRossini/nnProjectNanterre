Another candidate move was 10. Bb5 to prevent 10. Re8 but white's plan is still the central attack and I want to menace black's d pawn with 11. Bf6

30,Bb7,c8b7,rn2q1k1/1b3pbp/p2p1np1/2pP4/2N5/3B1N1P/PP3PP1/R1BQ2K1 w - - 2 16,"At first I thought this move was a blunder for : 16. Nxd6 Qd7 17. Nxb7 Qxb7 and white is one pawn up but if
18. Bc4 to protect the d5 pawn. 18. ... Rd8 and the pawn it dead for I cannot bring any other piece to protect it so that I think this is a very good move."
31,Nb6,c4b6,rn2q1k1/1b3pbp/pN1p1np1/2pP4/8/3B1N1P/PP3PP1/R1BQ2K1 b - - 3 16,So that I have to elect another move. I thought a lot about it because the knight is unprotected and has only two squares to retreat. But it seemed the only way to save my d pawn.
