My other choice to protect my kingside is Qe2, and I'm bottled in and really don't protect the kingside all that well. So I'll let him double my pawns. He can't immediately take advantage of them, and he may run into trouble if he chooses the wrong way to get them.
Probably his best choice, after trading the queens is to put his rooks on a5 and a8 while I put mine on d6 and d1."
