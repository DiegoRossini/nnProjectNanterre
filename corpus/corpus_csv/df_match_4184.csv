1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Black played Kamikaze chess... he pushed and pushed and kept pushing his pawns attacking my pieces like a madman, but then he over extended his pawns and underdeveloped his pieces, when finally he found himself without an attack objective, he lost initiative and then the game. This is a good example were lack of development get's you in trouble, attack with one or two pieces is just a bunch of fireworks that eventually burn off to nothing..."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,developing  because if dxc4 black only temporarily wins a pawn

12,e5,e6e5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/5n2/3pp3/2PN4/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"black is developing several pawns with tempo, I'll let him overextend them and then try to undermine those overextended pawns"
13,Nb3,d4b3,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/5n2/3pp3/2P5/1N4P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,"profiting from the lack of support on a possible e4 push, that loses the d pawn, I immediately return the sharpness... I expect to see the standard Bb4+ reply"

16,Bb4+,f8b4,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/5n2/4p3/1bPp1P2/1N4P1/PP2P1BP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 9,yes as expected
17,Bd2,c1d2,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/5n2/4p3/1bPp1P2/1N4P1/PP1BP1BP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 2 9,"forced eventually, black will exchange the dark squared bishops"
18,Ng4,f6g4,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/8/4p3/1bPp1Pn1/1N4P1/PP1BP1BP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 3 10,Ng4-e3 should be the idea again against best opening practices black will neglect development and uses only his two developed pieces... it will cost him eventually latter
19,O-O,e1g1,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/8/4p3/1bPp1Pn1/1N4P1/PP1BP1BP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 4 10,to remove my king from the center and add another defender to f4
20,Bxd2,b4d2,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/8/4p3/2Pp1Pn1/1N4P1/PP1bP1BP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 0 11,and black exchanges one of his two developed pieces
21,Qxd2,d1d2,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/8/4p3/2Pp1Pn1/1N4P1/PP1QP1BP/RN3RK1 b kq - 0 11,two ideas here further support to f4 and maybe even play Qb4 to prevent black's short castle and threaten b7
22,Ne3,g4e3,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/8/4p3/2Pp1P2/1N2n1P1/PP1QP1BP/RN3RK1 w kq - 1 12,the third move from the same knight (?)
23,Rf2,f1f2,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/8/4p3/2Pp1P2/1N2n1P1/PP1QPRBP/RN4K1 b kq - 2 12,forced
24,Nxc4,e3c4,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/8/4p3/2np1P2/1N4P1/PP1QPRBP/RN4K1 w kq - 0 13,"and the fourth move now after Qb4 I sense he will not doubt about a 5th move from the knight... it must be tired, the pawn is not a definitive capture as b7 will be hard  to defend, and black as several other weak point in his camp now that several of his pawns are exposed to an attack"
25,Qb4,d2b4,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/8/4p3/1Qnp1P2/1N4P1/PP2PRBP/RN4K1 b kq - 1 13,here it is as planed Qb4 with tempo attacks the knight and and b7 I expect to see Qc7 N1d2 Nxd2 Nxd2 with advantage for white as black can't castle and is underdeveloped
26,Qc7,d8c7,rnb1k2r/ppq2ppp/8/4p3/1Qnp1P2/1N4P1/PP2PRBP/RN4K1 w kq - 2 14,forced
27,Nb1d2,b1d2,rnb1k2r/ppq2ppp/8/4p3/1Qnp1P2/1N4P1/PP1NPRBP/R5K1 b kq - 3 14,"surprised me but is worst than Nxd2, due to Rc1 with tempo, hitting the queen, now white is clearly better and can try to convert the position and development advantage..."
28,Ne3,c4e3,rnb1k2r/ppq2ppp/8/4p3/1Q1p1P2/1N2n1P1/PP1NPRBP/R5K1 w kq - 4 15,"surprised me but is worst than Nxd2, due to Rc1 with tempo, hitting the queen, now white is clearly better and can try to convert the position and development advantage..."
29,Rc1,a1c1,rnb1k2r/ppq2ppp/8/4p3/1Q1p1P2/1N2n1P1/PP1NPRBP/2R3K1 b kq - 5 15,"occupies the open column with tempo, now black needs to move his queen away or to block the threat"
30,Nc6,b8c6,r1b1k2r/ppq2ppp/2n5/4p3/1Q1p1P2/1N2n1P1/PP1NPRBP/2R3K1 w kq - 6 16,... he chooses to block
31,Bxc6+,g2c6,r1b1k2r/ppq2ppp/2B5/4p3/1Q1p1P2/1N2n1P1/PP1NPR1P/2R3K1 b kq - 0 16,"as my bishop is probably lost, I do it on my terms... disturbing black's pawn structure"
32,bxc6,b7c6,r1b1k2r/p1q2ppp/2p5/4p3/1Q1p1P2/1N2n1P1/PP1NPR1P/2R3K1 w kq - 0 17,further centralizing the knight and threatening Ng5-f7 or Nd6-f7... let's see how does black deals with it
33,Ne4,d2e4,r1b1k2r/p1q2ppp/2p5/4p3/1Q1pNP2/1N2n1P1/PP2PR1P/2R3K1 b kq - 1 17,further centralizing the knight and threatening Ng5-f7 or Nd6-f7... let's see how does black deals with it
