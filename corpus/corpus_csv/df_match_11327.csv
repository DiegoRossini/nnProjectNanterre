13,Qg4,d1g4,rnbqk1nr/p4ppp/1p2p3/2ppP3/3P2Q1/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 1 7,"An important idea in the Winawer. As Black either has to demolish his kingside with g6, or play Kf8 , giving up the right to castle."

21,Qf3,g4f3,rn1qk2r/p3np2/bp2p1p1/2ppP1Bp/3P3P/P1PB1Q2/2P2PP1/R3K1NR b KQkq - 1 11,Releasing the pin and preparing Qa4 which would lock up the entire white queenside. In general in the Winawer you want to prevent the queen from getting to the a4 square.
22,Bxd3,a6d3,rn1qk2r/p3np2/1p2p1p1/2ppP1Bp/3P3P/P1Pb1Q2/2P2PP1/R3K1NR w KQkq - 0 12,Releasing the pin and preparing Qa4 which would lock up the entire white queenside. In general in the Winawer you want to prevent the queen from getting to the a4 square.

25,Ne2,g1e2,rn2k2r/p2qnp2/1p2p1p1/2ppP1Bp/3P3P/P1PQ4/2P1NPP1/R3K2R b KQkq - 2 13,White decides that moving the black queen again so soon will give white a big attack . White decides on Ne2 because once the black knight goes to f5 white will quickly play Ng3.
26,Nbc6,b8c6,r3k2r/p2qnp2/1pn1p1p1/2ppP1Bp/3P3P/P1PQ4/2P1NPP1/R3K2R w KQkq - 3 14,White doesn't fear an opposite sides castling as black can make no progress on the white king due to the strong g5 Bishop.
27,O-O,e1g1,r3k2r/p2qnp2/1pn1p1p1/2ppP1Bp/3P3P/P1PQ4/2P1NPP1/R4RK1 b kq - 4 14,White doesn't fear an opposite sides castling as black can make no progress on the white king due to the strong g5 Bishop.

31,Nxf5,g3f5,2r1k2r/p2q1p2/1pn1p1p1/2ppPNBp/3P3P/P1PQ4/2P2PP1/R4RK1 b k - 0 16,This move is a sort of waiting move as white wants to see what black will do before deciding on a plan.

35,a4,a3a4,2r1k2r/p2qnp2/1p2p3/2ppPpBp/P2P3P/2PQ4/2P2PPK/R4R2 b k - 0 18,"Black trys to win a pawn after cxd4, cxd4, Qxc2."

39,cxd4,c3d4,2r1k2r/p3np2/1pq1p3/3pPpBp/P2P3P/R2Q4/2P2PPK/5R2 b k - 0 20,?! A slight mistake as now white keeps black tied up for the rest of the game. Better was Qc4 when it is hard to see anything better than accepting the ending when the position is about level.

41,Qa6,d3a6,2r1k2r/p3np2/Qp2p3/3pPpBp/P2P3P/R7/2q2PPK/5R2 b k - 1 21,"A tricky move as the a7 pawn is threatened along with the skewer Rc1. Finally the point of Kh2 is seen as the check along the back rank after as after Rc1, Qxc1, Bxc1, Rxc1  saves black material."
