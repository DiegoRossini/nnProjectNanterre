1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This was one of my first loses on Gameknot. At the time both of us had much lower grades - I was 1711 and she was 1774.
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The standard queen's gambit. If black takes, white quickly recaptures the pawn."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"The standard queen's gambit. If black takes, white quickly recaptures the pawn."
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,The queen's gambit declined.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,This is all pretty standard stuff
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,This is all pretty standard stuff
7,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 3 4,This is all pretty standard stuff
8,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 4 5,This is all pretty standard stuff
9,e3,e2e3,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,This is all pretty standard stuff
10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR w KQ - 1 6,This is all pretty standard stuff
11,Qc2,d1c2,rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N1P3/PPQ2PPP/R3KBNR b KQ - 2 6,"This is slightly unusual however. At the time I was playing a line 6......h6 7. h4!? and if hxg5, 8 hxg5 and if the knight goes to anywhere other than e4 white has Qh7 mate! after Ne4 white captures twice on e4 and has two pawns and an attack for the bishop - I am not sure if it really sound, but it is an interesting line. Black here decides on another option."
12,dxc4,d5c4,rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/6B1/2pP4/2N1P3/PPQ2PPP/R3KBNR w KQ - 0 7,This again is slightly unusual. Normally black waits until white has moves the Bf1 before taking here - thus saving a tempo.
13,Bxc4,f1c4,rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/6B1/2BP4/2N1P3/PPQ2PPP/R3K1NR b KQ - 0 7,"And now with this move, black takes us out of the opening databases."

16,Nb4,c6b4,r1bq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/6B1/1nBP4/2N1PN2/PPQ2PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 3 9,"With the wonderful gift of hindsight, I think now that this is over-optimistic. Perhaps white should just play 10. 0-0 here, perhaps followed by Ne5 and f4. What do you think dear reader?"

21,d5,d4d5,r1bq1rk1/p3bppp/1p2pn2/2pP2B1/1nB1P3/2N2N2/PP1Q1PPP/R3K2R b KQ - 0 11,"Again d5 seems too aggressive, especially with the king still in the centre. 0-0 seems best still, although it is hard to see any advantage for white. Any thoughts dear reader?"

I thought now, if I have to return the piece, I may as well get a pawn for it, and played Bf7+, rather hoping for Kxf7, Qf4+ and then I can castle at last. My opponent finds an improvement however! Perhaps Bxa8 is best here - giving up the queen for two rooks? After 15. Bxa8 Rxd2, 16. Kxd2 perhaps white can still make a fight of it. What do you think dear reader?"
