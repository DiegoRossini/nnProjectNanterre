1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I begin with the usual e4.
2,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,d6 is the more normal move in the Robatsch.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,d6 is the more normal move in the Robatsch.
4,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,d6 is the more normal move in the Robatsch.
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,d6 is the more normal move in the Robatsch.
6,e6,e7e6,rnbqk1nr/pppp1pbp/4p1p1/8/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,d6 is the more normal move in the Robatsch.
7,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqk1nr/pppp1pbp/4p1p1/8/3PP3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"Here I am anticipating a king side castle by black. So I am positioning my pieces to hit towards the kingside, and I expect black to blow up the center at some point."
8,Ne7,g8e7,rnbqk2r/ppppnpbp/4p1p1/8/3PP3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,"And now I'm not sure what this game is, but black obviously is going to put pressure on the center from the flanks."
9,Be3,c1e3,rnbqk2r/ppppnpbp/4p1p1/8/3PP3/3BBN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 3 5,"This may be a bit conservative, this bishop move. But I don't feel comfortable putting it out further, and I think it's too passive on d2."
10,b6,b7b6,rnbqk2r/p1ppnpbp/1p2p1p1/8/3PP3/3BBN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"I chose this knight move to avoid future doubling of pawns on the c file, should that scenario arise, which is doubtful actually; it seems nearly certain now that black will castle kingside, and that black bishop fianchettoed like it is normally needs to be retained for defense until an opportune time."
11,Nbd2,b1d2,rnbqk2r/p1ppnpbp/1p2p1p1/8/3PP3/3BBN2/PPPN1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"I chose this knight move to avoid future doubling of pawns on the c file, should that scenario arise, which is doubtful actually; it seems nearly certain now that black will castle kingside, and that black bishop fianchettoed like it is normally needs to be retained for defense until an opportune time."
12,d6,d7d6,rnbqk2r/p1p1npbp/1p1pp1p1/8/3PP3/3BBN2/PPPN1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"Black has set up a small center, but is way too passive here. Fritz says white has a one point advantage here, and I tend to agree."
13,c3,c2c3,rnbqk2r/p1p1npbp/1p1pp1p1/8/3PP3/2PBBN2/PP1N1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 7,"This move in, I am now ready to begin operations. I'll castle when my opponent does here, as there is no threat yet to my king."
14,Nd7,b8d7,r1bqk2r/p1pnnpbp/1p1pp1p1/8/3PP3/2PBBN2/PP1N1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 1 8,This move is to begin an attack on the kingside. Black chooses to prevent h5 in this position; this actually creates dark-squared weaknesses despite the black bishop.
15,h4,h2h4,r1bqk2r/p1pnnpbp/1p1pp1p1/8/3PP2P/2PBBN2/PP1N1PP1/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 8,This move is to begin an attack on the kingside. Black chooses to prevent h5 in this position; this actually creates dark-squared weaknesses despite the black bishop.
16,h5,h7h5,r1bqk2r/p1pnnpb1/1p1pp1p1/7p/3PP2P/2PBBN2/PP1N1PP1/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 9,"and now with my knight in this position, black seems passive to me."
17,Ng5,f3g5,r1bqk2r/p1pnnpb1/1p1pp1p1/6Np/3PP2P/2PBB3/PP1N1PP1/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 9,"and now with my knight in this position, black seems passive to me."
18,Bb7,c8b7,r2qk2r/pbpnnpb1/1p1pp1p1/6Np/3PP2P/2PBB3/PP1N1PP1/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 10,A good place for the light squared black bishop.
19,Qf3,d1f3,r2qk2r/pbpnnpb1/1p1pp1p1/6Np/3PP2P/2PBBQ2/PP1N1PP1/R3K2R b KQkq - 3 10,"Thematically, the f7 pawn is one of the weaknesses that can often be exploited, so I position my queen to do so if the chance presents itself. I am not afraid of f5 at this point, but I'll have to watch for tactics down the road. Fritz did not much like this move of mine, but white still has an advantage."
20,Nf6,d7f6,r2qk2r/pbp1npb1/1p1ppnp1/6Np/3PP2P/2PBBQ2/PP1N1PP1/R3K2R w KQkq - 4 11,"There is good pressure now on my e4 pawn, but it is adequately defended."
21,Nc4,d2c4,r2qk2r/pbp1npb1/1p1ppnp1/6Np/2NPP2P/2PBBQ2/PP3PP1/R3K2R b KQkq - 5 11,Here I am trying to entice black to settle the central pawn question. But he does not advance them.
22,O-O,e8g8,r2q1rk1/pbp1npb1/1p1ppnp1/6Np/2NPP2P/2PBBQ2/PP3PP1/R3K2R w KQ - 6 12,"Now because of the b7 bishop, the game is fairly even. There is no easy way for me to get rid of it without help. At this point of the game, black can advance the d pawn and open the center up; that would be good for black right now."
23,O-O,e1g1,r2q1rk1/pbp1npb1/1p1ppnp1/6Np/2NPP2P/2PBBQ2/PP3PP1/R4RK1 b - - 7 12,"Now because of the b7 bishop, the game is fairly even. There is no easy way for me to get rid of it without help. At this point of the game, black can advance the d pawn and open the center up; that would be good for black right now."
24,Nf5,e7f5,r2q1rk1/pbp2pb1/1p1ppnp1/5nNp/2NPP2P/2PBBQ2/PP3PP1/R4RK1 w - - 8 13,"Now here black has made an interesting move, because my pawn is pinned; but white's defenses are sufficient. Bf4 is possible here as a response; the pawn on the h file is immune, because if Nxh4, Qg3 wins that knight. However, I decide to advance the g pawn anyways."
25,g3,g2g3,r2q1rk1/pbp2pb1/1p1ppnp1/5nNp/2NPP2P/2PBBQP1/PP3P2/R4RK1 b - - 0 13,"Fritz thinks this is not a good move, that I should have tried to save the bishop... ::edit:: Here were my thoughts during the game, with observations: Eduard's comment  below is exactly correct. This is why Fritz did not like this move. However, I actually wanted black to take my bishop in this position, as he does on his next turn; and in this position I did not wish to advance my center pawns first, nor did I wish to start activity on the queenside, in case black found counterplay with his other dark-squared bishop. I also did not wish to place my dark squared bishop on the f file, because even though that was what Fritz would have done, I was not simply content to stymie black in the center; I wanted to create a threat that black would not be able to ignore and did not see at this point a good reason for my bishop to be there. For these reasons, although I knew it weakened the king defense, I chose to play it anyways, Fritz be darned. ;) But in a classical, non-blitz game, playing this g pawn move is, as Eduard alludes, extremely dangerous than in a blitz game, as it might take too much thinking to figure out how to exploit it without time trouble."
26,Nxe3,f5e3,r2q1rk1/pbp2pb1/1p1ppnp1/6Np/2NPP2P/2PBnQP1/PP3P2/R4RK1 w - - 0 14,"While normally two bishops are worth more, only if the side with two bishops creates an open board! This is actually to my liking here; it allows me to create a half open file for my heavy pieces."
27,fxe3,f2e3,r2q1rk1/pbp2pb1/1p1ppnp1/6Np/2NPP2P/2PBPQP1/PP6/R4RK1 b - - 0 14,"At this point, perhaps black actually has the better game despite white's dominating position in the center. But after black's next move, the game is pretty much over."
28,b5,b6b5,r2q1rk1/pbp2pb1/3ppnp1/1p4Np/2NPP2P/2PBPQP1/PP6/R4RK1 w - - 0 15,"And this is a mistake in this game. The bishop on b7 is a key piece for black, and now I can get rid of it."
