1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,1.e4 as usual for me. I have never practiced Queen-pawn openings...
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Fischer said that the King's Gambit had been defeated. I might agree, since GM's rarely play it at high-level tournaments. But canuto and I are not GM's, so I always take a shot at it, when possible."
3,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Fischer said that the King's Gambit had been defeated. I might agree, since GM's rarely play it at high-level tournaments. But canuto and I are not GM's, so I always take a shot at it, when possible."
4,exf4,e5f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Gambit accepted...
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"Many lover's of the King's Gambit often play 3.Bc4 (remember Anderssen's Immortal Game), but I've always despised being checked so early in the game, besides, Nf3 is played more often than Bc4 for a reason."
6,h6,h7h6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1pp1/7p/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"This move doesn't look very good, as it neglects development of black's pieces this early in the game."
7,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1pp1/7p/8/2B1Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"Preparing to castle king-side, also to place a rook on f1 to exploit the soon to be opened f file."
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1pp1/5n1p/8/2B1Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,Trying to defend the extra pawn at the expense of falling behind on piece development is never a good idea. Even worse moving a piece twice; black would've been better off with something like 6...g5

14,Be6,c8e6,rn1qkb1r/ppp2pp1/3pb2p/7n/2BPPp2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 3 8,Getting rid of one of the hostile attackers...
15,Bxe6,c4e6,rn1qkb1r/ppp2pp1/3pB2p/7n/3PPp2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,"! This might seem like a simple knight exchange, but accepting it wouldn't be a recommendable idea for black's position."

19,Ng6,e5g6,rn1qkb1r/ppp3p1/3ppnNp/8/3PPp2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 3 10,"Eliminating the possibility of castling king-side (which wouldn't be a very good idea, anyway)."

28,Nc6,b8c6,r3kbr1/pppq2p1/2np2Np/3pP2Q/3P1B2/8/PPP3PP/R4RK1 w q - 2 15,If only that knight would've been moved there before (probably instead of 3...h6?).
29,exd6,e5d6,r3kbr1/pppq2p1/2nP2Np/3p3Q/3P1B2/8/PPP3PP/R4RK1 b q - 0 15,"15.Nxf8 would've been better!! Black can now castle and be away from danger. White would still have advantage, though."
