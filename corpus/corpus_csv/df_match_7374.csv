13,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 7,Not the best choice I really should have castled kingside.
14,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/1p2bppp/p2ppn2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 8,I've lost a tempo and gained nothing.

34,d5,d6d5,r2q1rk1/1b2bppp/4p3/pN1p3P/1p2n3/4B3/PPP1B1P1/1NKRQ2R w - - 0 18,Protecting the strong central knight but closing off the light squared bishop. However white seems to have no piece that matches the knight.

39,Bxc5,e3c5,2rq1rk1/1b2bppp/4p3/pNBp3P/1p4P1/3B4/PPP5/1NKRQ2R b - - 0 20,I give him the bishop pair which was a bad idea in an open game. I may be a pawn ahead but material isn't everything. Maybe Nd4 would have been better the knight is doing nothing in its current position.
