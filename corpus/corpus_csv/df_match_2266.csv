8,d6,d7d6,r1bqkb1r/ppp1nppp/2np4/1B2p3/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"D6 was played, very natural looking move, so the lsb can be developed."
9,d4,d2d4,r1bqkb1r/ppp1nppp/2np4/1B2p3/3PP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"D4, d5 is coming next, to win the knight."
10,Bd7,c8d7,r2qkb1r/pppbnppp/2np4/1B2p3/3PP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 6,"exd4 is possible, but black played Bd7 breaks the pin."
11,O-O,e1g1,r2qkb1r/pppbnppp/2np4/1B2p3/3PP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 2 6,White simply castles king side.

14,h6,h7h6,r2qkb1r/pppb1pp1/2np2np/1B2p1N1/3PP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,"h6, looks logical, black wants to kick the knight away, however here comes the first shocking move."
15,Nxf7,g5f7,r2qkb1r/pppb1Np1/2np2np/1B2p3/3PP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,Nxf7 what a move! The knight is forking the queen and the rook.
16,Kxf7,e8f7,r2q1b1r/pppb1kp1/2np2np/1B2p3/3PP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 0 9,"Well, king must take."
17,Bc4+,b5c4,r2q1b1r/pppb1kp1/2np2np/4p3/2BPP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 1 9,"It it's tempting to play Qf3+, but after king back to e8, black would have better chance to survive the attack, so it's critical to play the right move at this point. Bc4+ was played, the bishop is now dominating the a2 g8 diagonal, which restricts the king's position."
18,Ke7,f7e7,r2q1b1r/pppbk1p1/2np2np/4p3/2BPP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 2 10,"Ke7 was played, why not just play Be6 blocks the bishop? Because d5 would be disaster for black. However, I think ke8 would be a better move, because after white plays Qh5, black can play Qf6, also if white plays Qf3 treats mate, Qf6 can still be played, right? What do you think?"
19,Qh5,d1h5,r2q1b1r/pppbk1p1/2np2np/4p2Q/2BPP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNB2RK1 b - - 3 10,Qh5 attacks the knight
20,Qe8,d8e8,r3qb1r/pppbk1p1/2np2np/4p2Q/2BPP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNB2RK1 w - - 4 11,"Qe8 was played, and that's a blunder, if black played kf6 instead, he would survive much longer, although it looks risky, however because this Qe8 move, black jumped into his doom."
21,Qg5+,h5g5,r3qb1r/pppbk1p1/2np2np/4p1Q1/2BPP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNB2RK1 b - - 5 11,"Here comes the earth shuttering move, Qg5+! What a fascinating move!"
