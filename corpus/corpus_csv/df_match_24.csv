3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"OK, but perhaps unnecessarily provocative.  Much more usual is 2.exd5 and if Black recaptures, 2...Qxd5, 3.Nc3 forces Black to move the Queen a second time.  I once won a game in four moves when Black thoughtlessly retreated his Queen to c6, whereat 4.Bb5 pinned his Q against his K.   Much more usual is 3...Qa5, which places the Q on a safe square, but still actively located."
4,d4,d5d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/3pP3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Good response to White's threat to win the pawn.  Now the knight will have to move a second time.
5,Nd5,c3d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3N4/3pP3/8/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"Although this encourages Black to hit him again, I think this is probably OK.  3.Ne2 may be met by 3...e5, when Black has the larger share of the centre.  That need not be fatal - more like the colours reversing roles!"
6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3N4/3pP3/8/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"?  I can't tell whether this is a simple 'one-mover' oversight, or a reluctance to move the knight a fourth time.  It were better to have moved the knight a fourth time, and even a fifth - 5.Nh5 g5  6.Ng3.  However 5.Nd3 would have been OK too, threatening to win the e-pawn."
7,Nf4,d5f4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/3pPN2/8/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,"?  I can't tell whether this is a simple 'one-mover' oversight, or a reluctance to move the knight a fourth time.

10,Nh6,g8h6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/7n/4p3/2BpPN2/8/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 2 6,?  Taking the knight would have been fine for Black.
11,Nd3,f4d3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/7n/4p3/2BpP3/3N4/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 3 6,"This is a mistake, but a bit of calculation is necessary to figure it out.  The sequence isn't deep, but it IS more than two moves.  The problem is that if the bishop's protector, the h6-knight, can be drawn from his post, he can be overwhelmed by numbers, with two pieces attacking the bishop and one defending.  It is a small combination.  See if you can find it."

13,Ne2,g1e2,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/7n/4p3/2BpP1b1/3N4/PPPPNPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 5 7,"?  Rather awkward - White pieces are starting to get a bit tangled in the centre.  Recall the opening guideline - don't move a piece twice in the opening, unless there is a tactic.  Earlier, the knight was being hunted; it had to keep on the move.  Now there is a tactic: 7.Bxf7ch! Black has two reasonable replies: 7...Nxf7 8.Qxg4; OR 7...Kxf7 8.Nxe5ch ... (forking King on f7 and Bishop on g4) 8...Ke8 9.Nxg4 ... Either way, White wins a pawn with a slight advantage."
14,Bxe2,g4e2,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/7n/4p3/2BpP3/3N4/PPPPbPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,Gives up an active piece for one relatively immobile (because it is pinned).  Not usually a good bargain.
15,Qxe2,d1e2,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/7n/4p3/2BpP3/3N4/PPPPQPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 0 8,?  Another 'one mover' oversight that costs Black a pawn.  8...Bd6 or 8...f6 or a move by the b8-knight would have been much better.
16,Be7,f8e7,rn1qk2r/ppp1bppp/7n/4p3/2BpP3/3N4/PPPPQPPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 1 9,?  Another 'one mover' oversight that costs Black a pawn.  8...Bd6 or 8...f6 or a move by the b8-knight would have been much better.
17,Nxe5,d3e5,rn1qk2r/ppp1bppp/7n/4N3/2BpP3/8/PPPPQPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 0 9,The Gameknot engine gives White a 1.88 edge - worth almost 2 pawns - very much the better game.
18,Bf6,e7f6,rn1qk2r/ppp2ppp/5b1n/4N3/2BpP3/8/PPPPQPPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 1 10,"Safe enough.  An alternative idea would have been to invite (force) an exchange of minor pieces by 10.Ng4.  Now that she is a pawn ahead, even (i.e. equal) exchanges are in White's interests, in principle.  That does NOT mean simply blindly exchange, of course, nor should Black avoid them if by so doing he incurs worse, but they can be used to add value to White material advantage."

20,O-O,e8g8,rn1q1rk1/ppp2ppp/5b1n/8/2BpP3/3N4/PPPPQPPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 3 11,"!?  OK, but I think I would have castled, here.  White does have to be somewhat concerned about the tangled situation on the c- and d-files, too, though their unravelling is not yet urgent."

22,Be7,f6e7,rn1q1rk1/ppp1bppp/7n/4P3/2Bp4/3N4/PPPPQPPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 1 12,?!  Halves White's advantage according to the GK engine.  But I rather like this move - poking a heavy stick into Black's game.  It's a move I might well have played myself in this situation.

The recapture will throw White back onto the defensive.  It is not so easy to find a good move, but I might have been inclined to castle, or play 15.Bb3, with a view to relocating to c2, aiming at the h7-square."

33,O-O,e1g1,r2q1rk1/1pp1bnpp/8/8/p1Bn4/3N4/PP1P1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 17,"At last, and quite understandable.  There will come times at this level of play in which quite complicated tactical situations can arise.  It is very hard to learn to recognise and take advantage of them without having begun with simpler, less complicated motifs and patterns.  The main thing to note is that the f7-knight is pinned by the bishop against the king.  It is defended by a rook and the king.  Could White heap another attacker against the pinned knight?  Yes she could: 17.Ne5!  Could Black in response find another defender?  Only the Queen.  What that means is that White looks to be winning the exchange after 17.Ne5.   ++++++++++++++  As it transpires, this might have led to a wild tactical melee as follows:  17.Ne5! Bd6!  18.Nxf7 Qe7ch (the reason for the bishop move) 19.Kf1 b4  (A piece and a pawn down, Black fights like a tiger to stay in the game) 20.Nh6ch! ... (As you see, this is well beyond 'one-mover' territory, and would be challenging for an experienced tactician to calculate.  Not 20.Nd6ch?? bxc4  21.Nxc4 Rxf2ch 22.Kxf2 Rf8ch  23.Kg1 Ne2ch and Black wins)  20...Kh8 21.Bd5 e6  22.Nf7ch Kg8  23.Qg4! Ne2 24.Be6 Rxf7  25.Rb1 Raf8  26.Bxf7ch Rxf7.  fen=""6k1/4qrpp/2pb4/1p6/p5Q1/8/PPnP1PPP/1RB2K1R w - -"" ++++++++++++++++ I would not expect anyone below Master level to calculate this whole line, so complicated it is.  Myself, I would have decided that something like 17.Ne5 b5  18,Bxf7ch Rxf7  19.Nxf7 Kxf7 won the exchange and left it at that.  I might well have been surprised by the tactical fight Black put up by 17...Bd6!  but 'them are the breaks'.   If you don't see a reason NOT to capture a thing, or win some other advantage, go for it.  If it turns out bad, you will learn to recognise the really unsafe captures."
