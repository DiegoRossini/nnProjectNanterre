1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Interesting so far. F4 is actually a pretty bad move usually but if he can clutter up the centre with his pawns and knights (which he does very well) he may live to tell the tale.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Interesting so far. F4 is actually a pretty bad move usually but if he can clutter up the centre with his pawns and knights (which he does very well) he may live to tell the tale.

4,exf4,e5f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Obvious move. This is a King's gambit accepted, supposedly an ""antiquated"" opening. Apparently not."
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"On my database, this move is played 8 times out of 10. Why would anyone play anything else?"
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,"At this point my computer claims that g6,d6 or d5, not nf6 are the best moves.Interesting."
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/8/4Pp2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 4,Correct move here is definitely e5 but nc3 is the next best thing.
8,Bc5,f8c5,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/2b5/4Pp2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 4 5,Developing.
9,d4,d2d4,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/2b5/3PPp2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"My Computer is half for and half against. 2 lines say i'm losing 2, say i'm winning."
10,Bb4,c5b4,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/8/1b1PPp2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,"This stops 6. ... Nxe4, because the knight cannot retake due to it being pinned to the king."
11,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/8/1b1PPp2/2NB1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 6,"This stops 6. ... Nxe4, because the knight cannot retake due to it being pinned to the king."
12,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/5n2/8/1b1PPp2/2NB1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 3 7,! This move wins a piece and destroys white's position. He just doesn't know it yet.
13,Bxf4,c1f4,rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/5n2/8/1b1PPB2/2NB1N2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 7,! This move wins a piece and destroys white's position. He just doesn't know it yet.

15,O-O,e1g1,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/1b1PPB2/2NB1N2/PPP3PP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 8,This does make the positional damage slightly less painful but perhaps he should have concentrated on his E pawn?
16,Bxc3,b4c3,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/3PPB2/2bB1N2/PPP3PP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 9,"This beautiful move is the reason why i played d5. White resigns because, like I said, he is a piece down and his position shattered."
