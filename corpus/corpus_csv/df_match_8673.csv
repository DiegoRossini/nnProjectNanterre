Freddy also has this solution:-

""easy19: This should be the best solution.  
22. Qg5+ Kh7 23.Qxh5 Be6 24.Nxe6 Kg8 25.Qg5+ Kh7 26.Rh1 Qa5 27.Bd2+ Qh5 28. Rxh5#.""
Beware though it can come unstuck if your opponent is the Master Mater.  Freddy finds an excellent in between move as you will see."
