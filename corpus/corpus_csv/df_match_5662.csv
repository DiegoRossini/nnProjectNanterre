1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,In this game features subtle manouvering and was a good test of my patience as it is the longest game I have played on gameknot to date.  It took me a long time to find the right point to attack and create the slightest of advantages. My opponent played an excellent game and he was deserving of the draw
