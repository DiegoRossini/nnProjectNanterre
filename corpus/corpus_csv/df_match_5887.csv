1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I wrote this annotation because I believe a common mistake in chess is for h6 as black tries to prevent a queen pin. As this game proves, that move can allow white to blow a hole in the defense."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"As far the center game opening goes, I do not believe this move is sound. It doesn't develop black in a meaningful way, in fact I think it actually becomes harder for black to defend out of this position. Nc6 I think is the right choice."

7,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/8/2p5/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,Standard attack on the f7 pawn. Not hard to stop.
8,h6,h7h6,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1pp1/7p/2p5/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"In trying to prevent queen pin, (which cannot happen anyway because of c5, black has created an opening. The knight can no longer shield the f7 pawn. It does not stop the advance of the knight either (Ne5 instead of Ng5)."

10,Qf6,d8f6,rnb1kbnr/pp1p1pp1/5q1p/2p1N3/2BpP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 6,"This move is bad for black, but I am not sure what he should do to catch up defensively. Nxf7 creates leverage to push the pawn to e5, which will make black's life a lot more difficult. The queen has to move though if black wants to prevent a fork. Maybe Qb6 is this best choice here."
11,Nxf7,e5f7,rnb1kbnr/pp1p1Np1/5q1p/2p5/2BpP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,Qh4 would have been better. You cannot help but seeing how vulnerable the H file is to white's queen. And at some point black needs to get his b8 knight moving since the other one is basically stuck.
12,Rh7,h8h7,rnb1kbn1/pp1p1Npr/5q1p/2p5/2BpP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQq - 1 7,Qh4 would have been better. You cannot help but seeing how vulnerable the H file is to white's queen. And at some point black needs to get his b8 knight moving since the other one is basically stuck.
