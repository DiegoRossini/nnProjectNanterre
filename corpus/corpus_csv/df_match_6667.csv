1,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I've never actually encountered this opening before, in my memory - according to the gameknot Database, this is the Van't Kruijs opening"
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/8/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,I have no idea why I did this. [not that there's anything wrong with the move - I guess i just wanted to try something different :) ]
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"White develops his second centre pawn, which is now supported by the pawn at e3."
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"I mirror the move, taking my own claim into the centre."
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"nothing much to say about the opening developing moves, but the fianchetto here is probably less common. By making this move, Black is directing all of his pieces towards White's queenside (it's a shame that White wants to castle kingside)"
6,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p1b2/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,"nothing much to say about the opening developing moves, but the fianchetto here is probably less common. By making this move, Black is directing all of his pieces towards White's queenside (it's a shame that White wants to castle kingside)"
7,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p1b2/3P4/2N1PN2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 4,"nothing much to say about the opening developing moves, but the fianchetto here is probably less common. By making this move, Black is directing all of his pieces towards White's queenside (it's a shame that White wants to castle kingside)"
8,g6,g7g6,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3p1b2/3P4/2N1PN2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"nothing much to say about the opening developing moves, but the fianchetto here is probably less common. By making this move, Black is directing all of his pieces towards White's queenside (it's a shame that White wants to castle kingside)"
9,Bd3,f1d3,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3p1b2/3P4/2NBPN2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,White develops and threatens to double up Black's pawns on the f-file
10,Bg7,f8g7,rn1qk2r/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3p1b2/3P4/2NBPN2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 6,"This could have waited, as it was pretty obvious that Black was planning this anyway. Better might have been Qd7, but then White has the strong Ne5! [yes, White does move a piece twice in the opening, but that's nullified when it forces your opponent to do the same thing] I did not want to initiate the exchange myself because that would let White pull ahead in development [at this point, It's -1.02, advantage White. I guess he played his opening better here]"
11,Bxf5,d3f5,rn1qk2r/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3p1B2/3P4/2N1PN2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,! As expected...
12,gxf5,g6f5,rn1qk2r/ppp1ppbp/5n2/3p1p2/3P4/2N1PN2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,Now Black has doubled pawns on the f-file (and they're looking particularly ugly right now!)
13,O-O,e1g1,rn1qk2r/ppp1ppbp/5n2/3p1p2/3P4/2N1PN2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 7,"Retreating the king to safety. Most likely this will become a game of 'opposite side castling', since Black will not want to castle into a weakened kingside"
14,Nc6,b8c6,r2qk2r/ppp1ppbp/2n2n2/3p1p2/3P4/2N1PN2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 8,Black's first step towards queenside castling...
15,Ne5,f3e5,r2qk2r/ppp1ppbp/2n2n2/3pNp2/3P4/2N1P3/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 3 8,"!? White starts to get aggressive - though after Black's reply, White now has doubled pawns down the e-file (though they're probably more effective than Black's doubled pawns)"
16,Nxe5,c6e5,r2qk2r/ppp1ppbp/5n2/3pnp2/3P4/2N1P3/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 9,Black avoids the pawn capture and now targets the e-pawn
17,dxe5,d4e5,r2qk2r/ppp1ppbp/5n2/3pPp2/8/2N1P3/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 9,Black avoids the pawn capture and now targets the e-pawn
18,Ng4,f6g4,r2qk2r/ppp1ppbp/8/3pPp2/6n1/2N1P3/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 1 10,Black avoids the pawn capture and now targets the e-pawn
19,f4,f2f4,r2qk2r/ppp1ppbp/8/3pPp2/5Pn1/2N1P3/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 10,"The most natural way to defend the e-pawn, though it could be seen as a case of 'weakening the king's defence,' though Black can't immediately take advantage of that. The other option is Qd4, but that just doesn't feel right... [this move also limits the power of Black's fianchettoed bishop - I notice this at move 14]"
20,e6,e7e6,r2qk2r/ppp2pbp/4p3/3pPp2/5Pn1/2N1P3/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 11,"this move pretty much locks in the centre, and now both sides will be looking towards wing action. With the way Black is positioned, he can play Qh4, threatening mate on h2. Black predicts what White would play in response to that threat..."
21,h3,h2h3,r2qk2r/ppp2pbp/4p3/3pPp2/5Pn1/2N1P2P/PPP3P1/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 11,"...snd it comes one move early. It seems reasonable too - the only safe square for the knight is the h6 square, which isn't entirely desirable. However... [at this point the score is -0.29, advantage White... in other words, roughly even"
22,h5,h7h5,r2qk2r/ppp2pb1/4p3/3pPp1p/5Pn1/2N1P2P/PPP3P1/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 12,"Black hopes that after the knight sac, he can make something of the open h-file. after hxg4 hxg4, Black will then bring his queen over to the h4 square to pressure the now exposed king. White can stop this by g3 and Qe1 (I think Qe1 would be better) but then Black plays f6, and White (who loses a pawn otherwise) has to exchange, and the queen now reaches the h6 square. [as you would expect, the Gameknot Analysis didn't like this move at all, and gave this line; 10...h5 11.hxg4 hxg4 12.Qe1 Qe7... no thought about f6? maybe I missed something... in that line, Gameknot gives -1.54, advantage White... not completely losing, as far as I can see, so there must have been something in the knight sac]"
23,Ne2,c3e2,r2qk2r/ppp2pb1/4p3/3pPp1p/5Pn1/4P2P/PPP1N1P1/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 12,"White senses something suspicious, and declines the exchange [and yes, every move where the g4 knight is ignored is a mistake from both sides... though Gameknot gives a very strange line for this line; 12.Qd3 Nh6 13.Qb5+ c6 14.Qxb7 Qb6 15.Qxa8 Ke7 16.Na4 Qc7 17.Qxh8 Bxh8 18.Bd2 c5 19.Nc3 Bg7... one problem; how about 13.Qb5+ Qd7 14.0-0, which only loses one pawn and allows Rfb1 next move... again, and I missing something?]"
24,Qh4,d8h4,r3k2r/ppp2pb1/4p3/3pPp1p/5Pnq/4P2P/PPP1N1P1/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 13,"looking back, this probably wasn't the best move (f6 was better) Now, hxg4 would be a big mistake, and if White didn't want to take the bait lost move, then I was a fool to think he'd do so now. I was also considering 12....h4, to tempt Black with the knight again and hope to make something about the g and h pawns. However, the problem with that plan is all White will have to do his move his knight and the the g-pawn is undefendable."
25,Qe1,d1e1,r3k2r/ppp2pb1/4p3/3pPp1p/5Pnq/4P2P/PPP1N1P1/R1B1QRK1 b kq - 3 13,"Threatening the queen, who either has to retreat back to e7 or follow through with an exchange."
