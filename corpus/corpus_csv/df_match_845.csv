1-0
An impressive defeat of the champion of the Old World! This game lasted all of half an hour. After gaining revenge on the 77th move in the very next game, Anderssen joked gloomily: ""Morphy wins in 17 moves, whereas it takes me 77. However, this is still bearable..."" By winning the 11th game, Morphy won the match (+7 -2 =2), and thus in just one year he had clearly demonstrated that he had no equal in the world.
""Morphy possesses the secret of invincibility,"" the newspapers enthused. The loser of the match, although shocked, also worthily assessed his opponent's immense triumph, publicly declaring that Morphy played much more strongly and solidly than La Bourdonnais, and admitting: ""It is useless fighting against this man; for me he is too strong. He is accurate and faultless, like a machine, whereas I am only a mere mortal..."" Later, Anderssen shared a very important observation: ""Morphy treats chess with the seriousness and conscientiousness of an artist...For him a game of chess is a sacred duty...""
Before Morphy left Paris, a splendid farewell banquet was held in his honor. To the applause of the public, the chairman Saint-Amant crowned with a laurel wreath a marble bust, specially made for the occasion, of the ""king of all kings"", which became one of the sights of the Cafe de la Regence.
Paul was greeted even more triumphantly in New York. An official celebration in his honor took place in a hall seating two thousand, where enormous shields were erected with the names of his defeated opponents. When Morphy appeared, a hymn was played; then the chess king was presented with a gift from the nation - a rosewood table, encrusted with pearl and silver, a chess board with squares of mother-of-pearl and ebony, with gold and silver pieces on cornelian pedestals...He was also presented with a gold clock with diamonds, where the hours were indicated by red and black chess pieces. For the first time in chess history, a victory was truly recognized as an event of national importance!
What was the secret to Morphy's invincibility? I think that it was a combination of a unique natural talent and brilliant erudition. His play was the next, more mature stage in the development of chess. Morphy had a well-developed ""feeling for position"", and therefore he can be confidently regarded as the ""first swallow"" -- the prototype of the strong 20-th century GM.
Like Philidor a hundred or so years before him, Morphy was GREATLY ahead of his time. As Euwe put it: ""If the distinguishing feature of a genius is that he is far ahead compared with his epoch, then Morphy was a chess genius in the complete sense of the word."" He spontaneously established the three main principles of opening play: 1) the rapid development of the pieces; 2) the seizure of the center; 3) the opening of lines. To formulate these and other principles of positional play required a furth"
