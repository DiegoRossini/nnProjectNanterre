I can not defend f6 with 10. ..Qe6 because of a discovered attack Nxc7+ Kd7 Bxe6 and 10. ..Qe7 fails instantly to Nxf7. The only way to save the Queen is Qd8, but it is followed by Nxf6+ and my Bishop on g4 falls. I decide that my bishop is more useful that my Queen and go forward with my attack of Nf3 assisted with a window on g7 that helps to actifate the Kingside Rook."
