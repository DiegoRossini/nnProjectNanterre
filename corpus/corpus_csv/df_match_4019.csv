Re: blake78613's various comments: The proof is in the pudding. If White was trying out a new variation in this game, one could only say it met with resounding failure. Let me point out also that the Sicilian isn't the Ruy Lopez/Spanish game: the Sicilian is a fighting defense from the first move, and both players seek dynamic chances and counter-chances. Some variations are more positionally-minded, true, but none are cautious by nature or sedate, and all of them bristle with tactical fireworks simmering barely below the surface. It's my considered opinion that White's plan - if plan he had - was poor in both conception and execution against a defense as aggressive as the Sicilian. What makes my judgment valid, you may ask? Well, just take a look at the ratings of some of the Gameknot players my Annotated Games list includes. One final note: The Danish GM Bent Larsen was noted for his occasional barbed comments when analyzing games: I recall one (not one of his own games) where he bluntly wrote, ""In my opinion, both players are losing here,"" and earlier had said of Black, ""His whole game is incomprehensible."" When I analyze I state my opinion about the position. If the reader doesn't like it, that's fine: he's free to look at someone else's games."
