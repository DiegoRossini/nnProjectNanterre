1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This open challenge turned into a tough battle. Although Alexkhine was 100 points south of my rating at the start it was pretty evenly matched. I made a few blunders however I got lucky at the end.
2,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I'm doing a little experimentation with the English opening at the moment to make a change from my more usual efforts
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"Going for central control, the disadvantage for white here is that only one peice is developed where as black is already able to castle"
