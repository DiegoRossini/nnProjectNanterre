1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi, my name is Fred McGriff and I am a retired professional baseball player."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Typically when my opponent opens with the queen's pawn I panic, yank the plug from my computer, and rock back and forth huddled in the corner of my closet.  But since this is tenfingers, my nemesis, I dig deep and answer three days later with a well-thought-out d5.  I'm pretty sure it's a force from here but he chooses to play on:"
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,queen's gambit....
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"DECLINED!!  after my 1..d5! the rest is style points, and denying the gambit that he begged me for, whilst merciless, feels awfully good.  I'm 4-7-1 lifetime against tenfingers and am currently frothing at the mouth as 5-7-1 is but one move closer."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,He moves a sulky donkey to c3 in a weak attempt to regain compusure after such an embarrassing rejection
6,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/1bPP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"well, sulky donkey, now you're stuck."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/1bPP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 4,TWO sulky donkeys.
8,Bxc3+,b4c3,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/2b2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,With this move I shred my opponent's hopes of having any semblance of a pawn structure.  I must be playing downwind because supple fumes of victory waft my way
9,bxc3,b2c3,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/2P2N2/P3PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,I'm scratching my head here wondering why he hasn't yet issued his resignation.  is it not insulting to play on with doubled pawns?
10,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/2P2N2/P3PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,"I threaten to castle kingside, and rest assured this is no empty threat."
11,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2P2N2/P3PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 2 6,"Wow, nice move tenfingers, what are you like a five time dean's lister at the Fred McGriff School of Chess all the sudden?  Where have I seen this move before?"
12,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2P2N2/P3PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 3 7,Well this is how I answer.  I'm just going to develop and ignore.
