2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Queen's gambit declined.  Doesn't work out for black so often on the game DB here, but I believe it to be more than solid."

8,c6,c7c6,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"The defining move of the Cambridge Springs Variation.  Note that there's the nifty tactic that if black plays dxc4, there is a discovered attack on the bishop by the queen.  Black also has a strong queenside presence with his queen and (soon to be) his bishop as well."

17,Bxc4,d3c4,r1b1k2r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/q5B1/1bBP4/2N1PN2/PP1Q1PPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 0 9,"?  I would have thought Bc2 was better, jettisoning the c-pawn but at least preventing the knight from infiltrating.  What happens now is worse for white."

The following attempt to complicate is interesting and may have succeeded in blitz chess (as it almost does here), but the extra time-per-move of correspondence chess will prove decisive."

I thought a long time here before taking the bishop, since white gets a rook on an open h-file as well as a well-positioned queen, bishop, and knight plus a pawn majority.  On the other hand, I think black can parry those threats.  Soooo..."
