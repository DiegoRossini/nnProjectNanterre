Black wants to play on the flanks, and hold against any counters in the center. Thats why he set up e6 and d6. When the position is closed, then his lack of development means little. So it is clear white needs to blast the center and start attacking there."

Here black should be consistent with his idea, and play 8...e5 8.Be3. Now if black wants to force white to take, he will have to play ...c5. But then white still has a nice edge, since black has been forced to play in the center, and it has gotton opened up a bit. So black's strategy is incorrect, but if you don't understand it, then you will not be able to counter it."
