Because the Queen is the most valuable piece on the board, she is also the most vulnerable, because you can't trade her for anything other than another Queen, which means she is now going to start running."

Generally a good idea to develop your knights before bishops, besides which, what do you think is going to happen here, black does not see the mating threat? There is an old saying in chess: the threat is greater than the execution. What it means is that it's not the mating threat that is important, it is the weakness that the opponent must create when AVOIDING the threat that you are after. In this case, your threat, Qxf7 mate, actually helps Black because your Queen is out in the middle of the board."

(1) Do I have any pieces hanging that need to be protected or moved.
(2) What are the three best moves available to me in this position?
(3) What does each of those moves accomplish, specifically.
(4) Which of the is the best?"

10,Nd4,c6d4,r1bqkb1r/pppp1p1p/5np1/4p3/2BnP3/3P1Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 1 6,"And now we see the problem with your development. The Queen, at this stage, should have stayed on d1. The Knight at g1 should be sitting on f3. What would this accomplish. Well, the Queen would not be being attacked, yes? And the Knight on f3 would be guarding the d4 square, yes? which means black would never stick it there, because if you took it with the hypothetical knight at f3, black would have to take back with pawn on e5, and would have doubled his pawns.

As it stands, you have got to move the queen AGAIN, which means your pieces, which need to be developed, continue to sit on their home squares--the N at g1, the N at b1, the B c1."
11,Qd1,f3d1,r1bqkb1r/pppp1p1p/5np1/4p3/2BnP3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 6,"Okay, good enough, our queen is now back at d1. Now granted, the Queen sortie may have weakened Black's position a little by forcing the pawn move g6, BUT what has that cost you? Three moves. Qh4, Qf3, Qd1. 

There are time controls in chess, but internally, time in chess is measured in moves. The fewer moves it takes you to accomplish your goal, the better. Why, because you get more pieces developed faster than the other guy. You would never consider taking your bishop and moving it back and forth between c1 and g5, would you? Course not. But you are doing something like that here with your queen."

dropped a piece. This may simply be
carelessness due to your game load, but I can't
overemphasize how easy it makes it for your
opponent when you give up material.
Black's plan is simple, from here out--trade off
pieces and exploit the advantage of the extra
knight in the end game. Almost a sure win for
black from here on out, with accurate, careful
play."
