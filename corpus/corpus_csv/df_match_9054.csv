1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"Hi everyone, I have another two games to annotate against a 1900  rated player called grundnorm.  In both games he pushed his queenside pawns up the board and I was never in the games?  So, what went wrong, maybe you the jury can help here.  This game starts as a Reti Opening."
