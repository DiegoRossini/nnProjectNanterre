1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This, and the next game, also against sarapitolas are included for an unusual reason. In this game I was a pawn up, and in the other game I was a pawn down. I offered a draw in both games, and he accepted. What I want you to do is to work out who had the better deal and why? Your comments would be welcome!"
