1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

While contemplating playing in Master Freddy's Traxler Tournament and dropping 40 something rating points on Black Friday I feel in need of some dire inspiration so that when I do join the tournament I put up a jolly good show especially as Coach Ion is also playing in it.  I recalled my second ever game - an unrated game - with my buddy Dmaestro from the Coaching Club shortly after I went through The Big Slump.  In the middle game I was down a piece for a pawn and looked out.  But somehow things did not quite work out like that.  Ah well, dmaestro gives me the Lion Variation of the Philidor's Defense.  The Lion Variation can also arise out of the Pirc."
