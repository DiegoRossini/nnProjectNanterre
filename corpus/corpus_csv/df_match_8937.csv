While White plays on the queenside, Black tries to attack the king`s flank after playing f5. I used to play this as Black for some time, but was not really glad with the outcome. Perhaps I should try it again, I am still looking for a good defence against d4..."

It fits to Black`s plan, he can play f5 now, but I think he should have developed at least one more piece, played Nbd7 or 6...a5 7...Na6, planning to go to b4 and slowing down White`s attack."

I played b6 because I saw that his pieces don`t really have any good squares any more, but it closes the Queenside, which means I can`t really attack here anymore. So the game will move to the king`s flank, and who plays on the king`s flank in the King`s Indian Defense? Black. I think 16.a4 was better, since he can`t take on b5 (16...cxb5 17.axb5 and I can either attack a5 or just hope to create a free pawn. And, of course, 16.Qd2 was good, although after 16...Kh7 Rad1 he could play Nd5."

So bad, in fact, that I thought he could not really harm me any more and decided I had time. A terribly bad mistake, actually."

But I think I should have played 18.Nxd5, because my pieces still are better and I would have got either the free pawn or could have tried to create one on the b-file."
36,Bf8,g7f8,r2qnbk1/1p1b1r2/1Pp1p1pp/p1PnPp2/3Q1B1P/P1N2N2/4BPP1/R3R1K1 w - - 5 19,"19.Nxd5 was much better. As far as I remember I thought I could perhaps sacrifice a piece on d5 and either play e6 or get at least a second free pawn on b6. But this won`t work, and now I will lose a tempo after taking on d5. Therefore, Bd3 was probably better, too, because it uwould have undermined his pawn structure after Nxd5 exd5 e6 and prevents g4. If he plays cxd5 I could still try to push my pawn to b5."
