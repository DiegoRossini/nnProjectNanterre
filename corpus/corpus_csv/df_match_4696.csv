5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/2p5/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,Normally I would have played Bg7 before Nc6 so this move is interesting.
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/2p5/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,Normally I would have played Bg7 before Nc6 so this move is interesting.

9,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/1Bp5/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 5 5,"I decided to put the question to the bishop, is he willing to give it up and give me the bishop pair, the semi open b file and a nice centre? if not then this move still prepares the queen side storm that I tend to play for with these set ups. and I would normally play this move anyway so the bishop to move is a bonus."
10,a6,a7a6,r1bqk1nr/1p1pppbp/p1n3p1/1Bp5/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 6,"I decided to put the question to the bishop, is he willing to give it up and give me the bishop pair, the semi open b file and a nice centre? if not then this move still prepares the queen side storm that I tend to play for with these set ups. and I would normally play this move anyway so the bishop to move is a bonus."

12,b5,b7b5,r1bqk1nr/3pppbp/p1n3p1/1pp5/B3P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,So a storm it is.

14,d6,d7d6,r1bqk1nr/4ppbp/p1np2p1/1pp5/4P3/2P2N2/PPBP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,I had left this knight untill now because I didn't want to block my DSB diagonal. However it needs to be developed and I didn't want to play e6 untill I was sure where my LSB belonged.

28,e6,e7e6,r1b2rk1/3n1pbp/1qnpp1p1/p1p5/1p2P3/2PPNN1P/PPBB1PP1/R2QR1K1 w - - 0 15,covers d5

Namely the fact that against stronger opponents I can use a draw as a threat plus a draw becomes a good result. This move was designed to iniate mass trades and if I get doubled pawns on the e file I will play f5.

I thought I could win a pawn by taking d4 with my bishop but I overlooked the fact that after Qxd4 there would be a mate threat on g7.
