1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,White opens with the Queen's pawn opening. My favorite with White as well
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I'm a strict believer that 1...d5 is better than the popular 1...Nf6
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Queen's Gambit. The most logical following of the first move
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Queen's gambit declined. I like playing this from both sides
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,It probably isn't best to lock the bishop in this position as it belongs on g5.
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,It probably isn't best to lock the bishop in this position as it belongs on g5.
7,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,It probably isn't best to lock the bishop in this position as it belongs on g5.
8,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/1bPP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,Black pins the Knight. I felt that I don't need to stick my bishop on e7 as White has no intentions of placing the Bishop on g5.
9,Bd2,c1d2,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/1bPP4/2N1P3/PP1B1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 2 5,Only place for the Bishop
10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/1bPP4/2N1P3/PP1B1PPP/R2QKBNR w KQ - 3 6,I like to Fianchetto the Bishop in the QGD.
11,Nf3,g1f3,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/1bPP4/2N1PN2/PP1B1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 4 6,I like to Fianchetto the Bishop in the QGD.
12,b6,b7b6,rnbq1rk1/p1p2ppp/1p2pn2/3p4/1bPP4/2N1PN2/PP1B1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 7,I like to Fianchetto the Bishop in the QGD.

14,Bb7,c8b7,rn1q1rk1/pbp2ppp/1p2pn2/3p4/1bPP4/2N1PN2/PP1BBPPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 2 8,? The Knight can certainly be placed on d7 but not in this situation
15,O-O,e1g1,rn1q1rk1/pbp2ppp/1p2pn2/3p4/1bPP4/2N1PN2/PP1BBPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 3 8,? The Knight can certainly be placed on d7 but not in this situation

17,Qc2,d1c2,r2q1rk1/pbpn1ppp/1p2pn2/3p4/1bPP4/2N1PN2/PPQBBPPP/R4RK1 b - - 5 9,? A mistake in return. White misses 9. Nxd5! 9...Nxd5 is forced (9...Bxd2 10. Nxf6+ followed by 11. Qxd2) 10. cxd5 Bxd2 11.dxe6 Bxe3 12. exf7+ Rxf7 13. fxe3 wins a pawn
