1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I am annotating for my dear friend Elena, in a game she had with another lady player. (Please note - so if you comment,please refer to her bishop, not his bishop etc.)"
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,So it starts conventionally enough
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,A Sicilian Defence!
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"This is very common, normally leading to a Najdorf or Dragon variation"
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,This is normal
6,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/3PP1b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,"But this isn't! Simply taking the pawn is usual. Bg4 is not in the Gameknot ""World"" database, but it is in the database of Gameknot games. Post Match Computer Analysis (PMCA) gives this as a mistake, and I think quite rightly so."
7,dxc5,d4c5,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2P5/4P1b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"So White takes. If Black takes back, White exchanges queens, Nf3 goes to e5, hitting Bg4 and f7 and White already has an advantage. So Black avoids this."
8,Qa5+,d8a5,rn2kbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/q1P5/4P1b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,White throws in a check

11,Bb5+,f1b5,rn2kbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/1Bq5/4P1b1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"White throws in a check, but I prefer simply Be3 or Be2"
12,Nc6,b8c6,r3kbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/1Bq5/4P1b1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 7,Black blocks
13,O-O,e1g1,r3kbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/1Bq5/4P1b1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 3 7,White castles
14,a6,a7a6,r3kbnr/1p2pppp/p1np4/1Bq5/4P1b1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,Black puts the question to the White bishop
15,Ba4,b5a4,r3kbnr/1p2pppp/p1np4/2q5/B3P1b1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 8,White retreats and we are now out of the opening databases
16,Nf6,g8f6,r3kb1r/1p2pppp/p1np1n2/2q5/B3P1b1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 9,Black develops

18,Bxf3,g4f3,r3kb1r/1p2pppp/p1np1n2/2q5/B3P3/2NQ1b2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 0 10,"This exchanges is a mistake, as in open positions like this, the Bishops are worth much more than the Knights"
19,Qxf3,d3f3,r3kb1r/1p2pppp/p1np1n2/2q5/B3P3/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 0 10,White takes back
20,h6,h7h6,r3kb1r/1p2ppp1/p1np1n1p/2q5/B3P3/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 0 11,"This is not given as a mistake by PMCA, but to my mind it is just a waste of a move. Black should be trying to develop his Bf8 to play Bg7 followed by 0-0"
