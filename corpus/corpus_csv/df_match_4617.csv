1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,The game was long and hard it started at 8:00pm and didn't finish untill 12:30am! 4 and a half hours finishing after midnight. It was a very hard fought game. The game was quite unusual from start to finish where I went with some odd looking lines coming from the GPA. it seemed that I was looking at a good position when suddenly my opponent found a nice defence and it looked like I was destined to be slaughtered as I probably should have been in the position. How ever with some mistakes from my opponent I managed to get into a rook pawn end game where a nice little move seems to have secured the draw!

5,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/1Bp5/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 3,retreating the bishop to a4 would get it trapped and moving it back would be a waste of tempo.

12,e6,e7e6,r1bqkbnr/5ppp/p1p1p3/2ppP3/5P2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 7,I suspect this may have been an inaccuracy as d3 would prevent black from pushing his c pawn.
13,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/5ppp/p1p1p3/2ppP3/5P2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,I suspect this may have been an inaccuracy as d3 would prevent black from pushing his c pawn.

15,d3,d2d3,r1bqk1nr/4bppp/p1p1p3/2ppP3/5P2/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,I spent a bit of time here trying to work out weather I should do this or not. I had wanted to actually not castle at all and instead go for some aggresive pawn thrusts however I couldn't get around black playing Bh4+
16,Nh6,g8h6,r1bqk2r/4bppp/p1p1p2n/2ppP3/5P2/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 9,I spent a bit of time here trying to work out weather I should do this or not. I had wanted to actually not castle at all and instead go for some aggresive pawn thrusts however I couldn't get around black playing Bh4+

18,Nf5,h6f5,r1bqk2r/4bppp/p1p1p3/2ppPn2/5P2/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 3 10,?! a rather dubious move. It was meant to be a rook lift however I suspect it is a little early for that.
19,Ne1,f3e1,r1bqk2r/4bppp/p1p1p3/2ppPn2/5P2/2NP4/PPP3PP/R1BQNRK1 b kq - 4 10,?! a rather dubious move. It was meant to be a rook lift however I suspect it is a little early for that.
20,h5,h7h5,r1bqk2r/4bpp1/p1p1p3/2ppPn1p/5P2/2NP4/PPP3PP/R1BQNRK1 w kq - 0 11,And making my last move look even more silly I change plan straight away. This move intends to make a target out of the c5 pawn. Black can't save it if I play Na4 and Ba3. Well not without using either his rook or bishop.
21,b3,b2b3,r1bqk2r/4bpp1/p1p1p3/2ppPn1p/5P2/1PNP4/P1P3PP/R1BQNRK1 b kq - 0 11,And making my last move look even more silly I change plan straight away. This move intends to make a target out of the c5 pawn. Black can't save it if I play Na4 and Ba3. Well not without using either his rook or bishop.

23,Na4,c3a4,r1bqk2r/4bpp1/2p1p3/p1ppPn1p/N4P2/1P1P4/P1P3PP/R1BQNRK1 b kq - 1 12,I can't play Ba3 yet because of the fork at e3.

25,Rf3,f1f3,r2qk2r/4bpp1/b1p1p3/p1ppPn1p/N4P2/1P1P1R2/P1P3PP/R1BQN1K1 b kq - 3 13,I can't play Ba3 yet because of the fork at e3.
26,Bb5,a6b5,r2qk2r/4bpp1/2p1p3/pbppPn1p/N4P2/1P1P1R2/P1P3PP/R1BQN1K1 w kq - 4 14,Unfortunalty it also means I dont have the time to make my attack on the pawn.
27,Nc3,a4c3,r2qk2r/4bpp1/2p1p3/pbppPn1p/5P2/1PNP1R2/P1P3PP/R1BQN1K1 b kq - 5 14,Prepares a discovered check.
28,Qb6,d8b6,r3k2r/4bpp1/1qp1p3/pbppPn1p/5P2/1PNP1R2/P1P3PP/R1BQN1K1 w kq - 6 15,Prepares a discovered check.

30,h4,h5h4,r3k2r/4bpp1/1qp1p3/pbppPn2/5P1p/1PNP3R/P1P3PP/R1BQN1K1 w kq - 0 16,of course black cannot take e.p because of the pin on his h8 rook.
31,g4,g2g4,r3k2r/4bpp1/1qp1p3/pbppPn2/5PPp/1PNP3R/P1P4P/R1BQN1K1 b kq g3 0 16,of course black cannot take e.p because of the pin on his h8 rook.
32,Nd4,f5d4,r3k2r/4bpp1/1qp1p3/pbppP3/3n1PPp/1PNP3R/P1P4P/R1BQN1K1 w kq - 1 17,? I really think this move was a mistke. as now the knight is effectvly trapped in the middle of the board. I'm not sure what I would have done if black had played 16...Nh6. It has already been a messy sort of game.
33,Be3,c1e3,r3k2r/4bpp1/1qp1p3/pbppP3/3n1PPp/1PNPB2R/P1P4P/R2QN1K1 b kq - 2 17,stops him pushing is c pawn if it were on his mind as well as targets the c pawn.
34,Ba6,b5a6,r3k2r/4bpp1/bqp1p3/p1ppP3/3n1PPp/1PNPB2R/P1P4P/R2QN1K1 w kq - 3 18,"making an escape route for his knight since Nb1, c3 would trap it."
35,Na4,c3a4,r3k2r/4bpp1/bqp1p3/p1ppP3/N2n1PPp/1P1PB2R/P1P4P/R2QN1K1 b kq - 4 18,"I very much wanted to play a4 here covering the knights only escpe square however I couldn't see a way around the fact that if I got my knight out of the way the c3 would be useless on account of Nxb3 forking queen and rook. So I went with this which is still a very good move, It was here or the last move where I worked out I could win atleast a pawn."
36,Qa7,b6a7,r3k2r/q3bpp1/b1p1p3/p1ppP3/N2n1PPp/1P1PB2R/P1P4P/R2QN1K1 w kq - 5 19,! I thought this would win the knight however my opponent after quite a bit of thinking came up with a soloution.
37,Qd2,d1d2,r3k2r/q3bpp1/b1p1p3/p1ppP3/N2n1PPp/1P1PB2R/P1PQ3P/R3N1K1 b kq - 6 19,! I thought this would win the knight however my opponent after quite a bit of thinking came up with a soloution.
38,Bb5,a6b5,r3k2r/q3bpp1/2p1p3/pbppP3/N2n1PPp/1P1PB2R/P1PQ3P/R3N1K1 w kq - 7 20,! I thought this would win the knight however my opponent after quite a bit of thinking came up with a soloution.
39,Nb2,a4b2,r3k2r/q3bpp1/2p1p3/pbppP3/3n1PPp/1P1PB2R/PNPQ3P/R3N1K1 b kq - 8 20,! I thought this would win the knight however my opponent after quite a bit of thinking came up with a soloution.
40,a4,a5a4,r3k2r/q3bpp1/2p1p3/1bppP3/p2n1PPp/1P1PB2R/PNPQ3P/R3N1K1 w kq - 0 21,! now I can no longer win a piece. however I can easily win a pawn if I choose. But this is I think still the best move in this position.
