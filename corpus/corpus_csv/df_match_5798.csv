1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I wanted to play aggressively, so I try to introduce imbalances early, here on the second move.  White is prepared to play e3 if d/c."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I wanted to play aggressively, so I try to introduce imbalances early, here on the second move.  White is prepared to play e3 if d/c."

4,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"An extremely vigorous reply.  This looks like a gambit of some kind, and I would be really interested to know the name of this opening."
5,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/2PP4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,I am not sure if this is the correct move and would like to know.
6,dxc4,d5c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4p3/2pP4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"I may be wrong, but ..e/d looked better to me."
7,d5,d4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3Pp3/2p5/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"D5 really ups the ante, now that white is gambiting a pawn.  I just wanted to keep the position as fluid and complicated as possible.  Sometimes, as here, I play a move that looks intuitively good to me, without a lot of calculation.  I am pretty sure black can undermine and win the d pawn, but on the other hand the pawn, while it remains, is pretty annoying from black's perspective.  An early advanced pawn can be distracting and could hinder black's development."
8,Bb4+,f8b4,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/3Pp3/1bp5/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"So black is immediately giving up his dark-squared bishop.  I wonder about this move, though.  It is going to be an open board, and maybe white will play e4 followed by be3."
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/3Pp3/1bp5/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 5,"So black is immediately giving up his dark-squared bishop.  I wonder about this move, though.  It is going to be an open board, and maybe white will play e4 followed by be3."

11,bxc3,b2c3,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/3Pp3/2p5/2P1P3/P4PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,"He elects to defend c4, and I am able to defend d5."

14,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqk2r/p1p2ppp/5n2/1p1Pp3/2p1P3/2P5/P4PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 8,It looks like be3 would also be good here.
15,f3,f2f3,rnbqk2r/p1p2ppp/5n2/1p1Pp3/2p1P3/2P2P2/P5PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 8,It looks like be3 would also be good here.

19,Ne2,g1e2,rnbq1rk1/p1p2pp1/5n1p/1p1Pp3/2p1P3/2P1BP2/P3N1PP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 1 10,Preparing to play Ng3 and be2.
20,Qe7,d8e7,rnb2rk1/p1p1qpp1/5n1p/1p1Pp3/2p1P3/2P1BP2/P3N1PP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 2 11,I don't think this move makes it as unpleasant for white as nd7 and f5 would be.  I think the only idea is to threaten c3 after qa3.
21,Ng3,e2g3,rnb2rk1/p1p1qpp1/5n1p/1p1Pp3/2p1P3/2P1BPN1/P5PP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 3 11,"Inviting qa3, if that was the intent, and vacating e2 for the bishop."
22,b4,b5b4,rnb2rk1/p1p1qpp1/5n1p/3Pp3/1pp1P3/2P1BPN1/P5PP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 12,"This move is certainly distracting and causes me to take time away from solving my castling problem, but I don't think it guarantees any major advantages."
23,Qc2,d1c2,rnb2rk1/p1p1qpp1/5n1p/3Pp3/1pp1P3/2P1BPN1/P1Q3PP/R3KB1R b KQ - 1 12,"Again, I am not sure about black's play here.  Let me know what you think.  I guess the idea is to threaten nc5 or nb4, but after nb4 the knight is still going to be defended by the queen alone, and maybe it will be a liability."
24,Na6,b8a6,r1b2rk1/p1p1qpp1/n4n1p/3Pp3/1pp1P3/2P1BPN1/P1Q3PP/R3KB1R w KQ - 2 13,"Again, I am not sure about black's play here.  Let me know what you think.

31,Nf5,g3f5,r4rk1/p2bqpp1/B1p2n1p/3PpN2/4P3/2p1BP2/P1Q3PP/R4RK1 b - - 1 16,I think this move may not have been that great.  Maybe I should do something about the loose bishop on a6.

33,exf5,e4f5,r4rk1/p3qpp1/B1p2n1p/3PpP2/8/2p1BP2/P1Q3PP/R4RK1 b - - 0 17,I think black is playing very solidly here.  He is only a pawn down here.
34,Nxd5,f6d5,r4rk1/p3qpp1/B1p4p/3npP2/8/2p1BP2/P1Q3PP/R4RK1 w - - 0 18,I think black is playing very solidly here.  He is only a pawn down here.
35,Bf2,e3f2,r4rk1/p3qpp1/B1p4p/3npP2/8/2p2P2/P1Q2BPP/R4RK1 b - - 1 18,I think the idea here was to keep the bishop for bg3.
