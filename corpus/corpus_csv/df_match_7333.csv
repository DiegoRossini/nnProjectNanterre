1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Napoleon's Opening.  Already a departure from more  'usual' developments, this move has serious drawbacks for the sake of obtaining early pressure against f7.  Of course, my opponent might have been hoping that I didn't know how to deal with such a line.  The problem is that the attack it foreshadows is too easily thwarted (see Black's reply), whilst at the same time the Q takes from the King's knight its most 'natural' square for development."

4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 2 3,"Consistent, and White might have hopes of renewing the attack against f7 by bringing his Q behind it at b3."
5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 3 3,"Consistent, and White might have hopes of renewing the attack against f7 by bringing his Q behind it at b3."
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 4 4,"Threatens to come in at d4, but also has an eye on a5 if White does try Qb3 at some point.  The main purpose of this move, though, is to develop quickly."
7,c3,c2c3,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/2P2Q2/PP1P1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 0 4,"Some good thinking here: White wants to dominate in the centre.  At the same time, the move cuts across Black's threat to play 4...Nd4.  Remember that if there is a useful tactic, then moving the same piece twice in the opening may be justified.  White felt the threat from a knight reaching d4 (striking at the Q at f3 and the c2-square) serious enough to require preventative measures.  The drawback is that now neither of White's knights can reach their most 'natural' squares.  Not a fatal drawback, but it will make life a little harder, all the same.  Better was 4.Ne2."
8,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/2P2Q2/PP1P1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 1 5,"More ambitious than 4...Be7, and Black certainly does not want to block in his d-pawn with 4...Bd6?  This move prevents White's d-pawn reaching d4 for the moment.  Its secondary purpose was to clear the way for a King-side castle.  The drawback - though a minor one - is that it offers White a target."
9,b4,b2b4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/1PB1P3/2P2Q2/P2P1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 0 5,"Striking at the bishop.  Not bad, though it doesn't do a whole lot for White's development.  A good alternative was 5.d3, freeing up all the undeveloped pieces.  Not so good would have been 5.d4? exd4 6.cxd4 Nxd4, menacing f3 and c2."
10,Bb6,c5b6,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/1bn2n2/4p3/1PB1P3/2P2Q2/P2P1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 1 6,"Staying on the diagonal that strikes at f2.  Black had perforce move this piece a second time, or lose it."
11,b5,b4b5,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/1bn2n2/1P2p3/2B1P3/2P2Q2/P2P1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 0 6,"(?!) Not so good, even though Black has to move a second piece a second time.  Although this costs Black time, White is not profiting very much thereby.  True, White gains some space on the Q-side, but his pawn formation becomes a bit ragged in the process, and his pieces are still at home."
12,Na5,c6a5,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/1b3n2/nP2p3/2B1P3/2P2Q2/P2P1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 1 7,"(!?) OK - not necessarily the best.  Black had good alternatives in 6...Ne7 or 6...d5!  The problem with the text move (i.e. the move played) is that if the bishop retreats to e2, this knight is left rather out on a limb.  Of course, such a loss of time by the bishop doesn't make this an attractive proposition for White."
13,Na3,b1a3,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/1b3n2/nP2p3/2B1P3/N1P2Q2/P2P1PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 2 7,"Not bad: preparing to retake on c4, developing the knight with a gain in time.  Although Black didn't really have make this concession, he decided that on balance, to rid himself of his 'off-side' knight it was worth giving White something.  Black will retain a small lead in development."
14,Nxc4,a5c4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/1b3n2/1P2p3/2n1P3/N1P2Q2/P2P1PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 0 8,"Maybe 7...0-0 was better, really..."

16,d6,d7d6,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/1b1p1n2/1P2p3/2N1P3/2P2Q2/P2P1PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 0 9,"Freeing the c8-bishop for development.  Black is not very concerned that White might take on b6.  The double pawn is no serious inconvenience at all, yet the open a-file might come in useful."

18,Bg4,c8g4,r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/1b1p1n2/1P2p3/2N1P1b1/2PP1Q2/P4PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 1 10,"(!) Developing, with gain in tempo.  White's Q has just one square available."

20,Be6,g4e6,r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/1b1pbn2/1P2p3/2N1P3/2PP2Q1/P4PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 3 11,"(!?) A deliberate invitation to White to take the g-pawn.  At the same time, Black threatens to take the c4-knight, and then win a pawn (11...Bxc4 12.dxc4 Nxe4).  Better, however, was simply to castle."
21,Qxg7,g3g7,r2qk2r/ppp2pQp/1b1pbn2/1P2p3/2N1P3/2PP4/P4PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 0 11,"(?) What Black was hoping for.  Much better would have been first to take on b6: 11.Nxb6! axb6 12.Qxg7!? (Now it's OK!) 12...Rg8 13.Qh6 Rg6 14.Qh4 (Qd2 is also OK) 14...Nd7 15.Qxd8 Kxd8 with a reasonable game for White.  Although from Black's point of view this would have been something of a concession, in creating the chance for White to go wrong, the risk was not such as to compromise his whole game.  If White went wrong, Black got a large advantage; if White played correctly, at worst Black got a roughly even game."
22,Bxf2+,b6f2,r2qk2r/ppp2pQp/3pbn2/1P2p3/2N1P3/2PP4/P4bPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 0 12,(!) Now inviting White to help himself to the bishop as well!
23,Kxf2,e1f2,r2qk2r/ppp2pQp/3pbn2/1P2p3/2N1P3/2PP4/P4KPP/R1B3NR b kq - 0 12,"During the game, I thought maybe White ought to leave the bishop alone in view of what follows.  But after 12.Kf1 Rg8 13.Qh6 Rg6 14.Qd2 Bxc4 15.dxc4 Bxg1 Black obtains a strong attack anyway.  It seems for that the slight risk Black took in playing 10...Be6, he has reaped a larger dividend than expected!"
24,Rg8,h8g8,r2qk1r1/ppp2pQp/3pbn2/1P2p3/2N1P3/2PP4/P4KPP/R1B3NR w q - 1 13,"(!) Now Black's scheme takes shape.  He wants the Q to go to h6, whereat the knight forks K and Q at g4."
