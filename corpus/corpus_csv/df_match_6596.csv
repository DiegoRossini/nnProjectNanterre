1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone,

This is my second game with another Master buddy whose name is Jeff - the first was a bit of a disaster.  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=12471496&fb=1&rnd=0.36667961087623424.  As you could see from that analysis we played by the book for the best part of the game and when we came out of it, boy did you see those howlers on my part!  Well, in this game the improvement was that:- 1. We came out of the book on move 10.  2.  Computer Analysis only flagged up two of my moves as an innaccuracy and a mistake respectively.  The innaccuracy was on Move 14 and the mistake was on move 43, the move before I waved the white flag.  3.  The game lasted longer, so I suppose it was better.  I started off with a 3 knights opening, i.e. a double king pawn opening with 3 of the knights emerging."
