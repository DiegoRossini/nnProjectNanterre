1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This was my worst game so far.  White easily developes and keeps his king safe while black concentrates on a futile effort to develop his dark squared bishop ignoring king safety.

He can easily protect his e4 knight with d3! developing his dark squared bishop.  Instead he moves Ne4xc5 then after i move he can move Bf3 pinning my Queen to my King.
