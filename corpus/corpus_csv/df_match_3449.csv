1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hey all! This is the second game from this terrific league match. This time, I hold the White pieces, and very quickly offer an ill-conceived sacrifice. I try to cover my tracks by throwing more material at the problem in a desperate bid to expose the Black King before I run out of forces. Enjoy!"

This is where, as White, I decided to make a big, unsound sacrifice, but really the choice isn't made until next move.

The first is the simple one; 10.Bxe7 Qxe7 11.dxe5 and once White castles he should be in good shape, though he'll still probably have a tough time holding the e-pawn. The other line is much sharper and rather unclear: 10.dxe5?!! Qxd2+ 11.Kxd2?! Nec6 (say) 12.Bf6 and White has far better development, offset by his awkwardly-centralized King. White should be able to pick up the d-file soon because of Black's queenside lack of development, and may be able to use his greater activity to transition into a strong endgame. While this isn't the way the game went, I'd be very interested to see how that line would have played out!"

White's problems are the pawns on c4 and f5, preventing this Bishop from getting into the action. His other thorn is the nasty Nd4, ready to leap into action with a killer fork on f3 if given the chance and bottling up White's pieces with its mere presence. I'm loathe to exchange while a full piece behind, this move is the best option I found for White--if Black leaves the Bishop alone, White can renew his attack with a check on h5. If Black takes it, the Knight is gone and the Queen will move to a much more useful location on e2. Essentially, this is throwing another piece at the problem to hope it goes away, but at least it's a relatively weak piece compared to Black's strong Knight."

This feels like a perfectly reasonable, rational move, but in fact this inaccuracy tosses the game, or at least lets White recover with advantage.

The critical factor is White's Bishop, prepared to jump to either g5 or c5 at a moment's notice, so that after 23.Qh5+, Black's only response must be 23...Ke6, whereupon White can pick up at least the Bishop at his leisure. Other King moves all lose instantly to the powerful White Bishop: 23...Kf6 or 23...Ke7 are met with 24.Bg5+, skewering through to win at least the Queen, and 23...Kf8 fares no better, as 24.Bc5+ forces Black to give up his Queen to prevent mate."
