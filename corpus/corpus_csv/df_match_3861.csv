1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,The English opening.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Black chooses a reversed-Sicilian, which suits me fine, and frequently (in my experience) leads to very sharp play--perfect for blitz chess."
3,g3,g2g3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/6P1/PP1PPP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,My preferred continuation. 2. Nc3 is perfectly playable here as well.
4,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2p5/4p3/2P5/6P1/PP1PPP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"This move has the potential to transition many different ways. Most importantly to me, it indicates that Black plans to seriously contest control of d5."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2p5/4p3/2P5/2N3P1/PP1PPP1P/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"Other popular moves here are 3. b3, 3. d4, 3. Nf3 and 3. Bg2. I chose the text move to show a confrontational stance--I'm not giving Black d5 without a fight."
6,b6,b7b6,rnbqkbnr/p2p1ppp/1pp5/4p3/2P5/2N3P1/PP1PPP1P/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Planning to fianchetto the Bishop, to compete with me along the a8-h1 diagonal. I haven't seen any theory supporting this move, but I don't necessarily dislike it."
7,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqkbnr/p2p1ppp/1pp5/4p3/2P5/2N3P1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 4,"We both continue our development, and I begin to prepare for an eventual d4."

10,d6,d7d6,rn1qkbnr/pb3ppp/1ppp4/4p3/2P5/2N2NP1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"This is about the only way to shore up e5, so Black's ...d5 push will have to wait."
11,b3,b2b3,rn1qkbnr/pb3ppp/1ppp4/4p3/2P5/1PN2NP1/P2PPPBP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"I feel like e5 is weak, so I get ready to pressure it and support my coming advance to d4."
12,Nf6,g8f6,rn1qkb1r/pb3ppp/1ppp1n2/4p3/2P5/1PN2NP1/P2PPPBP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 7,"Black needs to catch up in development, so this is logical. 6...Nd7 would be fine as well, I think."
13,Bb2,c1b2,rn1qkb1r/pb3ppp/1ppp1n2/4p3/2P5/1PN2NP1/PB1PPPBP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 2 7,"Preparing to castle. This is the best spot for that Bishop at the moment, since Black's d-pawn can't get out of the way just yet."

20,c5,c6c5,rn1qk2r/pb2bppp/1p3n2/2pp2N1/2PPp3/1PN2PP1/PB2P1BP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 11,! Lending the Bishop's support to e4 and increasing the tension in the center. He wants to complicate the situation so I'll make a misstep--the same general idea that I favor in blitz games. Things are about to get really hairy; one wrong move on either side could spell disaster.

I'm also starting to think about sacrificing my Knight on f7 if Black doesn't castle soon, in order to attract the Black King into the path of my Rook."
22,h6,h7h6,rn1qk2r/pb2bpp1/1p3n1p/2pp2N1/2PPp3/1PN2PP1/PB2P1BP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 12,"Black tries to kick my Knight back to a dismal post at h3, giving him a clear advantage in the center and the initiative."
23,Nxf7,g5f7,rn1qk2r/pb2bNp1/1p3n1p/2pp4/2PPp3/1PN2PP1/PB2P1BP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 12,I think I can get compensation for the Knight. I have a slight developmental advantage and 12...Kxf7 13. fxe4 dxe4 14. Nxe4 Rf8 15. d5 Kg8 looks promising.
