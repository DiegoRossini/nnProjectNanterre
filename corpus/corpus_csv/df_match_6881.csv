23,Bxd3,e2d3,r3kb1r/pppn1ppp/8/8/2p5/2NBP3/PP3PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 0 12,It's not typically a good thing when one's opponent has advanced a passed pawn to the 6th rank by move 12.

30,Be7,f8e7,2kr3r/ppp1bppp/1n6/8/8/1PNpP3/P2B1PPP/R4RK1 w - - 1 16,I wasn't sure what else to do so I developed the plan to try and open up the King's defenses.

34,Bxc3,f6c3,2kr3r/ppp2ppp/1n6/8/P7/1PbpP3/3B1PPP/2R2RK1 w - - 0 18,This seemed like a mistake by Black.  It's a wide open board and he traded his B for my N--not to mention that it brings White's Rook a bit closer to Black's King.
35,Rxc3,c1c3,2kr3r/ppp2ppp/1n6/8/P7/1PRpP3/3B1PPP/5RK1 b - - 0 18,"I wanted to keep the N from centralizing but this was silly on my part because if White moved Nd5, then Rxd3.  This move also opened a diagonal for White the Bishop."
