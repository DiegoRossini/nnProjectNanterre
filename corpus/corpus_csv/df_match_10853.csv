1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Here is a recent league game I just completed. With the black pieces, I foolishly isolate my king with very little cover - throwing all of my resources towards a queenside attack. My opponent punishes me severely for this, and ultimately threatens mate in quick order. As I joked with him during the game, I was prepared to throw everything - including the kitchen sink:) - into an effort for a draw! Lo and behold it worked! This game reinforced an old chess adage to me, which is NEVER GIVE UP! Here we go.....my opponent opens with the very standard and solid 1.e4."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"OK - no more jokes about me playing the Scandi. For those that know me, this is no surprise. I think my good friend blackbaron could write the scouting report on me - he has seen it enough:) My opponent in this game, vegiemite, handles my attempt to rip open the center quite well by playing...."
3,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3pP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"2.e5 - declining the ""gambit"" pawn and the dangers associated with it. In this version, white pushes e5 and plans for a BIG center."
4,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2ppP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,The logical reply. Black clamps down on the d4 square and clears space on c6 for roomy development of his Nb8.
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2ppP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"White claims the big center, which makes sense. The danger here for white, however, is the possibility of black having two center pawns should exchanges occur - not deadly for him, but tricky to manage if not played correctly."
6,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3pP3/3p4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Black attempts to claim the central pawn advantage - albeit on his own side of the board.
7,Qxd4,d1d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3pP3/3Q4/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"White obviously maintains material equality. Again, this move is somewhat dangerous as his queen is now open to a developmental attack should black respond 4...Nb6."
8,a6,a7a6,rnbqkbnr/1p2pppp/p7/3pP3/3Q4/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"! Having seen this position numerous times, black is well aware that 4...Nb6 is weak due to the vulnerability of the light colored squares. White stands better after 4...Nb6 5. Bb4, delivering a pin that is extremely strong."
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/1p2pppp/p7/3pP3/3Q4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 1 5,Interesting - a more usual response is 5. Nf3. I began to wonder if a sac on b5 was in my future......
10,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/1p3ppp/p3p3/3pP3/3Q4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"Because of paranoia brought on by the many hundreds of times I have seen this, I intentionally ""block in"" my light squared bishop and hope to exchange it as quickly as possible. I have every intention of using it in a defensive role along the a4-e8 diagonal."
11,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/1p3ppp/p3p3/3pP3/3Q1P2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 0 6,"Wow - white makes a big commitment. He intends to push hard on the kingside. I remember thinking that this move was a bit premature, perhaps, as any move that develops a piece was probably stronger."
12,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/1p3ppp/p1n1p3/3pP3/3Q1P2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 1 7,"Sufficiently satisfied that any attack on the light squares could be repelled, black develops with tempo."
13,Qd3,d4d3,r1bqkbnr/1p3ppp/p1n1p3/3pP3/5P2/2NQ4/PPP3PP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 2 7,"Not a whole lot of better alternatives here. This move does contain a latent weakness though, as it somewhat limits the scope of whites light squared bishop (which should be very powerful in this position)."
14,Bb4,f8b4,r1bqk1nr/1p3ppp/p1n1p3/3pP3/1b3P2/2NQ4/PPP3PP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 3 8,"This move accomplishes several things - it develops (with a pin), it clears a square for the Ng8 to develop to, and it hastens 0-0."
15,Bd2,c1d2,r1bqk1nr/1p3ppp/p1n1p3/3pP3/1b3P2/2NQ4/PPPB2PP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 4 8,Interposing the pin and preparing 0-0-0.
16,Nge7,g8e7,r1bqk2r/1p2nppp/p1n1p3/3pP3/1b3P2/2NQ4/PPPB2PP/R3KBNR w KQkq - 5 9,As planned.
17,O-O-O,e1c1,r1bqk2r/1p2nppp/p1n1p3/3pP3/1b3P2/2NQ4/PPPB2PP/2KR1BNR b kq - 6 9,White takes the opportunity to secure his king. Now his main objective has GOT to be kingside development.
18,Bd7,c8d7,r2qk2r/1p1bnppp/p1n1p3/3pP3/1b3P2/2NQ4/PPPB2PP/2KR1BNR w kq - 7 10,"Last piece developed. This bishop is very weak, however, and is screaming to be exchanged at the first available opportunity."
19,a3,a2a3,r2qk2r/1p1bnppp/p1n1p3/3pP3/1b3P2/P1NQ4/1PPB2PP/2KR1BNR b kq - 0 10,"?! Not too sure about this one - kingside development makes more sense. Has white changed his mind and opted for a queenside attack? or has he just weakened his castled position? I must say I was confused. In this war of psychology I am definitely being toyed with:) If you are scoring at home, award vegiemite 10 style points:)"
20,Bxc3,b4c3,r2qk2r/1p1bnppp/p1n1p3/3pP3/5P2/P1bQ4/1PPB2PP/2KR1BNR w kq - 0 11,"Thinking that white's dark squared bishop won't be too dangerous on c3 because of his pawn on e5, black takes out the Nc3.  I remember thinking that the early 6.f4 by white may have just been a feint, as a big push on the queenside would be painful for me should I eventually play 0-0 - which could be very cramped indeed. Then I started counting pawns and swearing that he started the game with more than I did! It seems that white is poised to push on EITHER side of the board, and my so called ""advantage"" of central pawns was strictly an illusion. 10 more style points to vegiemite:)!"
