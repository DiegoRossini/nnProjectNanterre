1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

In this game my opponent, William gambits a pawn early on.  I manage to hold on to my advantage for a long time in this game but alas at a price - passivitis again sets in.  I then find myself in a real tactical knot.  However, due to some very passive but defensive moves, I manage to unravel the knot and avoid losing any material except the gambit pawn.  William realised that after the trade off of knights, we would end up in a rook endgame with just our kingside pawns left.  On that understanding he offered me a draw of which I gratefully accepted.  So, how did this happen?  Well, read on ......."
