White can't recapture with the e pawn in this position without losing her f pawn. This means White will either recapture with her c pawn or her knight. Taking the pawn with the knight seems a bad idea, as there will be 1 less defender of the e5 square, an important square in this opening. Taking with the c pawn allows some shenanigans on the Queenside from Black."

Now that that the mating threats are off, White's bishop is off the a6-f1 diagonal and my knight no longer blocks my bishop, I can play 18.Bb5!, attacking the rook. That rook is currently the only piece defending the c1 bishop form my rook, so it cant move off the first rank."
37,Re1,f1e1,2rq1rk1/pp2npnp/4p1p1/1b1pP1P1/5P1Q/P3P3/1P1N3P/RBB1R1K1 b - - 4 19,"A mistake would be 19.Rf3 (Sacrificing the bishop so her rook would go on h3 faster, threatening mate) Rxc1+ 20.Kg2 Nef5 21.Bxe5 (Discovered attack on the rook) fails to Nxf5, attacking the queen and the a1 rooks falls afterwards. 19.Re1 moves the rook away from danger and protects the e pawn, but it has lost the option to come down to h3, attacking my king. This means my king is now perfectly safe."
