1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I played the King's Gambit this game, and unlike the other game that I annotated, this one was a win for me. The usual move takes control of the center and opens lines for the bishop and queen, and typing this every game I annotate becomes more and more meaningless, so I try to truncate this every now and then."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Black replies with a classic. Truncating once again, this move refutes my center control and opens lines for his pieces."
3,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"This is the King's Gambit. Many games of this aggressive nature end fairly quickly and are rarely played out until the endgame. White sacrifices a king-side pawn in hope for a quick initiative and a rushed assault. In return, Black gets the pawn. I like the Vienna Gambit because it is generally less risky, but I decided to try out a more uncommon opening. It should be noted that at the grand master level, Black can quickly equalize by accepting the gambit and playing g5 later on if i remember correctly."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"Normally when declining the gambit, people play d5 or Bc5, and less commonly d6, but 2. ...Nc6 is a convenience for me because it typifies the Vienna Gambit."
5,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 3,"3. Nf3 is also a valid move, but I chose this because it resembles a Vienna Gambit-like position. Another possible move is 3. Bc4. 3. d3 will block the f1-bishop from attacking f7 for a while."
6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 3 4,"This move is a very strange approach to the King's Gambit. If White plays 4. fxe5, I believe that Black has a problem to deal with."
7,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 4 4,"I did not think on this move, and I decided to make a safe game. Again, 4. fxe5 seems great in this position because after the dubious 4. ...Nxe4, 5. Nxe4 Qh4+ 6. Ng3, and White is up the exchange."
8,Bb4,f8b4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/1b2PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 5 5,"This would be a great time to accept the gambit, but I am not experienced with the King's Gambit Declined, so I would not know. 4. ...d5 seems sketchy. This move attempts to remove the guard of the e-pawn, the knight."
9,d3,d2d3,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/1b2PP2/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"I quickly defend the pawn with another piece although I allow myself to get pinned. I view this as a mistake because Black can play d5 and threaten d4. Then again, the e5 pawn is undefended, and I might be able to play fxe5 to scare the knight and bring a distraction. After d4 the following move, I can play Nxd4. I render my current move as faulty because I contradict what I said earlier about keeping the bishop locked in as well."
10,Bxc3+,b4c3,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4PP2/2bP1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Personally, I would have played 5. ...d5 and see where that would have taken me. This move benefits me as it gets rid of my negative imbalance and gets rid of his stronger bishop."
11,bxc3,b2c3,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4PP2/2PP1N2/P1P3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,The only logical move was played. I intended to control the same diagonal that his bishop lost when he traded it for a bad knight the last move.
12,d6,d7d6,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4p3/4PP2/2PP1N2/P1P3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"Black reinforces the e-pawn and blocks out that aforementioned diagonal. It's still not a waste to have it, however."
13,Ba3,c1a3,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4p3/4PP2/B1PP1N2/P1P3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 7,"If Black castles now, I win a pawn using the pin I obtained the last move. After fxe5, Black will not recapture because of the pin. I feel that this move hinders Black's play."
14,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4p3/4PP2/B1PP1N2/P1P3PP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 2 8,"Well, Black castles, and I snatch a pawn. I might have captured the f-pawn and played d5 after d4. However, after the subsequent e5, Ne4 leaves the knight in an uncomfortable square."
15,fxe5,f4e5,r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4P3/4P3/B1PP1N2/P1P3PP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 8,"I chase the knight off and win a pawn, taking advantage of my pin on the pawn and rook. My next plan is to regather my pieces, castle, and further fortify the center."
16,Ng4,f6g4,r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2np4/4P3/4P1n1/B1PP1N2/P1P3PP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 1 9,"This move threatens to recapture the pawn, but it leaves the knight on a bad square if something is not done about it."
17,exd6,e5d6,r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2nP4/8/4P1n1/B1PP1N2/P1P3PP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 9,"I view this as a mistake of mine. Yes, I do retain my pawn advantage, but now My king is stuck between two semi-open files, and the respective side is weak. I should have played d4, which creates a phenomenal central pawn structure, and by that I mean unusual yet somehow strong."
18,cxd6,c7d6,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2np4/8/4P1n1/B1PP1N2/P1P3PP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 10,"The only instance move leaves the d-pawn isolated. 9. ...Ne3 would have only traded a piece, which I would have wanted."
19,Qd2,d1d2,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2np4/8/4P1n1/B1PP1N2/P1PQ2PP/R3KB1R b KQ - 1 10,"I wanted to play 10. Be2, but that would be uncomfortable for both of us after 10. ...Ne3. I might have played 10. h3 to chase off the knight and then play 11. Be2."
20,Re8,f8e8,r1bqr1k1/pp3ppp/2np4/8/4P1n1/B1PP1N2/P1PQ2PP/R3KB1R w KQ - 2 11,Black attempts to pressure my pieces and pin my pawn to my king. I might have played the same thing as this slightly ameliorates Black's position by removing the pin.
