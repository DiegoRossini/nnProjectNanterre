1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is a GK tournament game in which I choose the Latvian Gambit with the Black pieces, and White quietly declines my offer, resulting in a more positional Latvian than usual. I end up with an advanced center pawn mass, and rush to use it to knock the position open (a little prematurely) before White can coordinate a flanking attack. What results is a bit of a race as each side tears the other's pawns apart in a rush to clear a path to promotion. Enjoy!"
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"?! The key move of the controversial Latvian Gambit. Very rarely seen at high levels, Black gives up a pawn (and usually much more) for a lead in space and development."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"?! The key move of the controversial Latvian Gambit. Very rarely seen at high levels, Black gives up a pawn (and usually much more) for a lead in space and development."
4,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"?! The key move of the controversial Latvian Gambit. Very rarely seen at high levels, Black gives up a pawn (and usually much more) for a lead in space and development."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"This is a somewhat unusual way for White to decline the gambit. It tends to lead to somewhat more positional play than the main lines (3.Nxe5 or 3.Bc4), though the situation still generally gets very sharp, and can transpose to the Philidor Counter-Gambit after 3...d6 4.d4."
6,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/3p4/4pp2/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,More common are 3...Nf6 or 3...fxe4 4.Nxe5 Qf6.
7,d3,d2d3,rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/3p4/4pp2/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"This feels very passive to me; 4.d4 is perfectly playable (reaching the Philidor Counter-Gambit), but d3 blocks White's Bishop needlessly in my opinion."
8,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp4pp/3p4/2p1pp2/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"?! Black continues to blast his pawns forward, intent on restricting White's mobility at any cost and trying to seize on his perceived passivity to make a grab for the center. This move does allow White to put an untouchable Nd5 if he desires, though, which could be problematic against Black's fully-undeveloped home rank."
9,b3,b2b3,rnbqkbnr/pp4pp/3p4/2p1pp2/4P3/1PNP1N2/P1P2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"? I feel this is an error. White just trapped his LSB with the previous move, and now he spends another move preparing to fianchetto the DSB? Simple development would be stronger here, especially since that Bishop will have few prospects on b2. This move also makes c3 into a dangerous weakness."
10,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp4pp/2np4/2p1pp2/4P3/1PNP1N2/P1P2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,"Logical development, seeking further control of d4 since White is apparently worried about it."
11,a3,a2a3,r1bqkbnr/pp4pp/2np4/2p1pp2/4P3/PPNP1N2/2P2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"This prevents ...Nb4, but that doesn't seem like much of a threat at this point."
12,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp4pp/2np1n2/2p1pp2/4P3/PPNP1N2/2P2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,"? What is White doing? Again, he prevents Black from occupying slightly-inconvenient squares, but he allows his opponent to catch up in development while he wastes time with little passive pawn moves."
13,h3,h2h3,r1bqkb1r/pp4pp/2np1n2/2p1pp2/4P3/PPNP1N1P/2P2PP1/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"? What is White doing? Again, he prevents Black from occupying slightly-inconvenient squares, but he allows his opponent to catch up in development while he wastes time with little passive pawn moves."
14,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/pp2b1pp/2np1n2/2p1pp2/4P3/PPNP1N1P/2P2PP1/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,"Both sides develop logically. Black has a formidable center pawn mass, while White seems able to develop an attack on either flank."
15,Be2,f1e2,r1bqk2r/pp2b1pp/2np1n2/2p1pp2/4P3/PPNP1N1P/2P1BPP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 8,"Both sides develop logically. Black has a formidable center pawn mass, while White seems able to develop an attack on either flank."
16,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp2b1pp/2np1n2/2p1pp2/4P3/PPNP1N1P/2P1BPP1/R1BQK2R w KQ - 3 9,"Both sides develop logically. Black has a formidable center pawn mass, while White seems able to develop an attack on either flank."
17,O-O,e1g1,r1bq1rk1/pp2b1pp/2np1n2/2p1pp2/4P3/PPNP1N1P/2P1BPP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 4 9,"Both sides develop logically. Black has a formidable center pawn mass, while White seems able to develop an attack on either flank."
18,d5,d6d5,r1bq1rk1/pp2b1pp/2n2n2/2pppp2/4P3/PPNP1N1P/2P1BPP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 10,"!? Black's pawns are only delicately defended, but he wants to force White into an exchange and create a push in the center before White can mobilize his flanks."
19,exd5,e4d5,r1bq1rk1/pp2b1pp/2n2n2/2pPpp2/8/PPNP1N1P/2P1BPP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 10,Necessary to prevent ...d4 from locking his position down entirely.
20,Nxd5,f6d5,r1bq1rk1/pp2b1pp/2n5/2pnpp2/8/PPNP1N1P/2P1BPP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 11,Black releases his DSB to the kingside and targets White's vulnerable Nc3.
21,Nxd5,c3d5,r1bq1rk1/pp2b1pp/2n5/2pNpp2/8/PP1P1N1P/2P1BPP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 11,"Probably the best move, allowing Bb2 and some degree of control over the diagonal while trading off the weak Knight."
22,Qxd5,d8d5,r1b2rk1/pp2b1pp/2n5/2pqpp2/8/PP1P1N1P/2P1BPP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 12,"! Black cannot recapture, as White is threatening 13.Bc4, and White also threatens to discover an attack on the powerful but undefended Black Queen with 12...Kh8 dxe5, winning a pawn and placing a powerful wedge at e5."
23,d4,d3d4,r1b2rk1/pp2b1pp/2n5/2pqpp2/3P4/PP3N1P/2P1BPP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 12,"! Black cannot recapture, as White is threatening 13.Bc4, and White also threatens to discover an attack on the powerful but undefended Black Queen with 12...Kh8 dxe5, winning a pawn and placing a powerful wedge at e5."
24,Be6,c8e6,r4rk1/pp2b1pp/2n1b3/2pqpp2/3P4/PP3N1P/2P1BPP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 13,"Black continues his development and connects his Rooks, while just barely defending White's main threat."
25,Bc4,e2c4,r4rk1/pp2b1pp/2n1b3/2pqpp2/2BP4/PP3N1P/2P2PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 2 13,"?! This is certainly more aggressive than 13.dxe5, but not quite as strong, as White's pawn structure will now take a hit."
26,Qd6,d5d6,r4rk1/pp2b1pp/2nqb3/2p1pp2/2BP4/PP3N1P/2P2PP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 3 14,"The BQ keeps everything defended, for now."
27,dxe5,d4e5,r4rk1/pp2b1pp/2nqb3/2p1Pp2/2B5/PP3N1P/2P2PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 14,Not 14...Nxe5?? 15.Qxd6 and Black loses the LSB for nothing.
28,Qxd1,d6d1,r4rk1/pp2b1pp/2n1b3/2p1Pp2/2B5/PP3N1P/2P2PP1/R1Bq1RK1 w - - 0 15,Not 14...Nxe5?? 15.Qxd6 and Black loses the LSB for nothing.
