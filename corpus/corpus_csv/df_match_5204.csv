1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This is a game I played recently. I should have won but didn't play it right. This shows how not to win a Bishop V knight ending when you have the bishop. I hope you can learn from my mistakes. I know I have.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Interesting as although solid Phildor's defence is rarely seen at GM level because it usually leads to cramped and pasive positions for black
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Interesting as although solid Phildor's defence is rarely seen at GM level because it usually leads to cramped and pasive positions for black

8,a6,a7a6,rnbqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p2p4/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,Preparing Nc6 because if ...Nc6 Bb5 a6 Nxc6 Bxc6! wins the rook
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p2p4/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,?! Preparing another Knight development but there was no real threat because Bg5 is met with Be7

11,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/1pp2pp1/p2p3p/8/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,White has three pieces developed while black has only moved pawns
12,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/1pp2pp1/p2p1n1p/8/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 7,Finally some devlopment. Can White make is superior development turn into an attack?
13,O-O,e1g1,rnbqkb1r/1pp2pp1/p2p1n1p/8/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 3 7,Some may see it as to slow but I recently was reading an annotation and a player rated over 2200 suggested even if your opponent has played substandard moves that you should still make sure your king is safe just to get into good habits
14,Bd7,c8d7,rn1qkb1r/1ppb1pp1/p2p1n1p/8/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 4 8,I Like Be7 because it prepares O-O
15,a4,a2a4,rn1qkb1r/1ppb1pp1/p2p1n1p/8/P1BNP3/2N5/1PP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,I wanted to attack the queenside but the computer says my advantage moves from 1.27-1.05
16,Nc6,b8c6,r2qkb1r/1ppb1pp1/p1np1n1p/8/P1BNP3/2N5/1PP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 1 9,Now my advantage goes back to over 1 but I see no extra factor apart from Position and king safety.

The only risk is that His king is centralized and that may turn out to be an advantage. But if I get the d-file I keep the king from the queenside which is where the pawns will determine the victor
