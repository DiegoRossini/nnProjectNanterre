6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 4,Looks like he's setting up a simple king's indian defense.
7,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p1B1/2B1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 2 4,Again he doesn't know that I really want his knight in my pocket. I prepare to take.
