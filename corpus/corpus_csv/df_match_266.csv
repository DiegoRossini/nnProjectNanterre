1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,This was a game I won in my reti mini-tournament.   The reti opening is named after Richard Reti and he was one of the top players during 1910s and 1920s.  Born 28 May 1889  in Pezinok (Austrian-Hungarian) and died 6 June 1929.  In New York 1924 Richard Reti played a game against Raul Capablanca which he won.  This was Capablanca's only defeat in 8 years and also the first defeat since becoming world champion. https://www.chess.com/article/view/richard-rti

4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 3,"The reti opening starts with Nf3 and white is trying to control the centre without using his 2 centre pawns.   I set up the mini tournament with 1.Nf3 d5, 2. c4 and play then proceeds from there.  I went with nf6 protecting my d5 pawn.  This is a safe move but it keeps black in the centre rather than taking on c4 which would leave a weakness or an open file in the centre of the board giving access to the black king early on."
5,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/2P5/4PN2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,White moves his pawn to e3 allowing his bishop to protect the c4 pawn.
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3p4/2P5/4PN2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,Black develops his knight to c6 giving him more central control.
7,Be2,f1e2,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3p4/2P5/4PN2/PP1PBPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 4,White develops his LB to e3 and now has access to 2 diagonals and his king can castle.
8,g6,g7g6,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/2n2np1/3p4/2P5/4PN2/PP1PBPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,Black pushes his pawn to g6 to create a fianchetto.
9,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/2n2np1/3p4/2P5/4PN2/PP1PBPPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 5,White castles.
10,e5,e7e5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2p1p/2n2np1/3pp3/2P5/4PN2/PP1PBPPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 6,Black pushes his pawn to e5 and is claiming more centre space.
11,h3,h2h3,r1bqkb1r/ppp2p1p/2n2np1/3pp3/2P5/4PN1P/PP1PBPP1/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 6,White pushes a pawn to h3 to stop the f6 knight from coming to g4.
12,Bg7,f8g7,r1bqk2r/ppp2pbp/2n2np1/3pp3/2P5/4PN1P/PP1PBPP1/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 7,Black pushes his DB to g7 and now black can castle.
13,a3,a2a3,r1bqk2r/ppp2pbp/2n2np1/3pp3/2P5/P3PN1P/1P1PBPP1/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,White now pushes another pawn to a3 and so far he has only developed one piece.
14,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/ppp2pbp/2n2np1/3pp3/2P5/P3PN1P/1P1PBPP1/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 1 8,Black castles.

16,Nh5,f6h5,r1bq1rk1/ppp2pbp/2n3p1/3pp2n/1PP5/P3PN1P/3PBPP1/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 1 9,Black moves his f3 knight to h5 to allow his queen access to the diagonal to h4 thinking that white's f3 knight may come down to g5 and also ready to begin an attack. Also it allows the f7 pawn to be pushed.  Black needs to be careful as the knight has no safe squares to use on white's side of the board.
17,b5,b4b5,r1bq1rk1/ppp2pbp/2n3p1/1P1pp2n/2P5/P3PN1P/3PBPP1/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 0 9,White pushes the b pawn up to b5 and is attacking black's c6 knight.

20,f6,f7f6,r1bq1rk1/ppp1n1bp/5pp1/1P1pp2n/2P5/P3PN1P/1B1PBPP1/RN1Q1RK1 w - - 0 11,Black further fortifies the diagonal to g7 with pawn to f6.
21,Ne1,f3e1,r1bq1rk1/ppp1n1bp/5pp1/1P1pp2n/2P5/P3P2P/1B1PBPP1/RN1QNRK1 b - - 1 11,White now redirects his f3 knight to e1 as he may see that he is running short of squares to move to without being attacked.  Or he may have wanted to allow his f2 pawn to access the file.
22,Be6,c8e6,r2q1rk1/ppp1n1bp/4bpp1/1P1pp2n/2P5/P3P2P/1B1PBPP1/RN1QNRK1 w - - 2 12,Black now develops his LB to e6 and has 2 diagonals to access and is also protecting the pawn at d5 but this already has 2 protectors in the e7 knight and d8 queen.
