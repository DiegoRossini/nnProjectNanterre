1,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Most mature chess players open with a central Pawn move. The move in and of itself is not bad -- Bird's Opening is a respectable line -- but obviously, you don't expect a child to know the intricacies of offbeat chess openings."
2,b6,b7b6,rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/1p6/8/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I'm guessing that this youngster had learned about something called a ""fianchetto"" and because of its exotic name, thought it must be really cool to do. My 6-year-old son often thinks things about games are ""cool"" even when they worsen his chances, like getting sent back to Start in the game ""Sorry!"""
3,Nh3,g1h3,rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/1p6/8/5P2/7N/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Who knows what goes through a child's head? It does protect the Pawn, so in a weird way it has a logic to it."
4,Bb7,c8b7,rn1qkbnr/pbpppppp/1p6/8/5P2/7N/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"Completing the fianchetto, and probably feeling like nothing better could happen than to do so."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qkbnr/pbpppppp/1p6/8/5P2/2N4N/PPPPP1PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 3,"This one has the rudiments of the idea of development down, anyway."
6,Na6,b8a6,r2qkbnr/pbpppppp/np6/8/5P2/2N4N/PPPPP1PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 4 4,I'm assuming so as not to spoil the really cool maneuver by blocking the Bishop.
7,e4,e2e4,r2qkbnr/pbpppppp/np6/8/4PP2/2N4N/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"Hey, it is guarded by the Knight. Again, what makes sense to an adult is not necessarily what makes sense to a 5 or 6 year old. I know!"
8,f6,f7f6,r2qkbnr/pbppp1pp/np3p2/8/4PP2/2N4N/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,Preparing to attack the White KBP.
9,Bc4,f1c4,r2qkbnr/pbppp1pp/np3p2/8/2B1PP2/2N4N/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,Preparing to castle. Presumably the child's instructor had said something about the importance of castling.
10,e5,e7e5,r2qkbnr/pbpp2pp/np3p2/4p3/2B1PP2/2N4N/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,Following up...
11,O-O,e1g1,r2qkbnr/pbpp2pp/np3p2/4p3/2B1PP2/2N4N/PPPP2PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 6,...and doing likewise.
12,Nc5,a6c5,r2qkbnr/pbpp2pp/1p3p2/2n1p3/2B1PP2/2N4N/PPPP2PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 7,"Again, i'll have to hazard a guess that at some point the child was told it's agood thing to attack Pawns. This double attacks the KP."
13,fxe5,f4e5,r2qkbnr/pbpp2pp/1p3p2/2n1P3/2B1P3/2N4N/PPPP2PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,"By adult standards, this move is obvious. To a 5-year-old, perhaps they were taught that it's important to open a line for a Rook."
14,fxe5,f6e5,r2qkbnr/pbpp2pp/1p6/2n1p3/2B1P3/2N4N/PPPP2PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,Acting on the basic principle of recapturing.
15,Qh5+,d1h5,r2qkbnr/pbpp2pp/1p6/2n1p2Q/2B1P3/2N4N/PPPP2PP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 1 8,"I can picture the excited squeal of ""Check!"""
16,g6,g7g6,r2qkbnr/pbpp3p/1p4p1/2n1p2Q/2B1P3/2N4N/PPPP2PP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 0 9,What else?
17,Qxe5+,h5e5,r2qkbnr/pbpp3p/1p4p1/2n1Q3/2B1P3/2N4N/PPPP2PP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 0 9,"Again, the excitement of checking. Even to me it's a thrill when I launch an attack. To a youngster, they can barely sit still."
18,Ne7,g8e7,r2qkb1r/pbppn2p/1p4p1/2n1Q3/2B1P3/2N4N/PPPP2PP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 1 10,"No adult would do this, as it blocks in the King. But again, the 5-year-old probably just blocked the check with the first move they saw."
19,Bf7#,c4f7,r2qkb1r/pbppnB1p/1p4p1/2n1Q3/4P3/2N4N/PPPP2PP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 2 10,"Finis. The father of one of my son's friends in school supplied me with this game. His son was Black, but he wasn't upset by the loss -- he just wanted to play more games."
