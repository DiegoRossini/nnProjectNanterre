1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is a match I had with a player that was 1032. I'm still learning, so any comments about my moves would be great."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"A lot of people say that this move is not a good counter for e4, that c5 and e6 are better. Any thoughts?"
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Protecting my king pawn, impeding the d4 push, and developing my knight. This game is textbook so far."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"Protecting my king pawn, impeding the d4 push, and developing my knight. This game is textbook so far."
5,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 3,All knights developed. So far a mirrored game.

7,d3,d2d3,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,Doesn't push the pawn all the way. Good job knight on c6!
8,d5,d7d5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3pp3/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,Was this a good or a bad move? I think it was good because it opened up the middle. Dunno. What do you guys think?
9,exd5,e4d5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3Pp3/8/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"Threatens the queen. I've never liked this move, always thought it put the bishop in danger. Also, this move sets up the game changing pin."
10,Nxd5,f6d5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/3np3/8/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Threatens the queen. I've never liked this move, always thought it put the bishop in danger. Also, this move sets up the game changing pin."

12,Nf6,d5f6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/4p1B1/8/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 7,"Not the best move, I see now. But it's better than f6, and you'll see why later."
13,Qd2,d1d2,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/4p1B1/8/2NP1N2/PPPQ1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 3 7,"This is a blunder. See how the bishop and queen line up with c1, where the king will be if it castles queen side? This furthers the pin."
14,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/2n2n2/4p1B1/8/2NP1N2/PPPQ1PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 4 8,"I see the opportunity, so I line up my queen and bishop for a queen pin."

16,Nd4,c6d4,r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/5n2/4p1B1/3n4/2NP1N2/PPPQ1PPP/2KR1B1R w kq - 6 9,"I actually don't know why I did this. But it happened to really help me checkmate his king, so I guess it's a good move."
17,Nxe5,f3e5,r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/5n2/4N1B1/3n4/2NP4/PPPQ1PPP/2KR1B1R b kq - 0 9,About to take the bishop. I think that my opponent thought that his queen was protecting it.
18,Ng4,f6g4,r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/8/4N1B1/3n2n1/2NP4/PPPQ1PPP/2KR1B1R w kq - 1 10,About to take the bishop. I think that my opponent thought that his queen was protecting it.
19,Re1,d1e1,r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/8/4N1B1/3n2n1/2NP4/PPPQ1PPP/2K1RB1R b kq - 2 10,"Gets ready for a discovered check, which would be good in other circumstances. However, now his queen is only being defended by his king. Thus, this is a blunder."
20,Bxg5,e7g5,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/8/4N1b1/3n2n1/2NP4/PPPQ1PPP/2K1RB1R w kq - 0 11,"And the pin is here! Is it good, is it not, answer it in the comments. In this game, it changed who would win."
21,Nxg4+,e5g4,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/8/6b1/3n2N1/2NP4/PPPQ1PPP/2K1RB1R b kq - 0 11,"The discovery check I was talking about. It could have actually destroyed me, if he had played Nc6 instead of Nxg4. Then he would have taken my queen."
22,Be6,c8e6,r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/4b3/6b1/3n2N1/2NP4/PPPQ1PPP/2K1RB1R w kq - 1 12,"Was this how you would have stopped it? Also, to answer jkarp (thank you for all the comments!), I see that white could have played f4 here and my pin would be gone. Thanks for pointing that out!"
23,Qxg5,d2g5,r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/4b3/6Q1/3n2N1/2NP4/PPP2PPP/2K1RB1R b kq - 0 12,"This was worse than leaving the queen there, because now I can put the king in check. He should have played f4 to prevent the pin, and then he'd be up a pawn."
24,Qxg5+,d8g5,r3k2r/ppp2ppp/4b3/6q1/3n2N1/2NP4/PPP2PPP/2K1RB1R w kq - 0 13,So there are many good moves that this guy could have done. But instead...
