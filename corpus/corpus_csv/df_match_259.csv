So having drawn with Robert Akeya-Price, after we had looked at our game, I asked him how he beat Thomas Villiers, and he showed me."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,So it starts as a Queen's Gambit.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,So it starts as a Queen's Gambit.
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,So it starts as a Queen's Gambit.
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"Robert turns it into a Catalan Opening - quite an unusual choice for one so young!

6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,"Robert turns it into a Catalan Opening - quite an unusual choice for one so young!

7,g3,g2g3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"Robert turns it into a Catalan Opening - quite an unusual choice for one so young!

8,dxc4,d5c4,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/8/2pP4/5NP1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Black takes the pawn. Of course Robert could immediately regain the pawn with 5. Qa4+, but he is in no hurry, and calmly continues with his development."
9,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/8/2pP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,And now Robert plans to recapture the pawn.
10,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/8/2pP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 6,And now Robert plans to recapture the pawn.
11,Qa4,d1a4,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/8/Q1pP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 3 6,And now Robert plans to recapture the pawn.
12,Nd5,f6d5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/3n4/Q1pP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 4 7,This is slightly unusual. I tend to think that black should continue with his development.
13,Qxc4,a4c4,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/3n4/2QP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 7,So white gets the pawn back.
14,Na5,c6a5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4p3/n2n4/2QP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 1 8,"Again - I can't help thinking that black should be getting on with his development, rather than playing this."
15,Qa4+,c4a4,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4p3/n2n4/Q2P4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 2 8,Robert told me that he was expecting his opponent to play either Nc6 or c6.
16,Bd7,c8d7,r2qkb1r/pppb1ppp/4p3/n2n4/Q2P4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 3 9,This was a bit of a shock. Of course 9. Qxa5?? Bb4+ and black gets a queen for two pieces.
17,Qd1,a4d1,r2qkb1r/pppb1ppp/4p3/n2n4/3P4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 4 9,But the queen is quite comfortable here.
18,c5,c7c5,r2qkb1r/pp1b1ppp/4p3/n1pn4/3P4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 10,Black does a thematic attack on the white centre.
19,O-O,e1g1,r2qkb1r/pp1b1ppp/4p3/n1pn4/3P4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 10,White calmly castles.
20,Be7,f8e7,r2qk2r/pp1bbppp/4p3/n1pn4/3P4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 11,Black at last develops his Bf8.
21,Ne5,f3e5,r2qk2r/pp1bbppp/4p3/n1pnN3/3P4/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 3 11,Knight takes up a dominating square in the centre.
22,cxd4,c5d4,r2qk2r/pp1bbppp/4p3/n2nN3/3p4/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 12,I don't like this move either - castling or Nc6 seems better - but Fritz likes this move.
23,Qxd4,d1d4,r2qk2r/pp1bbppp/4p3/n2nN3/3Q4/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 0 12,"White recaptures, threatening to take twice on d5."
24,Qb6,d8b6,r3k2r/pp1bbppp/1q2p3/n2nN3/3Q4/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNB2RK1 w kq - 1 13,"This is a blunder - simply castling was best - the Catalan Bishop on g2 is so strong, it is worth giving up pawn and knight to get rid of it. OK what would you play here as white?"
25,Qg4,d4g4,r3k2r/pp1bbppp/1q2p3/n2nN3/6Q1/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 2 13,"How many players, facing an opponent graded 56 ECF grading points ahead of them would have taken off the queens? Quite a few I fancy! But Roberts took his time and played the strongest move. Black is in all sorts of trouble now, as 14. Bxd5 is threatened, and if black recaptures with the e pawn white can take the bishop on d7. Or white could play the moves in another order - 14. Nxd7 and if black plays Kxd7 then white has 15. Bxd5. Meanwhile white is also threatening 15. Qxg7."
26,Bb5,d7b5,r3k2r/pp2bppp/1q2p3/nb1nN3/6Q1/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNB2RK1 w kq - 3 14,Black finds the best defence.
