Many moons ago, a Class C player called Fiver played the Allgaier Gambit of the KGA and lost.  Ardin also tried that on me and met the same fate.  So, how did this happen?  Please see the Gameknot Analysis link below:-"

Thankfully, on both occasions the Class C players tried this on me, Henry managed to find some way of preserving his modesty and I was able to turn the tables on them big time!"

I now have an idea of attacking the WK who exposes himself further on the next turn with a normal developing move such as Nc6.

Ardin moves his bishop to h3 and I do not take the rook because there is a bigger fish, fit for Henry's table to fry - a white p(r)awn on d4 and the WK must part company with his other half on the next turn.  Ardin spares that ill-fated Royal couple the agony by waving the white flag.  I think the Allgaier is playable but white must be precise to avoid incurring a calamity, do you the Inquest Jury agree?  Anyhow, I hope you have all had a good read.  Bye for now - Joanne"
