1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game is unusual in that the white knights at move 15 occupy h7 and h8. It also features an unusual way of exchanging king side rooks, both of which are captured on their starting squares! Enjoy!
I had played Cherrypie seven times, I have lost to him, and conceded 3 draws. He is a player I greatly respect. I normally start with d4, but I played e4 mainly for variety. I think I drew with him last time I ventured d4."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"And he responds with the Alekhine defence, black tries to lure the white pawns forward, and hopes to undermine the white pawn centre later. It is double-edge though, as the white pawn centre may prove very powerful!"
3,e5,e4e5,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/4P3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,This advanced is really the only principled move and is by far the most commonly played move.
4,Nd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/3nP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,This is virtually forced.
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/3nP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,and this is the standard move for white too
6,d6,d7d6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p4/3nP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Black starts to attack the white centre.
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p4/3nP3/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"Nf3 is the most commonly played move, and, according to the database, the most successful move, out of the commonly played moves. Nc3 here actually scores 100%, but it looks bad to allow black to double white's pawns. There is only one game with Nc3 on the database, and I wasn't going to trust a single game!"
8,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p4/3nP3/3P2b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,"Black pins the white knight on f3, again the most commonly played move in this position."
9,Be2,f1e2,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p4/3nP3/3P2b1/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 5,And likewise I chose the most commonly played move too.
10,c6,c7c6,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2pp4/3nP3/3P2b1/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"e6 is more common here, although c6 does score better for black."
11,c4,c2c4,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2pp4/3nP3/2PP2b1/5N2/PP2BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,I go with c4 as it scores better than the more popular 0-0
12,Nb6,d5b6,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/1npp4/4P3/2PP2b1/5N2/PP2BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 7,"Nb6 is the most popular move, although Nc7 scores better."
13,Nbd2,b1d2,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/1npp4/4P3/2PP2b1/5N2/PP1NBPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 7,"Nbd2 is the most popular move, although Ng5 scores better, I thought it better to continue development."
14,dxe5,d6e5,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/1np5/4p3/2PP2b1/5N2/PP1NBPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"dxe5 is the more popular move - 60 games on the database with it, compared with 59 for Nb8-d7, which does score better. Generally when you have pawns in the centre like this which can take each other, it is better to leave the central tension, unless you fear your opponent exchanging, or can gain an advantage by exchanging."
15,Nxe5,f3e5,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/1np5/4N3/2PP2b1/8/PP1NBPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,"Nxe5 is more popular, and scores better than recapturing with the pawn. Black can grab a pawn here, with Bxe2 and the Qxd4, but white has plenty of compensation in better development."
16,Bf5,g4f5,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/1np5/4Nb2/2PP4/8/PP1NBPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 9,So my opponent declines the pawn.
17,Ndf3,d2f3,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/1np5/4Nb2/2PP4/5N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 9,And now he doesn't get a second chance!
18,e6,e7e6,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/1np1p3/4Nb2/2PP4/5N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 10,Making a route out for his black squared bishop.
19,g4,g2g4,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/1np1p3/4Nb2/2PP2P1/5N2/PP2BP1P/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 10,"We are getting near the end of previously trodden ground here. There is one game on the database with this position, Stein, Bernd (2405) vs. Andruet, Gilles (2365), which white won, so I was feeling confident!"
20,Be4,f5e4,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/1np1p3/4N3/2PPb1P1/5N2/PP2BP1P/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 11,But that game went 10. g4 Bg6 11. h4 Be7 12. Nxg6 hxg6 13. Be3 Nb8d7 14. Qc2 c5 15. O-O-O Qc7 16. Kb1 O-O-O 17. g5 Bd6 18. Qe4 Kb8 19. Rd2 Ka8 20. Rhd1 Nc8 21. Qc2 Be7 22. dxc5 Nxc5 23. b4 Na6 24. a3 Rxd2 25. Rxd2 Rd8 26. Rxd8 Bxd8 27. c5 Ne7 28. Bd4 Nf5 29. Be5 Qc8 30. Bxa6 bxa6 31. Qe4+. Perhaps my opponent knew this and wanted an alternative?
