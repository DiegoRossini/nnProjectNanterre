1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Winning a chess game is not easy.  A position is said to be better or winning, but then you haft to take the next step and prove it.  Your opponent isn't just going to roll over and play dead.  This game starts off as most with the simple push e4."

Lets look at the other short mate Nh4 Bg2+ Nxg2 Qh3# or Nh4 Bg2+ Kh2 Qh3#.  Qg1 Bxg1 Rxg1 Nxg1 Ne1 Rxe1 with Qg2# impossible to avoid or Qg1 Bxg1 Ne1 Ng3+ Kxg1 Nf1+ Ng2 Qxg2# or Qg1 Bxg1 Ne1 Ng3+ Kxg1 Nf1+ Kf2 Re2#.
