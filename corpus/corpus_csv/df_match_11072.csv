1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,The usual.
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Caro-kann. A solid response to e4. Often result in drawish positions. Black only wins if White overextends himself.
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,The old mainline. The new mainline is Nd7 with Ngf6. Both are playable. Black wants to get his light bishop out before e6 (an advantage of 1...c6 over 1...e6) which would shut it in for quite some time.
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,The old mainline. The new mainline is Nd7 with Ngf6. Both are playable. Black wants to get his light bishop out before e6 (an advantage of 1...c6 over 1...e6) which would shut it in for quite some time.

9,Ng3,e4g3,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/5b2/3P4/6N1/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 5,In turn White tries to harrass this bishop while developing his pieces into agressive squares.
10,Bg6,f5g6,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p3b1/8/3P4/6N1/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 3 6,Mainline is Nf3 but I like this move since it's not very popular but almost as good in my opinion since it results in some interesting position that might trouble Black if he doesn't pay attention to the subtle change of piece set up.
11,h4,h2h4,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p3b1/8/3P3P/6N1/PPP2PP1/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,Mainline is Nf3 but I like this move since it's not very popular but almost as good in my opinion since it results in some interesting position that might trouble Black if he doesn't pay attention to the subtle change of piece set up.
12,h6,h7h6,rn1qkbnr/pp2ppp1/2p3bp/8/3P3P/6N1/PPP2PP1/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,Mainline is Nf3 but I like this move since it's not very popular but almost as good in my opinion since it results in some interesting position that might trouble Black if he doesn't pay attention to the subtle change of piece set up.
13,Ng1e2,g1e2,rn1qkbnr/pp2ppp1/2p3bp/8/3P3P/6N1/PPP1NPP1/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 7,Mainline is Nf3 but I like this move since it's not very popular but almost as good in my opinion since it results in some interesting position that might trouble Black if he doesn't pay attention to the subtle change of piece set up.
14,e6,e7e6,rn1qkbnr/pp3pp1/2p1p1bp/8/3P3P/6N1/PPP1NPP1/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,Putting the knight into a nice square with threat to the Bishop.
15,Nf4,e2f4,rn1qkbnr/pp3pp1/2p1p1bp/8/3P1N1P/6N1/PPP2PP1/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 8,Putting the knight into a nice square with threat to the Bishop.
16,Bh7,g6h7,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppb/2p1p2p/8/3P1N1P/6N1/PPP2PP1/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 9,Forced.
17,Bd3,f1d3,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppb/2p1p2p/8/3P1N1P/3B2N1/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 9,Standard exchange. The point is that Black has been using all his turns to develop his light bishop and now has been forced to trade it off for a piece that only moved once. He would be down a lot of tempos straight from the opening. But Black's position is solid enough that if he doesn't commit any major errors he should be OK.
18,Bd6,f8d6,rn1qk1nr/pp3ppb/2pbp2p/8/3P1N1P/3B2N1/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 4 10,A bit forceful. The objective for Black in this opening is not to attack White (if he wants to be agressive then Sicillian would have been a better choice) but to keep the balance using his solid position. Developing with Nf6 first would have been preferred I think.
19,Nfh5,f4h5,rn1qk1nr/pp3ppb/2pbp2p/7N/3P3P/3B2N1/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 5 10,White has already had most of his pieces out and ready for attack. This move highlights the error of Bd6. Black's kingside is exposed to weakness that cannot be covered by 0-0. If his bishop hasn't moved then Nh5 would not generate any serious threat.
20,g6,g7g6,rn1qk1nr/pp3p1b/2pbp1pp/7N/3P3P/3B2N1/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 11,Awkward move. The light bishop is shut in. But it's hard to come up with an alternative since Black had wasted too many turns with ineffectual moves. Black has been too trusting in his solid position that he completely forgot the fundamental rule of opening: developing your pieces.
21,Nf4,h5f4,rn1qk1nr/pp3p1b/2pbp1pp/8/3P1N1P/3B2N1/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 11,No speculative sacrifice to be found. But often time creating a weakness in your opponent's camp is as good an objective as any.
22,Qc7,d8c7,rn2k1nr/ppq2p1b/2pbp1pp/8/3P1N1P/3B2N1/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 12,"Black's knights must be feeling pretty jealous of their White counterparts right about now. While their enemies are ready in formation preparing for battle, they have to stay home in their original squares looking pretty."
23,Qf3,d1f3,rn2k1nr/ppq2p1b/2pbp1pp/8/3P1N1P/3B1QN1/PPP2PP1/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 3 12,Protecting the knight. Also clearing up spaces if White chooses to castle queenside. White is better.
24,Nd7,b8d7,r3k1nr/ppqn1p1b/2pbp1pp/8/3P1N1P/3B1QN1/PPP2PP1/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 4 13,"Black probably wants to seek shelter on the queenside as well, seeing how his kingside has already been weakened and all the White pieces are pointing at it."
25,Nfe2,f4e2,r3k1nr/ppqn1p1b/2pbp1pp/8/3P3P/3B1QN1/PPP1NPP1/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 5 13,"There's really not much White can do at the moment, despite his superior development. Black's position is still rather solid. I saw that if Black was to push e5 the next move then I would be forced to trade my d4 pawn for it and then Black knight can go to e5 attacking my Queen. His position wouldn't seem as bad then. So I decided to retreat and see what Black's plan is."
26,Ndf6,d7f6,r3k1nr/ppq2p1b/2pbpnpp/8/3P3P/3B1QN1/PPP1NPP1/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 6 14,"I feel Ngf6 is more accurate and to the point, planning to use Nd7 for the center thrust e5. I don't think Black adequately considered that option."
27,Bd2,c1d2,r3k1nr/ppq2p1b/2pbpnpp/8/3P3P/3B1QN1/PPPBNPP1/R3K2R b KQkq - 7 14,Still playing the waiting game.
28,O-O-O,e8c8,2kr2nr/ppq2p1b/2pbpnpp/8/3P3P/3B1QN1/PPPBNPP1/R3K2R w KQ - 8 15,Settling down.
29,c4,c2c4,2kr2nr/ppq2p1b/2pbpnpp/8/2PP3P/3B1QN1/PP1BNPP1/R3K2R b KQ - 0 15,"White has spatial advantage. This move aims to take away the knight's awesome spot on d5. This is the first commital move of the game, since d4 is slightly weakened, but only if Black manages to gain some counterattack via c5 or e5. Note that I haven't settled down on castling yet, give me the option of castle kingside and go for opposite side attack which would benefit me since my pieces are more ready."
