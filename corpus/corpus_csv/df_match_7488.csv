Right off the bat, it looks as if I could have already backed myself into a corner early on, but it soon  opens up into an open, action-packed game, where both sides go on the attack a number of times..."

9,Bxf7+,c4f7,r1bqk2r/pppp1Bpp/2n2n2/2b1p1N1/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"after a quick check on a few ongoing games, I find this is the most played here, and that the altenative Nxf7 doesn't work at all for White (it's funny how in all of Freddy's mini-tournaments that this knight fork is bad)"
10,Ke7,e8e7,r1bq3r/ppppkBpp/2n2n2/2b1p1N1/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 1 6,connecting the queen and rook

12,Rf8,h8f8,r1bq1r2/ppppk1pp/2n2n2/2b1p1N1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 3 7,Black starts to build up pressure on that f2 pawn with a discovered attack (e.g 7...Bxf2 8.Kxf2? Nxe4+!)
13,Qe2,d1e2,r1bq1r2/ppppk1pp/2n2n2/2b1p1N1/2B1P3/8/PPPPQPPP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 4 7,"?! this was not the best way to protect my king. Better alternatives would have been 7.0-0 or maybe even 7.f3 (though that move isn't as strong - it stops White castling)

I realised that with this move, there was nowhere that my knight could go, and my queenside wasn't looking too good. I was considering, after 9...Nc6, 10.b4, but that would most likely force Black to simply play Bxf2, and though Ne4+ isn't a possibility, it still breaks open my kingside defence (plus b4 wouldn't help much for my dsb.)  After a bit of playing around on the analyse board, however, I see another possibility..."

Moving the queen won't do either (e.g Qe2, then Re3! or Qc2, then Rxc3) the only way to (immediately) save my queen here is Kd2, which is an unflattering choice because of 16...Rd3+ 17. Kc2 Qd7, with Bf5 next move (alt. variation; 16...Rd3 17.Qxd3 Nxd3 18.Kxd3 Qd7...) I overlooked Kd2 as an option here, though, as a look at the analyse board showed me that it wasn't as bad as it seemed..."
