1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

This is my second non-timeout victory in the King Pawn Opening Mini-tournament against the same opponent in Two Against One.  He plays the King's Gambit and I accept it.  We then follow the database and I find a game between my opponent and an Expert called Erizo.  We follow the database until Move 11.  By that time a hell of a lot of damage had been done to white's position but as I said in a previous annotation, it is one thing to win big material and quite another to clean up your opponent should he refuse to wave that white flag!  My opponent does in fact cop Old Matey but you will need to read on to see just how."

One was d6 but it branched out into one lost game so I decided to look carefully and I mean carefully at that Erizo game.  I also liked Ne7 because it did develop a piece and prepare for kingside castling, although d6 would have uncovered a defensive battery from Fou Leblanc onto my footman at g4."

Ion, I know Alekhine's gun means heavies on one file but I wonder what you could call this particular arrangement, Glenda will line up on the f column, one rook will line up on the e column and another is already on the d column - and the WK is exposed on the e column.  It may not be long before he is well and truly Gunned Down!"

I put my horsie on that square in Analyse the Board and No, says gameknot, because the checkmate detector lights up!  Better put that horsie on c2 and click submit then!  I do just that and my opponent cops Old Matey.  This bumped my rating up to 1856.  It has been a great start to this morning, waking up to that white flag from Ledzepp in the Annotation Project Pt 2 and then to find myself delivering mate in another game.  Double nice."
