1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,When this game stated we both were rather close in our ratings differential.  A few years later the difference was much larger.  Lesson?  Do not put a bunch of faith in ratings.  Just try to play your best.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"2...d5 might put us in a Veresov Opening, which is not a huge problem for Black.  It is one of the BPWUW openings (best player will usually win).  Not a lot of theoretical advantage to be gained for either side if I play 2...d5.  An opening that is NOT a BPWUW is the Rauzer Attack.  A well versed weaker player can take out a much higher rated opponent with either color.  Any of those long theoretical openings can yield positive results for the better prepared.  The Veresov might be that way, but I tend to think not..."

5,e4,e2e4,r1bqkb1r/pppppppp/2n2n2/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"We are probably in a Nimzovitch Defense now: 1.e4 Nc6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 would be one move order besides the game's move order.  I am not a regular player of that line with either color.  I do have some books on the opening and a few more that cover some of the main lines.  Hugh Myers has the best book, but to use the contents requires study and analysis to find the best lines."

14,e6,e7e6,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/4Pb2/3Pp3/4B3/PPP1NPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,An option is 11..f6 when Black seeks to attack the pawn chain.  Ultimately the pawn chain survives but lines are opened.  Most likely the f and/or d files.

White has not taken the opportunity to ruin Black's Queen side pawns, but that just means the Bishop is valued more than doubled pawns.  I might have tried 12.Bc4 as an alternative to 12.f4 or 12.Bxc6.  Not playing 12.f4 allows White to attack the pawn chain with f2-f3 later."
