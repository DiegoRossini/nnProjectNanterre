1,h4,h2h4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/7P/8/PPPPPPP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"h4?! played by me. I always feel i should try something new which no-one else usually does, so i went for the Desprez opening. The opening is named after the French player Marcel Desprez. Like a number of other rare openings, 1.h4 has some alternate names such as ""Kadas Opening"", ""Anti-Borg Opening"", ""Samurai Opening"", and ""Reagan's Attack"". Gabor Kadas is a Hungarian player. According to Eric Schiller's Unorthodox Chess Openings, the latter name is because 1.h4 is ""thoroughly unmotivated and creates weaknesses with only vague promises of future potential"", a political gibe against Ronald Reagan.

Like 1.a4, the Ware Opening, 1.h4 is an irrelevant pawn move which does nothing in the fight over central space, and does very little for development. The only piece released is the rook, and this piece is usually not developed by moving it to h3. In addition, 1.h4 weakens White's kingside. For all of these reasons, 1.h4 is among the rarest of the twenty possible first moves for White."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/7P/8/PPPPPPP1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Black usually responds by grabbing the center with 1...d5 or 1...e5, and simple and sound development by 1...Nf6 is also possible. However, 1...g6, intending to fianchetto Black's bishop on g7, is rare because White can undermine Black's pawn structure with 2.h5, making 1.h4 seem like a logical move."
3,g3,g2g3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/7P/6P1/PPPPPP2/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,g3 opens c6-g2 diagonal for Bishop and protects h4.
