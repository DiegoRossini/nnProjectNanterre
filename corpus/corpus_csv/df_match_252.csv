1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"How's my Dutch?

When I first started learning openings, my response to d4 as Black was the Dutch. My reasoning was it's superficial similarity to the King's Gambit, which I was playing as White at the time.

I dropped it in favour of the King's Indian Defence, as the Indian is more popular. Perhaps mistakenly, I assumed if finer chess brains than me had made the King's Indian popular, it must really be better."
2,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Recently, I've decided to broaden my opening repertoire and as I used to play it, I'm looking again at the Dutch. Here's a game where I played it for the first time in years.

I'd welcome comments/ criticism on my play."
3,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/3P1P2/8/PPP1P1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Not too popular reply from White here, as far as I can tell. Seems to counter the threat(?) of a later f4 from Black.

Allows Black to keep control of the e4 square. I guess this should be pretty comfortable for a player familiar with the Dutch?"
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppppp1pp/5n2/5p2/3P1P2/8/PPP1P1PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"Safe from Bg5 from White, Black's knight can happily make a home on f6."
5,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/ppppp1pp/5n2/5p2/3P1P2/4P3/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"White makes a play for the dark squares, this formation protects the control White has over c5, e5 and g5.

The white squares d5, e4 and g4 are controlled by black.

e3 looks as though it has the potential to become weak as the game goes on."
6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp2pp/4pn2/5p2/3P1P2/4P3/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Seems a little early for this. White seems think a Bb4+ from Black is irritating enough to prevent.
7,a3,a2a3,rnbqkb1r/pppp2pp/4pn2/5p2/3P1P2/P3P3/1PP3PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,Seems a little early for this. White seems think a Bb4+ from Black is irritating enough to prevent.

Black is master of the light squares."
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/p1pp2pp/1p2pn2/5p2/3P1P2/P3PN2/1PP3PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"White has strengthened its claim on the dark squares.

12,Be7,f8e7,rn1qk2r/pbppb1pp/1p2pn2/5p2/2PP1P2/P3PN2/1P4PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,"Preparing to castle. Black's rook may be able to control the f-file from f8, if the f pawn can usefully be exchanged away."
13,h4,h2h4,rn1qk2r/pbppb1pp/1p2pn2/5p2/2PP1P1P/P3PN2/1P4P1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"Hmm. White continues to put pressure on the central dark squares. But White's pawn structure looks wild. 

Castling kingside now looks dangerous for white and the queenside does not look any more attractive.

So many pawn moves by white and its pieces are underdeveloped. Black is edging ahead."
14,O-O,e8g8,rn1q1rk1/pbppb1pp/1p2pn2/5p2/2PP1P1P/P3PN2/1P4P1/RNBQKB1R w KQ - 1 8,"As in King's Gambit positions for white, here castling Kingside looks weakened by f-pawn having been moved so early.

As with the King's Gambit, too, the hope is the attacking chances created are sufficient that the weakened defences just do not matter."

A sensible exchange for Black?"

Could Black exploit this?"
