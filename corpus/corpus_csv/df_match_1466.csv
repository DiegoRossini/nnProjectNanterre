10,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk1nr/ppp2pbp/3p4/6p1/2B1Pp2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 6,Taking control of the long diagonal and enabling a further Bd4+ (which is black's plan)
11,O-O,e1g1,rnbqk1nr/ppp2pbp/3p4/6p1/2B1Pp2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 3 6,White has castled and is strong on the center but his king can be attacked via the a7 f2 diagonal. Black has 2 options : developp the queenside pi√®ces to enable the castle or use the white's king weakness to attack.
12,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk1nr/ppp2pbp/2np4/6p1/2B1Pp2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 4 7,First : develop the center (common move) and taking control of d4
13,d3,d2d3,r1bqk1nr/ppp2pbp/2np4/6p1/2B1Pp2/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,"One of the most common answer, protecting the e pawn and freeing the DSB."
14,Bg4,c8g4,r2qk1nr/ppp2pbp/2np4/6p1/2B1Ppb1/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 1 8,Pinning the knight and developping on the queenside.
15,h3,h2h3,r2qk1nr/ppp2pbp/2np4/6p1/2B1Ppb1/2NP1N1P/PPP3P1/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,"Mistake. It weakens the king and achieve little... White should have carried on developping on the center, unpinning his knight by moving the queen or attacking on the center..."
16,h5,h7h5,r2qk1nr/ppp2pb1/2np4/6pp/2B1Ppb1/2NP1N1P/PPP3P1/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 9,... for black doesn't have to move the bishop.

18,hxg4,h5g4,r2qk1nr/ppp2pb1/2np4/6p1/2B1Ppp1/2NP1N2/PPP3P1/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 10,Now the white king is in serious danger
19,Nh2,f3h2,r2qk1nr/ppp2pb1/2np4/6p1/2B1Ppp1/2NP4/PPP3PN/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 10,Mistake. White has little good move available but 10. Nd2 was better as was 10. Nd5 (abandoning the knight to his doom)
20,Bd4+,g7d4,r2qk1nr/ppp2p2/2np4/6p1/2BbPpp1/2NP4/PPP3PN/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 11,"White submits here for if 11. Be3 Bxe3+ and the situation is the same with one bishop less for white
if 11. Kh1 g3 and white is facing an unavoidable mate by 12. Rxh2+mate If 11. Rf2 Bxf2 12. Kxf2 Rxh2 and white is 4 points late in material with a very weak king."
