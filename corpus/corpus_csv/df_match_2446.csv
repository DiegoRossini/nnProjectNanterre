2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Likewise.
3,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Going for the old Stonewall.
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,As per Stonewall plan.
5,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/3BP3/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 3,As per Stonewall plan.
6,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2pp4/3P4/3BP3/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 4,That's a bit of a nuisance.  Happens quite often with this opening.  Better create a retreat square for my white squared Bishop.
7,c3,c2c3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2pp4/3P4/2PBP3/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 4,Normal Stonewall developing move in preparation for f4 and Knights on e5 and f3.

10,e5,e7e5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/2ppp3/3P4/2PBP3/PP1N1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,Pete is coming full frontal..well I can't allow him to pushe4 so I must swap on e5.
11,dxe5,d4e5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/2ppP3/8/2PBP3/PP1N1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 6,I want to keep my Bishop pair for the endgame so it's a bit of a toss up to stick the Bishop on c2 or e2.  I think its more useful on e2 as a Kingside attack seems a bit futile with both his knights on that side of the board and my Bishop can support a Queenside pawn advance from e2.

18,Qe7,d8e7,r1b2rk1/pp2qppp/3b1n2/2ppn3/8/2P1PN2/PP1NBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 6 10,Putting my rook on same file as Blacks Queen to try to make him feel a wee bit more uncomfortable.  A sort of precurser for any tactical possibilities that may arise on that file and overprotecting e3.
