This is not a standard annotation, it is just Fritz's analysis of variations copied and pasted (my brief comments are those not in parenthesis).  At the beginning of every relevant move a number is given by Fritz which indicates who is winning in terms of pawns, positive for white and negative for black. It is only intended to allow Luckpawn and I to have a look at our game and see where we went wrong tactically - so if you could refrain from giving it a bad rating then that would be great, thanks.  ;) The threshold for blunders was set at 1 pawn (i.e moves that lose the equivalent of 1 or more pawns have variations suggested)."
