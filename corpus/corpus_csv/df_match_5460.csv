10,Nd4,c6d4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/1bBnP3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 6,"? Moving the same piece twice, neglecting castling, and undefending the e-pawn. 
There are lines of the Four Knights' where Black can play this move successfully, but not when White is so well-developed. Black should have followed principles and castled here, or played ...d6.
It is important to recognize and make use of inviting squares like d4, and so Black's impulse here is basically good. The problem is timing -- we can only make one move at a time in chess, and redeploying an already-developed piece, even to a really nice square, usually needs to wait in line behind developing the other pieces and castling the King to safety."
11,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/1bBnP3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 2 6,"!? As far as I can tell, White can safely grab the pawn here, though things can get dicey:
Nxe5!? d5 7. exd5 and now ...Qe7, ...Nxd5 and ...0-0 all seem insufficient, though I admit I didn't properly analyze any of them. I encourage others to post their own analysis -- especially you, Kyle, who could consider getting a board out and playing through the lines as some useful practice.

Instead, White plays for a safe edge (he's still up in development), which is understandable in a blitz game.

Note that Nxd5? is a poor choice because, after ...exd5, the other Knight on c3 is pinned."
12,d6,d7d6,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/1bBnP3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,"? Ugh!!!!!
This Bishop makes a very annoying pin, which gives White a lot of pressure. White could maintain the pin with Bh4, and now Black will be hesitant to play ...g5 unless he absolutely has to. 
I believe that White made this move thinking that he had a tactical justification based on a fork at d5, but that was a miscalculation. Much better would be to retreat to h4 and THEN aim for Nd5, piling on the pinned Knight.
It is usually not a good idea to trade off Bishops for Knights without a good reason in open games, (because the Bishops' long reach are so useful when there are open diagonals) and that is especially true of this particular Bishop, which is 1) White's ""Good Bishop"" (notice that most of White's pawns are on light squares, so that this Bishop complements them very well) and 2) exerting a lot of pressure with this pin,"
