4. ... Bc5. If 5. Nxf7 then Bxf2 !, 6. Kxf2 Nxe5 , 7. Qg1 Qh4 saves black's queen, threatens mate in 1, and then saves black's rook after white avoids the mate. ...

4... Bc5 is the wild Traxler variation, which is DEFINITELY not recommended to play unless you're well prepared. (For a start, White isn't forced to take the bishop. Do you know how you'd respond?) I'd suggest either sticking with 4... d5 or, if you want to play the Traxler, at least build up a bit of confidence by mastering 4... d5 first."
