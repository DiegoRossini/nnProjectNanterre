The plan was: Ra8+!, BxR (forced), Qa6+, Bb7, and now Qa7 threatens mate in one, so black has to move the d pawn, say d6. Then Ba4, renewing the mate threat, and I can't see anything black can do to avoid mate or, in the worst case (let's say I forget to play Ba4, and went for Qb8?+: Kd7 - forced, QxB. Moreover: even if the black K manages to escape to e6, I would still have Nf4+, with the other N covering e4 and d5. I can't lose, even with -4. Black has virtually  N, a R and a B not playing."
