9,Qd2,d1d2,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/6B1/3PP3/2N5/PPPQ1PPP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 3 5,Doubling on the diagonal and clearing the way for castling.
10,c6,c7c6,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/2pp1np1/6B1/3PP3/2N5/PPPQ1PPP/R3KBNR w KQkq - 0 6,I'm unclear as to why Black didn't just castle. He never does move his King into safety!
11,O-O-O,e1c1,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/2pp1np1/6B1/3PP3/2N5/PPPQ1PPP/2KR1BNR b kq - 1 6,White does take the opportunity to castle.
12,Qa5,d8a5,rnb1k2r/pp2ppbp/2pp1np1/q5B1/3PP3/2N5/PPPQ1PPP/2KR1BNR w kq - 2 7,"Black is being ""aggressive"" when he should instead be concentrating on castling and developing."
13,Nf3,g1f3,rnb1k2r/pp2ppbp/2pp1np1/q5B1/3PP3/2N2N2/PPPQ1PPP/2KR1B1R b kq - 3 7,"White, by contrast, is steadily building an attacking force."
14,b5,b7b5,rnb1k2r/p3ppbp/2pp1np1/qp4B1/3PP3/2N2N2/PPPQ1PPP/2KR1B1R w kq - 0 8,Seemingly wasting another tempo. The Q-side pieces are still completely undeveloped!
15,e5,e4e5,rnb1k2r/p3ppbp/2pp1np1/qp2P1B1/3P4/2N2N2/PPPQ1PPP/2KR1B1R b kq - 0 8,"White, ahead in development, tries to open up the position."

17,exf6,e5f6,rnb1k2r/p3ppbp/2pp1Pp1/q5B1/1p1P4/2N2N2/PPPQ1PPP/2KR1B1R b kq - 0 9,Now Black is down a piece and his KB is en prise.

If White falls for 11 PxQ?, 11...B-B1! saves the piece. 12 PxP BxP 13 BxB KxB 14 R-K1 ch would still leave White with a strong game, but Black would be able to drag out his resistance for a while."
