1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"Hi everyone!

Here I am, still yet to achieve my first ever Expert Victory in a non-timed out game.  Now wouldn't it have been lurvely to have just done it against The Coach!  Off the board, Ion has given me tremendous ongoing support, but alas, on the board Ion is painfully aware of my strengths and weaknesses and knows just how to tempt me into his tactical traps.  In this game it was not a case of simply walking into a one-move tactical shot and coming off worse, I won a pawn in a speculative gambit that Ion played against me and tried to hold on to it at a cost of my development.  This allowed Ion to put a lot of pressure on me, in particular the d column and he had a very strong knight which he used to devastating effect as first one black pawn, then another dropped.  Gameknot analysis is provided here  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15730439&fb=1&rnd=0.7837962235268192 to help you follow this game, of which, incidentally is my longest game against Ion.  He starts off with 1. Nf3 which is called the Reti Opening."

Ng5, as Alice in Wonderland would say, curioser and curioser, Ion moves the same piece twice in the opening to attack my advanced e pawn after I accepted the gambit.  I decided to play d5.  Although this does not develop a piece at least it opens up the c8-h3 diagonal for Fou Leblanc."
