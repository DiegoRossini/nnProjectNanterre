1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,[On a completely random note....]
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,[just to pass through the moves that you know a lot about....]
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"[check out my top rating, in case it's dropped down again - over 1400!]"
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,[yeehaw! :D]
5,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,"Ruy Lopez, Spanish Opening"
6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,I ignore the bishop for now (the popular move here was 3...a6) and threatens the e4 pawn.
7,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1B2p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 5 4,"natural. For both sides, the king's pawns are in the centre, and both sides have developed their knight. (White had also developed his bishop, but Black will catch up on that, since it's his turn) Apparently, this is supposed to lead to a quiet sort of game. (or maybe a certain move that arises out of the position, I can't remember... was it d3?....the Halloween Gambit certainly isn't boring, though!)Well, not this time!"
8,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1Bb1p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 6 5,"popular choice in the DB was Nd4, but there's nothing wrong with this move, as far as I can see"
9,Bxc6,b5c6,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2B2n2/2b1p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"?! I expected 0-0. Usually, it isn't advisable to make these sort of exchanges before being forced to do so first (for example, if Black plays a6). This does leave the e-pawn hanging..."
10,dxc6,d7c6,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2p2n2/2b1p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"but Black has a nice move now after Nxe5; Qd4!, winning the knight because White needs to defend against the mate threat on f2"
11,d3,d2d3,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2p2n2/2b1p3/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"forgoing castling for the moment, and opening up a line for the bishop"
12,Bg4,c8g4,r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2p2n2/2b1p3/4P1b1/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 7,usual pin....
13,h3,h2h3,r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2p2n2/2b1p3/4P1b1/2NP1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,White doesn't want the pin!
14,Bh5,g4h5,r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2p2n2/2b1p2b/4P3/2NP1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 8,"White REALLY doesn't want the pin, by the look of it! However, it also means that kingside castling won't be much of an option for White, with such a busted up position."
15,g4,g2g4,r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2p2n2/2b1p2b/4P1P1/2NP1N1P/PPP2P2/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,"White REALLY doesn't want the pin, by the look of it! However, it also means that kingside castling won't be much of an option for White, with such a busted up position."
16,Bg6,h5g6,r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2p2nb1/2b1p3/4P1P1/2NP1N1P/PPP2P2/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 9,"Nxg4 went through my mind here, but White could easily castle queenside before I would be able to get an attack on the king"
17,Qe2,d1e2,r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2p2nb1/2b1p3/4P1P1/2NP1N1P/PPP1QP2/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 2 9,"seeing that the kingside isn't looking too good, White starts to open up a way for queenside castling. It also (though White doesn't go for it for awhile) that the e-pawn is ripe for the picking!"
18,Qd7,d8d7,r3k2r/pppq1ppp/2p2nb1/2b1p3/4P1P1/2NP1N1P/PPP1QP2/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 3 10,"Black does likewise, but maybe Qe7 was better, to do something about the e-pawn (though I usually do this so that the queen and rook are lined up after 0-0-0)"
19,Be3,c1e3,r3k2r/pppq1ppp/2p2nb1/2b1p3/4P1P1/2NPBN1P/PPP1QP2/R3K2R b KQkq - 4 10,"not only opening up queenside castling, this move also threatens the capture of the bishop on c5"
20,Bb4,c5b4,r3k2r/pppq1ppp/2p2nb1/4p3/1b2P1P1/2NPBN1P/PPP1QP2/R3K2R w KQkq - 5 11,"!? usually, in my games I tend to avoid trading off pieces this early in the game (unless I've managed to pull ahead with a big lead) - that's just my way of playing :) I was dubious about trading off as well, because after fxe3 White can support a pawn push to d4. In the game, simply defending the bishop never crossed my mind, but there really isn't any good way to do that (b6 - tripled pawns? no way! ** Qe7 - wouldn't have wanted to waste time moving my queen again)"
21,Bd2,e3d2,r3k2r/pppq1ppp/2p2nb1/4p3/1b2P1P1/2NP1N1P/PPPBQP2/R3K2R b KQkq - 6 11,"? White definitely has some sort of pin phobia, but this move loses a tempo. 0-0-0 is better"
