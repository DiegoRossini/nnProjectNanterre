One of the things that I noticed about this opening is that it creates lots of parallel diagonals in White's position. This means that Black's Bishops will be invaluable for attacking, while White's will be needed for defending.
Another thing to notice is that Black's position is solid, while White's is not. Black has spent his time (mostly) making good developing moves, while White has made mostly pawn moves."
