1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game features one of the sharpest lines in the Najdorf/English Attack.  Black chooses the continuation 8...h6, where, as Finnish IM Tapani Sammaluvo puts it, Black burns his boats behind him.  His king will never castle, at least not on the kingside, however, his pieces can develop freely and White is unable to stop Black's freeing d5 break.  White's pieces develop quickly also and the play becomes razor sharp."

Black has one more center pawn than White so is the only side with the reasonable expectation of a center break.  Black can attempt to exploit this early f3, with an immediate 6...Qb6 or 6...b5."
