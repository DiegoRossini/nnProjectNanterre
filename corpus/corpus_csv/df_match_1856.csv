30,Rxe2,e8e2,1n4k1/pb3ppp/2p5/2b5/8/3P4/PPn1rPPP/RNB2RK1 w - - 0 16,Yet another overlooked attack. Just a few moves ago I had a massive advantage. Now I'm about to have a big disadvantage!
31,Rd1,f1d1,1n4k1/pb3ppp/2p5/2b5/8/3P4/PPn1rPPP/RNBR2K1 b - - 1 16,"He never gave up, and now look at where black is. Once this had happened, I had basically given up myself."

34,Bb4,c5b4,1n4k1/pb3ppp/2p5/8/1b1P4/8/PP2rPPP/nNBR2K1 w - - 1 18,"...but he instead protected his bishop. He may not of seen the possibilities of checkmate, or he was going easy on me, but then I noticed that both our kings had the same flawed protection, thus I decided to go for one final push!"
