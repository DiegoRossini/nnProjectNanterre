1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Not the best move for white. Black will gladly play into the Center Game opening. It allows black to gain a tempo by developing a knight with a threat on white's queen.

5,Qxd4,d1d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 0 3,Black is now ahead in development. I've stolen white's advantage of being first.

9,e5,e4e5,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4P3/2Q5/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"An odd move. I don't see any reasonable refutation by white, so it looks like a free pawn to me - and a threat on white's queen again. I'm expecting 6. Qe2 which then threatens 7. f4 to kill the pinned knight."

11,Qe4,c4e4,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4n3/4Q3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 1 6,Now I truly wasn't expecting that move. This is where white decided he'd had enough.
