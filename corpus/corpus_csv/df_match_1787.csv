1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is my traditional opening, the King's Pawn Opening, the most popular opening."
2,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"Interesting response, the King's Pawn Nimzovich defence, a response I've hardly ever seen in my games."
3,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 2,"This is surprisingly not a chess opening in the book, so the book ends quick."
4,e5,e7e5,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,I put pressure on the e5 pawn. I hope to take it here shortly.
5,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,I put pressure on the e5 pawn. I hope to take it here shortly.
6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,A customary move by white. I take the knight so I can take the pawn.
7,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1B2p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 4,A customary move by white. I take the knight so I can take the pawn.
8,Nd4,c6d4,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/1B2p3/3nP3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 4 5,"Black instead protects his knight, which is now protected by the e5 pawn, and attacks white's f3 Knight and b5 Bishop, which are both protected though."
9,Nxe5,f3e5,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/1B2N3/3nP3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"I continue with my plans to take the pawn. Interesting to see all 4 knights lined up like that. Black's knight is no longer protected, but also currently not under attack."
10,c6,c7c6,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2p2n2/1B2N3/3nP3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"Black attacks white's bishop more with his c pawn. This move is viewed by the computer analysis as an inaccuracy and that Qe7 was the best move. Yes indeed, for then white would have to move his knight or protect it with the f pawn. Likely this sequence would of occurred: 5. ... Qe7 6. Nf3 Nxf3 7. gxf3 Nxe4 8. Nxe4 Qxe4+ 9. Qe2 Qxe2+ 10. Kxe2. This would of left black with a bit of an advantage in position, but as you can see, c6 was the move made."
11,Bd3,b5d3,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2p2n2/4N3/3nP3/2NB4/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,Now black plays Qe7. Thus I must protect and retreat my knight.
12,Qe7,d8e7,r1b1kb1r/pp1pqppp/2p2n2/4N3/3nP3/2NB4/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 7,Now black plays Qe7. Thus I must protect and retreat my knight.
13,Nf3,e5f3,r1b1kb1r/pp1pqppp/2p2n2/8/3nP3/2NB1N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 7,"I was expecting Nxe4, but it was this move instead."
14,Nxf3+,d4f3,r1b1kb1r/pp1pqppp/2p2n2/8/4P3/2NB1n2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"I was expecting Nxe4, but it was this move instead."
15,gxf3,g2f3,r1b1kb1r/pp1pqppp/2p2n2/8/4P3/2NB1P2/PPPP1P1P/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,"This move definitely not the best. Computer analysis views this move as a mistake and that Qxf3 was the best. Very true, for this move has a 2-in-1 damage. First, the pawn structure for white is thrown off now. It's a 2-in-1 damage because with the pawn structure the way it is now, if white castles king-side, his king is wide open and vulnerable to attack, so this move is definitely a mistake."
16,d5,d7d5,r1b1kb1r/pp2qppp/2p2n2/3p4/4P3/2NB1P2/PPPP1P1P/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,"I retreat the knight, but this is viewed by the computer analysis as an inaccuracy. It says O-O was best? I question that. As I said in the previous comment, it would leave the king open for an attack. True it can be defended, but in my view, it is not the best move right now, but that's my view."
17,Ne2,c3e2,r1b1kb1r/pp2qppp/2p2n2/3p4/4P3/3B1P2/PPPPNP1P/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 9,"I retreat the knight, but this is viewed by the computer analysis as an inaccuracy. It says O-O was best?

18,dxe4,d5e4,r1b1kb1r/pp2qppp/2p2n2/8/4p3/3B1P2/PPPPNP1P/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 10,"A lot of pieces on e4. 10. fxe4 Nxe4 11. Bxe4 Qxe4 would put the material advantage at a tie for both sides, so it may help black slightly, but this will not be the sequence of events that will take place right off the bat."
19,fxe4,f3e4,r1b1kb1r/pp2qppp/2p2n2/8/4P3/3B4/PPPPNP1P/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 10,"Black now attack's white's knight, and he's starting to worry white, for black is starting to control the game more."
20,Bg4,c8g4,r3kb1r/pp2qppp/2p2n2/8/4P1b1/3B4/PPPPNP1P/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 11,"Black now attack's white's knight, and he's starting to worry white, for black is starting to control the game more."
21,h3,h2h3,r3kb1r/pp2qppp/2p2n2/8/4P1b1/3B3P/PPPPNP2/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 11,I try to swing things back some by driving back the bishop.
22,Bh5,g4h5,r3kb1r/pp2qppp/2p2n2/7b/4P3/3B3P/PPPPNP2/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 12,Nothing from the computer analysis. It even knows that castling is not the best now.
23,c3,c2c3,r3kb1r/pp2qppp/2p2n2/7b/4P3/2PB3P/PP1PNP2/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 12,Nothing from the computer analysis. It even knows that castling is not the best now.
24,Rd8,a8d8,3rkb1r/pp2qppp/2p2n2/7b/4P3/2PB3P/PP1PNP2/R1BQK2R w KQk - 1 13,"Computer analysis views this move as an inaccuracy and that, as I mentioned earlier, Nxe4 was the best move, for it gives a piece back to black."
25,Bc4,d3c4,3rkb1r/pp2qppp/2p2n2/7b/2B1P3/2P4P/PP1PNP2/R1BQK2R b KQk - 2 13,"Bad move by white, a blunder from the computer analysis. This move gives 0 protection to the e4 pawn, thus, when black takes it with his queen, much more pressure is put on the knight, and unless white can find a counter, checkmate is imminent... 
(Bc2 was the best move)"
26,b5,b7b5,3rkb1r/p3qppp/2p2n2/1p5b/2B1P3/2P4P/PP1PNP2/R1BQK2R w KQk - 0 14,...but black instead attacks the bishop. Not Qxe4??? No surprise the computer analysis also sees this as a blunder. Qxe4 was the best move of course.
27,Bb3,c4b3,3rkb1r/p3qppp/2p2n2/1p5b/4P3/1BP4P/PP1PNP2/R1BQK2R b KQk - 1 14,"I do retreat the bishop, but Bd3 was definitely better than Bb3..."
