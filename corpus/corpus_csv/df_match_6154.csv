""Your strongest.""

For whatever it's worth, I really like opening with 1. e4 as well."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"It's all a matter of personal taste, but when I have to face 1. e4, I almost always come back with e5.  It says so much:

""You're coming after us?  You're gonna have to go through me!""

Why let white think you aren't going to challenge his presence right from the start?"
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"The Ruy Lopez.  ""The Spanish.""

Threatening Black's setup right away, as the threat is to take the knight and then the unprotected pawn.  

Black has many ways of addressing that threat to the pawn, including d6 (protecting it), Nf6 (attacking its opposition), Nd4 (where black has to accept doubled pawns on the d-file), and a6 (ignoring it)."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"The Ruy Lopez.  ""The Spanish.""

6,a6,a7a6,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,"The move to ignore white's threat, I understand, is experiencing competition at the top levels, where the Berlin Defense (3... Nf6) may now be king.  But the Morphy Defense offers a lot of advantages.

If white plays 4. Ba4, black has a good plan to drive the bishop away, castle kingside, and play for lots of different queenside and central attacking options, including the exciting Marshall Gambit.  (White has great chances and options too, of course.) 

And if white plays Bxc6, black will have to justify his choice to ignore white's threat.

While much of the opening choice is just style, there's something to be said for playing to your strengths and preferences.  In my case, that equates to a brazen, impetuous style, if not a bit careless."
7,Bxc6,b5c6,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1B5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,"dieselengine9 is impetuous, too.

The exchange variation loses white the bishop pair but gives black doubled pawns.  If white can restrict black's mobility, he'll be in good shape."
8,dxc6,d7c6,r1bqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1p5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"But black has chances, too.  4... dxc6 is the superior recapture here, opening up lines for black's queen and bishop.

If black had played 4... bxc6, white can either grab the pawn or steam ahead in development, while black's light square bishop still struggles to get out.  The half-open b-file isn't enough compensation to justify that choice."
9,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1p5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 5,"Castling is superior to 5. Nxe5, where Qd4! gives black the edge."
10,Bg4,c8g4,r2qkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1p5/4p3/4P1b1/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 6,"But now the threat of Nxe5 needs to be addressed; otherwise black could lose a pawn for nothing.  Other options here are f6, Qd6, and Bd6, but the pin is certainly the most aggressive response."
11,h3,h2h3,r2qkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1p5/4p3/4P1b1/5N1P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 6,"Forcing the issue.  If I take, I lose the bishop pair, which was my main compensation for the doubled pawns.  If I run, he can play g4, giving him a space advantage.  The choice is difficult."
12,h5,h7h5,r2qkbnr/1pp2pp1/p1p5/4p2p/4P1b1/5N1P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,"But I was recently inspired by the Southern Chess captain, who crushed an opponent with a well-timed h5 in an OTB tourney.  http://gameknot.com/annotate.pl?id=33156

It's a risky move to offer a bishop so early, but the open h-file is worth a lot in this position.  For example, 7. hxg4 hxg4 8. Nxe5 (or some such move; otherwise white loses his knight) Qh4! and white's barely hanging on."
13,d3,d2d3,r2qkbnr/1pp2pp1/p1p5/4p2p/4P1b1/3P1N1P/PPP2PP1/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,"Now, I'm quoting from the game here, where dieselengine9 made this move and said:

""at least I know what NOT to do at this point.""

Referring to playing hxg4, of course, not wanting to go down that route."
14,Qf6,d8f6,r3kbnr/1pp2pp1/p1p2q2/4p2p/4P1b1/3P1N1P/PPP2PP1/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 8,"Protecting the e-pawn and coming over to where the action is.  Also threatening equality by doubling white's pawns on the f-file, and weakening the position around the white king.

But this game is pretty tame at this point."
15,hxg4,h3g4,r3kbnr/1pp2pp1/p1p2q2/4p2p/4P1P1/3P1N2/PPP2PP1/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,"?!  But not anymore!  White goes for the bishop grab after all.  

Both Nbd2 and Be3 look like better options."
16,hxg4,h5g4,r3kbnr/1pp2pp1/p1p2q2/4p3/4P1p1/3P1N2/PPP2PP1/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 9,The only sensible move.
17,Bg5,c1g5,r3kbnr/1pp2pp1/p1p2q2/4p1B1/4P1p1/3P1N2/PPP2PP1/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 1 9,"An aggressive try.  White is trying to hold onto his extra piece, whereas playing for development with Nc3 might offer a better plan.  For example, 9. Nc3 gxf3 10. Qxf3 Qh4 11. Qh3 Qxh3 12. gxh3 Rxh3, and white is down a pawn, but not totally out.

At this point, we have to conclude that white's 8th was a mistake."

19,Nh2,f3h2,r3kbnr/1pp2pp1/p1p3q1/4p1B1/4P1p1/3P4/PPP2PPN/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 3 10,"An interesting option: white gives up the bishop to try and defend with the knight.  White is likely planning 10. Nh2 Qxg5 11. Qxg4, weathering the storm.

In hindsight, perhaps Nbd2 would've offered more resistance; 10. Nbd2 gxf3 11. Nxf3, and even though black can force the win of the g-pawn, he has a hard time getting more."

The immediate threat is Qxh2#, or, if the knight moves, Qh1#."

Black has multiple good ways to continue, including 11... Bc5+, which gameknot's computer analysis prefers."
22,g3,g4g3,r3kbnr/1pp2pp1/p1p5/4p1Bq/4P3/3P1Pp1/PPP3PN/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 0 12,"I prefer this continuation, which applies much more pressure.

How does white avoid mate in this position?  A knight move won't do (Qh1#), and there's no way to defend the h2 square from Qxh2#."
