1,b4,b2b4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/1P6/8/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"On a blitz basis, this opening has some very dangerous lines if black goes after the pawn."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/1P6/8/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,I'm looking about how to shield the black diagonal instead.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/1P6/5N2/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 2,"Just ignoring b4. It's the best strategy, believe me."
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/1P6/5N2/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"Just ignoring b4. It's the best strategy, believe me."
5,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/1P6/4PN2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"Space for my B. I'm not the kind of player that plays e6, here, self-blocking his own B without a very good reason."
6,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p1b2/1P6/4PN2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,"Space for my B. I'm not the kind of player that plays e6, here, self-blocking his own B without a very good reason."
7,Be2,f1e2,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p1b2/1P6/4PN2/P1PPBPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 4,"I waited enough: now white ""must"" play Bb2, or I'll play e5, contesting his center space."
8,Nbd7,b8d7,r2qkb1r/pppnpppp/5n2/3p1b2/1P6/4PN2/P1PPBPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 3 5,"I waited enough: now white ""must"" play Bb2, or I'll play e5, contesting his center space."
9,Nc3,b1c3,r2qkb1r/pppnpppp/5n2/3p1b2/1P6/2N1PN2/P1PPBPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 4 5,"Just thank you. See how white was not right in delaying his Bb2 move. It is not only logical, it's needed."
10,e5,e7e5,r2qkb1r/pppn1ppp/5n2/3ppb2/1P6/2N1PN2/P1PPBPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"Just thank you. See how white was not right in delaying his Bb2 move. It is not only logical, it's needed."
11,a3,a2a3,r2qkb1r/pppn1ppp/5n2/3ppb2/1P6/P1N1PN2/2PPBPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"Saving the b4 pawn, but losing another developing tempo. This is the reason white coudn't allow e5 in the first place."
12,c6,c7c6,r2qkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p2n2/3ppb2/1P6/P1N1PN2/2PPBPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"Just weak? Maybe, but white still has b5 for his pieces. I can allow myself to play slower than average. a6-c5 was the natural and good plan, but it was too explored. I'll try something else."
13,h3,h2h3,r2qkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p2n2/3ppb2/1P6/P1N1PN1P/2PPBPP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,"Still losing time, without an attacking plan. Don't do this at home!"
14,Nb6,d7b6,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/1np2n2/3ppb2/1P6/P1N1PN1P/2PPBPP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 8,"I sac the central pawn! Crazy, but it will give me more tempo after Bd6, and since W's lsb is still a move away from b2, maybe I can play this crazy move."
15,Nh4,f3h4,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/1np2n2/3ppb2/1P5N/P1N1P2P/2PPBPP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 8,"White refuses the sac - with a higher rated player offers you a sac... just in case, refuse it. If you can. White could, with this nice move, asking a question to my B."
16,Bg6,f5g6,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/1np2nb1/3pp3/1P5N/P1N1P2P/2PPBPP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 3 9,"Ok, let's take it and open my h column. I can cope with that, and even turn it in my favour. Be careful!"
17,Bg4,e2g4,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/1np2nb1/3pp3/1P4BN/P1N1P2P/2PP1PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 4 9,"White plays the tactic way. Now let's see: NxB opens an attack over the WN because of BQ, but any of the possible takes back are just good for white, defending it. I can hope in 9... NxB, 10. QxN, f5!?, 11. Qg3... and black just misses one tempo to make of Bd6 the weapon to recover the N... or not, because white can defend with f4 at some point... too dangerous! And if 10. hxN, I have just nothing. But I am not forced to take it! Its better to have there a B than a Q... I can use my center instead... can you see how?"
18,d4,d5d4,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/1np2nb1/4p3/1P1p2BN/P1N1P2P/2PP1PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 10,"A center is valuable because an just when it can do things like this! White's N has few places to go to, since I didn't give up my Nf6 for the W's lsb."
19,Na2,c3a2,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/1np2nb1/4p3/1P1p2BN/P3P2P/N1PP1PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 10,"No, it was not a mistake! If Ne2, I would have played d3!, and after fxd3, Bxd3, with a pressing and dominant position over white. White could have exchanged and played for Qe2+, hoping to unravel himself with some exchanges. Now, how would you proceed?"
20,d3,d4d3,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/1np2nb1/4p3/1P4BN/P2pP2P/N1PP1PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 11,"...of course. This pawn will become a formidable outpost and, if c3 is played, will block forever THREE white's pieces. White shouldn't have allowed this. Better for white is to take, and try Be2, etc, begging black doesn't find something along the way..."
21,c3,c2c3,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/1np2nb1/4p3/1P4BN/P1PpP2P/N2P1PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 11,"The worst? White coudn't allow dxc2, and if 11. NxBg6 instead, ...dxc2 and white can't take it or 12. Qxc2, hxBg6 and NxB is now a threat for white. After white's B retreat, black has plenty of options."
22,Nxg4,f6g4,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/1np3b1/4p3/1P4nN/P1PpP2P/N2P1PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 12,"? Nerves. No need to take, so don't take! This is very bad, because of QxN or hxN."
23,Nxg6,h4g6,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/1np3N1/4p3/1P4n1/P1PpP2P/N2P1PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 12,"White goes for the ""other"" way: he isn't afraid o complication, is he?"
24,Nxf2,g4f2,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/1np3N1/4p3/1P6/P1PpP2P/N2P1nP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 13,"So let's complicate the game even more! I'll recover my piece back and I won't even scramble my pawns! - White has a tempting response here, very bad, a normal one and a risky one. Can you see them?"
