1,f3,f2f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5P2/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Thinking of trying out the Fried Fox/Pork Chop Opening?  Well, do not, I repeat, do not try it out on a player about 400 points north of your rating, particularly the Master Mater.  I ended well and truly on the spit on move 17.  In my opinion .........

THE FRIED FOX/PORK CHOP OPENING SHOULD BE AWARDED THE SKULL AND CROSSBONES!!"
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/5P2/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"2. Kf2?? - this move characterises the Fried Fox/Pork Chop Opening.  I think it fully deserves two question marks here as you will see.  Always, always play Nc3!  That is the Freddy way!"
3,Kf2,e1f2,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/5P2/PPPPPKPP/RNBQ1BNR b kq - 1 2,"2. Kf2?? - this move characterises the Fried Fox/Pork Chop Opening.  I think it fully deserves two question marks here as you will see.  Always, always play Nc3!  That is the Freddy way!"
4,Bc5+,f8c5,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/8/5P2/PPPPPKPP/RNBQ1BNR w kq - 2 3,2. ....... Bc5+ - development with check.
5,e3,e2e3,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/8/4PP2/PPPP1KPP/RNBQ1BNR b kq - 0 3,3. e3 - blocking the check.  Ke1 is better but I will not be able to castle and this just emphasises what a silly move that Kf2 is.
6,d5,d7d5,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/2bpp3/8/4PP2/PPPP1KPP/RNBQ1BNR w kq - 0 4,"4. g3 - so far only pawn moves, and 1 king move.  You cannot afford to do this against the Master Mater!  In retrospect maybe c3 was better here or even a developing move like Ne2."
7,g3,g2g3,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/2bpp3/8/4PPP1/PPPP1K1P/RNBQ1BNR b kq - 0 4,"4. g3 - so far only pawn moves, and 1 king move.  You cannot afford to do this against the Master Mater!  In retrospect maybe c3 was better here or even a developing move like Ne2."
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2n5/2bpp3/8/4PPP1/PPPP1K1P/RNBQ1BNR w kq - 1 5,5. c3 - one move too late.

13,Bg2,f1g2,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/2bp4/4p3/2P1PPP1/PP1PNKBP/RNBQ3R b kq - 1 7,"7. Bg2 - trying to catch up in development, but Ne5 is gonna be a right pain where the sun don't shine."

15,Rf1,h1f1,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/2bpn3/4p3/2P1PPP1/PP1PNKBP/RNBQ1R2 b kq - 3 8,8. Rf1 - maybe Re1 was better.  At least I would have been able to have avoided moving that rook twice later on and wasted a vital tempo.

I must then put my knight in the way on g2.  The Witch will cooly take it and cackle out ...... checkmate! .....

This move attacks black's dsb and contests control in the centre and frees up some space for my queenside pieces.  Not a lot of use though when I am about to get Freddied yet again.
32,Ne4+,g3e4,r3k2r/pp3ppp/2p5/2bp4/Q2PnNq1/2P1P2b/PP5P/RNB1R1K1 w kq - 1 17,"16. ..... Ne4+ - which piece would I rather be checkmated by, queen or knight?  Freddy often gets me with his queen which is getting a little bit boring.  Let it be the knight then."

Nf2# - getting Freddied at all is bad enough, even in the endgame, but getting Freddied in just 17 moves, well, I bet you the jury think I should hide myself away in shame!  Stigmatising oneself does nobody any good.  I come out of the closet here and post things like this as a warning and an example of what and what not to play in the opening!"
