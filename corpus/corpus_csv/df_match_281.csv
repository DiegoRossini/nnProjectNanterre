2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"1...e5 White has Black's position in the Sicilian but with an extra tempo. This is often called the Reversed Sicilian, though others call it the King's English. Bruce Leverett, writing the English chapter in MCO14, stated, ""It is natural to treat the English as a Sicilian reversed, but the results are often surprising—main lines in the Sicilian Defense correspond to obscure side variations in the English, and vice versa."""
