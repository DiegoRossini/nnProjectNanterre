17,Nd2,f3d2,r1bq1rk1/ppp1npbp/3p1np1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N5/PP1NBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 2 9,"And Nd2 is one of the most popular ones. White's plan is to expand on the queenside, while I try to attack on the kingside."
18,Ne8,f6e8,r1bqnrk1/ppp1npbp/3p2p1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N5/PP1NBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 3 10,"This is still theory. I move the knight away, so I can play the typical central break f5."

20,f5,f7f5,r1bqnrk1/ppp1n1bp/3p2p1/3Ppp2/2P1P3/2N2P2/PP1NB1PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 11,The break.
21,Rb1,a1b1,r1bqnrk1/ppp1n1bp/3p2p1/3Ppp2/2P1P3/2N2P2/PP1NB1PP/1RBQ1RK1 b - - 1 11,White prepares for pushing the queenside pawns.
22,Nf6,e8f6,r1bq1rk1/ppp1n1bp/3p1np1/3Ppp2/2P1P3/2N2P2/PP1NB1PP/1RBQ1RK1 w - - 2 12,Adding pressure on e4. Moving the knight back and forth is not as bad as it would be in open positions. Here it is more important to get to play f5.
23,b4,b2b4,r1bq1rk1/ppp1n1bp/3p1np1/3Ppp2/1PP1P3/2N2P2/P2NB1PP/1RBQ1RK1 b - - 0 12,Continuing the plan. This prepares for c5.
24,f4,f5f4,r1bq1rk1/ppp1n1bp/3p1np1/3Pp3/1PP1Pp2/2N2P2/P2NB1PP/1RBQ1RK1 w - - 0 13,I close the center. I surrender the fight for the center to turn my attention to White's king.
25,Qc2,d1c2,r1bq1rk1/ppp1n1bp/3p1np1/3Pp3/1PP1Pp2/2N2P2/P1QNB1PP/1RB2RK1 b - - 1 13,I think White is a bit too slow here. Direct c5 is what I would do.
26,g5,g6g5,r1bq1rk1/ppp1n1bp/3p1n2/3Pp1p1/1PP1Pp2/2N2P2/P1QNB1PP/1RB2RK1 w - - 0 14,The attack begins.
27,c5,c4c5,r1bq1rk1/ppp1n1bp/3p1n2/2PPp1p1/1P2Pp2/2N2P2/P1QNB1PP/1RB2RK1 b - - 0 14,White plays the expected move.
28,Ng6,e7g6,r1bq1rk1/ppp3bp/3p1nn1/2PPp1p1/1P2Pp2/2N2P2/P1QNB1PP/1RB2RK1 w - - 1 15,"The knight is a more useful piece in the attack, so it occupies a better square."
29,Nc4,d2c4,r1bq1rk1/ppp3bp/3p1nn1/2PPp1p1/1PN1Pp2/2N2P2/P1Q1B1PP/1RB2RK1 b - - 2 15,"This is logical. White adds pressure to d6, which is the base of the pawn chain after the exchange of pawns on d6."
30,Rf7,f8f7,r1bq2k1/ppp2rbp/3p1nn1/2PPp1p1/1PN1Pp2/2N2P2/P1Q1B1PP/1RB2RK1 w - - 3 16,"The purpose of this move might not be obvious at first. It protects the c7-square, which will be important for White, if he wishes to penetrate the position. In addition, it frees the f8-square for other pieces and allows the rook to join the attack if it is needed on the g- of h-files."
31,a4,a2a4,r1bq2k1/ppp2rbp/3p1nn1/2PPp1p1/PPN1Pp2/2N2P2/2Q1B1PP/1RB2RK1 b - - 0 16,"This is unnecessary, I think. I would exchange the pawns now with cxd6."
32,Bf8,g7f8,r1bq1bk1/ppp2r1p/3p1nn1/2PPp1p1/PPN1Pp2/2N2P2/2Q1B1PP/1RB2RK1 w - - 1 17,"The bishop has no future on the long diagonal, because the center is closed, so it helps in defence by over-protecting the important d6-square."
33,cxd6,c5d6,r1bq1bk1/ppp2r1p/3P1nn1/3Pp1p1/PPN1Pp2/2N2P2/2Q1B1PP/1RB2RK1 b - - 0 17,Now White exchanges.
34,cxd6,c7d6,r1bq1bk1/pp3r1p/3p1nn1/3Pp1p1/PPN1Pp2/2N2P2/2Q1B1PP/1RB2RK1 w - - 0 18,I think this is a mistake. The b5-square belongs to the other knight in my opinion. There is no hope breaking through with pawns only.
35,b5,b4b5,r1bq1bk1/pp3r1p/3p1nn1/1P1Pp1p1/P1N1Pp2/2N2P2/2Q1B1PP/1RB2RK1 b - - 0 18,I think this is a mistake. The b5-square belongs to the other knight in my opinion. There is no hope breaking through with pawns only.
