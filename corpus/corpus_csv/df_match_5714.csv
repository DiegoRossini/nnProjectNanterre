1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Right now, in the middle of a Big Freeze, we are all getting ready for Christmas.  Well, here is a little winter-warmer for you.  This is now Expert Draw No. 12 and if Dave, my opponent had just 17 points more on his rating it would have been my third Master Draw.  Still, I am pleased with the result as I got canned by Dave with the black pieces.  So, how did all this come about?  Well, read on.

Black could keep the Witch on the g1-a7 diagonal but Glenda can get in a nice nuisance check on the a3-f8 diagonal.  Black moves his queen onto the e column threatening Qe1# but Henry decided to rid himself of black's dsb.
