10,h6,h7h6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2pp1/3p1n1p/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,Even though I didn't pin the Knight my opponent seems to fear that possibility. He loses a first tempo I think.
11,Be2,f1e2,rnbqkb1r/ppp2pp1/3p1n1p/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,A second tempo loss? I wonder about the reasons of this move? Maybe Nonoanoop will tell us more. Maybe he fears pinned knights but an immediate Nc6 would seriously mine his pawn structure
