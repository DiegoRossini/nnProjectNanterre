1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"Hi everyone!

Here I am white against the same opponent I played in Jo's Great Escape Part 2.  I decide to play the Reti here and see how I get on.  How did I get on?  Well, my opponent played a very unusual move on move 2 and followed it up with a couple of queen moves.  I tried to develop normally but I ended up yet again with an inferior middlegame.  In the latter stages of the middlegame all seemed lost - then Glenda found a good square and I think that the game turned around then because she was the vixen in black's henhouse!"
