1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi all, and here is a game which I believe demonstrates the awesome power of rooks on the 7th rank. This is from Round 3 of the Intermediate 51st GK Tournament, and I open with my usual queen pawn."
2,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"!? Unusual move, but allows a direct transposition into the Pirc Defence, and possibly into a KID."
3,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Another option is 3.f3, soon transposing directly into the Samisch KID. Since I prefer the Averbakh Variation of the KID, this transposition is no good to me, so I resolve to swallow my irritation at not being allowed 3.c4 and develop my queenside knight, allowing a main line Pirc position to form."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p1n2/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"Another option is 3.f3, soon transposing directly into the Samisch KID.

6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2np1n2/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 3 4,"?! Unusual, as the knight can be kicked aroung with 4.d5."
7,d5,d4d5,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2np1n2/3P4/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"Gaining a powerful pawn centre, with tempo. No wonder GameKnot's DB shows excellent statistics for White."

One rook on each open file, bishops have lovely diagonals to rake down. In contrast to Black's rooks, marooned on a8 and h8, and Black's bishop, biting on concrete. This, coupled with Black's awful pawn-structure, gives White a HUUUGGGEEE positional advantage - am I right?"
