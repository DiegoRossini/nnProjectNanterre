1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This game is from another King's Gambit Accepted tournament I joined. In this game I had the black pieces.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,This is the position the games were started in. White to move.
3,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,This is the position the games were started in. White to move.
4,exf4,e5f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,This is the position the games were started in. White to move.
5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 3,A very strange looking move. I believe it to be a bad move. I've talked to my opponent about this particular move after the game. He believes it's OK.
6,Qh4+,d8h4,rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1Pp1q/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 4,It can be dangerous to move the Queen out just three moves into the game. But in this position I believe it to be alright. White can play 3 things. I think them all to be bad.
7,Kf1,e1f1,rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1Pp1q/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1KNR b kq - 3 4,This would be the best of the moves. It can be ok though. White can play Nf3 kicking out the Queen and moving Kf6 followed by Rf1 or Rf2.
8,g5,g7g5,rnb1kbnr/pppp1p1p/8/6p1/2B1Pp1q/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1KNR w kq - 0 5,Now my obvious idea is to rush a King side attack.
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1kbnr/pppp1p1p/8/6p1/2B1Pp1q/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQ1KNR b kq - 1 5,Maybe white could still have play Nf3.
10,g4,g5g4,rnb1kbnr/pppp1p1p/8/8/2B1Pppq/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQ1KNR w kq - 0 6,Stopping the Knight to get where it should be.
11,d4,d2d4,rnb1kbnr/pppp1p1p/8/8/2BPPppq/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQ1KNR b kq - 0 6,Good move. Attack the f pawn while gaining center control.
12,Nf6,g8f6,rnb1kb1r/pppp1p1p/5n2/8/2BPPppq/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQ1KNR w kq - 1 7,I blundered here. I could have played Bh6.
13,g3,g2g3,rnb1kb1r/pppp1p1p/5n2/8/2BPPppq/2N3P1/PPP4P/R1BQ1KNR b kq - 0 7,I think white should have taken the pawn. I don't see the logic in this move.
14,fxg3,f4g3,rnb1kb1r/pppp1p1p/5n2/8/2BPP1pq/2N3p1/PPP4P/R1BQ1KNR w kq - 0 8,Maybe to double my pawns. That's fine for black.
15,Kg2,f1g2,rnb1kb1r/pppp1p1p/5n2/8/2BPP1pq/2N3p1/PPP3KP/R1BQ2NR b kq - 1 8,Making is possible to play hxg3.
16,Nh5,f6h5,rnb1kb1r/pppp1p1p/8/7n/2BPP1pq/2N3p1/PPP3KP/R1BQ2NR w kq - 2 9,Moving the Knight twice. Maybe black had a better move? Push a pawn or develop the dark squared Bishop.
17,Nd5,c3d5,rnb1kb1r/pppp1p1p/8/3N3n/2BPP1pq/6p1/PPP3KP/R1BQ2NR b kq - 3 9,Threatening Nc7  winning the rook. Black can't play Bd6 or Na6 to guard the c7 square. If Bd7 then e5. If Na6 then Bxa6.
18,Kd8,e8d8,rnbk1b1r/pppp1p1p/8/3N3n/2BPP1pq/6p1/PPP3KP/R1BQ2NR w - - 4 10,Obvious.
19,Qe1,d1e1,rnbk1b1r/pppp1p1p/8/3N3n/2BPP1pq/6p1/PPP3KP/R1B1Q1NR b - - 5 10,Good move. Pinning the g3 pawn as well as threatening to play Qa5.
20,c6,c7c6,rnbk1b1r/pp1p1p1p/2p5/3N3n/2BPP1pq/6p1/PPP3KP/R1B1Q1NR w - - 0 11,At this point I noticed a rook fork for white. And this doesn't prevent it.
21,Nc7,d5c7,rnbk1b1r/ppNp1p1p/2p5/7n/2BPP1pq/6p1/PPP3KP/R1B1Q1NR b - - 1 11,There it is. Which is OK for black. You will see why.
22,Kxc7,d8c7,rnb2b1r/ppkp1p1p/2p5/7n/2BPP1pq/6p1/PPP3KP/R1B1Q1NR w - - 0 12,There it is. Which is OK for black. You will see why.
23,Qa5+,e1a5,rnb2b1r/ppkp1p1p/2p5/Q6n/2BPP1pq/6p1/PPP3KP/R1B3NR b - - 1 12,There it is. Which is OK for black. You will see why.
24,b6,b7b6,rnb2b1r/p1kp1p1p/1pp5/Q6n/2BPP1pq/6p1/PPP3KP/R1B3NR w - - 0 13,There it is. Which is OK for black. You will see why.
25,Qe5+,a5e5,rnb2b1r/p1kp1p1p/1pp5/4Q2n/2BPP1pq/6p1/PPP3KP/R1B3NR b - - 1 13,There it is. Which is OK for black. You will see why.
26,Bd6,f8d6,rnb4r/p1kp1p1p/1ppb4/4Q2n/2BPP1pq/6p1/PPP3KP/R1B3NR w - - 2 14,Now black has its dark squared bishop right where it should be.
