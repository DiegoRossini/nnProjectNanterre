1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,A standard move
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Nothing special with this response - quite standard too
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,White wants to challenge the control of the e5 center square. Also developing the black squared bishop by this move.
4,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,This move from black is odd and the variation is called Albin counter gambit. If white takes at e5 it will become a doublepawn that might be able to win back later on. If white takes at e5 its bad by black to take at c4 since after Queen exchanges black cant Castle anymore.
5,dxe5,d4e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pP3/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,White takes at e5. Probably best move.
6,d4,d5d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/2Pp4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Black moves to d4 with his pawn. This is a possible move but maybe not the best. Anyway we have played these moves only for getting to a position where a student can learn alot. Lets see what happens....
7,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/2Pp4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,Another move that can be questioned but just wait and see what happens next.
8,Bb4+,f8b4,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/1bPp4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,Black checks white and white can make 2 ok moves. Please ask the student if he or she can find those 2 moves..
9,Bd2,c1d2,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/1bPp4/4P3/PP1B1PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 2 5,Another option would have been placing the knight there. Moving the king was bad and placing the Queen in front of the king is also a bad sacrifice.
10,dxe3,d4e3,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/1bP5/4p3/PP1B1PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,White can take back the pawn at e3 with the f-pawn. But can it be a better move to take the unprotected black bishop at b4? Think about it..yes or no? Another option could be Qa4 check!
11,Bxb4,d2b4,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/1BP5/4p3/PP3PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,Yes! But now black has some counterplay. Ask the student if he/she can find the right move...give it some time..
12,exf2+,e3f2,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/1BP5/8/PP3pPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,Oh yes! This check is fierce. Flip the board and let the student tell what white should do...
13,Ke2,e1e2,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/1BP5/8/PP2KpPP/RN1Q1BNR b kq - 1 7,Right. Because if whites king takes at f2 then white will lose his Queen since it will become unprotected. Now flip the board and let the student think about what black should do next....
14,fxg1=N+,f2g1n,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/1BP5/8/PP2K1PP/RN1Q1BnR w kq - 0 8,Why promote to knight and not a Queen?! Think about what happens if promoting to anything else but a knight. White will simply exchange queens and take the piece at g1. But when promoting to a knight its check! And white can therefore not make the queenexchange. White must do something about the check first. Ask the student what white should do about the check? Is Rxg1 a good move for example or what?...
15,Ke1,e2e1,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/1BP5/8/PP4PP/RN1QKBnR b kq - 1 8,No! If Rxg1 then the c8 bishop will move to g4 and white will lose the Queen. Therefore white must return to e1 square. Ask the student what black should move now?
16,Qh4+,d8h4,rnb1k1nr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/1BP4q/8/PP4PP/RN1QKBnR w kq - 2 9,Yes! A good move. Please flip the board again and ask what white should do about the check? What will happen if white makes the move g3 for example?
17,Kd2,e1d2,rnb1k1nr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/1BP4q/8/PP1K2PP/RN1Q1BnR b kq - 3 9,If g3 - then Qe4 with a check and the rook at h1 can be taken next move. And white must defend the Qe4 check also and ask the student which move they would make. Be2 or Kf2 or Kd2 or even Qe2? But Queen e2 is dumb since the knight can take it then. Ok so g3 was bad and therefore white made the move Kd2 as we could see here. Now as a last question you can ask 2 questions in this lesson to the student. First of all - how many checks can black do? Its ok to show also idiotmoves. Tell them to show all squares where you can check. Last of all. Ask which move your student would make here.
18,Qd8+,h4d8,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/1BP5/8/PP1K2PP/RN1Q1BnR w kq - 4 10,These are the squares Qd8 Qh6 Qg5 Qf4 Qf2 Qe1 Qd4 Nf3. Maybe none of the checks are best move. Bg4 would develop a piece and might be worth to mention. End of lesson.
