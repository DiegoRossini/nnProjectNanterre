I thought that I would try the Bishop's Opening against him and try and get a game like my evergreen Battle of the Wings against him.  It didn't work out, however, and I ended up losing my 7th game on the bounce against him, aargh! - Joanne"

Kh8 - here I wave the white flag on the grounds of unavoidable mate on g2 or h2 and there is no way I can try and get a perpetual with Glenda and my other rook all bottled up on the queenside.  A sorry end.  Hope you have enjoyed this lesson.  For further examples of this type of attack I would recommend you read J N Walker's Attack on the King which devotes a chapter to how locking up the centre can lead to mating attacks on the enemy king when you castle on the same side as your opponent.  If your opponent's pieces are locked in on the other side of the board you can afford to expose your king here.  A cautionary tale however is that if the centre is not locked then you may be punished for moving pawns in front of your castled king as Glenda has netted a few lower rated victims that way!  Anyhow, I will not give up the fight, one day I will get my first half point against an Expert!  Unitl then I will keep smiling.  Cheers - Joanne"
