3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"The Ruy Lopez. I was tempted to play 3. Bc4 here but I did not want the possibility of my opponent playing the Two Knights Defense with 3... Nf6 so I decided to play the ""Spanish Torture"", an opening I have played from the Black side many times."

6,d6,d7d6,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,"Generally considered a weaker response to Black's 3rd move. While solid, it blocks in Black's DSB and gives White an immediate space advantage"
7,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/1B2p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,White gleefully takes control of the center. He will hope to use his center control and space advantage in the middlegame

11,O-O,e1g1,r2qkbnr/pppb1ppp/2np4/1B6/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 2 6,My coach told me after the game that castling Queenside is more common in this variation but I still feel comfortable on the Kingside.
12,Nxd4,c6d4,r2qkbnr/pppb1ppp/3p4/1B6/3nP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,Black takes the knight occupying the center and exposes an attack on the Bishop on b5

14,Qxd7,d8d7,r3kbnr/pppq1ppp/3p4/8/3nP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,"This Queen becomes a very powerful piece. Normally it is not best to bring your queen out so early but in this case, Black can not easily disturb her from her menacing spot in the center."
15,Qxd4,d1d4,r3kbnr/pppq1ppp/3p4/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 0 8,"This Queen becomes a very powerful piece. Normally it is not best to bring your queen out so early but in this case, Black can not easily disturb her from her menacing spot in the center."

18,O-O-O,e8c8,2kr1bnr/p1pq1ppp/1p1p4/8/3QP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 2 10,As expected
19,a4,a2a4,2kr1bnr/p1pq1ppp/1p1p4/8/P2QP3/2N5/1PP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 0 10,"! Simple but strong. Black must react to White's threat of 11.a5, breaking down Black's wall"
20,a5,a7a5,2kr1bnr/2pq1ppp/1p1p4/p7/P2QP3/2N5/1PP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 0 11,Weakens the light squares even further but Black doesn't have any other better alternative

25,cxd5,c4d5,2kr1b1r/2pq1ppp/1p1p4/p2P4/P2QP3/8/1P3PPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 0 13,Now White has an open c-file that his rooks can attack on. White seems to have a good edge here
26,c5,c7c5,2kr1b1r/3q1ppp/1p1p4/p1pP4/P2QP3/8/1P3PPP/R1B2RK1 w - c6 0 14,? Blunders the exchange. It is best not to move pawns out in front of your castled king because there will be many threats that can be created by the newly formed open lines.
