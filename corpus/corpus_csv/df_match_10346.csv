1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,So 1.Nf3. the reti. as i said previously i seen that most common was d5 then c5. however i played 1.c5 as this guy did in his match basically to see what this guy on the website was talking about. he said that the opening upto 8. O-O was strong and gave black a good position for advancement on whites queenside.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,"should say i played this opponent previously and he started with reti, kings indian attack so i assumed after 1. Nf3 he would do the same so it would give me time to set the opening up."
3,g3,g2g3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/8/5NP1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,"preventing advancement of knight, opening diagonal for queen and giving support for d4."

6,g6,g7g6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/2p5/8/2P2NP1/PP1PPP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"I was worried about going for this type of defence as i very seldom use it but as i was curious about the opening and as it seemed a strong opening i decided just to do what was written down and see where it took me win, lose or draw. this does put pressure on d4 but if white moves d4 black simply moves d6 then e5."
7,Bg2,f1g2,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/2p5/8/2P2NP1/PP1PPPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"I was worried about going for this type of defence as i very seldom use it but as i was curious about the opening and as it seemed a strong opening i decided just to do what was written down and see where it took me win, lose or draw. this does put pressure on d4 but if white moves d4 black simply moves d6 then e5."

9,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/2p5/8/2P2NP1/PP1PPPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 3 5,perhaps a bit early white should have put more pressure on center here. makes no diffence this early on though.
10,e5,e7e5,r1bqk1nr/pp1p1pbp/2n3p1/2p1p3/8/2P2NP1/PP1PPPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 6,gives black the upper hand in the battle for middle earth.

12,Nge7,g8e7,r1bqk2r/pp1pnpbp/2n3p1/2p1p3/4P3/2P2NP1/PP1P1PBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 7,again something i never usually do. only if i am under threat do i play Ng-e7 usually go for Nf6. after this game however i use this more frequently.
13,d3,d2d3,r1bqk2r/pp1pnpbp/2n3p1/2p1p3/4P3/2PP1NP1/PP3PBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,"Thats me finished with the opening now, a nice defensive situation for black dont particularly like the dark squared white bishop on g5 as i can be a nuisance to get rid of i could move h7 to chase it but that weakens the pawn structure defending my king. (from now on i play my own game with the advice of going for a queen side attack)"

18,a5,a7a5,r1bq1rk1/1p2npbp/2np2p1/p1p1p1B1/4P3/2PP1NP1/PP1N1PBP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 10,redeploying the troops to cope with the advancement. dont think this is necessary at this stage.

21,Nc2,e1c2,r1bq1rk1/4npbp/2np2p1/ppp1p1B1/4P3/2PP2P1/PPNN1PBP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 11,"positioned so 12.....,b4 13.cxb4, axb4 14. either qb1 rendering it useless for a while or b3. giving me a territorial advantage and giving white less room to maneuver."

24,b4,b5b4,r2q1rk1/4npbp/2npb1p1/p1p1p1B1/1p2P3/N1PP2P1/PP1N1PBP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 13,doesn't fancy the swap so moves knight. i really dont like the position of the knight but bxc4 results in Nxc4. also if he moves dxc4....so no sir i dont like it!! bishop for knight out of the question.
25,Nac4,a3c4,r2q1rk1/4npbp/2npb1p1/p1p1p1B1/1pN1P3/2PP2P1/PP1N1PBP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 13,doesn't fancy the swap so moves knight. i really dont like the position of the knight but bxc4 results in Nxc4. also if he moves dxc4....so no sir i dont like it!! bishop for knight out of the question.

30,h6,h7h6,r2q1rk1/4npb1/2npb1pp/2p1p1B1/p3P3/2PPN1P1/P2N1PBP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 16,since i want the queen on a5 i have to chase the bishop contrary to what i said about potential weakening of the pawn structure. could have moved Qa5 but white c4 didn't appeal to me.
31,Bxe7,g5e7,r2q1rk1/4Bpb1/2npb1pp/2p1p3/p3P3/2PPN1P1/P2N1PBP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 16,2 options here. i decide to put my plan of Qa5 on hold and take with the queen. this does not help with trying to get tempo back but it does keep my d6 pawn well protected.
