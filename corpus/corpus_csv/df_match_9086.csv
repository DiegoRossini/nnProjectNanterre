1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Hi everyone!  Just to say that I had a narrow squeak against wakefire who played very well and my position had the worrying hallmark of a jstevens1 game - passive but just about able to hold things together.  My passed c pawn saved the day and prompted my opponent's draw offer which I gratefully accepted!  Cheers.  Joanne
