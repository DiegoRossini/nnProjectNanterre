1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"1. e4 allows me play Caro-Kann defence.
Originally mentioned by Polerio in 1590, the Defense was rarely played until H. Caro of Berlin and M. Kann of Vienna seriously analyzed it in the 1890s. Capablanca frequently played it to avoid book lines. It can be highly successful against aggressive opponents but the CK lacks attacking possibilities. Patience and endgame skill are usually needed by Black to win."
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"With Caro-Kann Black stakes a claim to the central squares and seeks free development. While solid, it is by no means a drawing weapon - resulting positions generally contain at least a degree of imbalance and the critical lines lead to sharp positions with chances for both sides."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"It is not mandatory. White have few other alternatives and the most promising is 2. Nc3 leading (2. ... d5 3. Nf3) to Two Knights variation or to Spielmann attack (2. ... d5 3. Qf3). Other good alternative is Steiner attack 2. c4!? White can select Old Indian like structure with 2. d3 (Breyer variation or Stein attack). Rarely used moves are 2. Ne2, 2. b3, 2. Nf3, 2. f4 (with tranposition to Advanced variation), 2. g3, 2. Bc4?! (Hillbilly attack) and 2. Qe2 (in Russian book, I found that it was proposed by ""Нипхауз"", but I can't identify that master - (Niphouse?) )"
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Caro Kan defence -- good even for blitz!
5,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3P4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"I found that Exchange variation is not so simply as it seems, so I started to take more attention to it.
The Exchange variation is a rare guest at modern tournaments. For its apparently non-aggressive approach, most books don't take it seriously and guarantee Black equality. But remember - Bobby Fisher used it against T. Petrosian, one of the greatest defenders of all time!
And it is a prelude to Panov attack!"
6,cxd5,c6d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"(3. ... Qxd5 is a transposition to Scandinavian...)
Asymmetric pawn structure in the center define plans: a) initiative of White at King wing (e-file and e5 square); b) attack of Black’s pawn minority at Queen wing (b7-b5-b4) and pressure using c file. And Black can organize their minority attack easier than White - to attack at King wing (related to some level of risk).
But that did not happen in this game..."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"Not the most common move - but it seems that White likes that development schema (Nf3, Bf4) and uses it in many beginnings...
Usually there you will meet 3. Bd3 (Rubinstein variation; does not allowing Bf5) but it is acceptable to play immediately 4. c3
4. c4 starts Panov-Botvinnik attack but that is another story!
--
One of the first games of this variation was played about 130 years ago: Noa-Winawer, London, 1883:
4. Nf3 Nc6 5. Bb5 Qb6 6. Nc3 e6 7. a3 Nf6 8. 0-0 Bd6 9. Bd3 Bd7 10. Ne2 Bc8 11. c3 Ne7 12. h3 h6 13. Bb1 Vc7 following long (100 moves, proposed by 1951 “Chess Review”  as “the dullest game ever played) and maneuvering game in which Black had a success."
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,"Another possible move is 4. ... Nc6. It is possible to meet 4. ... Bg4 and 4. ... g6
I consider 4. ... Bf5 as possibly dangerous (for example, 5. Nc3 e6 6. Bb5 Nc6 7. Ne5 with sme pressure)"
9,Bf4,c1f4,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p4/3P1B2/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 3 5,"I looked into some games of my opponent and saw that he likes that development schema (Nf3 + Bf4) and uses it for various openings.
Popular moves here are 5. Nc3 and 5. Bd3. Possible moves are 5. Bb5+ and 5. c3
5. c4 lead to Panov-Botvinnik attack (again)"

I see one of its advantages - it doesn't allow Bg4 piining Knight at f3"

--- 7. ... g6 - also one of possibilities"

... good move is 8. Be2, too. But that in the game creates fire on the board, immediately..."

It seems it is acceptable 11. Bxh6 and then Black has two responses (at first sight, both looks acceptable):
A) 11. ... d4 12. Bd2 dxc3 13. Bxc3 Qc7
B) 11. ... gxh6 12. Qd4 Bg7"
