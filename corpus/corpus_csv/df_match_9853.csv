I thought black cannot defend c6 but taking my knight with Bd6xe5. I planned this from the moment I moved my bishop to b5. After this, queen exchange is forced since the black knight is pinned. That leaves me with a rook on my d column, and his knight is not in a comfortable position: if it goes to h5, it's only plan can be to move f6, allowing to exchange my doubled e5 pawn.

Queen castle is not so important, since the b column is open for him. Though, he cannot take too much advantage of it. With the castling, b2 is defended by my king and if he want to use his pawns to attack, it is a long journey and it would be easy for me to defend. 
In order to complement the 13� move's considerations, his knight can go to d5, blocking the d column to my rook action (aiming to d8), and threatening an attack on my queen's pawns. But I again can defend it easily with rook d4, that both takes the e4 pawn and prevents Kb4. He can go on with c5, supporting his knight, to which I could have answered a3. 
This leaves the time for him to castle, but if he does so, I would have played rook g1, threatening bishop h6, and planned to advance my h pawn too. I think it would have been his best plan, though.
