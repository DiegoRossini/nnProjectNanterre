4,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,The Slav. I love playing both sides of this opening.
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"!? Not a good move, not a bad move. Personally, I like to develop my bishop to g5 on occasion and pin the f-knight, but this doesn't look to be the time to accomplish that."
6,h6,h7h6,rnbqkbnr/pp2ppp1/2p4p/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"!? Not a good move, not a bad move. Personally, I like to develop my bishop to g5 on occasion and pin the f-knight, but this doesn't look to be the time to accomplish that."

9,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qkbnr/pp2ppp1/2p4p/3p1b2/2PP1B2/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 3 5,Piece number 3 activated.

11,e4,e2e4,rn1qkbnr/pp2ppp1/2p4p/5b2/2pPPB2/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"Dual threat. Not sure if this is the best way to recover the pawn, but it does force my oppenent to lose a tempo to deal with the bishop."
