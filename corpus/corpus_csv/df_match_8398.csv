2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"The Gruenfeld Defence. Black offers White the chance to grab a big pawn centre, which he will then try to undermine. The sharp Classical Exchange Variation runs 4.cxd5 Nxd5 5.e4 Nxc3 6.bxc3, and White has a massive pawn centre, but Black will place intense pressure on this pawn centre with 6...Bg7 7...c5 8...Nc6. However, if White can hold on to his pawn centre, he can expect an edge in the middlegame."

When I used to mess around with 3.c5 or 4.c5 for White in queen pawn openings, I soon realised this, so I used to try to complicate things and throw a spanner in Black's works with Qa5+. Clearly my opponent was thinking along the same lines.
