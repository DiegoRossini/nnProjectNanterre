Two bishops tend to be better than two knights or a bishop and a knight, so the swap is beneficial for white generally. It also gives you an unpleasant choice. Either capture with the king, leaving it exposed in the centre and unable to castle, or capture with the queen and lose the knight at e4 (it is then pinned and you cannot escape from the d or f pawns if I advance them).

Something like Bb5 would retain the initiative and allow Ne4 to follow anyway."
