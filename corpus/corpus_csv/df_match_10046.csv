1,Na3,b1a3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/N7/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 1,"This is a famous game between lord Jabborg (playing white) and his elderly pet lobster 'Carlsberg' (playing black). The game took place on the top floor of Willy Wonkz palace, submerged in the 'purple ocean' 45 goblemetres Northwest of the historical sinking of the 'Flying Fangerblot' at minus 3 minutes to 37 o clock on the 91.5th of Krumpember year 208 (since Wacky World was first discovered). The game contains moments of genius, melancholy, evil and madness and is one of the most celebrated games in western Wacky World (of course, only among the Squoppulant race).

The 1st Move is the most conventional opener since Wacky World was discovered."
