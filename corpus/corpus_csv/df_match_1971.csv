1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"An unusual opening leads to approximate opening equality, but Black gets an edge in the middlegame when White fails to fix his defects efficiently and wins late as a direct result of early issues."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The Englund Gambit Accepted.  White could have ""opted out"" with 2.e4 with a counter gambit offer (The Danish/Goring/Scotch Gambit complex).  Interesting also is 2.d5."

4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4P3/8/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"Black's options include 2...f6 and 2...d6.  The latter can transpose to a gambit line of Black's in the Philidor.  The Englund Gambit coplex is actually three or four different gambits.  The Soller (2...f6), the Englund (2...Nc6), the Hartlaub (2...d6) and the Blackburne which arises out of the Hartlaub.  I have also experimented with 2...Bc5, then 3...Qe7 and perhaps 4...Nc6, but this is sometimes cumbersome against best play by White and definitely difficult to play under such circumstances.  If white hesitates however..."
5,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4P3/8/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 3,"If White wants to test Black, then a different third move is probably needed.  A favorite is 3.Qd5."
6,Qe7,d8e7,r1b1kbnr/ppppqppp/2n5/4P3/8/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 3 4,Maybe 6.c4 is better?

12,Bb4,f8b4,r1b1k1nr/pppp1ppp/8/4q3/1b6/2N1P3/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 7,Wisely unpinning the Queen's Knight immediately before Black can build any significant pressure.

14,Nf6,g8f6,r1b1k2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4q3/1b6/2N1P3/PPPB1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 4 8,The opening is pretty much over and in taking stock we see Black has a healthy bit of the center and a Queen that might be attacked while White is solid and ready to push e3-e4. If White gets the e4 push in soon the Black Queen may need to take time to move to a safe square.  Dynamic equality?

19,a3,a2a3,r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/5n2/3pq3/1b6/P1NBP3/1PPB1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 10,Initially 10.a3 moves Black's Bishop to a very threatening position.  Which is not particularly strong as White easily parries the mating threat. Most likely the Black Bishop is going to eventually need to re-position so maybe 10.g3 to counter the expected ...Bd6 is convincing? A different plan with Re1 and e4 is in order too.  I suspect 10. a3 is to help implement e3-e4.

22,Qe6,e5e6,r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/3bqn2/3p4/5P2/P1NBP3/1PPB2PP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 1 12,An interesting solution!
23,f5,f4f5,r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/3bqn2/3p1P2/8/P1NBP3/1PPB2PP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 12,An interesting solution!
24,Qe5,e6e5,r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/3b1n2/3pqP2/8/P1NBP3/1PPB2PP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 1 13,Maybe 11.g3 (or even 10.g3) was better since White now ends up playing it to stop another mating threat? Seems like it is always easier to see stuff after the fact.
25,g3,g2g3,r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/3b1n2/3pqP2/8/P1NBP1P1/1PPB3P/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 13,Dreaming of ...Nxg3 sacks....

White makes certain all I can do is dream about those sacks. I expected 14. Bxe4 however.  White's pawn structure will soon be inferior to Black's. Depending on your viewpoint you might say the same situation existed at move 8.

37,Rf1,a1f1,r4rk1/ppp2p1p/6p1/4bq2/4N2Q/P3P1P1/1PPB3P/5RK1 b - - 3 19,Now 19.Ng5 does not seem convincing to me. The game move seems best for White.
