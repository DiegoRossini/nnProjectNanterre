1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"what a strange game, with Svetlana (who, btw, won very nicely the second game we played). Not really the opening, nor the middle game, but most of all the endgame. I passed by moments of rejoice and total depression about my necessity of winning the game. Please go and check the key moments of this game"
