1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This is by far the most popular opening move.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I personally don't like playing against the kings gambit. The centre usually belongs to white although you may have an extra pawn or not.
3,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,I personally don't like playing against the kings gambit. The centre usually belongs to white although you may have an extra pawn or not.
4,exf4,e5f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,exf4 if probably the best option. Second best would be d5
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,Most popular and less riskiest ( Not sure if that is even a word) kings gambit continuation. This move prevent Qh4+
6,h6,h7h6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1pp1/7p/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,This is the Beckers defense. The idea is that it will support a g5 thrust and controls the aggressive square g5 for the knight.
7,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1pp1/7p/8/2B1Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,Continues to add pressure on f7. Any moment he can play Ne5
8,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/3p3p/8/2B1Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,I have strong dark squares but weak light squares.

11,d3,d2d3,rn1qkbnr/ppp2pp1/3pb2p/8/2B1Pp2/3P1N2/PPP3PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 6,Pretty strange move. The idea was probably that he didn't want me to take on e6 with my pawn and play e5 with a nice pawn chain.
