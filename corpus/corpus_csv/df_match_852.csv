1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"English Opening - so far at least.  The thing can transpose into all sorts of other openings, yet retains an independent significance of its own.  For years it was my favourite OTB (over-the-board) opening move."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Symmetrical English.  Often leads to slow, positional manoeuvring.  Yeah.  Right."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"On other occasions I've played 2.Nc3 or 2.g3, both popular and playable lines."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"Played about as often as 2...Nf6.  Also playable is 2...g6, and even 3...b6 has been tried several times."
5,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"(!?) A departure from my usual modus operandi.  Normally I would play 3.Nc3 or 3.g3, but today I thought I'd play something a bit different.  This thrust is as popular as the alternatives."
6,cxd4,c5d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/2Pp4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Almost a 'gimme'.  On rare occasions other moves have been tried, with some success, but there seems to be no reason not to take White's centre pawn for a centre-flank one."
7,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/2PN4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"Also playable is 4...g6, and 4...e6 is worth considering.  Quite a few other moves have been tried here, with varying success: ...Qb6!?, ...e5!?, even ...f5, among others even more obscure."
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/2PN4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"Also playable is 4...g6, and 4...e6 is worth considering.  Quite a few other moves have been tried here, with varying success: ...Qb6!?, ...e5!?, even ...f5, among others even more obscure."
9,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/2PN4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,"Normal.  Also playable is 5...g3.  You might have noted that my comments so far have been fairly repetitive.  What this shows is that there is plenty to select from in this opening.  It is very flexible, and, may I say, forgiving."
10,e6,e7e6,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/8/2PN4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Probably safest.  Had Black played 5...g6, I would almost certainly have replied 6.e4, transposing the game into a type of Sicilian Defence with a Moroczy Bind - where White's c- and e-pawns put a crimp in Black's counter-actions in the centre and Q-side."
11,g3,g2g3,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/8/2PN4/2N3P1/PP2PP1P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"Still 'Book'.  Also playable here was the more aggressive and adventurous 6.Ndb5, seeking to exploit the dark square weaknesses that have appeared at d6 and c7.  Something like this might have occurred: 6.Ndb5 d5  7.Bf4 e5 8.cxd5 exf4  9.dxc6 bxc6  10.Qxd8ch Kxd8 11.Rd1ch (or 0-0-0ch) with a game hard to call. But keep this knight move in mind...! +++++ Also possible was 6.a3, which has been tried, presumably to inhibit ...Bb4, and maybe with an idea, somewhere down the track,  of a general advance on the Q-side."
12,Qb6,d8b6,r1b1kb1r/pp1p1ppp/1qn1pn2/8/2PN4/2N3P1/PP2PP1P/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,"Quite a popular move here.  Also playable are [A] 6...Bc5, attacking the d4-knight and indirectly, f2:  7.Nb3 Bb4 8.Bg2, OR [B] 6... Bb4  7.Bg2.  In neither line does White concern himself overmuch about the possibility of ...Bxc3, doubling and isolating the c-pawns.  I suspect the central squares under their control would be the more significant positional factor, at least early in the middle game."
13,Ndb5,d4b5,r1b1kb1r/pp1p1ppp/1qn1pn2/1N6/2P5/2N3P1/PP2PP1P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 7,"Issuing a challenge.  Less popular than the more supple 7.Nb3, it is much the more aggressive line.  You might recall that this move was playable earlier."
14,Bc5,f8c5,r1b1k2r/pp1p1ppp/1qn1pn2/1Nb5/2P5/2N3P1/PP2PP1P/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 3 8,"Challenge accepted!  Now we're for it.  The move attacks f2, and although 8.e3 would mask the weak spot, the weakened light squares and shut-in Queen's bishop would be a high price to pay.  So what should White do?"
15,Bg2,f1g2,r1b1k2r/pp1p1ppp/1qn1pn2/1Nb5/2P5/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 4 8,[!] White ignores the threat.  It so happens there was an alternative defence: 8.Nd6ch Ke7  9.Nde4 Nxe4  10.Nxd4 with an OK game for White.  But I still prefer the fighting text move!
16,Bxf2+,c5f2,r1b1k2r/pp1p1ppp/1qn1pn2/1N6/2P5/2N3P1/PP2PbBP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,"Interesting!  At this point the GK engine calls the game dead even.  The GK World database has 10 examples of this line up to White's 8th move, but only one in which Black played this checking capture.  The other tries were: 8...a6 (6); 8...d5 (2); 8.Ne5 (1 - though this probably transposed into something else in the database)."
17,Kf1,e1f1,r1b1k2r/pp1p1ppp/1qn1pn2/1N6/2P5/2N3P1/PP2PbBP/R1BQ1K1R b kq - 1 9,There was nothing attractive about 9.Kd2.
18,Ng4,f6g4,r1b1k2r/pp1p1ppp/1qn1p3/1N6/2P3n1/2N3P1/PP2PbBP/R1BQ1K1R w kq - 2 10,"Homing in upon f2, and looking at e3 and h2 as well.  Among other nastinesses, I was now faced with the possibility of ...Nxh2+; Rxh2 Bxg3 with the rook attacked and mate in one threatened.  What to do?"
19,Qd6,d1d6,r1b1k2r/pp1p1ppp/1qnQp3/1N6/2P3n1/2N3P1/PP2PbBP/R1B2K1R b kq - 3 10,"Counter-attack! - but a dual-purpose move, too.  White threatens a fork (double attack) by Nc7ch, but at the same time defends the g3 square.  This puts paid to 10...Nxh2ch, which would simply lose a piece."
20,Kd8,e8d8,r1bk3r/pp1p1ppp/1qnQp3/1N6/2P3n1/2N3P1/PP2PbBP/R1B2K1R w - - 4 11,"Stops White's Nc7ch threat.  Now a battle rages for the initiative.  For the moment Black's attack has stalled, but White has to take energetic measures to seize and keep the initiative."
21,Na4,c3a4,r1bk3r/pp1p1ppp/1qnQp3/1N6/N1P3n1/6P1/PP2PbBP/R1B2K1R b - - 5 11,Driving the Queen from the critical diagonal seems a good place to start.
