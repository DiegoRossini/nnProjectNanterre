9,d4,d2d4,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4bn2/8/2PP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,Another thematic second-best move. My opp. is testing my knowledges.
10,Bb4+,f8b4,rn1qk2r/ppp2ppp/4bn2/8/1bPP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,...or Qe7. White will lose his d4 pawn or the exchange.
11,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qk2r/ppp2ppp/4bn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 6,...or Qe7. White will lose his d4 pawn or the exchange.

13,Bd2,c1d2,rn1qk2r/ppp2ppp/4b3/8/1bPPn3/2N5/PP1B1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 4 7,White must defend f2.
14,Qxd4,d8d4,rn2k2r/ppp2ppp/4b3/8/1bPqn3/2N5/PP1B1PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 8,White must defend f2.
15,Nxe4,c3e4,rn2k2r/ppp2ppp/4b3/8/1bPqN3/8/PP1B1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 8,Qe7 is another playable move here. My answer is forced: Qxb2 is just ugly.
16,Qxe4+,d4e4,rn2k2r/ppp2ppp/4b3/8/1bP1q3/8/PP1B1PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 9,"Here, the only thing I'll get would be his K exposed while I will be able to castle. But is more than nothing, with a stronger opponent! But it is true that, looking closely, now ...BxB+, 10. KxB, Qd4+, threatening b2, may whorth a look."
17,Qe2,d1e2,rn2k2r/ppp2ppp/4b3/8/1bP1q3/8/PP1BQPPP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 1 9,"Here, the only thing I'll get would be his K exposed while I will be able to castle.

18,Qxe2+,e4e2,rn2k2r/ppp2ppp/4b3/8/1bP5/8/PP1BqPPP/R3KBNR w KQkq - 0 10,"Now it comes the problem: how to continue? Do I grab the centered K advantage? I decide yes, but Nc6 can be interesting, in view of 11. Bf3? (BxB+, KxB, Nd4+, exchanging the Wlsb). But he won't have fallen for it."
19,Bxe2,f1e2,rn2k2r/ppp2ppp/4b3/8/1bP5/8/PP1BBPPP/R3K1NR b KQkq - 0 10,"Now it comes the problem: how to continue? Do I grab the centered K advantage? I decide yes, but Nc6 can be interesting, in view of 11. Bf3? (BxB+, KxB, Nd4+, exchanging the Wlsb). But he won't have fallen for it."
20,Bxd2+,b4d2,rn2k2r/ppp2ppp/4b3/8/2P5/8/PP1bBPPP/R3K1NR w KQkq - 0 11,"Now what? o-o is probably right, but I wanted to be sure he won't grab so much space and action with his lsb, so I dared to play..."
21,Kxd2,e1d2,rn2k2r/ppp2ppp/4b3/8/2P5/8/PP1KBPPP/R5NR b kq - 0 11,"Now what? o-o is probably right, but I wanted to be sure he won't grab so much space and action with his lsb, so I dared to play..."
22,c5,c7c5,rn2k2r/pp3ppp/4b3/2p5/2P5/8/PP1KBPPP/R5NR w kq - 0 12,"...weakening b7. Now, if Bf3, Nc6, and I'll accept gladly the doubled pawns keeping the only lsb on the board. Was it a good decision?"
23,Nf3,g1f3,rn2k2r/pp3ppp/4b3/2p5/2P5/5N2/PP1KBPPP/R6R b kq - 1 12,"He apparently didn't see too much advantage in grabbing the diagonal, and, very ""old-schoolisly"", developed."
24,Nc6,b8c6,r3k2r/pp3ppp/2n1b3/2p5/2P5/5N2/PP1KBPPP/R6R w kq - 2 13,"Now, I want to win a tempo by castling Qside and chech him. But h6 should be on my agenda."
25,a3,a2a3,r3k2r/pp3ppp/2n1b3/2p5/2P5/P4N2/1P1KBPPP/R6R b kq - 0 13,"He, righly, protects my N's possible entryon b4. This allows me to play Na5, threatening the fork check on b2. I missed it, unfortunately."

29,Bd3,e2d3,2krr3/pp3ppp/2n1b3/2p5/2P5/P1KB1N2/1P3PPP/R6R b - - 4 15,"If white plays b4, I'd play Bh3. Either bxB, RxB, or Bf1 (otherwise, Bxb2 forks N and R), and I can retire the B where I like to. He is threatening h7 here, but it is doubtful he can release the B after g6, in the long run."
30,Bg4,e6g4,2krr3/pp3ppp/2n5/2p5/2P3b1/P1KB1N2/1P3PPP/R6R w - - 5 16,"The idea is that if Bxh7, BxN and after g6 the B is trapped. Not so simple, though..."
