Rarely played at higher level due to it being deeply analyzed and White has extremely good chances to hold a draw or even to go for a win. However, never underestimate your opponent.. a novelty can be winning only by being new even if it is not neccessarily ground braking. As they say the result of the World Tltle Matches usually depends on such novelties."

It casually ignores the fact Black is attacking a centre pawn and goes on with the normal Spanish plan. 4.Nc3 or 4.d3 would have defended the pawn, though both has drawbacks as well. 4.Nc3 develops a piece to a good position for it but seriously decreses the manouvering area of the b5 bishop and 4.d3 is slow and passive, hence looses tempo."
8,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/2n2n2/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 6 5,An aggressive move to put more and more pressure on Black. 6.c3 might have been better or equally good but definitely a lot slower.

Black is relatively well developed and his defence is solid after castling while White is behind in development so it was worth considering some more to do on that area rather than rushing ahead. The only achievment White can come up with is that he has already castled. 8.Nc3 was more mature and careful here with developing a piece (no more need to take care about the b5 bishop). What can I say, I got excited and ignored the basic opening principals.."

Bxc6 9.Nc3 0-0 10.Qe2 Qd7 11.Bf4 Bxb5 12.Nxb5 would have helped White in eliminating his only clash.. being underdeveloped. Too much complication without a clear adventage, better to avoid it."

Possible alternatives are 9... Rb8 to occupy the half-open b-file of 9... 0-0 to put the king into safety.

Would have doubled the attack on e4 and by that would have forced White to withdraw his bishop to e4.

Not even mentioning that it is always easier to calculate with forced moves."

Ne8 is a firm option though, it is passive and even if it opens up the f-file the c4 bishop prevents Black to use it. This also means that the f-rook gets closed up.. so Black would have set up a defence giving White a chance for a full-scale attack. More or less the same holds to 12... Nh7 13.Qd3 Rb8 14.Qg6! where Black is struggling heavily. Taking back: 12... dxe5 did not work due to 13.Nxe5! threatening with a breakthrough on f7."

I would like to state that this move is easy to critisize but it is just as easy to overlook next to the board. Its major point is to block the white bishop's way to f7 while attacking it so White either accepts the exchange that might make Black's life a bit (and just a bit) easier: 14.Bxe6 fxe6 15.exd6!! or defends it that really favours for Black. 13... Rb8 or 13... Bc6 were more fortunate options. All those that blame my opponent here for this mistake I would like to ask if they would really have made it better? I have to admin that I would most probably have made the very same move he did.
