6,c5,c6c5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2ppP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"This offers to transpose into a French Defense perhaps, and plays an early c5 to undermine d4, with the idea of if dxc then maybe Qa5+ with the semi open c file and a nice spot for the queen on c7 after Be3"
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2ppP3/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"Certainly not the only move, developing the lsb before closing the pawn chain is to be considered too"

9,Nxd4,f3d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3pP3/3N4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"Objectionable I think, the pawn has no future with two attackers and no defensive resources available.  I considered developing Nbd2 to b3 with a strongly posted knight on d4.  This move opens up the Queen to access the light diagonal on the KS for hopes of a Qg4 if the bishop leaves its defense of g7"
10,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/3pP3/3N4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"This is a French Defense type transposition now, locking in the lsb of black."
11,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/3pP3/3N4/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"A natural square for the bishop, preparing to castle if desired.   Nbd2 again possible or maybe the fianchettoing of the dsb to eye the KS."

I do not think in retrospect that this knight belongs on b3, but it gains the tempo on black's valued dsb and forces the question of which diagonal it shall possess.  It stakes out control of d4 still"

14,Bb6,c5b6,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/1b2p3/3pP3/8/1N1B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 8,"An aggressive move recommended by Dzindzichashvili in some of his interesting Bd2 lines against the Winnawer pin on the c3 knight in the advance French, it makes sense to play this now that the bishop has committed itself away from the defense of the pawn and g6 is an awkward weakening of the dark squares on black's KS."

16,Ne7,g8e7,rnbqk2r/pp2nppp/1b2p3/3pP3/6Q1/1N1B4/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 6 9,"I saw the chance for the following: Qxg7 Rg8 Qxh7 Rxg2 Be3 Bxe3 fxe3 and the position is jumbled a bit with doubled e pawns for white but the outside passed h pawn.  White will castle QS and pursue KS initiative now that  it is opened.    White has good control on d4, but the position is unclear in my mind, at least so it was otb."
17,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqk2r/pp2nppp/1b2p3/3pP1B1/6Q1/1N1B4/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R b KQkq - 7 9,"!? The idea is simple, though perhaps not to be recommended.  I made it in the mindset of a quick attack, though it really just gives tempi to black in his defense which gets hi pieces to agreeable squares and allows him the development lead"

19,Bb5,d3b5,r1bqk2r/pp2nppp/1bn1p3/1B1pP1B1/6Q1/1N6/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R b KQkq - 9 10,"? This is just a bad move, and commits the lsb to a poor diagonal.  It allows and encourages Bd7, developing black's lsb naturally.  This is the second time this bishop has moved in the opening, so for beginners this should be made a special note of how not to play the opening.  Better wa s Nbd2 with ideas of castling long and after h6 most likely Bxe7 to save the tempo as it would be awkward to retreat the bishop, and on h5 the same response most likely as the one to h6, with some slight danger because of Bxf2+ not Kxf2 for then Qb6+ winning white's queen.  The threat by black's knight against e5 is temporarily blunted by the pin, but this is a quick fix and soon white finds himself tied up by his own initiative."

This commits giving away the bishop pair for absolutely nothing (the way I play it, which is a good note to the beginner as well, don't give away the bishop pair, note even for a pawn or even two pawns in an open position)."
