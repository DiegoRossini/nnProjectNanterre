5,Nd2,b1d2,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,I believe this to be the best option as you don't have to deal with the annoying pin with Nc3.  However it is going to delay the c1 bishops development.

In hind sight I should have probably played 11. f4 instead of Nf3. But in closed games the action is not happening quickly so I have time to make these strange moves.

However I wasn't ready to give up my good bishop for a knight.

The knight on a4 is a great paralyzing piece for black as it inhibited both my c1 bishop and a1 rook from coming into the game.  However black really doesn't have any way to take advantage of this as of current and will most likely need to move the knight in order to make a breakthrough.  My goals are going to be getting my lsb out from its square on b1 since all the pawns are guarding my squares.  A good way to do this would to break open the board with f5.  Really none of my pieces are that bad since the action is going to most likely take place on the king side and all my pieces are slicing though it.
