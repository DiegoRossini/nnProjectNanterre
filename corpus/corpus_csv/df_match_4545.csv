1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I wasn't sure what I wanted to play against this paticular opponent. I didn't want to play my usual 1... c5 and I dislike the king pawn oppenings. So what did that leave me with. I dont like the Scandinavian or something like the modern. It came doen to to options. Either I would play the French But then I figured why not try the Alkhine?

10,dxe5,d6e5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/1n6/4p3/2PP1P2/8/PP4PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,?! I wasnt sure if this was very good at all to be honest. The problem is my LSB. It has very few squares to go to and is not really doing much at the moment. I concerned myself at this point weather my opponent might try Bg5!?

Including h3 with the idea of trapping blacks LSB. That woul;d force me to play h5 anyway so I decided rather than waste a tempo I wpuld play h7-h5 in one go.

I was hoping for a queen trade but figured there was no way white would oblige. still though. I figured it was worth having my queen here for protection of my king side even if there were more active options available.

Forces a trade of queens or pieces. but perhaps this was the wrong idea, after all my knight is quite usefull right now so perhaps trading it for the bishop was the wrong move.     The point is that on the surface Rxe4!? seems to win a piece but if you look deeper it becomes apparent that it is only a piece trade. 25.Rxe4 Qc3 16.Rc1 Qb2 and white needs to give back the bishop to save the rook.

This threatns the infamous smothered mate with Nh3+ Kh1 Qg1+ Rxg1 Nf2# there are only two defences to mate in this position. 1. h4 which losses two rooks. and gives white a horrific position. 2.h3 which is probably whites best reply. It looses a rook for a pawn or two which is obviously dead lost for white but is most stubborn. and the reply white played in the game.
