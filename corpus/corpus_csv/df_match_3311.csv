1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Pretty standard Sicilian up to this point.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Pretty standard Sicilian up to this point.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Pretty standard Sicilian up to this point.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,Pretty standard Sicilian up to this point.
5,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,"Elyhim suggested (later) that 3. Bb5 is better.  Bc4 has been my standard protocol up to this point, usually this is because I'm too lazy to fight with the decision to take or not to take the knight when black challenges the bishop by going a6.  The decision to take or not to take changes with the scenario, so lazy development is the result.  I will use this advice in a few games in the future and maybe check back here with updates :)"
6,e6,e7e6,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,Castling as soon as possible.  It isn't always beneficial.
7,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 4,Castling as soon as possible.  It isn't always beneficial.
8,a6,a7a6,r1bqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p1n1p3/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 5,"That move is the reason I didn't put the bishop on b5.  At this point in the game I would have retreated the bishop to a4, which would have been a mistake, but I don't like trading bishops for knights before knowing what that middle game is going to look like."
9,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p1n1p3/2p5/2BPP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 5,"This is something new I've been doing to drive a wedge in the center.  Usually here I would go d3 instead, but sometimes you have to be bold!  This is more like italic, but at least I tried."
10,cxd4,c5d4,r1bqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p1n1p3/8/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 6,"The exchange... right now I like the way the game looks, despite elyhim hogging up all the white squares with his pawns."
11,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p1n1p3/8/2BNP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 6,"The exchange... right now I like the way the game looks, despite elyhim hogging up all the white squares with his pawns."
12,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/1p1p1ppp/p1n1pn2/8/2BNP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 7,A solid attack on the e4 pawn.
13,Re1,f1e1,r1bqkb1r/1p1p1ppp/p1n1pn2/8/2BNP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq - 2 7,I made this move to open up a square to possibly fianchetto the bishop later on and make it useful again.  The Post Computer Analysis (PCA) claimed inaccuracy and declared Nxc6 to be better.  In hindsight I would have chosen Nc3 over both of those moves.  Tempo and development is key at this stage of the game and that move would have developed the knight and defended the e4 pawn.
14,Ne5,c6e5,r1bqkb1r/1p1p1ppp/p3pn2/4n3/2BNP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq - 3 8,"I thought I was clever here.  Maybe against someone of a similar strength as my own, but really this just managed to undevelop a piece."
15,Bf1,c4f1,r1bqkb1r/1p1p1ppp/p3pn2/4n3/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQRBK1 b kq - 4 8,"I thought I was clever here.  Maybe against someone of a similar strength as my own, but really this just managed to undevelop a piece."
16,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk2r/1p1p1ppp/p3pn2/2b1n3/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQRBK1 w kq - 5 9,My aim to pin the knight to the queen.
17,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqk2r/1p1p1ppp/p3pn2/2b1n1B1/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QRBK1 b kq - 6 9,My aim to pin the knight to the queen.
18,d6,d7d6,r1bqk2r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/2b1n1B1/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QRBK1 w kq - 0 10,"Again, why didn't I develop the knight?  I felt the knight on d4 needed more security, but not so bad to take a possible square from another knight."
19,c3,c2c3,r1bqk2r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/2b1n1B1/3NP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RN1QRBK1 b kq - 0 10,"Again, why didn't I develop the knight?  I felt the knight on d4 needed more security, but not so bad to take a possible square from another knight."
20,h6,h7h6,r1bqk2r/1p3pp1/p2ppn1p/2b1n1B1/3NP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RN1QRBK1 w kq - 0 11,I was afraid of this on the other side.  Moment of truth...
21,Bh4,g5h4,r1bqk2r/1p3pp1/p2ppn1p/2b1n3/3NP2B/2P5/PP3PPP/RN1QRBK1 b kq - 1 11,"Coward... In retrospect, I didn't really have much of a choice.  Bxf6 leads to Qxf6 and elyhim has me in his sights."
22,Ned7,e5d7,r1bqk2r/1p1n1pp1/p2ppn1p/2b5/3NP2B/2P5/PP3PPP/RN1QRBK1 w kq - 2 12,The PCA says this is a mistake and recommends castling.  Ely points out later in the game that it was better that he didn't castle.  The PCA is short-sighted it seems.
23,Nd2,b1d2,r1bqk2r/1p1n1pp1/p2ppn1p/2b5/3NP2B/2P5/PP1N1PPP/R2QRBK1 b kq - 3 12,"For some reason I feel that the d4 knight needs more defenders, I don't see it now but I saw it then.  I was fighting with my own demons."
24,Qc7,d8c7,r1b1k2r/1pqn1pp1/p2ppn1p/2b5/3NP2B/2P5/PP1N1PPP/R2QRBK1 w kq - 4 13,So much for the pin.
25,Nd2f3,d2f3,r1b1k2r/1pqn1pp1/p2ppn1p/2b5/3NP2B/2P2N2/PP3PPP/R2QRBK1 b kq - 5 13,"I look at this position now and it doesn't look atrocious.  We're pretty well even, I could do without some of the defenders of the d4 knight, but there are some possibilities with this position."
26,g5,g7g5,r1b1k2r/1pqn1p2/p2ppn1p/2b3p1/3NP2B/2P2N2/PP3PPP/R2QRBK1 w kq - 0 14,Now comes the retreat...
27,Bg3,h4g3,r1b1k2r/1pqn1p2/p2ppn1p/2b3p1/3NP3/2P2NB1/PP3PPP/R2QRBK1 b kq - 1 14,"Sometimes I don't mind giving up material to disrupt pawn structures, but there was no way I was allowing an open h-file against someone rated 2270!"
28,Nh5,f6h5,r1b1k2r/1pqn1p2/p2pp2p/2b3pn/3NP3/2P2NB1/PP3PPP/R2QRBK1 w kq - 2 15,Did that bishop need to be defended?  It seems like I'm needlessly cluttering myself in the corner.
29,Ne2,d4e2,r1b1k2r/1pqn1p2/p2pp2p/2b3pn/4P3/2P2NB1/PP2NPPP/R2QRBK1 b kq - 3 15,Did that bishop need to be defended?  It seems like I'm needlessly cluttering myself in the corner.
