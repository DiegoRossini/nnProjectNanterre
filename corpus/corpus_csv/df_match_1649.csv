1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game is full of bad blunders, so take it for fun only. It presents an uncommon situation of a queen and a bishop against a plethora of minor pieces and pawns, and it can be an example of the goods and bads (?) of such an asset for both sides. Set your clock to 5:00am. spepo and I played a row of very funny games, full of tactics and surprises. And blunders, of course! So we also have example of a ""refuted courtesy"" (your opponent blunders badly, and you ""overlook"" the bad move so the game can go on), but your opponent doesn't accept to rectify). This gives to an unusual position, very difficult to play for both sides, that can be ""food for thoughts"" for someone. I hope you have fun with it, not to take it as a ""serious"" game."

6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3P4/2P5/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Bc4 was another option. I go for the Icelandic gambit (don't do it at home).
7,dxe6,d5e6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4Pn2/8/2P5/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,d5 can be played. Black has some tricks about Bb4 and Ne5.
8,Bxe6,c8e6,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4bn2/8/2P5/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,d5 can be played. Black has some tricks about Bb4 and Ne5.

10,Qe7,d8e7,rn2kb1r/ppp1qppp/4bn2/8/2P5/2N5/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 6,...but also have this one. The plan is to develop the dsb on g7. Now white has to stop Bxc4+.
11,Qe2,d1e2,rn2kb1r/ppp1qppp/4bn2/8/2P5/2N5/PP1PQPPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 3 6,"Stops the threat. Now, both players are  little cramped."
12,Nc6,b8c6,r3kb1r/ppp1qppp/2n1bn2/8/2P5/2N5/PP1PQPPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 4 7,Looking at c2.
13,Nf3,g1f3,r3kb1r/ppp1qppp/2n1bn2/8/2P5/2N2N2/PP1PQPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 5 7,"Unlining Q/K, and avoiding d5. I am exposed with an attack on the queenside, but white has to waste some moves before it can get active."
14,O-O-O,e8c8,2kr1b1r/ppp1qppp/2n1bn2/8/2P5/2N2N2/PP1PQPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ - 6 8,"Unlining Q/K, and avoiding d5. I am exposed with an attack on the queenside, but white has to waste some moves before it can get active."
15,d3,d2d3,2kr1b1r/ppp1qppp/2n1bn2/8/2P5/2NP1N2/PP2QPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQ - 0 8,"Further cramping his own position, but controlling c2. I looked for a tactic based on Nb4 and Nc2+ after the queen's exchange, but I was unable to find it."
16,h6,h7h6,2kr1b1r/ppp1qpp1/2n1bn1p/8/2P5/2NP1N2/PP2QPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ - 0 9,"A profilactic move against g5. Kind of a waste of time, but I am also preparing g5 and Bg7."
17,Be3,c1e3,2kr1b1r/ppp1qpp1/2n1bn1p/8/2P5/2NPBN2/PP2QPPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 1 9,Looking at a7.

19,O-O-O,e1c1,2kr1b1r/ppp1qpp1/2n2n1p/5b2/2P5/2NPBN2/PP2QPPP/2KR1B1R b - - 3 10,"White mimics me, but my batteries are about to be aimed there."
20,Nb4,c6b4,2kr1b1r/ppp1qpp1/5n1p/5b2/1nP5/2NPBN2/PP2QPPP/2KR1B1R w - - 4 11,"A stupid move, unless you may welcome a3, and the knight must sadly retire (Nxd3 is not an option yet, because after RxN, BxR, QxB, white loses two minors for a R...). Instead, 11... Bxa7 begins an interestic tactic duel: b6 (trapping the bishop), and white must think about Nb5, c6, Bxb6, bxN, BxRd8, etc."
21,Qc2,e2c2,2kr1b1r/ppp1qpp1/5n1p/5b2/1nP5/2NPBN2/PPQ2PPP/2KR1B1R b - - 5 11,"My opponent blunders badly. I decided to try to ""save"" the game by not taking it. We were playing several games and I knew he was a good player, and that this was only a slip."
22,g5,g7g5,2kr1b1r/ppp1qp2/5n1p/5bp1/1nP5/2NPBN2/PPQ2PPP/2KR1B1R w - - 0 12,I played a nearly neutral move in order to give him time to rectify.

24,Nxc2,b4c2,2kr1b1r/ppp1qp2/5n1p/5bp1/2P5/P1NPBN2/1Pn2PPP/2KR1B1R w - - 0 13,"""As you desire, milord!"""
25,Kxc2,c1c2,2kr1b1r/ppp1qp2/5n1p/5bp1/2P5/P1NPBN2/1PK2PPP/3R1B1R b - - 0 13,"No hurry now. But the simple Qe6, threatening Qxc4, was a good start, and it prevented Nb5 too."
26,a6,a7a6,2kr1b1r/1pp1qp2/p4n1p/5bp1/2P5/P1NPBN2/1PK2PPP/3R1B1R w - - 0 14,"No hurry now. But the simple Qe6, threatening Qxc4, was a good start, and it prevented Nb5 too."
