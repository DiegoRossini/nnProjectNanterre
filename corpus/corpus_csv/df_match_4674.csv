1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is a game within the ""Walking the Walk"" club.  The idea is to give a lower- to mid-level player an opportunity to play a chess master.  (For these purposes, a ""master"" is someone on gameknot with a rating above 2000.)  The master initiates the game and plays Black.  I play White."

I did a little research on it - I'll call this a modified Modern Defense (aka Robatsch Defense); normally the black g-file pawn is on g6, not out there on its own like this.

(The GK computer analysis considered 2...Bg7 a mistake and claims I should have taken the offered g-file pawn, but I thought it a waste of time.)"

12,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/ppp1ppb1/2np1n1p/6p1/2BPP3/2N1BQ2/PPP2PPP/R3K1NR w KQkq - 4 7,"Black blocks access to the f7 square and puts pressure on the e4 pawn, also weighs in on the d5 square.  Currently, Black has more kingside space, but White has more central space and is ahead in development.  Note the huge risk for White castling here (7.O-O-O?), as the white queen's rook and the queen are on the same diagonal, and Black can land his light-squared bishop on g4."

My plan at this point is to work toward a king-side pawn attack, but it seems too early yet to play something like 9.g4."

He complemented me on the maneuver but pointed out the rook was a bit of poison for my position.  Better probably would have been 16.Bxd4, but I couldn't resist the delectable rook bait.  (Later addition: The GK server also considered Bxd4 best, and it calls my choice an ""inaccuracy"", but I think it was a worse mistake than that considering the critical nature of the position.)"
