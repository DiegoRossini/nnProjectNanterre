1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Hey hey all. Another d4 opener that i desperately hate. but this game i took advice from one of you who annotated my last game and had a much more easier and enjoyable game.
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,i stick with the e6 that i like to open with
3,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"and once again im faced with d4.  last time i had tried c5 and it gave a weird game. i was suggested to play d5 and decided to give it a try, I already find myself in uncharted territory on move 2 but we will deal with the flow and see what happens"
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,my opponent pushes by. I dont know why i thought he would go exd5 and open up the board. but pushing by makes me feel like this opponent is more experienced. i decide to check his profile out and his 22-10 damn good starting record i have to watch myself this game it seems!
5,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,my opponent pushes by. I dont know why i thought he would go exd5 and open up the board. but pushing by makes me feel like this opponent is more experienced. i decide to check his profile out and his 22-10 damn good starting record i have to watch myself this game it seems!
6,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,i dont know if this is a good reply but it felt right to maybe undermine his middle pawn and deploy my DSB if he takes
7,Bb5+,f1b5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/1BppP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 4,he decides to take his LSB out with a check i will just reply by saying
8,Bd7,c8d7,rn1qkbnr/pp1b1ppp/4p3/1BppP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 5,lets take our LSB's off the board!
9,Bxd7+,b5d7,rn1qkbnr/pp1B1ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,and he accepts
10,Qxd7,d8d7,rn2kbnr/pp1q1ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,felt like retaking with the queen was more appropriate i wanted my knight on c6 having already played c5
11,c3,c2c3,rn2kbnr/pp1q1ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 6,hmm unanticipated reply. i like these kinds of games not too aggressive. Some set up for a nice mid game with some thought. Instead of straight forward swap outs with the most aggressive replies.
12,Nc6,b8c6,r3kbnr/pp1q1ppp/2n1p3/2ppP3/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 7,decide to finally develop a piece. one of us has too! and he doesnt bite on letting my DSB out
13,Be3,c1e3,r3kbnr/pp1q1ppp/2n1p3/2ppP3/3P4/2P1B3/PP3PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 2 7,after he played this i realised that our LSB's are off the board and pushing my pawn forward seems so much stronger than doing some exchanges in the middle.  if he tries some queen side pushing i can just set up on a6 and b5 and have entire pawns on white squares.
14,c4,c5c4,r3kbnr/pp1q1ppp/2n1p3/3pP3/2pP4/2P1B3/PP3PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 0 8,and so i decide to go for a control of the white squares. since all his pawns are on dark squares i thought it greatly added value to my bishop over his and would allow ten times more mobility
15,Nf3,g1f3,r3kbnr/pp1q1ppp/2n1p3/3pP3/2pP4/2P1BN2/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 1 8,he further develops planning for a king side castle i can see. i decide im going to queen side castle at this stage and just move my pawns up left side of the board and see what develops
16,h6,h7h6,r3kbnr/pp1q1pp1/2n1p2p/3pP3/2pP4/2P1BN2/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 9,i play this as to restrain his knight and bishop my castle can wait 1 more turn he cannot interupt it immediately
17,h3,h2h3,r3kbnr/pp1q1pp1/2n1p2p/3pP3/2pP4/2P1BN1P/PP3PP1/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 0 9,hmmm this reply i thought to be curious and made me think he wouldnt king side castle. I thought he was trying to formulate some sort of counter play king side. i saw it as a non threat as im going to be pushing that side. Especially since i was planning to go ne7 not nf6 so the pawn wouldnt help against my knight
18,O-O-O,e8c8,2kr1bnr/pp1q1pp1/2n1p2p/3pP3/2pP4/2P1BN1P/PP3PP1/RN1QK2R w KQ - 1 10,queen side castle!
19,O-O,e1g1,2kr1bnr/pp1q1pp1/2n1p2p/3pP3/2pP4/2P1BN1P/PP3PP1/RN1Q1RK1 b - - 2 10,im surprised he still decided to king side castle after playing h3 but this really delighted me
20,f5,f7f5,2kr1bnr/pp1q2p1/2n1p2p/3pPp2/2pP4/2P1BN1P/PP3PP1/RN1Q1RK1 w - f6 0 11,"i tempted him with an en passant instead of f6,   i thought he wouldnt take, and it goes with my plan of having all pawns on white squares. and to help push the g pawn"
21,Nbd2,b1d2,2kr1bnr/pp1q2p1/2n1p2p/3pPp2/2pP4/2P1BN1P/PP1N1PP1/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 11,hmm i really liked this move hes giving very little breathing room to his knight on the f3 square and i will be coming up to pressure him
