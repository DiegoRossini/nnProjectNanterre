5,Nf3,g1f3,rn1qkbnr/pbpppppp/1p6/8/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 3,like what my opponent's doing... right now he probably has better control of the centre
6,g6,g7g6,rn1qkbnr/pbpppp1p/1p4p1/8/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,I do the same thing on the left side
7,Bc4,f1c4,rn1qkbnr/pbpppp1p/1p4p1/8/2BP4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,I do the same thing on the left side

9,O-O,e1g1,rn1qk1nr/pbppppbp/1p4p1/8/2BP4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 3 5,This is another reason - that knight doesn't have a lot of places to go
10,Na6,b8a6,r2qk1nr/pbppppbp/np4p1/8/2BP4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 4 6,This is another reason - that knight doesn't have a lot of places to go

12,Nh6,g8h6,r2qk2r/pbppppbp/np4pn/8/2BP3N/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 6 7,"again, same on both sides"
13,Nc3,b1c3,r2qk2r/pbppppbp/np4pn/8/2BP3N/2N1P3/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 7 7,although this will bring a strong attack if I can free my main pieces...
14,O-O,e8g8,r2q1rk1/pbppppbp/np4pn/8/2BP3N/2N1P3/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 8 8,although this will bring a strong attack if I can free my main pieces...

21,Nxa7,b5a7,2rq1rk1/Nb1p1pbp/npp1p1pn/8/2BPPP1N/8/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 11,but that's a big mistake for white!

24,dxc6,d7c6,r2q1rk1/1b3pbp/npp1p1pn/8/2BPPP1N/8/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 13,"I guess I could have attacked with the bishop as well, but it could lead to me wasting turns running away from White's pawns"
25,Nf3,h4f3,r2q1rk1/1b3pbp/npp1p1pn/8/2BPPP2/5N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 13,trying to trade pawns while I have the piece advantage.... but I don't know enough about positioning to comment on that
