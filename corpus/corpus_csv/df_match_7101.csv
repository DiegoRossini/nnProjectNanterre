1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,A positional player ?
2,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"As black, I don't have an opening-repertoire.. The only opening I'm used to use, is a sort of Pirc-Modern Defense.. Please correct me if I'm wrong!
The main idea in this opening-line is to control the center indirectly. You create a space for your king's-bishop, and afterwards, your plan is to attack the center."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"According to me, my opponent likes pretty closed games (most 1.d4-players do). By moving up his c-pawn 2 moves, he's aiming directly for the center. Now he has control over my 5th rank."
4,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,Developing move..
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 3,"According to Fritz, we're playing a sort of Kings Indian.."
6,d6,d7d6,rnbqk1nr/ppp1ppbp/3p2p1/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Making space for my bishop, and indirectly attacking e5 and c5."
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk1nr/ppp1ppbp/3p2p1/8/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,Nice developing towards the center.
8,Nd7,b8d7,r1bqk1nr/pppnppbp/3p2p1/8/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,"My idea was to play e5, within a few moves.. Mostly, I play 4. Nf6, but after a few losses, I'm trying something else.."
9,e4,e2e4,r1bqk1nr/pppnppbp/3p2p1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,White is building up a nice pressure towards d5 !
10,e5,e7e5,r1bqk1nr/pppn1pbp/3p2p1/4p3/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Leaving the choice to white.. Taking on e5 would result in an open game, while d5 would close the gates, and make it a closed game. I was aiming for the latter, simply because closed games are more ""my"" style of playing."
11,d5,d4d5,r1bqk1nr/pppn1pbp/3p2p1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"A ""closed"" game it will be ! In meanwhile, my opponent's f-knight is pretty inactive.."
12,Ngf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/pppn1pbp/3p1np1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,Preparing to castle..
13,b4,b2b4,r1bqk2r/pppn1pbp/3p1np1/3Pp3/1PP1P3/2N2N2/P4PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"""c5 is mine, not yours"", was white's way of thinking !"
14,b6,b7b6,r1bqk2r/p1pn1pbp/1p1p1np1/3Pp3/1PP1P3/2N2N2/P4PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,"Preparation of playing a5.. My purpose is distracting that b-pawn, so c5 would be all mine.."
15,Be2,f1e2,r1bqk2r/p1pn1pbp/1p1p1np1/3Pp3/1PP1P3/2N2N2/P3BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 8,"Developing his light-squared-bishop and preparing to castle kingside. Activating this bishop could go via his kingside, or through a4, which would cost him a couple of moves."
16,a5,a7a5,r1bqk2r/2pn1pbp/1p1p1np1/p2Pp3/1PP1P3/2N2N2/P3BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,"Aiming for that b-pawn.. In a way, I wanted to gain control of c5. If white played 9. bxa5, I would have a nice spot for my knight on c5, and having an open file for my rook! If white would move up his b-pawn one square, I would have the same result."
17,b5,b4b5,r1bqk2r/2pn1pbp/1p1p1np1/pP1Pp3/2P1P3/2N2N2/P3BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 9,"Gives a closed position (looking to the pawns), but in this case, it was the best move, in my opinion."

19,Qc2,d1c2,r1bqk2r/2p2pbp/1p1p1np1/pPnPp3/2P1P3/2N2N2/P1Q1BPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 2 10,"The best move to play, in my opinion. If 10. Bd3, then 10. ... Nfxe4 11. Bxe4 Nxe4 and black was up a pawn."
20,Ke7,e8e7,r1bq3r/2p1kpbp/1p1p1np1/pPnPp3/2P1P3/2N2N2/P1Q1BPPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 3 11,"I've been thinking long time on this move.. I know this seems a strange move, but I was aiming for some activity on my kingside. Castling would result in a direct kingside-attack from my opponent. My queenside is pretty closed, so the actions would be best on kingside.."
