1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was my 18th game against Jo.  We started with a string of draws, then she beat me game after game after game (if these had been rated, her rating would have been marginally higher, mine lower - her choice).  Finally, after she's got me playing against masters like Freddy and annotating my games so that they're criticised constructively by the likes of ionadowman, easy19, dmaestro, nuntar and ruachessnut  (thanks lads), I've finally broken my duck."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,We've been varying the openings a lot.  Jo reverts to traditional territory and I reply with my favourite Sicilian.

11,Be3,c1e3,rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"Preparing the English Attack.  I quite often respond with 6. Ng4, which leads to well-analysed and tactically complex lines.  Kasparov was a pioneer in that line.  But I'm no Kasparov and I've been listening to Freddy's advice: sit back, ignore the database and wait for Jo to make a mistake.  In this game, I did more or less ignore the database.  I relied on instinct, background knowledge of the opening theory, calculation and feel for the positions."

The important thing is to connect the rooks and to launch the attack at White's King's position.  Admittedly, this B is pointing in the wrong direction for that objective; but it does look across the centre of the board at e4, f3 and a1."
