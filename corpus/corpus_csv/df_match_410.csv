15,Bg5,c1g5,rn1q1rk1/pbpp1ppp/1p2pn2/6B1/1bPP4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 8 8,I decide to attack blacks night at f3 with my DB which develops it as well.  I am forgetting that my knight at c3 is under attack and if taken will leave me with double pawns. And black will have access to 'b' file.
16,h6,h7h6,rn1q1rk1/pbpp1pp1/1p2pn1p/6B1/1bPP4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 9,My c3 knight is safe for now and black instead pushes his h pawn to h6 and kicks me off g5.
17,Bf4,g5f4,rn1q1rk1/pbpp1pp1/1p2pn1p/8/1bPP1B2/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 9,I move my DB to f4 which I feel is a more central position and I leave my knight on c3 to the attack by black's DB.
18,Bxc3,b4c3,rn1q1rk1/pbpp1pp1/1p2pn1p/8/2PP1B2/2b2NP1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 10,Now black captures my c3 knight and I retake with my b pawn and have doubled pawns on the c file.
19,bxc3,b2c3,rn1q1rk1/pbpp1pp1/1p2pn1p/8/2PP1B2/2P2NP1/P3PPBP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 10,Now black captures my c3 knight and I retake with my b pawn and have doubled pawns on the c file.
20,a5,a7a5,rn1q1rk1/1bpp1pp1/1p2pn1p/p7/2PP1B2/2P2NP1/P3PPBP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 11,Black pushes his a pawn out to a5 and he has a chain of pawns and is protecting the diagonal from b4 to d6 with these pawns.  I probably should have pushed my c pawn and tried to attack on c5 and this would have broken the chain and given me more centre space.
21,Bh3,g2h3,rn1q1rk1/1bpp1pp1/1p2pn1p/p7/2PP1B2/2P2NPB/P3PP1P/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 11,Instead I make a move with my LB to h3 (I was preparing to move my g3 pawn up so this LB was protecting g4).  I may be going to learn a hard lesson about moving your LB unnecessarily.  Perhaps a better move would have been moving my e pawn up which is a move I make and I would then have 3 pawns in a row but I seem to have forgotten this!
22,Bxf3,b7f3,rn1q1rk1/2pp1pp1/1p2pn1p/p7/2PP1B2/2P2bPB/P3PP1P/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 12,Black decides to take my f3 knight with his LB and again I can only retake with my pawn so I will have doubled pawns again.  I don't think this is too bad on the 'f' file as it provides protection to my king.  Now there is the 'e' file for black to access but my rook is able to access too.

25,g4,g3g4,rn1q1rk1/2p2pp1/1p1ppn1p/p7/2PP1BP1/2P2P1B/P4P1P/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 13,I move my pawn g3- g4 taking control of more squares around my king.
26,g5,g7g5,rn1q1rk1/2p2p2/1p1ppn1p/p5p1/2PP1BP1/2P2P1B/P4P1P/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 14,Black moves g7 - g5 and blocks the progress of my g pawn and attacks my DB at f4.
27,Be3,f4e3,rn1q1rk1/2p2p2/1p1ppn1p/p5p1/2PP2P1/2P1BP1B/P4P1P/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 14,I move my DB to e3 which gives protection to my f2 and d4 pawns.
28,a4,a5a4,rn1q1rk1/2p2p2/1p1ppn1p/6p1/p1PP2P1/2P1BP1B/P4P1P/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 15,Black moves h4-h5 and I don't see that he is now bringing his flank pawns to take control of another diagonal.
29,a3,a2a3,rn1q1rk1/2p2p2/1p1ppn1p/6p1/p1PP2P1/P1P1BP1B/5P1P/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 15,I block this a4 pawn with a2-a3.
30,d5,d6d5,rn1q1rk1/2p2p2/1p2pn1p/3p2p1/p1PP2P1/P1P1BP1B/5P1P/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 16,Black now moves d6-d5 which attacks my pawn at c4.  I see he is also restricting my centre.
31,c5,c4c5,rn1q1rk1/2p2p2/1p2pn1p/2Pp2p1/p2P2P1/P1P1BP1B/5P1P/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 16,It seems I have only one move which is moving my top pawn of my doubled pawns on the c file to c5.  I could have taken on d5 but this would have been captured by black's e6 or I would have been left with doubled pawns on the d file.
32,b5,b6b5,rn1q1rk1/2p2p2/4pn1p/1pPp2p1/p2P2P1/P1P1BP1B/5P1P/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 17,Black moves his pawn b6-b5 and if he moves his c7 pawn next will have taken control of the diagonal a4 to c6 with his pawns.
33,Bd2,e3d2,rn1q1rk1/2p2p2/4pn1p/1pPp2p1/p2P2P1/P1P2P1B/3B1P1P/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 17,I move my DB to d2 protecting my c3 pawn as I think that black may move his b5 pawn down to attack it.
34,c6,c7c6,rn1q1rk1/5p2/2p1pn1p/1pPp2p1/p2P2P1/P1P2P1B/3B1P1P/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 18,Black moves c7-c6 and his pawns are now connected and he has a very strong pawn defence while my pawns are doubled on 2 files and I am restricted by his c6 and d5 pawns from doing anything in the centre.
35,Be3,d2e3,rn1q1rk1/5p2/2p1pn1p/1pPp2p1/p2P2P1/P1P1BP1B/5P1P/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 18,I move my DB back up to e3.  I have purely been acting in defence mode and not as white should play by making the moves with black defending.  I do not see that he is about to bring his last flank pawn to c6.  So instead I should have moved to c6 with my pawn but I would have been captured by the knight.  So black is in charge.
