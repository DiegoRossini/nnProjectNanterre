1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was a training match against c1pe and is being annotated for general audiences as a way to learn/improve.  c1pe had never played against King's Gambit before, so I thought I'd give him a run through the game.  I promised him it would be lots of early, furious attacking.  I believe he said something akin to , ""Bring it.""  :)"

8,Ne4,f6e4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/4np2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"According to book play, Nh5 is the best continuation move, but now he allows for some counterplay."
9,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/3Pnp2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,It would have been better to play d3 here to force his knight away and give me a tempo move.

I get to take his knight."

For all beginners, working through chess games, if there is an open rook file, never ever ever put your queen in front of your king, because the opponent will get you every time."

When you are forced to make an exchange, make sure that the exchange is as much on your terms as you can allow it.  Because of 10. ... b6, the next move is possible."

In retrospect, I think black made the right choice.  If 14. ... Rb8, 15. Bxd6.  If black retakes 15. ... cxd6, then 16. Qxc6 leaves black in an ugly ugly place."
