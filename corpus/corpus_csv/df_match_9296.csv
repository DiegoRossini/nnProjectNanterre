1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"1.  When White plays e4, White can get a great number of replies!  The most common reply, above 1900 elo, is c5 - Sicilian - expectation of e4 c5 is 51%!!  White can expect to get e5 21-24% of the time!  When you decide to play the Kings Gambit (KG), you will need to know how to play against c5.  Keep in mind that playing e4 will get you only one KG every four or five games."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Black has several good responses here.  I play the Falkbeer Counter Gambit (FCG): e4 e5, f4 d5, exd5 exf4.  This exchange leaves the white pawn on d5, blocking the diagonal of his bishop from c4.  This delays White's attack.  The speed of the attack is critical to Whites' success."

4,exf4,e5f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,I accept the Gambit because it is the move you will most often see in this position.
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,It is critical for White to play Nf3 at this point.  The knight must remain on this post until the White King is safely castled.  The knight protects g5 and e4 against the Black Queen.  White needs to get castled quickly to get his pieces into play with threats.
6,g5,g7g5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/6p1/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,This is the move Black plays most often.  I like Be7 better.
7,h4,h2h4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/6p1/4Pp1P/5N2/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"This is the major divergence point in the KG.  4. h4 is the Kieseritzki variation, often called the Kings Knights Gambit.  4. Bc4 is the Philidor variation, which then leads to other divergences: The Hanstein variation and the Muzio Gambit.  The Muzio was my primary weapon when I was young."
8,g4,g5g4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/8/4PppP/5N2/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"This is considered White's best move, the other, perhaps more popular, playable move is Ng5."
9,Ne5,f3e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/4N3/4PppP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"This is considered White's best move, the other, perhaps more popular, playable move is Ng5."
10,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2p1p/3p4/4N3/4PppP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"There are eight (8) different moves that have been tried here.  The ones I believe you will see most are:
5. ... h5, the long whip variation.
5. ... Nf6, the Berlin variation.
5. ... d5, the Brentano variation. and
5.  ... d6, the Kolisch variation, the move I make here because I believe it is the one you will see most."
11,Nxg4,e5g4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2p1p/3p4/8/4PpNP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"Be7 reveals the weakness created on White's kingside by moving the knight from f3 early.  Now, Black bishop and queen bear down on h4 and white cannot defend with the knight.  This gives Black time to develop.  Still, the game is even.  Blacks advantage just about equals the value of the gambited pawn."
12,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk1nr/ppp1bp1p/3p4/8/4PpNP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,"Be7 reveals the weakness created on White's kingside by moving the knight from f3 early.

13,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqk1nr/ppp1bp1p/3p4/8/2B1PpNP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 7,"We are still in the Kieseritzky, but in a sideline.  6. ... Nf6 is more often played, but Be7 is the second most popular move.  I played it to show what happens when the Knight leaves f3 - as he does in the Kieseritzky.  7. Qf3 may be best for White, because after Bxh4 the knight can block with Nf2 and the Queen will support the knight.  By moving the Queen, white also envisions a possible future 0-0-0."
14,Bxh4+,e7h4,rnbqk1nr/ppp2p1p/3p4/8/2B1PpNb/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"This move could become troublesome, but it is playable if the plan is to get the knight back to f3."
15,Kf1,e1f1,rnbqk1nr/ppp2p1p/3p4/8/2B1PpNb/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQ1K1R b kq - 1 8,"This move could become troublesome, but it is playable if the plan is to get the knight back to f3."
16,Qg5,d8g5,rnb1k1nr/ppp2p1p/3p4/6q1/2B1PpNb/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQ1K1R w kq - 2 9,"Black now attacks the knight twice, and it must move or die.  The KG is a very tactical game.  Al"
17,Nf2,g4f2,rnb1k1nr/ppp2p1p/3p4/6q1/2B1Pp1b/8/PPPP1NP1/RNBQ1K1R b kq - 3 9,"9. Withdrawal of the knight to f2 was appropriate at move 8.  It is no longer appropriate.  Now, it was important to return the knight to f3 by 9.Nh2 and a later Nf3."
18,Bxf2,h4f2,rnb1k1nr/ppp2p1p/3p4/6q1/2B1Pp2/8/PPPP1bP1/RNBQ1K1R w kq - 0 10,"Getting the Black king into the open, without cost!  An easily found zwichenzug."

20,Kxf7,e8f7,rnb3nr/ppp2k1p/3p4/6q1/4Pp2/8/PPPP1bP1/RNBQ1K1R w - - 0 11,"This puts the Black king out in the open, on the same file as his opponent."
21,Kxf2,f1f2,rnb3nr/ppp2k1p/3p4/6q1/4Pp2/8/PPPP1KP1/RNBQ3R b - - 0 11,"The White king must recapture, and a lone pawn stands on the file between the kings.  Both sides are relatively undeveloped and the side that can develop with threats will have the initiative.  Al"
22,Nf6,g8f6,rnb4r/ppp2k1p/3p1n2/6q1/4Pp2/8/PPPP1KP1/RNBQ3R w - - 1 12,"Black gets several benefits from this tempo-saving move:
1.  e4 comes under attack.
2.  h7 and h5 are protected from incursion by the white rook.
3.  g4 is held for occupation by Queen, Knight or Bishop.
4.  The knight can enter the attack on the next move."
23,d3,d2d3,rnb4r/ppp2k1p/3p1n2/6q1/4Pp2/3P4/PPP2KP1/RNBQ3R b - - 0 12,"After 12. d3, developing the bishop with an attack and pin on f4, White is coming to life.  But it is already too late.  Look at Black's possible attacking responses:  Qg3 , Ng4 , Rg8 threatening g2.   These three seem very playable, and the Black bishop bears down on g4.  It would be natural for Black to become giddy and play one of these moves.  Black would still win, but he would create counter-chances for White with any of these moves.  ""When you see a good move, look for a better one"""
24,Nc6,b8c6,r1b4r/ppp2k1p/2np1n2/6q1/4Pp2/3P4/PPP2KP1/RNBQ3R w - - 1 13,"Nc6 is probably the best move, it develops another piece for the kingside attack and connects the rooks once the bishop moves.  Black has an advantage in time and material and will win if there is no blunder.  This move allows no counter-attack and positions the knight for d4 or d5.  As long as the pawns remain on the f-file, the Black king is not subject to harassment.  Al"
25,c3,c2c3,r1b4r/ppp2k1p/2np1n2/6q1/4Pp2/2PP4/PP3KP1/RNBQ3R b - - 0 13,"White seems to be ignoring Blacks' attack.  True, the best defence is an attack, but White does not have enough pieces in play yet.  White needs a better plan.  By playing c3, the knight's best square is taken.  True, he may come out via d2, but that square may be needed by the bishop!  It seems that White's best hope was in 13. Kf1, followed by Qf3.  This would support Bxf4, if the move is still available at that time, and an exchange of queens to blunt Black's attack."
