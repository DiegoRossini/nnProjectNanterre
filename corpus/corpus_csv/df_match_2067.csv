1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is the French Defence. I used to play it a lot, so I know what is coming."
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"This is the French Defence. I used to play it a lot, so I know what is coming."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,This is something different than the closed positions arising from moves like 3...Nf6 4. Bg5 Be7 5. e5 Nd7 6. Bxe7 Qxe7 etc.
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,This is something different than the closed positions arising from moves like 3...Nf6 4. Bg5 Be7 5. e5 Nd7 6. Bxe7 Qxe7 etc.

7,Nxe4,c3e4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/3PN3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,This called Rubinstein Variation.
8,Nd7,b8d7,r1bqkbnr/pppn1ppp/4p3/8/3PN3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,I can also play 5. Bd3 which can lead to the same kind of positions than in this game.
9,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pppn1ppp/4p3/8/3PN3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,I can also play 5. Bd3 which can lead to the same kind of positions than in this game.
10,Ngf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppn1ppp/4pn2/8/3PN3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 3 6,"I practice I have to exchange the knights anyway. For example, 6. Bd3 Nxe4 7. Bxe4 Nf6 8. Bd3 etc."
11,Nxf6+,e4f6,r1bqkb1r/pppn1ppp/4pN2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"I practice I have to exchange the knights anyway. For example, 6. Bd3 Nxe4 7. Bxe4 Nf6 8. Bd3 etc."
12,Nxf6,d7f6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"There are other moves here that I could play, such as Bg5, c3, Be3, Bc4 etc. The one that I selected takes the e4-square and potentially targets h7."
13,Bd3,f1d3,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/8/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,"There are other moves here that I could play, such as Bg5, c3, Be3, Bc4 etc. The one that I selected takes the e4-square and potentially targets h7."
14,c5,c7c5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2p5/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,This is logical. Black challenges the central control by attacking d4.
15,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2p5/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 8,"I could take on c5, but instead, I move the king to a safer place. There is a little tactical trick that makes this possible, although d4 is threatened."
16,cxd4,c5d4,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/8/3p4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 9,Black takes it.
17,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/8/3N4/3B4/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 9,And I take back! 9...Qxd4 would be followed by 10. Bb5+ winning the queen.
18,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2b5/3N4/3B4/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 1 10,So Black develops a piece with tempo.
19,Nf3,d4f3,r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2b5/8/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 2 10,Keeping it simple.
20,Qc7,d8c7,r1b1k2r/ppq2ppp/4pn2/2b5/8/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 3 11,Now I cannot pin the f6-knight.
21,Bg5,c1g5,r1b1k2r/ppq2ppp/4pn2/2b3B1/8/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 4 11,"I still move the bishop to g5, because other active squares are covered by Black pieces. I also have the option to break Black's kingside pawn structure."
22,O-O,e8g8,r1b2rk1/ppq2ppp/4pn2/2b3B1/8/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 5 12,Breaking the pawn structure here is probably not worth losing the bishop pair.
23,Qe2,d1e2,r1b2rk1/ppq2ppp/4pn2/2b3B1/8/3B1N2/PPP1QPPP/R4RK1 b - - 6 12,Breaking the pawn structure here is probably not worth losing the bishop pair.
24,b6,b7b6,r1b2rk1/p1q2ppp/1p2pn2/2b3B1/8/3B1N2/PPP1QPPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 13,Preparing to bring the bishop to b7.
25,Ne5,f3e5,r1b2rk1/p1q2ppp/1p2pn2/2b1N1B1/8/3B4/PPP1QPPP/R4RK1 b - - 1 13,This is a good square for the knight.
26,Bb7,c8b7,r4rk1/pbq2ppp/1p2pn2/2b1N1B1/8/3B4/PPP1QPPP/R4RK1 w - - 2 14,The rook takes the open file.
27,Rad1,a1d1,r4rk1/pbq2ppp/1p2pn2/2b1N1B1/8/3B4/PPP1QPPP/3R1RK1 b - - 3 14,The rook takes the open file.
28,Nd5,f6d5,r4rk1/pbq2ppp/1p2p3/2bnN1B1/8/3B4/PPP1QPPP/3R1RK1 w - - 4 15,"I do not like this move. Bringing a rook to oppose mine on the d-file would be better, I think."
29,c4,c2c4,r4rk1/pbq2ppp/1p2p3/2bnN1B1/2P5/3B4/PP2QPPP/3R1RK1 b - - 0 15,Driving the knight away.
