1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,After playing chess at GK for some few months my interest for chess was really awakened and I decided to join a chess club and see how I liked it. This game is my second full time(90 minutes for the 40 first moves and an additional 30 minutes for the rest of the game) match. The shocking situation for me comes at the 24th move...
