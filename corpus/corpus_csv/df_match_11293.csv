1,b4,b2b4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/1P6/8/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"oh crud another odd opening. huh. his idea is to fiancetto the bishop to b2 and with a possible c4, b5 to cramp my queenside."
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/1P6/8/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,this slows down b5.

4,Qb6,d8b6,rnb1kbnr/pp1ppppp/1qp5/8/1P6/8/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,an early queen attack. now c4 is difficult.
5,a3,a2a3,rnb1kbnr/pp1ppppp/1qp5/8/1P6/P7/1BPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,defending the pawn.

8,d5,d7d5,rnb1kbnr/1p2pppp/1qp5/p2p4/1P6/P1P5/1B1PPPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"the b4 pawn is also pinned, so I overprotect another light square. by stopping c4 the bishop looks awkward here."
9,e3,e2e3,rnb1kbnr/1p2pppp/1qp5/p2p4/1P6/P1P1P3/1B1P1PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"gaining a share of the center, and contesting my queenside."

I don't fear a check on e5 as the queen is all alone. I have robbed the kings knight of his favorite square. I am looking at c4! now by white in order to bring the Bishop into the attack."
