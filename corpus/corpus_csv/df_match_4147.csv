11,Be2,f1e2,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/3p4/2p5/4P1b1/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 6,Interesting choice by black to trade knight for bishop here after opening the board up by taking pawns.  I wondered what he was up to.

28,Na6,b8a6,r4rk1/p3bppp/n1pp4/2p5/2P1PB2/1P3B2/P4PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 1 15,"I spent a lot of time analyzing this position.  It was clear that black intended knight to b4 to c2 for a fork.  The problem was that anything that prevented the fork was at risk of walking into a trap.  I considered 15. Bd2 for some time, but then the knight could go to d3 and cause trouble.  Any attempt to stop the fork by using the a1 rook would hang the a2 pawn and allow black's rook to move to b8 and undermine the pawn structure.  It was a complicated decision to castle, but in the end, I decided I could neutralize both the fork and the problem of Nd3."
29,O-O,e1g1,r4rk1/p3bppp/n1pp4/2p5/2P1PB2/1P3B2/P4PPP/R4RK1 b - - 2 15,"As expected.  Black probably figured it was win/win - if the a1 rook moves, the a2 pawn hangs.  If not, Nc2 can challenge it while keeping the f-rook locked down."

35,Bc3,e5c3,r4rk1/p3bppp/2p5/2p5/2P5/1PBn1B2/P4PPP/R4RK1 b - - 2 18,It's a careful dance.  I want to keep the black knight as locked down as possible.  This move makes black's only knight move to f4 that accomplishes little.  Meanwhile he's blocking the d file and keeping black's rooks from claiming it.  I'm planning Bxc6 to win the pawn.
36,Rad8,a8d8,3r1rk1/p3bppp/2p5/2p5/2P5/1PBn1B2/P4PPP/R4RK1 w - - 3 19,"Black either anticipated Bxc6 and wanted to move the rook out of danger early, or expected 19. Be2 or Be4, which would threaten the knight.  I honestly don't like those moves because they just push black's knight away."
37,Bxc6,f3c6,3r1rk1/p3bppp/2B5/2p5/2P5/1PBn4/P4PPP/R4RK1 b - - 0 19,Free pawn and now black's f8 rook is locked down.
38,Nf4,d3f4,3r1rk1/p3bppp/2B5/2p5/2P2n2/1PB5/P4PPP/R4RK1 w - - 1 20,"Black moves his knight out, freeing up the d file for his rook, and leaving it ready to defend the bishop at e7 if need be.  A good move, but he's forgotten that the knight was the only thing keeping me off the e1 squarerook..."
39,Rfe1,f1e1,3r1rk1/p3bppp/2B5/2p5/2P2n2/1PB5/P4PPP/R3R1K1 b - - 2 20,Simple and direct.  I'm expecting Ng6 here.  I would then respond with bringing the a1 rook into play on d1 and challenging black's control of that file.  The queenside pawns are also waiting to become a nice battering ram that will lock down black's rooks.  I'm feeling pretty good about this position.
