1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The e4 open by White, in my mind, is the strongest open. D4 is okay too.  Anything else tells me my opponent needs a lesson in chess."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I never respond to e4 Ruy Lopez and so I have the French or the Sicilian or the Caro-Kann in my mind as a response.  Rule out the French Defense because the barricades there limit Black to do anything except defend.  Rule in Sicilian or Caro-Kann and then an attack is possible and imminent by Black--and isn't the best defense an Attack? Sometimes I do Sicilian and in this case I do it.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,I like the Sicilian Scheveningen variation above the rest. My records in the past when I use Sicilian will show this.
