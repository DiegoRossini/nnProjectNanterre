1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"My previous annotation is debatable and to some extent agreeable, but this is highly agreeable. I don't know how my opponent managed to get in a terrible position, but I do know I had many ways to win this game. I'll show what I think is best, but you are welcome to specify any others, even if they aren't as good. Here is the start of the game, with the famous pawn push."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I was thinking of 2.d4, but I did something different."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,One of the more serious approaches to the King's Pawn Game.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,Good. 2...d6 fine. 2...f6 is not. I still have people play 2...f6 and 3.Nxe4! wins if Black doesn't play 3...Qe7.
5,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"I believe that this is the Scotch. I'm not fond of playing the Scotch, but it is worth a try."
6,exd4,e5d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,He takes.
7,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,This is the Main line of the scotch.
8,Ne5,c6e5,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4n3/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,Somewhat inaccurate. Black might as well have put the Bishop on c5.
9,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4n3/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,Everything goes whacky afer this turn.
10,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1n3/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 3 6,Maybe 6.Be3.
11,Nf5,d4f5,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1nN2/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 4 6,"?! Nope, but I know I can do better than this."
12,Qf6,d8f6,r1b1k1nr/pppp1ppp/5q2/2b1nN2/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 5 7,"This make Black's move look worse than mine, although the Knight is pinned to checkmate."
13,Be3,c1e3,r1b1k1nr/pppp1ppp/5q2/2b1nN2/4P3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 6 7,This is to unpin my Knight.
14,Ng4,e5g4,r1b1k1nr/pppp1ppp/5q2/2b2N2/4P1n1/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 7 8,? I think that Black is trying too hard. 7...d6 is better.
15,Bxc5,e3c5,r1b1k1nr/pppp1ppp/5q2/2B2N2/4P1n1/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,"Maybe taking the Knight was better, but I decided to do this move, which is good for White, but unfortunate for Black."
16,d6,d7d6,r1b1k1nr/ppp2ppp/3p1q2/2B2N2/4P1n1/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 9,Does 9.Bd4 look good?
17,Bb5+,f1b5,r1b1k1nr/ppp2ppp/3p1q2/1BB2N2/4P1n1/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 9,This not my best move but it'll work smoothly.

19,Bd4,c5d4,r1bk2nr/ppp2ppp/3p1q2/1B3N2/3BP1n1/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 3 10,Now this is a potential attack for certain.
20,Qe6,f6e6,r1bk2nr/ppp2ppp/3pq3/1B3N2/3BP1n1/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 4 11,Before I take the g7 pawn...
