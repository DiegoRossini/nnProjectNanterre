5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"""It can't be bad"". And it isn't. It's better than c4, that opens the way for nasty black tactics."
6,Qxd5,d8d5,rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3q4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"This is not the wisest response, but I don't like Nxd4, c4 (with tempo). So I tried this to see where does it lead"
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3q4/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,"Bd2, c6, followed by Qc7. Quite a nice trip, but black is kind of solid."
8,Qa5,d5a5,rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/q7/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 5,"Bd2, c6, followed by Qc7. Quite a nice trip, but black is kind of solid."
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/q7/3P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 5,"Good choice, but better was d5! It seems to lose a tempo, but undermines black's plans (c6, dxc6!, followed by a terrible counterattack based on B/Nb4...)."
10,c6,c7c6,rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/q7/3P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Going on with the scheme. Nc6 is not wise in this position, since after d5 the knight's journey doesn't accomplish that much."
11,Bc4,f1c4,rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/q7/2BP4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"Not daring to go for d5 (and I can't blame him), white develops with attack. But I'm not worried, since I know this kind of attack very well."
12,Ne4,f6e4,rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/2p5/q7/2BPn3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 7,"The normal choice was Bf4, followed by e3. But I wanted to cash something. If Ne5, black wins the following exchanges."
13,Bd2,c1d2,rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/2p5/q7/2BPn3/2N2N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 3 7,It's always nice to see that the white's dsb can be exchanged...

I can guess white wanted to keep the e semicolumn open, in sight of its weakness, and I can't say it's wrong. But this just slowens white's developement. The white knight can go to c4, true, but this is a better place for the pawn."
