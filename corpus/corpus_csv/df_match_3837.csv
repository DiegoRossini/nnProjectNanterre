3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Nf3, another common move."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"Nc6, another regular move in the King's pawn opening."
5,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"This move is more unusual, but compared with The King's pawn opening, it is better, and compared to the King's Pawn Game, it is about the same, except with a higher draw rate."
6,exd4,e5d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,... And he captures.

8,Nxd4,c6d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3nP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,Obviously.
9,Qxd4,d1d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"And Queen captures back, while indirectly pinning down the darksworn bishop. ( Bishop Moves away, Qxg7 ) Usually, you should develop your Queen last, though."
10,d6,d7d6,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Very Common response, but Nf6 is better."
11,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/2BQP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 1 6,Developing.
12,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/8/2BQP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 2 7,"Now, he does Nf6."
13,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/6B1/2BQP3/8/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R b KQkq - 3 7,I dunno why I chose that move. I guess I just favor pinning down knights.
14,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/3p1n2/6B1/2BQP3/8/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R w KQkq - 4 8,"Nobody likes pinned knights, though."

17,O-O-O,e1c1,r1bq1rk1/ppp1bppp/3p1n2/6B1/2BQP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b - - 7 9,I like Queenside better than Kingside.
18,Ne8,f6e8,r1bqnrk1/ppp1bppp/3p4/6B1/2BQP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/2KR3R w - - 8 10,... But I like my Bishop! :(
19,Bxe7,g5e7,r1bqnrk1/ppp1Bppp/3p4/8/2BQP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b - - 0 10,Moving back would have been kinda useless...
