While white has a pawn, bishop, and knight attacking that square, black needs to protect against Nxf7.  Black stands to lose a pawn and bishop for nothing here.  While white could take the black knight (Nd5), Ng5 is undefended--Qxg5.

On second thought, Nxf7, Rxf7, Bxf7.  White trades a bishop and knight (six points) for a rook (5 points).  Black comes out ahead in this exchange.  I change my mind--this is a decent move."

Even without NxQ, this move does not appear to confer any tactical advantage.  The response to Nxf7+ would be Qe7.  NxB+, Kh8, Nf5.  This does give white a pawn and bishop, but these are not worth the queen."
