9,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqk1nr/ppp1bppp/3p4/8/2B1Pp2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 5,"!? Does Ohman not see that? Actually, this isn't unusual in the King's Gambit - 1.e4 e5 2.f4 exf4 3.Bc4!? - this position is more of a variation of that opening, with Black giving check with the bishop and a White knight on f3"
10,Bh4+,e7h4,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/2B1Pp1b/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 4 6,A strange gambit which seems to serve only to expose Ohman's king - I'm fairly certain that no-one reading this annotation would have seen this move. 6.Kf1 and 6.Nxh4 are alternatives

16,Bg3,h4g3,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/2B1P3/2N2Nb1/PPPP3p/R1BQ1R1K w kq - 2 9,"So let's recap on what White has achieved in the past three moves. He gave up a pawn so that his kingside could be exposed. He then castled INTO his kingside where there were no pawns to defend him. Now, he has allowed Buck to secure a very dangerous pawn on h2 (Nxh2, Qh4! causes complications for White) What kind of rating would you give a player who does this? Actually, Ohman couldn't care less about that. What he's interested in is the semi-open f-file..."

20,Ke6,f7e6,rnbq2nr/ppp3pp/3pk3/4N3/4P3/2N3b1/PPPP3p/R1BQ1R1K w - - 2 11,"Bringing the king out into the open like this seems very suspect, but like I said I'm not seriously analysing this game - perhaps Ke7 was better here [Ke8, Qh5+] and perhaps later in the game there was a move that would have saved Black and given him the advantage, but if that had happened this game wouldn't have been nearly as entertaining!"

Surely a player who throws away material like this ought to be merely a beginner? :P Actually, of course, Black is busted, and next move Ohman may have the pleasant choices of Qf3#, Rf3#, Rd3#, Nd5#, Qe2# - five different mating threats from all of White's remaining four pieces! Black's seven pieces, on the other hand, are doing nothing!"
