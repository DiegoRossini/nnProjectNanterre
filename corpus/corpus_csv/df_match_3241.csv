2,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Some Players know their opening. My opponent thought for 3 minutes before making this first move. this game takes awhile and thought goes into ... well, most of the moves."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"if you can identify black's opening, please do."

5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/4p3/5p2/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,this was risky because of the unwanted Bb4. My friend who taught me Queen's told me to avoid Bb4 like the plague.
