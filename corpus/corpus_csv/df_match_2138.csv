1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I was not accepting challenges but I had made a challenge against djburns of the English Team and he declined.  When I had made a challenge my German national Zugspitze appeared challenging me with me opening as white.  I tried to gracefully decline but the machine in Gameknot would not allow me to decline.  I figured it was a sort of computer thing and then I though oh well why not play another game when I had told GK I was through playing games with online chess players.  It was a moment I knew I was sealing my fate to play another game despite my limitations to GK saying no more online games but then GK allowed Zugspitze to come into my chess board and there was no way to get rid of him! 

I usually open e4 so this is no surprise."
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Now comes my surprise! Zugspitze (Black from here and after with me White here and after) uses the Caro Kann against ME! I use the Caro Kann most times selecting from two other defenses I trust: Alekhine's, and Sicilian (usually in Sicilian I opt for the Shev or the Dragon).  Imagine my immediate sparkle to Zugspitze (Black) to use my favorite defense against my e4 open!  I had to check this out! And play!"
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,The first time I ever encountered the Caro was when I was playing against a blind seminarian (we were both seminarians having a hobby outside of Greek and Hebrew and Theology and Philosophy and Exegesis and Church History and Homiletics and Reformed Theology and Psychology and Sacred History and Secular History and all we had to do to get ordination.  We just got together and played chess and relaxed in Graduate School instead of going out to party.  We liked being unavailable to distractions sort of like monks in a monastery and we liked chess! This is the move I made in 1983 the first time I saw c6 to my open e4.  It was a reaction to take over the center of the board as fast as possible and it seemed the best move to make.  It turned out I had made the standard response to Caro Kann.
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"My blind friend in seminary did the same move which is standard for the Caro Kann.  At this point I can't recall what I did in 1983 with the Blind Seminarian but soon after I had played with him I studied the Caro Kann.  I liked Sicilian and Alekhine's. I had decided for my brains to give up the Ruy Lopez since my father beat it every time with the King's Gambit.  I learned the King's Gambit from him and my records here on GK show I use it ALL the time against the insignificant Ruy Lopez. I had also studied the French Defense enough to see it was mostly a blockade like in Les Miserables by Victor Hugo when his book was written about something entirely different from chess.  I had read Rommel's book on being a Platoon Leader in WWI against the French and the French like blockades and retreating instead of fighting.  The French Foreign Legion is a gathering of exceptional troops and these troops of the French Foreign Legion are not included. However, in chess the French Defense is as it was in WWI against Rommel defeated and running behind barricades."
5,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,This is called the closing action from white instead of the engaging act from white to trade pieces.  White can do other moves to engage in conflict but in this case white is dealing with the Caro Kahn and white has many published responses to d5.  I confess my response here is what I would have to think the most about if I was Caro Kann (Black).  What is happening is I am responding to Black in the fashion I know I would have to WORK HARD as Black to get this opening just right!
6,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pPb2/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,I know when I play Caro it is absolutely essential to run out the q bishop right there!
7,Bd3,f1d3,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pPb2/3P4/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 4,This is really the only thing white can do of worth and I figure black has his next move ready to go which is really very predictable in all annuls of Caro Kann.
8,Bxd3,f5d3,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pP3/3P4/3b4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,Usual.
9,Qxd3,d1d3,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pP3/3P4/3Q4/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 0 5,Usual in all history of what is going on when Black is using Caro Kann.....
10,Qa5+,d8a5,rn2kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/q2pP3/3P4/3Q4/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 1 6,"This is a deviation from what I would do if I am black using Caro. It is not what I would do.  I would have done e3 to make an Infantry formation blocking and opening the King Bishop.  

The problem when somebody does something unexpected is amateurs do unexpected things and win from sheer chance or luck or the stupefying effect it has upon a person thinking all is fine until something jumps out like a cougar to attack from nowhere.  I had to think a bit about this move and even if it is in the book written as a standard I still felt it was premature.  So....."
11,Nc3,b1c3,rn2kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/q2pP3/3P4/2NQ4/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 2 6,...can't choose the pawn over the knight to block because the pawn would block the development of the knight!
12,Qa6,a5a6,rn2kbnr/pp2pppp/q1p5/3pP3/3P4/2NQ4/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 3 7,What can my queen do at this point? If I try to set her aside it leaves black to advance at my cost.  It is time to execute that early developed queen...
13,Qxa6,d3a6,rn2kbnr/pp2pppp/Q1p5/3pP3/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 0 7,...thusly.
14,Nxa6,b8a6,r3kbnr/pp2pppp/n1p5/3pP3/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 0 8,Expected. Now to trap the black night into a useless field of fire...
15,a3,a2a3,r3kbnr/pp2pppp/n1p5/3pP3/3P4/P1N5/1PP2PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 0 8,Thusly. Now the board will be on the right side for action from white:
16,e6,e7e6,r3kbnr/pp3ppp/n1p1p3/3pP3/3P4/P1N5/1PP2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 0 9,And black does the infantry formation finally as I thought he should have done before sacrificing our queens.
17,Nf3,g1f3,r3kbnr/pp3ppp/n1p1p3/3pP3/3P4/P1N2N2/1PP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 1 9,Just reinforcement and development for the obvious reason.
18,Ne7,g8e7,r3kb1r/pp2nppp/n1p1p3/3pP3/3P4/P1N2N2/1PP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 2 10,Whatever.  I think a better move is available instead of Knight to e7. I think I would rather it have been Bishop to e7 or 0-0-0 or a few other pawn movements to advance the infantry before taking two moves to get a knight out of the king side.  I am not a genius but maybe Zugspitze is about the Caro.  The Caro is always able to respond with clarity for the next moves.  I think some moves done by black are not in synch with Caro but I cannot really figure it out for now because I never used these moves in the sequences black is doing now.  It is going to be a learning lesson for me at this point.
19,O-O,e1g1,r3kb1r/pp2nppp/n1p1p3/3pP3/3P4/P1N2N2/1PP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 3 10,I basically have to get my rooks doubled and 0-0 is the fast way to do it.  It also means I have to commit to the right side of the board with my King....
20,h5,h7h5,r3kb1r/pp2npp1/n1p1p3/3pP2p/3P4/P1N2N2/1PP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 0 11,"This game is ongoing and is actually 13 moves ahead of all this.  I am annotating it now and making it public since GK let someone challenge me when I said I would decline all challenges.  Whatever anyone says about this game until the 10th move is so far behind the actual game.  I don't think Zugspitze or I would really care what is publically stated about what to do after what move.  When a game is played it is between the two and when this game finishes I will deliver the final annotation along with my worthy opponent, Zugspitze.  So hold your horses on this game until we end it and remember we are 13 moves ahead.  Remember you cannot counsel either one of us while this game progresses.  You may look at it but it is cheating if either one of us is helped along the way.  This is Gameknot policy for online chess."
