1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is my first annotation, so be gentle with me. This was a blitz game I played on Gameknot. All of the analysis was done by myself without engines or anything so please let me know anything that was missed as I'm sure I didn't catch everything. Thank you for reading!"
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"This is not terribly common in the Sicilian, as e6 essentially negates it."

4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 3,Regardless of the bishop I like playing e6. It allows for my bishop to come to c5 if an exchange occurs and it allows for d5 to be played in one move.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 3,"I was dubious about this, and retrospectively I think it was not a good move, for a number of reasons. Firstly, it weakens the dark squares on my kingside, which becomes supremely relevant. Secondly, it is intended to allow me to fiancetto my dark squared bishop, which weakens c5."
