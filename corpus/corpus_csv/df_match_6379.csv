1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

This is going back nearly two years when I was a Class C player.  I feel that the Dentist (who has a current Class D rating of 1363) ought to be a Class C player too and this game illustrates the facts.  He gave me nothing in this game and made no obvious mistakes and I ended up having to tread carefully to avoid an ignominious defeat.  In the end I ended up conceding a Low Draw, luckily the game was unrated so I did not incur any penalty points with that result.  Just as well because Gameknot Analysis told me I had a won position, aargh and double aargh.  Here is the link to gameknot analysis:-  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=9023239&fb=1&rnd=0.09381839335531355.  White kicks off with 1. d4."
