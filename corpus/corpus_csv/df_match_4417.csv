1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"A game I was sure I would win with ease, after gaining a winning position I thought a win was going to be easy however with some determined play by my opponent the full point gradually slipped through my fingers. My opponent in this game showed a never say die attitude that just goes to show that one shouldn't give up.

4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/2P1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,I figured the best way to go about this is to make use of the d4 square which seems to be blacks best shot.

As well as that I figured blacks going to aim for queenside expansion and this prepares that."
