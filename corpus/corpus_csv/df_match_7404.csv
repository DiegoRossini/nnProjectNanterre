1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This is a good game to start a discussion on the caro kann from black's point of view. The reason this is true is because black follows a simple positional game by placing all of his pieces on the standard squares.

9,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pp1npppp/2p5/8/2BPN3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 2 5,This was at the time it was first played by A. Karpov a revolutionary move. The whole point of the move was to punish black of a haste 6...h6. Because of Bxf7++

12,e6,e7e6,r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/6N1/2BP4/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 7,A typical move where white adds to the control of e4 and increases pressure on e6.

14,Nb6,d7b6,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/1np1pn2/6N1/2BP4/8/PPP1QPPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 2 8,This move was introduced by Kornchoi and breathed new life into a stale game for black. The idea of this move is to gain tempo by attacking the bishop and manoeuvring the knight to d5
15,Bd3,c4d3,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/1np1pn2/6N1/3P4/3B4/PPP1QPPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 3 8,"Now that the bishop has been move off the g8-a2 diagonal it is safe to kick the knight out of g5.
My plan after kicking out the knight is to develop the rest of my pieces. After that I will turn my sights on to forcing through a c6-c5 thrust."

I don't want to get to deep into caro kann strategies but the c6-c5 thrust is critical to blacks chances of winning."

In this situation black is quite safe as it would take white some time in order to mount attack against the black king. However, the same can not be said for white as black is already in king hunting mode."
