2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,Alekhine's defence...  Black plays the move in order to entice white's pawns forward so that it weakens white's position and makes targets for black to attack (hypermodern).

4,Nd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/3nP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"Clearly, there are few moves better than this one.

Beginners tend to play 2...Ne4, which is weak to 3.d4, cutting off all escapes, or 3.d3, gaining plural tempi.

Nevertheless, this move is solid."
