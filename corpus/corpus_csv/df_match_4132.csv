It start a biut slow, but at it height both players throw in some big moves.
And the game seem to change direction several times.

Its only thorugh sheer agressiveness that I managed to win it in the end.
Buty more importanly my oponnent and me both trully enjoyed playing this game."

I contemplated d5, but I did not like it.
So instead I took the safe road, but it is too passive."

If I can just break it open for my pieces to come out, I could do some severe damage.
