17,d4,d2d4,r1bq1b1r/ppp1n1pp/4k3/3np3/2BP4/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 0 9,"standard mainline move, black can't take the pawn as after Qe4  he can't hold on to the d5 knight"
18,c6,c7c6,r1bq1b1r/pp2n1pp/2p1k3/3np3/2BP4/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 0 10,trying to expose the badly placed black king. white needs to act quickly as the black forces are in a poor state for now but given time black will unravel and white will be left with little compensation for the piece
19,dxe5,d4e5,r1bq1b1r/pp2n1pp/2p1k3/3nP3/2B5/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 0 10,trying to expose the badly placed black king. white needs to act quickly as the black forces are in a poor state for now but given time black will unravel and white will be left with little compensation for the piece
20,Ng6,e7g6,r1bq1b1r/pp4pp/2p1k1n1/3nP3/2B5/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 1 11,atempting to get the black pieces into fighting positions by unblocking the dark square bishop
21,O-O,e1g1,r1bq1b1r/pp4pp/2p1k1n1/3nP3/2B5/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 2 11,white is going to need every last piece in his attack if he can get them into the game with threat then this will add to his advantage in time which he hopes to turn into a more permanent advantage such as material or positional
22,Nxe5,g6e5,r1bq1b1r/pp4pp/2p1k3/3nn3/2B5/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 0 12,"?! not sure about this one, black takes a pawn that was shielding his king with a piece he's already moved thrice. i think the white pawn on e5 was doing a good job for the black king by shielding him from the eyes of whites rooks, and black has more important things to do like activate his pieces."
23,Re1,f1e1,r1bq1b1r/pp4pp/2p1k3/3nn3/2B5/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B1R1K1 b - - 1 12,the black king can't be happy sitting in the centre of the board surronded by enemy pieces pinning the few defenders he has around him to him. looking at the board its easy to forget white is down a piece as his piece activity and the black kings uncomfortable position more than make up for the material deficit.
24,Bd6,f8d6,r1bq3r/pp4pp/2pbk3/3nn3/2B5/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B1R1K1 w - - 2 13,"?? activating the bishop, but this allows the white queen to close in on her prey on e6"
25,Nxd5,c3d5,r1bq3r/pp4pp/2pbk3/3Nn3/2B5/5Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B1R1K1 b - - 0 13,"taking the white knight here loses the e5 knight as after Qxd5  the white king has no good squares, Ke7 loses to Qf7#, Kd7 allows the e5 kinght to be taken when white is up 2 pawns with a dominating position, and Kf6 also allows Rxe5 as Bxf5 runs into Qf7#"
26,Kd7,e6d7,r1bq3r/pp1k2pp/2pb4/3Nn3/2B5/5Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B1R1K1 w - - 1 14,"taking the white knight here loses the e5 knight as after Qxd5  the white king has no good squares, Ke7 loses to Qf7#, Kd7 allows the e5 kinght to be taken when white is up 2 pawns with a dominating position, and Kf6 also allows Rxe5 as Bxf5 runs into Qf7#"
27,Qf5+,f3f5,r1bq3r/pp1k2pp/2pb4/3NnQ2/2B5/8/PPP2PPP/R1B1R1K1 b - - 2 14,with both knight and bishop attacked white must operate with checks or exchange his rook for the offending knight. as it turns out white does both.
28,Ke8,d7e8,r1bqk2r/pp4pp/2pb4/3NnQ2/2B5/8/PPP2PPP/R1B1R1K1 w - - 3 15,"unfortunatly there is no way to forcibly remove the white knight on d5, if white could he would like to remove the piece from the board as then Qf7 is checkmate."

31,Qxe5+,f5e5,r1bqk2r/pp4pp/2p5/3NQ3/2B5/8/PPP2PPP/R1B3K1 b - - 0 16,so he just takes the bishop
32,Kd7,e8d7,r1bq3r/pp1k2pp/2p5/3NQ3/2B5/8/PPP2PPP/R1B3K1 w - - 1 17,"here the white knight is invunrable as after cxd5 his king is fataly exposed and Bb5 mates, also notice how blacks forces can barely move here so white can bring in the reserves at will"
33,Bf4,c1f4,r1bq3r/pp1k2pp/2p5/3NQ3/2B2B2/8/PPP2PPP/R5K1 b - - 2 17,further restricting the black pieces by threatening Qd6 should any piece attempt to come to the e8 square. at this stage black can only thrash around as the the white pieces have unrestricted access to the black monarch
34,cxd5,c6d5,r1bq3r/pp1k2pp/8/3pQ3/2B2B2/8/PPP2PPP/R5K1 w - - 0 18,"?? unfortunatly my opponent did not notice the simple mating threat, however the threat of Nb6  followed by Rd1# is impossible to meet, the best try i can find is Qf8 but this still instantly loses to Nb6 as Kd8 is met with Bg5"
35,Bb5#,c4b5,r1bq3r/pp1k2pp/8/1B1pQ3/5B2/8/PPP2PPP/R5K1 b - - 1 18,"if you have any questions/comments on the game/annotation, can think of ways i can improve my annotations or if i missed anything in my analysis then please message me. thanks for reading :)"
