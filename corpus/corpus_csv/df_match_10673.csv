1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I'm playing Thomas G, a fellow Alabama Chess Federation reserve player.  He's a catastrophically underrated player both OTB and on gameknot and the most shining example of adult ADHD I've ever seen.  ...meaning he'd destroy me every game we play here if it weren't for the fact that I'm really just one in a simul of 10 or 20 he's playing with very little time per board.  Don't let the nearly 400 point rating difference fool you, this guy is every bit my match.  Come to think of it, I think he's up on me in casual blitz games something like 2 to 1 (IHOP, Montgomery, February 2007 -- I did *not* expect to get demolished like that, Tom.)"

I did better than I thought.  But I'm not going to do any of the bicycle-with-training-wheels systems (colle, torre)...  I'm going for... er.  Hell I don't even know what to call this.  Sigh."

Apparently not.  Shredder gives: If hxN, Bxg6, black declines to take back -- Qd7 and black gets to stay alive, apparently.  Black has to be extremely careful, but It's not a totally winning sac for white unless the second piece is accepted.  Ain't that a kick in the pants!"
