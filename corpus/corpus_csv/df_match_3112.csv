1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Hi all; here's a brief by-request annotation of a recent game. This particular game shows how one small mistake early on can cascade into an unwinnable position over the course of the game. Enjoy!
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I've been playing the Latvian Gambit in these games. It makes for very sharp, decisive play, where the game may hang in the balance on every move."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"I've been playing the Latvian Gambit in these games. It makes for very sharp, decisive play, where the game may hang in the balance on every move."
4,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"I've been playing the Latvian Gambit in these games. It makes for very sharp, decisive play, where the game may hang in the balance on every move."
5,d3,d2d3,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"Too passive a continuation for my tastes, but safer than the main lines (3.Nxe5, 3.Bc4, 3.exf4, 3.d4)."
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/2n5/4pp2/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,"A waiting move. This Knight frequently proves hard to develop in this opening, so I prefer to get it into play early."
7,Be3,c1e3,r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/2n5/4pp2/4P3/3PBN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,"White's play is solid, if passive. This Bishop usually develops to g5 (or beyond!)"
8,d6,d7d6,r1bqkbnr/ppp3pp/2np4/4pp2/4P3/3PBN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Inaccurate, but not deadly by any means. This move doesn't have any real effect except to hinder White's QN's development. As I mentioned earlier, d2-d4 was playable all the way back at move 3; it didn't need support."
9,c3,c2c3,r1bqkbnr/ppp3pp/2np4/4pp2/4P3/2PPBN2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"Inaccurate, but not deadly by any means. This move doesn't have any real effect except to hinder White's QN's development. As I mentioned earlier, d2-d4 was playable all the way back at move 3; it didn't need support."
10,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/ppp3pp/2np1n2/4pp2/4P3/2PPBN2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,Black continues development while pressuring the White center.
11,Nbd2,b1d2,r1bqkb1r/ppp3pp/2np1n2/4pp2/4P3/2PPBN2/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 2 6,"? And here, suddenly, unexpectedly, White throws away a piece with a subtle mistake. The thing to notice is that with this move, White's Bishop is trapped."
12,f4,f5f4,r1bqkb1r/ppp3pp/2np1n2/4p3/4Pp2/2PPBN2/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"And now Black wins the Bishop for a pawn. It's worth mentioning right now, I think, that White's play is very solid for the rest of the game. 6.Nbd2 was the only real mistake."
13,Bxf4,e3f4,r1bqkb1r/ppp3pp/2np1n2/4p3/4PB2/2PP1N2/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,I like 8.Be2 better; this doesn't serve much of a purpose and loses a move.
14,exf4,e5f4,r1bqkb1r/ppp3pp/2np1n2/8/4Pp2/2PP1N2/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,I like 8.Be2 better; this doesn't serve much of a purpose and loses a move.
15,Ng5,f3g5,r1bqkb1r/ppp3pp/2np1n2/6N1/4Pp2/2PP4/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 8,I like 8.Be2 better; this doesn't serve much of a purpose and loses a move.

17,Ngf3,g5f3,r1bqkb1r/ppp3p1/2np1n1p/8/4Pp2/2PP1N2/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 9,"White looks like he's planning to go kingside, so Black prepares to castle queenside and aims a battery toward the WK along the c8-h3 diagonal."

21,Qa4,d1a4,r3kb1r/pppq2p1/2npbn1p/8/Q3Pp2/2PP1N2/PP1NBPPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 5 11,"White's play is a little scattered, but not at all bad. Here he begins to make queenside threats, to discourage Black from castling."
22,g5,g7g5,r3kb1r/pppq4/2npbn1p/6p1/Q3Pp2/2PP1N2/PP1NBPPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 12,Shoring up the weak pawn.
23,Nd4,f3d4,r3kb1r/pppq4/2npbn1p/6p1/Q2NPp2/2PP4/PP1NBPPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 1 12,White's plans begin to take form; he piles up on the Nc6.
24,Bg4,e6g4,r3kb1r/pppq4/2np1n1p/6p1/Q2NPpb1/2PP4/PP1NBPPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 2 13,"There's no real need to deal with the queenside pressure yet, so Black offers a trade. Normally it's disadvantageous to trade a good Bishop for a bad one (as here), but Black is following a single very simple principle: when ahead in material (especially by a whole piece), trade pieces."
