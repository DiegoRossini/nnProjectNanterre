1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Black opts for the agressive sicilian line. Immediately it was tempting for me to accept a cramped position to avoid playing someone in their area of expertise, but i considered the rating difference and went ahead with mainline stuff."

10,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3ppn2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"I know black here normally plays a6, but for the life of me i couldn't remember what he got out of it. Possibly, it is played to facilitate e5, so if he just accepts a more conservative e6 maybe it wins him a tempo?"
11,g4,g2g4,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3ppn2/8/3NP1P1/2N5/PPP2P1P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"Pushing on the kingside. I decided to go for it as early a possible, before i'd developed my pieces or got my king safe, because i know how quick attacks normally come in the sicilian. note that to attack this unprotected pawn with his bishop black would have to lose a tempo by pushing the e pawn again (and i'd play Nf5)."
12,h6,h7h6,rnbqkb1r/pp3pp1/3ppn1p/8/3NP1P1/2N5/PPP2P1P/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,He ended up playing this pawn move anyway. Maybe he should've played it earlier and my pawns wouldn't look so strong in the middle if i let him play e5.

16,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/1p2bpp1/p2ppn1p/8/3NPPP1/2N2Q2/PPP4P/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 2 9,This move serves no purpose other than preparing to castle my king. I was eager to get my rook on the semi open file opposing his queen.

18,b5,b7b5,rnbqk2r/4bpp1/p2ppn1p/1p6/3NPPP1/2N1BQ2/PPP4P/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 10,"b5?? This is black's first obvious mistake, losing him material."
19,e5,e4e5,rnbqk2r/4bpp1/p2ppn1p/1p2P3/3N1PP1/2N1BQ2/PPP4P/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 10,"Either the rook or the knight has to fall. The best move here would be Nd5, reducing black's material disadvantage to a pawn, but the queen would be left on a powerful square threatening black's weakest pawn and his rook."
20,d5,d6d5,rnbqk2r/4bpp1/p3pn1p/1p1pP3/3N1PP1/2N1BQ2/PPP4P/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 11,"This is probably worst, because at least if he loses his rook my attack will be delayed a bit. This way white can launch into an attack right out of the opening."

Possibly better is Nd7, discouraging any further pawn pushes on white's kingside (specifically the f pawn, or anything defended by the f pawn)."
25,O-O-O,e1c1,rn1qk2r/1b3pp1/p3pb1p/1p1p4/3N1PP1/2NBBQ2/PPP4P/2KR3R b kq - 3 13,"I saw a game recently where white castled kingside. Although in my position, i've already pushed two of my pawns so it may be questionable, arguably most of black's pieces are on the queenside, whereas most of white's are on the kingside. Maybe a kingside castling would've worked here too."
