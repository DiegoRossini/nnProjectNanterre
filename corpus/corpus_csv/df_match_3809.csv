The text move leads to exciting, probably-equal play, falling somewhere between those calmer lines and the wild Frankenstein-Dracula variation (3...Nxe5!? 4.Qh5+ Nd6 5.Bb3 Nc6 6.Nb5 g6 7.Qf3 f5 8.Qd5 Qe7 9.Nxc7+ Kd8 10.Nxa8 b6)."
7,d3,d2d3,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/1bB1P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 4,"4.f4 is the book move here, not that we're at all off the GK database yet. The main intent of the Vienna Game, though, is generally for White to transpose into a favorable line of the King's Gambit. There's no danger of Black winning the e-pawn for free, because 4.f4 Bxc3 is met with 5.dxc3 Nxe4 6.Bxf7+ Kxf7 8.Qd5+ and White wins the Knight back with a strong position."

This sacrifice shuts down White's attack entirely, for if 16.Bxf8 Rxf8, White has exchanged a powerful, aggressive piece for an entirely passive one of his opponent's. 15...Nf4! also shuts the WQ out of the attack, and thanks to the doubled pawns it is completely untouchable without at least an even exchange--which is to say, a favorable exchange for Black."
