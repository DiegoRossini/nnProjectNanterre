This threatens a possible Nxc2 and fork attacks in the future. This move also appears to leave my own Knight awkwardly en prise. A possible (read mundane) continuation is: 9.Nxd5 Nxd5 10. Bxd5 Qxd5 11. Qf3 which retains material equality but obliterates my centre.

Edit: After further review I realize this is a horrible position for Black."

I played this move in the hope of getting some tactical fun out of what seemed like a rigid position. At the time it seemed dodgy but I have not found a refutation to it. An even stronger play was 9.
