This is his fairly standard opening in all of the games I played against Shane Hill.  He brings out his Queen after moving one of his pawns.  It's week, but effective if played right."

By castling queenside, I gain the open file with my rook -- after all, another amateur stresses -- ""Put your rooks on open files!""  It also tucks my king away in a secure location.  I was confident about this move.  Usually, I castle king side because I feel better about castling King side.  However, this particular game requires the Rook to be on the d file to own this file.  The quickest way to move it to where I need it is to Castle."

Note though, I could never form an Alekhine Gun in any of my games, even though I try too.  The formation is two rooks on one file with the queen backing them up.  However, my games always results differently against this opponent.  However, I am using my rook effectively by castling Queen side."

My queen is a sitting duck, a fair exchange.  Even though I was up a pawn, if White took my queen by Qxe5; then I have to respond with Rxe5 and be down a Queen (7 points).  I would be a pawn up, but still, I would have lost my queen which would make this game longer and much more exciting."
