8,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk1nr/ppppbppp/2n5/6B1/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,"Another questionable move by White.  White advances the h4 pawn which compromises the king side pawn structure if White intends to castle in that direction.  White might have been trying to prevent moving the knight from f3 (which is threatening to capture Black's d pawn).   however i this position, White can simple move Bf4 which still gives him an active bishop although he did allow Black to develop his BSB."

Although the f6 attack can lead to a very strong king side initiative (6. Bf4 g5 7. hxg5 fxg5 )  If White wishes to continue to trade in this scenario the black king can be left with no pieces to defend his flank.
11,Bf4,g5f4,r1bqk1nr/ppppb1pp/2n2p2/8/3pPB1P/5N2/PPP2PP1/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,The bishop check allows black to trade down an awkward pawn for White's c pawn however Black would have been better to continue development at this point.  Pushing the d pawn to allow for the development of his WSB and to help prepare to castle would have been better.
12,Bb4+,e7b4,r1bqk1nr/pppp2pp/2n2p2/8/1b1pPB1P/5N2/PPP2PP1/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 2 7,The bishop check allows black to trade down an awkward pawn for White's c pawn however Black would have been better to continue development at this point.

21,O-O,e1g1,r1b1k1nr/ppp1q1pp/2np1p2/b2Q4/2B1PB1P/2P2N2/P4PP1/RN3RK1 b kq - 3 11,White should have reviewed Bb5 at this point.  This combination may very well allow White to go up a piece for a pawn.  (11.  ...  Bd7  12.  Bxc6  Bxc6  13. Qxa5)  or (11.  ...  Bxc3  12.  Nxc3).  The only other attempt to save the bishop (11.  ...  Bb6  12.  Bxc6  bxc6  13. Qxc6 ) leaves the a8 rook to black.

It is imperative that he hold onto his pawns so that White will be forced to sac key pieces in order to reach the king.  Black is in a completely defensive state with little thought of attacking White.
