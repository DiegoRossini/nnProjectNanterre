1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game was not pretty equal. I was  at least 200 points rating lower than my opponent and he won the first easily.
I was surprised he agreed for a rematch, because i was not strong enough.
(but there was a reason behind!)
Let's go with d4, my favorite 1st move."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"Most of my games begin like that.
My computer chessgame tells me this is not so good, but i like it.
I must say i often have trouble in classic games, but in blitz with short time,
it surprises opponents, and i win many games that include this opening.

One more detail: we both play very fast; even if it is a 2 days per move game, the maximum is 3 minutes between 2 moves (both addicted to the game that night!)."

6,c6,c7c6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p2B1/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"It closes the road back for my bishop, but it puts pressure, threaten the Queen if e7-e6, may force opponent to move h&g pawns."
