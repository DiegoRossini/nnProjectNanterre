1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I open with King pawn
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,He follow's suit.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"I really am trying to distract him with attacking his pawn, I want to open king side castling."
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,he protects with pawn
5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 3,I pull out my bishop so now i have a clear back row king side while my opponent is still locked in.
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 4,"He attacks my pawn, I think he is thinking the same thing. Hide the king!"
7,d3,d2d3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/2B1P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,"I have to advance my pawn to protect. No biggy this does several things. Opens bishop up, protects e pawn and allows my queen to stay at home. I suspect b f8 to come out."
8,h6,h7h6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2pp1/3p1n1p/4p3/2B1P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,Oh! I guess he didn't like it last time when I pinned his knight to his queen. So he take's precations this time.
9,O-O,e1g1,rnbqkb1r/ppp2pp1/3p1n1p/4p3/2B1P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 5,Ok this allows me to get him hid safe and sound. Bishop f8 now will come out.
10,a6,a7a6,rnbqkb1r/1pp2pp1/p2p1n1p/4p3/2B1P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 6,"Ok, I guess he is playing defensively. Not a bad idea, but since he's beaten two or three times in a row now I would've thought he'd think a little more aggresively."
11,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/1pp2pp1/p2p1n1p/4p3/2B1P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 6,"I advance some materail, to gain more ground in the middle."
12,b5,b7b5,rnbqkb1r/2p2pp1/p2p1n1p/1p2p3/2B1P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,"He pushes my bishop, gaining ground in the middle with pawns."
13,Bd5,c4d5,rnbqkb1r/2p2pp1/p2p1n1p/1p1Bp3/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 7,"Threatening his rook will almost certainly get my bishop taken, but I have plenty of support"
14,Nxd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/2p2pp1/p2p3p/1p1np3/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,expected. p e4 or knight c3?
15,Nxd5,c3d5,rnbqkb1r/2p2pp1/p2p3p/1p1Np3/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,"I'll go with the knight, it keeps my pawn structure strong and happy. The only thing bad about this is, that my knight is an easy target from p c7 and I'll have to retreat him in back to back moves."
16,Be6,c8e6,rn1qkb1r/2p2pp1/p2pb2p/1p1Np3/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 1 9,He opt's for the bishop kinght trade. I'll take it if he does.
17,a4,a2a4,rn1qkb1r/2p2pp1/p2pb2p/1p1Np3/P3P3/3P1N2/1PP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 9,"So I'll advance a pawn, try to thin out his middle defenses a little."
18,c6,c7c6,rn1qkb1r/5pp1/p1ppb2p/1p1Np3/P3P3/3P1N2/1PP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 10,Now he brings the pawn up... Not as confident about my middle ground hold now. That pawn line looks more daunting that what I anticipated.
19,Nc3,d5c3,rn1qkb1r/5pp1/p1ppb2p/1p2p3/P3P3/2NP1N2/1PP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 10,"I didn't want to put him back in the same spot, but I have a feeling that I'll need his defense here very soon."
20,b4,b5b4,rn1qkb1r/5pp1/p1ppb2p/4p3/Pp2P3/2NP1N2/1PP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 11,I should have figured he'd something irritating like that.
