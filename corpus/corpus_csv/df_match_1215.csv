This has the advantage of getting black to commit himself before white plays Bd3.  For example, if black plays Be7 first, then in the game that follows he would not have had the option of playing Qxf6 later."

Kg7 (Ke7, f5 {Threatens a crushing Bg5+} f6 and now Nxc5 or Bg5! anyway and black is crushed) , Bc4! with mate threats.  If after Rxd5 c4 instead, Nc6+! with the powerful threat of Qe3+, so if Black plays Ke6 (Qxc6, Qe3+ Qe6, Re5), Qe3+ Kxd5, Bf3+ with a crushing king hunt:  Kd6, Qd4+ Ke6, Qxc4+ Kd6, Be3 Bg7, Bc5+ Kd7, Qxf7+ Kc8, Na7+ Kd8 (Kb8, Bd6!), Nc6+ Kc8, Qe6+ Kb7, Nb4+ forces mate."
