3,g4,g2g4,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/2P3P1/8/PP1PPP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"... the Krejcik Gambit! ...I don't know: technically this may not be the Krejcik because that's a gambit against the Dutch. By opening 1. c4 White keeps the option of playing his d-pawn to the 3rd rank, and with his Bishop on g2 (buck-nekkid fianchetto though it may be), the opening becomes more like the English. If the t-crossers and i-dotters insist on the purity of 1. d4 f5  2. g4!? as the Krejcik, then let's by all means call 1. c4 f5  2. g4!? the Avocet Gambit.  ;-)"
