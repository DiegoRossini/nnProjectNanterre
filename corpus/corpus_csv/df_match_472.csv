1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Yet again I get struck down by passivitis and my Class C opponent brews up a really nasty attack which leaves my King Henry shivering under the familiar dark dark shadow of Old Matey.  Somehow my opponent takes his foot off the gas and gives me much needed breathing space which enables my queen, Glenda, to mount a lone wolf counter-attack on King Rick.  It is all hope chess but luckily Rick overlooks a saving move which would have kept his attack going.  Rick's mistake, however, ensures that his attack is stopped short and never to go again when his old King died.  So, how did this happen?  Well, read on."
