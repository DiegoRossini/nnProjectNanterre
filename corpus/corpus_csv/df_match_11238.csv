1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Don't look at this game if you expect spectacular moves or sacrifices. This is one of my real league games with a 3h time control. It is not an example of an excellent game of mine but one can learn from it. I have annotated the critical parts with questions to the reader so one might make guesses for better moves.
