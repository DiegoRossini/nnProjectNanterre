1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game played in the Chess coaching club mini-tournament is not so much an analytical annotation of a game in the usual sense but more just my personal (and very brief) thoughts at various points. 

The aim of the tournament (and these 'annotations') is to allow the players taking part to discuss the strategic and tactical factors of the finished games. The stronger players then being able to help those whose weaknesses may become apparent through the annotations (like me and my bad thought processes!) and the weaker players to have a chance to learn from the stronger players thoughts throughout their games."

I felt that he would almost certainly play Nc6 to try and develop with tempo if I played Qxd4. But the advanced d-pawn would allow for a pin the consequnce of which would be that the queen, in an active position, would actually be quite stable for the moment."

In the end I couldn't see a concrete reason not to take the pawn..."
