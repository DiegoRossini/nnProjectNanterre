5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2pP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,Moving the knight twice in the opening is weak.  Seems like a novice  mistake.

11,O-O,e1g1,rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/3q4/8/2BPn3/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 2 6,"In my chess lessons, I have repeatedly shown examples of how this move can run into problems after white plays moves like Ne5 and Qb3.  The problem is that in queen pawn openings, moving the c8 biship leaves the b7 square vulnerable where white can at least gain a tempo by playing Qb3."

15,Ne5,f3e5,rn2kb1r/ppp1pppp/6q1/4N3/2BPn1b1/1Q2P3/PP3PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 6 8,I seem to be attacking everything.
16,Qg5,g6g5,rn2kb1r/ppp1pppp/8/4N1q1/2BPn1b1/1Q2P3/PP3PPP/RNB2RK1 w kq - 7 9,"Now white could play Nxg4, Bxf7+, or ..."
