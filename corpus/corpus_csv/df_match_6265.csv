4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Declining the King's Gambit. Unfortunately I've found this to be a little bit of a weak opening, because it doesn't seem to do much. It'd be good for beginners though, who don't know that much about this gambit."
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4PP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"This was interesting. I'd much rather play 3. ... exf4 if I was him, but this is interesting too."

8,h6,h7h6,rn1qkbnr/ppp2pp1/3p3p/4p3/2B1PPb1/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"(?!) I think he's scared of 5. Bxf7+ Kxf7 6. Ng5 ... 7. Qxg4. But I would have thought 4. ... Nf6 significantly repels this by protecting Bg4 and developing at the same time, and also threatening e4."
9,fxe5,f4e5,rn1qkbnr/ppp2pp1/3p3p/4P3/2B1P1b1/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,I set up this threat my own way.
10,dxe5,d6e5,rn1qkbnr/ppp2pp1/7p/4p3/2B1P1b1/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,But only because I've seen it before.
