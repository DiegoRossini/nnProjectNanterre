1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Annotated by legspin.  This is the first game I have annotated.  I picked this one due to a rook sacrifice later in the game which I thought people may find interesting.  I am not a grandmaster (or anywhere near), I have not memorised all openings.  I do refer to a book for openings and I am not as good over the board as on this site.  However, I do think about what I am doing and try to understand why certain moves are the preferred one.  This is my view of what happened and why - better players may disagree but lets not worry about that!  My favourite opening.  Who knows whats coming back at you?"
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Sicilian - fairly standard amongst top players on this site.  Which of the many thousand variations is coming?
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Standard response
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"OK, I'm now thinking probably Nadjorf but I'll have to wait and see"
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,Standard response which should lead to the normal trade off
6,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,Yep
7,Nxd4,f3d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,And again
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"Now this took me by surprise.  Nearly all Sicilian openings would see Nf6.  Some  use Nc6 as the second move instead of d6 but I cannot find a variation that would result in the above position in my sources.  That said, I have looked on some game databases and this does happen fairly regularly so I reserve judgement.  Nf6 would force Nc3 to protect the pawn.  I now have free reign to do what I want so I plumped for continuing development."
9,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,Now I was expecting Nf6.............but
10,a6,a7a6,r1bqkbnr/1p2pppp/p1np4/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,So now we have the Nadjorf position but with a black knight at c6 rather than f6.  Not quite sure whats going on here so continue development...
11,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqkbnr/1p2pppp/p1np4/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,Pin the pawn preventing e5 and an attack on the knight
12,Qa5,d8a5,r1b1kbnr/1p2pppp/p1np4/q5B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 7,Pins my knight and attacks the bishop.  Personally I'm not keen on developing the queen so early when the whole kingside remains stationary.  This comes back to cause problems later.
13,Nf3,d4f3,r1b1kbnr/1p2pppp/p1np4/q5B1/4P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 3 7,Knight back to protect bishop and make the knight better protected whilst also maintaining control on the centre of the board
14,Bg4,c8g4,r3kbnr/1p2pppp/p1np4/q5B1/4P1b1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 4 8,Black development continues pinning my knight.  Time to chase off the queen and prepare for a queenside castle which is under pressure at the moment with the queen  at a5.
15,Bd2,g5d2,r3kbnr/1p2pppp/p1np4/q7/4P1b1/2N2N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 5 8,Threatening Nd5 and a revealed threat on the queen
16,Qd8,a5d8,r2qkbnr/1p2pppp/p1np4/8/4P1b1/2N2N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 6 9,Black queen retreats in anticipation
17,Qe2,d1e2,r2qkbnr/1p2pppp/p1np4/8/4P1b1/2N2N2/PPPBQPPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 7 9,"Queens gone so no need to move the knight, get the queen out of the way and double it with the bishop."
18,Nd4,c6d4,r2qkbnr/1p2pppp/p2p4/8/3nP1b1/2N2N2/PPPBQPPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 8 10,Threatening the queen and  c2 with a fork on the king and rook
19,Qd3,e2d3,r2qkbnr/1p2pppp/p2p4/8/3nP1b1/2NQ1N2/PPPB1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 9 10,Avoiding the Nxd4 blunder which would have let the bishop take my queen took the only move available to protect c2 and move the queen other than going backwards and messing up my castling as well as leaving it less well developed
20,Nxf3+,d4f3,r2qkbnr/1p2pppp/p2p4/8/4P1b1/2NQ1n2/PPPB1PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 11,Check - no choice for a reponse
