9,Nb5,d4b5,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n5/1N2p3/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,White threatens 6.Nd6  Bxd6 7.Qxd6. The Old Lowenthal Sicilian allows this but the Kalashnikov has a different way of dealing with it.
10,d6,d7d6,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2np4/1N2p3/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Protected by Black's Queen and Bishop, the threat of Nd6  has been deflected."
11,Nb1c3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2np4/1N2p3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"Most common moves for White in this position are 6.c4, preventing a later b5 by Black, or 6.Nc3, taking immediate aim at the hole created on d5. This particular Sicilian variation allows this hole in exchange for more active piece play."
12,a6,a7a6,r1bqkbnr/1p3ppp/p1np4/1N2p3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"Development move choices were Nf6, Be6/d7, and Be7. The move 7...Nf6, threatening the e4 pawn was probably the better choice as it would have discouraged an immediate 8.Nd5 by White. ***** (Edit for Wakefield - 7...b5 is indeed more thematic and I miscalculated the value of playing it a turn earlier then I did. I was perhaps overly concerned about 8.Nd5 or a wierd piece sac on b5 since White attacked the square 3 times."
13,Na3,b5a3,r1bqkbnr/1p3ppp/p1np4/4p3/4P3/N1N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 7,"Development move choices were Nf6, Be6/d7, and Be7.

15,Nc4,a3c4,r1bqk1nr/1p2bppp/p1np4/4p3/2N1P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 8,"Had c4 been played earlier, White could have played Nc2 into the pocket behind the c3 Knight. However, this would have left d4 unguarded by a pawn, possibly allowing Black to park his own Knight there if given the chance."
16,b5,b7b5,r1bqk1nr/4bppp/p1np4/1p2p3/2N1P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 9,"The open d-file and the placement of the Knights are White's compensation for the earlier loss of tempo from the Knight on Ne3 which has had to move 6 times in the last 9 moves.

Black must attempt to use his lead in tempo and space and translate it into a developmental or positional advantage before White finishes his own development and takes advantage of the d5 hole by parking a Knight on it."

The first book I ever read on chess was Weapons of Chess by Bruce Pandolfini. The zwischen or inbetween move and other tactical concepts I learned from that book played a large part in shaping my early chess.

Had White played Bd2 earlier, he would have been forced to recapture with the pawn, creating an isolated b-pawn."

It is possible that White wanted his Knights to remain where they were to take advantage of the d5 hole and/or to more easily prevent d5. I am not sure whether or not this constitutes as a blunder.
34,Ba6,c8a6,q4rk1/4bppp/b2p1n2/1Q2p3/4P3/2N1NP2/1PP3PP/2B2RK1 w - - 1 18,I skewer the Queen and the Rook behind it. I will get one or the other in exchange for my Bishop which is worth the sacrifice of one of my last Queen side pawns as long as I can eliminate White's majority on that side later.
