1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,The old favourite.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,And the usual response.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,I develop my knight.
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,Defending the e5 pawn and opening a line for black's bishop.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,I develop my other knight.
6,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2pp4/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"c6, laying claim to d5 - stopping me putting my knight there later if I want to anyway."
7,Be2,f1e2,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2pp4/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"Aware that black may pin my knight, I make a bad move. This was very passive, and a waste of time. Bb4 would have been a better bishop move, or h3 would have removed the threat of the pin."
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2pp1n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,Developing a knight.
9,O-O,e1g1,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2pp1n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 3 5,I castle.
10,b5,b7b5,rnbqkb1r/p4ppp/2pp1n2/1p2p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 6,Black has made a lot of pawn moves and only developed one piece. His development should be significantly worse than mine. But this move restricts the movements of my minor pieces and I'm starting to feel a bit cramped...
11,b4,b2b4,rnbqkb1r/p4ppp/2pp1n2/1p2p3/1P2P3/2N2N2/P1PPBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 6,Trying to halt blacks pawn push on my  queenside.
12,a5,a7a5,rnbqkb1r/5ppp/2pp1n2/pp2p3/1P2P3/2N2N2/P1PPBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,Another pawn move!
13,bxa5,b4a5,rnbqkb1r/5ppp/2pp1n2/Pp2p3/4P3/2N2N2/P1PPBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,"I take, because my b4 pawn can't be defended easily."
14,Rxa5,a8a5,1nbqkb1r/5ppp/2pp1n2/rp2p3/4P3/2N2N2/P1PPBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w k - 0 8,Black's roook now controls most of the a file.
15,d4,d2d4,1nbqkb1r/5ppp/2pp1n2/rp2p3/3PP3/2N2N2/P1P1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b k - 0 8,This might have been a good move if I'd played it earlier instead of b4!
16,b4,b5b4,1nbqkb1r/5ppp/2pp1n2/r3p3/1p1PP3/2N2N2/P1P1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w k - 0 9,Now I'm feeling really uncomfortable - my knight has no good squares other than back where it came from!
17,Nb1,c3b1,1nbqkb1r/5ppp/2pp1n2/r3p3/1p1PP3/5N2/P1P1BPPP/RNBQ1RK1 b k - 1 9,So back it goes...
18,Nxe4,f6e4,1nbqkb1r/5ppp/2pp4/r3p3/1p1Pn3/5N2/P1P1BPPP/RNBQ1RK1 w k - 0 10,Black wins a pawn.
19,dxe5,d4e5,1nbqkb1r/5ppp/2pp4/r3P3/1p2n3/5N2/P1P1BPPP/RNBQ1RK1 b k - 0 10,I also win a pawn - material is even.
20,dxe5,d6e5,1nbqkb1r/5ppp/2p5/r3p3/1p2n3/5N2/P1P1BPPP/RNBQ1RK1 w k - 0 11,Black takes back. A mistake I think...
