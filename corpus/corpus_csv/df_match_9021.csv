1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Hi everyone!  As I said at the end of my last annotation.  Now for the good news!  This game starts off as a Scotch Opening.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"3. d4 - this move characterises the Scotch Opening - it challenges the centre and interesting play results.  Just for the benefit of newcomers to the annotations gallery, my first ever game with Coach Ion which I annotated as Battle of the Wings started off as a Scotch.  White deviates to a Goring Gambit on his next move."

Nxb5 - I decided to let the b pawn go in order to tuck Henry away on the kingside and to bring another defender to the weak pawn on f7 which is pinned against Henry.  Somehow I must drive the Wicked Witch of the West off the a2-g8 diagonal.

This was the first time that I had managed to maintain a clear pawn lead against an Expert.  There seemed to be no weaknesses, but this just seemed too good to be true.  I let the emotional baggage from my past performances against the Expert colour my judgement here.  I offered Jim a draw.  I half expected a refusal.  If the refusal was to come with an exchange of queens I would recapture with Frere Lenoir, otherwise Frere Leblanc would come to e6 and drive back the Witch followed by the move Ne7 to protect my e pawn and to prepare f6 to bolster it.  But he accepted the draw offer and I received 7.1 points for this high draw.  At the end of the game Ion assessed the position as Black has a clear advantage.  I suppose in one way I am in a win win situation here.  If the advantage is with white then it was a good draw offer.  If it was a bad draw offer then it is nice to end the game with the better of things against a player 300 points north of my rating.  In any case it ensured that although I came bottom of the league I did not leave Beafyness' tourney with nul point.  It was Un Demi Point.  

My opponent had the following to add - hope you can follow:-

1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 exd4 4.c3 [4.Nxd4 Bc5 5.Nxc6 Qf6= ] 

4...dxc3 5.Bc4 [5.Nxc3 Nf6= ] 

5...d6 I have always thought this best 

6.0-0 Nf6 7.Qb3 Qd7 8.Ng5 Ne5 9.Bb5 [>=9.Nxc3!? is interesting 9...h6 10.Nf3=/  ] 

9...c6-/  10.f4 cxb5 11.fxe5 dxe5 12.Nxc3 Dunno whether Be3 is better? 
12….Bc5  13.Kh1 0-0 14.Nxb5 [14.Nd5!? Nxd5 15.exd5-  ] 

14...Qc6 15.Nc3 h6 16.Nf3 Re8 17.Bd2 Qb6 [17...b6 18.Nh4-  ] 1/2-1/2 
Look at the following game…I would have played 14 Rxf6 if I had have seen this analysis first…….
