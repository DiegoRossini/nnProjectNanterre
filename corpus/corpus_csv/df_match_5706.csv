1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Meyer indicates he wants an open game, quickly tactical."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Newcomb obliges.
3,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,An old-fashiooned variant. 2 N-KB3 supplanted this move in popularity around 1830.
4,Bc5,f8c5,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 3,"Countering symmetrically. 2... N-KB3 is the most solid response, but this move is acceptable."
5,Qh5,d1h5,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p2Q/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 3 3,"If properly defensed, this move should not be a threat. But Newcomb fails to properly defense it."
6,g6,g7g6,rnbqk1nr/pppp1p1p/6p1/2b1p2Q/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 0 4,"An error. The correct move was 3... N-KR3, to be followed up with 4... O-O neutralizing any chance of a quick mate and leaving White's Q dangerously exposed."
7,Qxe5+,h5e5,rnbqk1nr/pppp1p1p/6p1/2b1Q3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 0 4,Meyer pounces on the mistake. Black's position is already crumbling.
8,Ne7,g8e7,rnbqk2r/ppppnp1p/6p1/2b1Q3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 1 5,The alternatives aren't much better. There's no way to avoid losing the KR.
9,Qxh8+,e5h8,rnbqk2Q/ppppnp1p/6p1/2b5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQq - 0 5,The King-hunt is on in earnest.
10,Ng8,e7g8,rnbqk1nQ/pppp1p1p/6p1/2b5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQq - 1 6,Forced. Mate is now forthcoming.
11,Qxg8+,h8g8,rnbqk1Q1/pppp1p1p/6p1/2b5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQq - 0 6,Closing the ring.
12,Bf8,c5f8,rnbqkbQ1/pppp1p1p/6p1/8/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQq - 1 7,"6... K-K2 would have prolonged the game, but Newcomb's position was hopeless anyway."
13,Qxf7#,g8f7,rnbqkb2/pppp1Q1p/6p1/8/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQq - 0 7,Mercifully putting Black out of his misery.
