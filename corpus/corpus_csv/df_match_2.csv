1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"So after a win in round 2 (see my last annotated game,) I eventually managed to win on time in round 3, so with 2.5 out of 3 I was paired against this guy, the tournament's strongest player, who went on to win the tournament outright with 4.5 out of 5, conceding a draw to the second highest ranking player in the last round. I was the third highest ranked player in the tournament, and so to lose the last two rounds and only finish on 50% was a bit of a disappointment, although the games are not sent for grading or anything."

Black holds back the c-pawn for the time being, and aims to put the knight on d4. The immediate plan is to prepare queenside counterplay with ...a6, ...Rb8 followed by ...b5."
