11,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/3ppp1p/P4np1/2pP4/8/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 6,"This is the main tabya of the gambit. Personally, I'm not a fan of gambits, but someone would make a list of the most respectable and sound gambits, the Benko would be pretty up on the list. Before I carry on with the rest of the game, let me summarize what has Black gained for his invested material. A lead in development and more than that, a better pawn structure, in fact Black's only weakness is e7, which is pretty hard for White to attack. The main benefits of a better pawn structure pretty evident here. White has no useful pawn breaks, pushing e4-e5 doesn't do much, while pushing the Q-side pawns only creates weaknesses. Black's pawn break/advance is c4, clearing c5 for a Knight which can come to d3 or even b3 in some cases. The open files on the Q-side give Black a lot of pressure and make it difficult for White to develop his pieces, his Bc1 is particularly hard to find a role in the game. There is another side benefit for Benko when it comes to blitz games. The play is very smooth, so you save time on moves, you don't have to memorize a lot of lines, in fact, I know almost no theory and in spite of that, have very good results with it."

It's rather easy to write that and absolve yourself from explaining more about a certain move. The other plan for White here is to fianchetto the Bf1 and keep the pawn on e2 for a while. Granted, the Bishop isn't very active on g2 but unlike other gambits where the goal is to exchange pieces in order to make the extra pawn count, it's very hard next to impossible to do that in this gambit, simply because of Black's pressure on the Q-side. So why is this move a waste of time? The pawn belongs on either e2 or e4. On e3 it just hems the Bc1 and doesn't do much to defend the d5 pawn."
