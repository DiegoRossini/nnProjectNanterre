7,f4,f2f4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,The deadly Austrian Attack!  White goes for complete control in the center and looks to squash Black before Black can come up with adequate counter-play.

10,Qb6,d8b6,rnb1kb1r/pp2pp1p/1qpp1np1/8/3PPP2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,Qb6!?  A curious move without a great deal of theory available-I like that against the Austrian Attack.  So I elect to take us into the less explored territory Qb6.
11,Be2,f1e2,rnb1kb1r/pp2pp1p/1qpp1np1/8/3PPP2/2N2N2/PPP1B1PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 6,getting ready to castle

22,c5,c6c5,rnb1k2r/pp3pbp/1q1p2p1/2p5/3N1P2/2P1B3/P1P1B1PP/R2Q1R1K w kq - 0 12,Save to do because black does not have to worry about whates queen going to A4 this game. White has taken on a structural weakness in the form of the doubled up pawns on the C-file.  The pawn on c3 is especially weak

But I was ok with that, we would be even in material, but I like my pawn structure and postion better. I had faced the dreaded Austrian Attack formation and chip away at it till it was no more. That all you can ask from a opening really, the rest is up to the player.  The Pirc gave me pariaty going into the middlegame, which means the Pirc defense did its job.  I like Qb6 I think Pirc players who run into the Austrian Attack should give it a look."
