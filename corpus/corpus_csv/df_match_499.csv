When I went through the CHESS OPENINGS link on GK's front page I found absolutely no annotated Spanish Game: Marshall Attacks to reference as I prepared to start games in two separate thematic tournaments on the site.  So....I will remedy that to a degree.  Not saying these are necessarily outstanding examples of the Marshall, but they are indicative of the tactical nature of the line."

Of course after I wrote all this and plugged the position into Stockfish 7 the silicon beast says 12...c6 and 12...Bd6 are Black's two best choices at a depth of 21.
