1,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/2N5/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 1,Mr Kitrich had tired of the English and played this hypermodern variation instead.
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/2N5/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Mr. Kitrich supposes that he can call this opening the 'Queen's Indian Defense'.

4,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/8/1PN5/P1PPPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,We are set for the classic hypermodern challenge; will white be able to undermine black's control of the center with peripheral pieces?
5,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/8/1PN1P3/P1PP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"Is Mr. Kitrich prepared to relinquish his light-squared bishop, given the likely weakness of d3?"

8,Nge7,g8e7,r1bqkb1r/ppp1nppp/2n5/1B1pp3/8/1PN1P3/P1PP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 3 5,"Kitrich plays a thematic break, inviting black to either unzip the E-file, which both players can then share, or to close the board with e4.  My question: is e4 good for black...?"
9,d4,d2d4,r1bqkb1r/ppp1nppp/2n5/1B1pp3/3P4/1PN1P3/P1P2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,"Kitrich plays a thematic break, inviting black to either unzip the E-file, which both players can then share, or to close the board with e4.  My question: is e4 good for black...?"
10,e4,e5e4,r1bqkb1r/ppp1nppp/2n5/1B1p4/3Pp3/1PN1P3/P1P2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,E4 it is.  We are getting a sense of the game now.  With the center closed white's dark-squared bishop looks to be boxed in after Bc2 -- the only viable move for the piece.  F3 will be a thematic break that will have to be played at the correct time.  White now also has the possibility of Nge2 followed by Nf4.
11,Nge2,g1e2,r1bqkb1r/ppp1nppp/2n5/1B1p4/3Pp3/1PN1P3/P1P1NPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"This move seems reasonable given the fact that we are faced with a closed board.  In fact, the move is forced, as the bishop has no retreat."
12,a6,a7a6,r1bqkb1r/1pp1nppp/p1n5/1B1p4/3Pp3/1PN1P3/P1P1NPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"This move seems reasonable given the fact that we are faced with a closed board.  In fact, the move is forced, as the bishop has no retreat."

15,Bb2,c1b2,r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1n5/3p4/3Pp3/1PN1P3/PBP1NPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 8,An unaesthetic move.
