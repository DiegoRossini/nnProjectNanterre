1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"A few notes on this game. A team match against Rosedale17, I also won the other as White. This was also my first time ever playing against an English opening. After I saw this move I had to do a little research and prepare myself for what was to come. Near the middle game I started grasping at straws as I did not know what I should/could move. White made a fatal mistake which allowed me to grab a free bishop and knight. After that point the game consists in Black pushing a passed pawn and keeping the pressure on the semi-exposed White King."
