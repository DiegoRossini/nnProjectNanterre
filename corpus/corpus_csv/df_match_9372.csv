1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I have joined Gameknot two days ago. I like how it looks and that I can play rated games. This game is very interesting to me because I missed a very easy tactic move with my knight several times in a row - in internet slow game with three days per move.
