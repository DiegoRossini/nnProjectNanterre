1,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

I did manage a win with the white pieces yesterday against Graham who has recently been knocking on the door of 1400 - I back him to get there sometime soon.  In this game I somehow managed to firstly over-turn the deficit by getting rid of the Wicked Witch of the West sometime in the middle-game and then winning a pawn immediately afterwards.  Graham then left a knight en prise and sadly it was downhill all the way for him as I managed to rid him of all his pieces bar his rook.  His refusal to give up the rook led to him eventually copping Old Matey.  How did this happen, well, we pick up the action on move 9."
