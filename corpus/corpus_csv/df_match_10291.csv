1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was my first ever over-the-board tournament game.  At this point, I had been playing on Gameknot for about 2 years and felt ready to try my hand at ""real world"" chess.  The tournament was the 4th George Washington Open held in Springfield, Virginia.  As is typical in open play, my first round Friday night game was against a relatively highly rated player.  

Playing black, I set up my board and clock and anxiously awaited the start.  When the start was announced, my opponent wasn't there!  I started my clock and waited.  He must have been stuck in traffic, as he showed up and quickly played d4.

Even though I'm in my mid-thirties, I was incredibly nervous about this first tournament experience."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"I was happy with d4, because, at this point in my study, I was a still a little ""scared"" of e4 openings.  Nf6 was comfortable for me."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 2,"Bolstering his d4 pawn and establishing control over two of the center squares.  e5 for black is now, pretty much, out of the question."
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,I'm anxious to quickly castle.
5,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,Taking advantage of the open board to advance his c pawn and establish control over a third center square.
6,d6,d7d6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,d5 probably would have been better.
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,Doubling up the protection on d5.  Matching power on e4.  Advantage on d5.
8,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,"I'm still fond of the fianchetto, but I've come to realize that there are times to do it and times to attack the center squares more directly.  In this case, it's probably a decent move, and I've already pretty much committed to this line from 2. .. g6."
9,e4,e2e4,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,White now dominates the center squares and has three pawns on the 4th rank.  This is a very strong opening for white.
10,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP1b1/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,"As I recall, my philosophy at the time was that trades against a higher-ranked player get me closer to a draw.  Certainly nothing necessarily wrong with this move."
11,Be2,f1e2,rn1qk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP1b1/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 6,A smart response.  This develops the board and provides extra defense.
12,O-O,e8g8,rn1q1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP1b1/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 3 7,This for me was and is a familiar position.  I need to work on recognizing whether the particular game situation warrants this position rather than relying simply on rote memory.
13,h3,h2h3,rn1q1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP1b1/2N2N1P/PP2BPP1/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 7,"This says, ""Do something or leave!""  It seems that the earlier you do this, generally speaking, the better.  It weakens the potential short castle, but it forces a decision to capture or a retreat."
14,Bxf3,g4f3,rn1q1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2b1P/PP2BPP1/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 8,"I elect to accelerate the game, avoid potential complex situations in the midgame and exchange the bishop for a knight.  I'm happy at this point, as I've weakened any potential castle."
15,Bxf3,e2f3,rn1q1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2B1P/PP3PP1/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 8,"As it happens, this allows white to bolster his position at e4."
16,Nbd7,b8d7,r2q1rk1/pppnppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2B1P/PP3PP1/R1BQK2R w KQ - 1 9,All of black's mid-level pieces are out.
17,Be3,c1e3,r2q1rk1/pppnppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N1BB1P/PP3PP1/R2QK2R b KQ - 2 9,All of white's mid-level pieces are out.
18,b6,b7b6,r2q1rk1/p1pnppbp/1p1p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N1BB1P/PP3PP1/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 10,"I think I'm trying to set up c5, but, for some reason, I don't follow up."
19,Qd2,d1d2,r2q1rk1/p1pnppbp/1p1p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N1BB1P/PP1Q1PP1/R3K2R b KQ - 1 10,"Establishes a powerful bishop-queen line on the castle.  Also, gives white the option for a long castle, which, eventually, he exercises."
20,e5,e7e5,r2q1rk1/p1pn1pbp/1p1p1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2N1BB1P/PP1Q1PP1/R3K2R w KQ - 0 11,"If white captures dxe5, then I would respond with dxe5 or Nxe5.  But, white also has the option to advance and lodge a pawn firmly on my side of the board.  c5 might have been better."
