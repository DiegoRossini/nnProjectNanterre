7,c3,c2c3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2pp4/3P1B2/2P1P3/PP3PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"!?? I was trying to make a reasonable move that was not in the DB, but next time I think I'll just steer the game into more familiar lines. This should be playable, but pressure on d5 and b7 make it dangerous for Black.
…Bg4, …e6, …Nc6 and …Qb6 are all natural and good."
