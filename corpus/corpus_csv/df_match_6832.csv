1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Here is a razor sharp game against Expert Nyctalop.  Nyctalop has kindly commented on my previous annotations so I thought I would try my luck against him.  I tried to attack but it was rebuffed big time.  The story starts with a Scilian Defense. 1. e4  c5."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,4. Nxd4 - fairly standard play so far.

8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"5. Nc3 - it is considered bad play to play Nxc6 as bxc6 allows black to build up a pawn centre.  Mind you I did do this exchange in an OTB friendly against a player with an 1824 rating way back in 1999 and went on to win in spectacular fashion.  Sadly I did not notate that game but it is in my memory - my rating was 1240!  Still, I decided not to chance it here and play Nc3 - a developing move which defends the pawn on e4."
