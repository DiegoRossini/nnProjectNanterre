1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is a WtW mini tournament game against a player quite a bit stronger than me. A dubious choice in the opening left him behind material, and he never managed to get it back. Anyway, this is my highest non-blitz victory. The forced moves end on move six for black."

The only advantage is that it doesn't get his king out in the opening. But then again, easy19 played this move and beat my in seventeen."
