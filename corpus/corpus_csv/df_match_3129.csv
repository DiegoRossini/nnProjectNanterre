My pawns being intact, I reason that exchanging a minor piece for two pawns may be worth the investment.  On the other hand, given that both sides are somewhat depleted, N (or B) for P+P may not be a very good idea."

While I think 33. ...Nc3 could be followed by RxP threatening RxB, black would actually land a checkmate with 33.	Re4	Nc3, 34.	Rxg4	Ne2+, 35.	Kh1	Rf5, 36.	Rxg7	Rf1# (though white could avoid # with Kf1 or Kf2 which are not uninteresting).  Regardless, I have now placed pieces based on bad evaluation, in effect wasting some amount of time over the past few moves.  GK computer agrees this was not a good move, preferring 33. Rd3."
