1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Once again, Spassky resorts to his QP opening, an indication that he prefers a solid buildup rather than the sharp play required in the Sicilian, Fischer's pet defence against 1. e4"
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,Black prevent's 2.e4 and leaves open many options.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Gaining more center control.
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Preparing to pin White's Knight after 3.Nc3.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,Once again threatening e4.
6,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"This is the NImzo-Indian defence, one of the most popular answers to 1.d4. By pinning the Knight Black gains several advantages. He neutralizes the Knight's pressure on the center. In some instances Black will exchange BxN, which weakens White's queenside pawns. Black also gains a temporarily lead in developmant with two pieces out. Finally, Black can now castle in one move, while White has yet to develop any of his Kingside forces. It is easy to see why the Nimzo is favored by many of the world's best players."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 4,White develops to control the center and prepares to castle kingside.
8,c5,c7c5,rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/1bPP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,Black brings up his pawn to chalenge d4.
9,e3,e2e3,rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/1bPP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,Preparing to bring out King's Bishop as well as protecting the pawn in d4. Now if Black plays 5...cxd4 6.exd4 retains a pawn on d4.
10,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk2r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/2p5/1bPP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,Another solid development move and a favorite of the German Grandmaster Robert Huebner.
11,Bd3,f1d3,r1bqk2r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/2p5/1bPP4/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 6,White pursues straightforward development.
12,Bxc3+,b4c3,r1bqk2r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/2p5/2PP4/2bBPN2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"Swapping the bishop is usually reserved until white plays a3. The text forces a permanent weakness on white's queenside pawns. Also White no longer has the option developing his Knight on e2 as in the normal Samisch line. Black saddles White with doubled pawns. However, amid the large scale of activities of the middlegame Black will have difficulty concentrating on this weakness as the diversion of force this would entail might leave his K-side in the lurch. Hence, Black plays to prevent or nutralize any aggressive overtures from White, knowing that an eventual endgame will allow him to exploit the doubled pawns without the fear of a K-side attack. This is also good psychology as it lets White know he must come up with resourceful middle game play or eventually face an inferior endgame."
13,bxc3,b2c3,r1bqk2r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/2p5/2PP4/2PBPN2/P4PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,"As the result of Black's sixth move, White enjoys the advantage of the two Bishops.However, two Bishops need an open position to function at maximum efficiency. White plays to open up the center. The trouble is that Black skillfully keeps the center well barricaded with pawns, restricting the scope of the Bishops."
14,d6,d7d6,r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2nppn2/2p5/2PP4/2PBPN2/P4PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"This is consistent with Black's strategy; instead of the text, 7...d5 would be a grave strategical error as it would allow White to undouble his pawn and open up the center for his Bishops."
15,e4,e3e4,r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2nppn2/2p5/2PPP3/2PB1N2/P4PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,Freeing the QB.
16,e5,e6e5,r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2np1n2/2p1p3/2PPP3/2PB1N2/P4PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,Liberating the QB and contesting the center.
17,d5,d4d5,r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2np1n2/2pPp3/2P1P3/2PB1N2/P4PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 9,"While this has the advantage of cramping Black, the locked pawn formation in the center constitutes a formidable barrier against the activity of White's Bishops. But if 9. dxc5 dxc5 10.Qc2 Be6 11.Nd2 Na5! does not give White time for Nf1-e3-d5."
18,Ne7,c6e7,r1bqk2r/pp2nppp/3p1n2/2pPp3/2P1P3/2PB1N2/P4PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 10,"The best square for the Knight. Instead, 9...Na5 would leave it out of play as White could easily defend his weak pawn on c3 while building up an attck on the other wing."
19,Nh4,f3h4,r1bqk2r/pp2nppp/3p1n2/2pPp3/2P1P2N/2PB4/P4PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 10,"Not the best solution. The right way is to sit on the position by 10.Nd2 followed by f3, Nf1-e3, etc.Black has no counterplay unless White tries violent measures. In view of the obstructing barrier of pawns in the center, the White Bishops have reduced mobility. To rectify this Spassky aims for f4 to try to open up lines as quickly as possible."
20,h6,h7h6,r1bqk2r/pp2npp1/3p1n1p/2pPp3/2P1P2N/2PB4/P4PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 11,Preventing the pin Bg5 and and deterring White from castling for fear of g5.
