In black playing ...d5 here, I can take advantage of 5.a3 and then force a trade or retreat of the black bishop.  If the former, I can un-double my c-pawns at some stage with cd5 and then transpose into a favourable Samisch variation."

The black Knight does take up a fine outpost, but at this stage I was happy to ignore it and just develop with Qc2.  The idea being that I wanted to concentrate my efforts on e4, with a view to at some stage playing f3, and then e4.  Qc2 also has the advantage that it prevents black taking on c4 as the Knight is en prise."

I do have to be a little careful here as if I play 8.f3 straight away then I get the rather nasty 9...Qh4  in response.  If I try and play 10.g3, then black simply responds with 10...Nxg3 and I'm in all sorts of trouble."

Capturing with the Knight means that I don't even now have to play f3 - I can play e4 straight away and then force the black Knight to move yet again.  A feature of this game is the number of times black pieces are repeatedly moved to the neglect of black's overall development.

White stands well due to the pinned g4 Knight and has much the better placed pieces.  Here, 14...e5 effectively conceded the centre and forces black to move his f6 Knight yet again!"

However, having played 18.e6, I now saw a way of surprising the black King (see move 20).  By playing 19.Nf2, I wanted to attack black's Queen and at the same time set a trap should black play 19...Nxf2.  If black plays 19...Qh5 (the only square), then white has a very dangerous discovered attack when he moves his bishop from g5.  One possible line is 19...Qh5, 20. exf7 , and if the black King moves to d8 or f8, the white can win the black Queen with the discovered attack referred to above.  The alternative move 20...Kd7, allows white to play 21.Qxd3 with check and a crushing attack.  Perhaps seeing this, black chose 19.Nxf2 instead."
