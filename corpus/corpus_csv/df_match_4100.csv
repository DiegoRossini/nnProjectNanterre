1,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Here playing white with the Bird Opening. It's an opening rarely used, but still very fine who can surprise the oponent. Moving the f pawn right in the beginning look to break the defense but give later another piece ready to pierce the defense of the oponent. It looklike a wild opening but with a correct defense, it's just create a very balanced game as the bishop opening."
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Threating right in the beginning Qh4.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/5P2/5N2/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Protecting h4 and developing the king side for a quick castling.

5,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/5P2/4PN2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"Protecting the f pawn and giving space for my bishop. g3 is possible like the leningrad variation of the dutch opening, but it would have been too much reckless I think."

11,a3,a2a3,rnbq1rk1/ppppbppp/4p3/3n4/5P2/PP2PN2/1BPP2PP/RN1QKB1R b KQ - 0 6,"I was thinking about to do Bd3, so I prevent Nb4. It look as a lost of tempo, but my position gonna be better after. There is no hurry, my position is safe right now."

16,Bh4+,f6h4,rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/5P1b/PPP1PN2/1BP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 1 9,? Black waste his time. He is too much low developped to make this kind of attack.
17,g3,g2g3,rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/5P1b/PPP1PNP1/1BP4P/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 9,I'm thinking about to castle at the queen side and to attack on the king side.
18,Bf6,h4f6,rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/4pb2/8/5P2/PPP1PNP1/1BP4P/R2QKB1R w KQ - 1 10,Now I have a very strong position. Two of my bishop are in the direction of the king while Black have not an accurate defense and is very low developped.
