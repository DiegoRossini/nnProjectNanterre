1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

This is just so agonizing.  I came very close here to ending my losing streak with Coach Ion.  Incredibly the only real mistake I made in the game was to resign it!  I did keep in my game notes the analysis I made before the decision to resign so I will show them to you so you will at least see just what prompted my decision.  I kick off with 1. e4 and Ion gives me the Robatsch Defense."
