9,Ne5,f3e5,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2nbpn2/4N3/3P1B2/7P/PPP1PPP1/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 4 5,My plan is the same as always. f6 is not possible right now.
10,Bb4+,d6b4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n1pn2/4N3/1b1P1B2/7P/PPP1PPP1/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 5 6,"A waste of time, since I would moved c3 anyway. But he cannot know. The purpose of this move can be to relocate the bishop on b6, a much better square, and to push the knight while advancing the center pawn. So it is not really bad."
