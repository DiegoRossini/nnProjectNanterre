2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I usually replied c5 a Sicilian opening. But many times I tried as well the Caro Kann Defense in a regular tournament. Its a tough opening for black, favoured by many defensive players."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,The normal continuation for white.
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,The usual reply for black attacking e4 pawn and as well to free the Q-bishop
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,White can try as well the advance variation 3. e5 or 3. exd5 cxd5 4.c4 the Caro-Kann/Panov Attack with a good development for white 2 bishops despite of having an isolated pawn
6,dxe4,d5e4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/3Pp3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,normal move for black which transposed to the Classical system after 4. Nxe4 Bf5
7,Nxe4,c3e4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/3PN3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,I can try as well the Nd7 (Flohr Variation) but I much prefer the Tartakower/Nimzovich System

11,c3,c2c3,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p2p2/8/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,"The position is almost equal. My first thought white's move is 6. Nf3 or Bc4. The c3 move purposes are to defend his d4 pawn, then move his bishop in d3 and queen in c2 towards the  black h7 pawn, and  as well to discourage black bishop in b4 square."
12,Bd6,f8d6,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/2pb1p2/8/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 7,I immediately put my king's bishop before white's occupying the f4 square by his bishop.
