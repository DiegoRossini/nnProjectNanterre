1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is my first annotation here on GK.  This particular game was a lot of fun...  a Kieseritsky gambit, a poisoned pawn, and a pretty checkmate (well, pretty for us  hanging around 1450!)  Enjoy...

As white, I'm a fan of e4."

3,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,The King's Gambit leads to many sharp lines.
4,exf4,e5f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Accepting the gambit is generally considered to be the best reply.

10,g3,g4g3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/4N3/4Pp1P/6p1/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"!?  Interesting.  Black doesn't accept the loss of the pawn, and sends the brave soldier to the sixth rank to put pressure on f2.  I'm going to have to be careful not to allow him to exploit it."
11,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/4N3/3PPp1P/6p1/PPP3P1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"Taking control of the center, and threatening to win the pawn at f4."
12,Qe7,d8e7,rnb1kbnr/ppppqp1p/8/4N3/3PPp1P/6p1/PPP3P1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,"?!  Huh?  I would have expected Black to play ..d6 to drive off the knight, or ..d5 to fight for the center.  Instead he brings out his queen to threaten my knight, which has a defender..."

Black has my b2 pawn caught undefended, and has an eye out for more-- indeed, after Qxb2, my rook is trapped and helpless.  But I had a sense at this point that if Black DID gobble my pawn, I would actually be in a stronger position!"

White has 3 pieces out, including a centralized knight, while Black has only the lonely queen out pawn-hunting.  Still, good defense might have salvaged the game, at least for a little while..."
