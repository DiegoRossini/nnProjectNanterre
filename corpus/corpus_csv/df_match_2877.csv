This was an error and I lose the previous positional advantage I have. Computer analysis puts this at -0.12. The pawn on c4 is undefended Bxc4 puts me a pawn down. Qa4 would have been better. However, Black has opted to continue his Kingside attack."

Worried about Nxb2 which would also threaten my Queen on d1 I rush to defend b2 with my rook. Computer analysis puts this at -0.64. However, Bd6 was also a mistake, this time on Black's part (+1.66). ( 13. Qxd4 b6 14. Bxd6 Qxd6 15. Qxg7 would have provided me a + 2 pawns advantage)."

Rbc1 is better. Qxg7 would have been too greedy as Bxf4, gxf4 weakens my Kingside defense. (14 Rbc1 Qc8 15. Bxd6 Nxd6 16. Qxg7 Nh6 would have won me the pawn after dealing with the Bishop threatening f4.). Black takes my Bishop."

Computer scores this as -6.27. I should have gone with Nf5 to defend my King.
