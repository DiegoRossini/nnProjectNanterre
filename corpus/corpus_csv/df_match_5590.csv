This also improves black's position because a bad bishop is traded for a more powerful one. For white, taking on h7 opens a file and allows the rook to escape the impending fork. Bc4 is not a good option because the bishop on a6 would prevent the castle. Black would also gain a pawn and tempo after Nxd4."
