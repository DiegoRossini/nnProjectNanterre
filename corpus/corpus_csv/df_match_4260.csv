Last year I opted for 3...Nc6 and after 4.Nf3 we had a quiet two knights. In that game he had no advantage after the opening, however he managed to outplay me in the middlegame and got an endgame with two extra pawns which he easily converted (I'm planning to annotate that game as well)."

He managed to win that game after a long fight. However I continue with the main line and I was still well within my preparation.

Usually 9...Bf5 is played. Black then doesn't have to be afraid of losing the bishop pair (which was the main reason for my 9...Be7 because after 10.Nxd6 Qxd6 he has strong centre control and easy development in return. I considered 9...Bc7 as well, but I didn't like the look of 10.Nc5 so I decided to keep his knight out of c5 for now."

It seems as if I'm forced to give up the bishop pair anyway with 11...Bxe4 12.dxe4, because if I move my bishop the e5 pawn is hanging. After 11...Qd7 12.Ng3 seems very strong (the bishop has to move anyway and then the pawn can be taken), and 11...g6 creates huge weaknesses in the king's position."

I was pondering this move and 17...Ne6, but I didn't like the fact that after 17...Ne6 he could exchange with 18.Bxe6 fxe6, creating doubled isolated pawns on an open file. The computer prefers 17...Ne6 slightly, but doesn't suggest the exchange after that (apparently the bishop is too strong to be exchanged for that knight).
