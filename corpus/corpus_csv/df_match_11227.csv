1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,The King's Indian Attack... not the 1. e4 or the 1. d4 I'm familiar with.
2,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 2,Offering white 2. e4 if he wants it.
3,c4,c2c4,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,Staking a claim to the center.
4,e5,e7e5,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,Staking a claim to the center.
5,b3,b2b3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2P5/1P3N2/P2PPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,Not developing the kingside... this move seems very commital to fianchettoing the bishop to me.
6,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2P5/1P3N2/P2PPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,"So, I reason, might as well develop my kingside and attack towards his."
7,e3,e2e3,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2P5/1P2PN2/P2P1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,I expected Bb2.
8,e4,e5e4,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b5/2P1p3/1P2PN2/P2P1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,Threatening to win a pawn with 5. Nd4 Nxd4 6. exd4 Bxd4.
9,d4,d2d4,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b5/2PPp3/1P2PN2/P4PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq d3 0 5,The only way to keep material equality without retreating the knight to g1.
10,Bb4+,c5b4,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/1bPPp3/1P2PN2/P4PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,"The knight is forced to a bad square.  Black is ahead in development, but white controls more space on the queenside."
11,Nfd2,f3d2,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/1bPPp3/1P2P3/P2N1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 6,"The knight is forced to a bad square.  Black is ahead in development, but white controls more space on the queenside."

13,a3,a2a3,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/1bPPp3/PP2P3/3N1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"!  This good move forces black to retreat his dark squared bishop, and breaks the pin on the knight.  Now, black must take care not to lose his distant e4 pawn."
14,Be7,b4e7,r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/2n2n2/8/2PPp3/PP2P3/3N1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,"?!  Seems like the natural way to defend the e4 pawn, but black will lose a pawn anyway."
15,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/2n2n2/8/2PPp3/PPN1P3/3N1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 8,"?!  Seems like the natural way to defend the e4 pawn, but black will lose a pawn anyway."
16,d5,d7d5,r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/2n2n2/3p4/2PPp3/PPN1P3/3N1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 9,"?!  Seems like the natural way to defend the e4 pawn, but black will lose a pawn anyway."

18,Nxd5,f6d5,r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/2n5/3n4/3Pp3/PPN1P3/3N1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 10,"So, down a pawn, black must take advantage of his edge in development and the fact that his pieces are more mobile."

21,Nc5,e4c5,r1bqk2r/ppp1b1pp/2n5/2Nn1p2/3P4/PP2P3/3N1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 11,"Ng3 may also be worth considering here, for defensive purposes, and also since after b6, the knight will be booted out of c5."

24,Kh8,g8h8,r1bq1r1k/ppp1b1pp/2n5/2Nn1p2/2BP4/PP2P3/3N1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 4 13,"I have to break it, otherwise the threat of g4 followed by e4 wins the knight."
