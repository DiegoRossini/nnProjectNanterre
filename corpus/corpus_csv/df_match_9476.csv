1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This was a standard game between two low-ranked players. Play opened with a classic King's pawn game.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Probably a bad move. I wanted to play Bb2, but there was no real reason to do so. Better moves would have been Bb5 (Ruy Lopez), Bc4 (King's pawn game main line) or Nc3 (Three knights game)."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Probably a bad move. I wanted to play Bb2, but there was no real reason to do so. Better moves would have been Bb5 (Ruy Lopez), Bc4 (King's pawn game main line) or Nc3 (Three knights game)."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"Probably a bad move. I wanted to play Bb2, but there was no real reason to do so. Better moves would have been Bb5 (Ruy Lopez), Bc4 (King's pawn game main line) or Nc3 (Three knights game)."

6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/1P3N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,Black achieves the classic pawn centre: pawns on d5 and e5. Normally it's white who can get this - a measure of my ineptitude!

My best guess is that he had seen his main attack blunted and did not want to play on without a queen. Thank you for reading this. Comments are welcome."
