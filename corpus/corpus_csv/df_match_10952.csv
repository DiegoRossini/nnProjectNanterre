4,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"An unusual time to accept the gambit, although the Slav Accepted does so on the fourth turn."

7,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/2pP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,Threatening to win the pawn back; it seems to be the most common move here.
8,Qa5+,d8a5,rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/q7/2pP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,Probably an overly aggressive queen move; there is no real threat.

17,Rc1,a1c1,rn2kb1r/pp2pppp/2p4n/7q/2BP2b1/2N1PN2/PP1B1PPP/2RQ1RK1 b kq - 4 9,"I don't want to retreat my bishop to e2, and after 9...Bxf3 10. Qxf3 Qxf3 11. gxf3, it looks fine, since I still have a large lead in development and my rook can use the g file.  Therefore I develop my other rook."

I don't want the knight to be pinned, so I drive away the bishop first. Better would have been Nb5, with similar threats as later in the game; if 11...cxb5?, 12. Bxf7  wins the queen.  However, this turns out to lose a pawn."
