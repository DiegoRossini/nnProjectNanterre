1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"By agreement, we will play the Evans Gambit, which is a favorite of both players with White.   White is a Master Candidate over the board, but is new on gameknot, his true elo is far above the gameknot indication.  He is a formidable opponent.   Black is a coach."

6,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,The Giuoco Piano.  First step to the Evans.
7,b4,b2b4,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/1PB1P3/5N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,"The Evans Gambit.  I recommend it to beginning players because it is an attacking, tactical game.  White will yield a wing pawn for tempo and space."
8,Bxb4,c5b4,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/1bB1P3/5N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,Black accepts the gambit.
9,c3,c2c3,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/1bB1P3/2P2N2/P2P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,White will gain space and tempo with the dislodgement of the black bishop.

12,exd4,e5d4,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/b7/2BpP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"Capablanca said: ""Capture with the kings pawn at every opportunity."",  Black complies."
13,Qb3,d1b3,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/b7/2BpP3/1QP2N2/P4PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 1 7,"This was a surprise to Black, who expected 0-0.  White is obviously a gambler who enjoys the attack.   Mohammad shared that this move has been played by Short and Conquest in a few games.  He shared what he believes is the Main Line with me:  7. 0-0  Nge7, 8. cxd4 d5, 9. exd5 Nxd5, 10. Qb3.  I did not know this line.  
So, now Black is out of the opening and into the middle game!  I suspect White has had experience in this line and will still be in the opening for a while.  While White remains in the opening, Black now enters his middle game:   Blacks' plan now is:
a.  Seize the initiative at the first opportunity.   Gain time whenever possible.
b.  Hold any material advantage so far gained until the initiative is gained.
c.  Get the pieces into play, with attacking moves where possible. 

It appears that White's plan is mainly tactical:  Attack f7, build a center, get the Kings rook into play on the e-file.  In the Evans, White wins lots of brilliancy prizes - unless it goes to an endgame.   White must attack relentlessly, seeking tactical opportunities."
14,Qe7,d8e7,r1b1k1nr/ppppqppp/2n5/b7/2BpP3/1QP2N2/P4PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 2 8,The only reasonable move.  Black holds f7 and attacks e4.
15,O-O,e1g1,r1b1k1nr/ppppqppp/2n5/b7/2BpP3/1QP2N2/P4PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 3 8,The pawn on e4 is safe because of the pin that would occur on the e-file.  The rook will now seize the e-file.
16,Nf6,g8f6,r1b1k2r/ppppqppp/2n2n2/b7/2BpP3/1QP2N2/P4PPP/RNB2RK1 w kq - 4 9,"Black does not take the c3 pawn because White would gain another tempo, bringing his knight into play at no cost.  Black must gain tempo in order to seize the initiative, not lose tempo.  d6, Bb6, and h6 are all playable here; but they are too defensive for this Black player, who wants the initiative - and Nf6 offers better opportunities to grasp the initiative."
17,Re1,f1e1,r1b1k2r/ppppqppp/2n2n2/b7/2BpP3/1QP2N2/P4PPP/RNB1R1K1 b kq - 5 9,The rook reaches his post.
18,Ng4,f6g4,r1b1k2r/ppppqppp/2n5/b7/2BpP1n1/1QP2N2/P4PPP/RNB1R1K1 w kq - 6 10,"The knight is headed for e5, to blockade the e4 pawn, and to threaten the bishop on c4."
19,e5,e4e5,r1b1k2r/ppppqppp/2n5/b3P3/2Bp2n1/1QP2N2/P4PPP/RNB1R1K1 b kq - 0 10,White knows the importance of opening the e-file and cannot have the pawn blockaded.
20,Ngxe5,g4e5,r1b1k2r/ppppqppp/2n5/b3n3/2Bp4/1QP2N2/P4PPP/RNB1R1K1 w kq - 0 11,"If Black is to ever seize the initiative, he cannot make defensive moves that do not accomplish a second objective.  This self-pin of the knight will result in loss of the piece - for a price.  The knight captures a second pawn, 'attacks' the bishop, threatens Nxf6  with discovery on the e1 rook and also protects f7 from this post!  The initiative is in the balance!"
21,Nxe5,f3e5,r1b1k2r/ppppqppp/2n5/b3N3/2Bp4/1QP5/P4PPP/RNB1R1K1 b kq - 0 11,White must exchange the best defender of the kingside in order to win the piece.
22,Nxe5,c6e5,r1b1k2r/ppppqppp/8/b3n3/2Bp4/1QP5/P4PPP/RNB1R1K1 w kq - 0 12,"This knight can eventually be captured by the d-pawn or f-pawn.  Once White gets the e1 rook off e1 the pin on c3 is broken and the discovery on f3 loses its potency.  This capture is the the way to avoid the discovered attack by 12. Nf3.  Having said all of that, I really don't like White's position.  The pinned pawn on c3 is taking away the best square for his knight, the white knight cannot go to d2 to protect f3 because it must guard that pinned pawn.  To unpin the pawn, the rook must leave e1, and only e2 seems a reasonable placement because it must hold the pin on the knight.  The e1 rook is hanging and the discovered attack by ... Nf6  will win the rook if it remains on e1 unprotected.  Once the pinning bishop is relocated to b6 it will attack White's kingside and the thing that troubles me most about White's position is that the kings knight is missing from the defense.  Again, the queens knight cannot get there because it is tied down to the defense of the c3 pawn.  That means that White needs to find the tempi to get the c1 bishop into the game without blocking d2 as the knights' next post.  As White, I would not like the situation where the queenside pieces have not been developed and Black just needs a target for his c1 bishop in order to gain tempo.  As White, I would like to get the c1 bishop into play on this move, but I think that Re2 is probably best, in order to break the pin without leaving the rook hanging.  Still, this is the first time I have seen this position and deeper study may prove my thinking inaccurate."
23,Re4,e1e4,r1b1k2r/ppppqppp/8/b3n3/2BpR3/1QP5/P4PPP/RNB3K1 b kq - 1 12,I think this move makes Blacks' development easier and then opens the black diagonal to whites' king after cxd4.  It may have been better to take the king off of the a7-g8 diagonal.  White missed this and lost a tempo and eventually the initiative.
