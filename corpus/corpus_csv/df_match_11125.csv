15,Qd2,d1d2,r1bqk2r/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 2 8,"!? This is by no means a 'book-move' (as far as I know!). It seems a little suspicious to move queen's knight second time when king is still in centre and queen bishop in his original square. In my view, the best part of this move is that it should take the game out of well-studied theory of the Dragon."

Maybe black is trying to keep white's light-squared bishop out of a2-g8 diagonal, so in case of castling and white playing h4-h5xg6 black can take back with f-pawn, keeping a-file closed. However, I think black should've castled or moved his bishop, since now he drops behind in developement."

This is a bad move, and I'd like to think that the whole game is just showing how much lose of two tempi effects in the Dragon. After this move, the game transposes in a sharp line of Yugoslav attack with 9.Bc4, with white having two extra tempi and black having played h6 instead of 0-0. 

In the line with 9.Bc4, black often want's to exchange it by ...Ne5 and after white had played Bb3 only then force the exchange with ...Nc4."

Now it seems that black gets three pawns for the piece and try to exchange pieces and advance his kingside pawns. I felt that although black had sacrificed, I shouldn't give him the initiative for free, and decided to play actively instead of going passive with 17.Rdg1 or something."
