1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is an aggressive variation of the Fisher/Reti opening for black, that results in an upset win over a stronger player.  I got lucky, but it is interesting to see that this typically closed, slow, ponderous opening can be played very aggressively, provided white gives you an opening.  He opens with the common e4, to which I often respond with what is perceived be a weak reply, d6."

5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p1n2/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 3,"That allows me to counterattack early.  A common response might be f3, but ..."
