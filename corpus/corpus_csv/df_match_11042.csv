2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Scandanavian defense. The intent is to rip open the center and wrest initiative away from white immediately.
3,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,The most common response. 2. e5 is also very playable.
4,Qxd5,d8d5,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"To maintain material equality, black must violate one of the ""sacred"" opening principles by developing his queen very early. This move inevitably invites........."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,! Developing a piece while attacking the exposed enemy queen.
6,Qa5,d5a5,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/q7/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"A seemingly awkward, yet proven solid square for the queen."
7,Bc4,f1c4,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/q7/2B5/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 3 4,White starts a rapid piece development  to take further advantage of black's uncoordinated and underdeveloped pieces.
8,c6,c7c6,rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/q7/2B5/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,A key component in this version of the Scandi. Black must create an escape path for his queen. Black is pinning his hopes on strong flank attacks once white dominates the center of the board.
9,Qf3,d1f3,rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/q7/2B5/2N2Q2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 1 5,"? An over-zealous attempt for a quick mate on f7. Better was Nf3, e3, or even e4."
10,Nf6,g8f6,rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/q7/2B5/2N2Q2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 2 6,Black protects the weak f7 while attempting to get caught up in development.
11,Nge2,g1e2,rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/q7/2B5/2N2Q2/PPPPNPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 3 6,"Since f3 is occupied, white develops this knight to the next best square with the idea of castling quick."
12,Bg4,c8g4,rn2kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/q7/2B3b1/2N2Q2/PPPPNPPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 4 7,! This move proves the fallacy of white 5th. Black develops with aggressive tempo.
13,Qg3,f3g3,rn2kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/q7/2B3b1/2N3Q1/PPPPNPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 5 7,"White must reposition his queen or lose it. Notice that it has now moved twice, while no pawn stab at the middle or developing move for the dark squared bishop has been made yet. White is allowing black the opportunity to catch up in development."
14,e6,e7e6,rn2kb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/q7/2B3b1/2N3Q1/PPPPNPPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 0 8,Logical. Be7 was also playable.
15,a3,a2a3,rn2kb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/q7/2B3b1/P1N3Q1/1PPPNPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 0 8,Logical. Be7 was also playable.
16,Nbd7,b8d7,r3kb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/q7/2B3b1/P1N3Q1/1PPPNPPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 1 9,Logical. Be7 was also playable.
17,O-O,e1g1,r3kb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/q7/2B3b1/P1N3Q1/1PPPNPPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 2 9,"White secures his king. IMHO, this move was a bit premature, as the white king is under no imminent attack and the dark squared bishop needs to get active. Not a bad move, just far too conservative."
18,Be7,f8e7,r3k2r/pp1nbppp/2p1pn2/q7/2B3b1/P1N3Q1/1PPPNPPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 3 10,Black develops his last piece and prepares to castle.
19,h3,h2h3,r3k2r/pp1nbppp/2p1pn2/q7/2B3b1/P1N3QP/1PPPNPP1/R1B2RK1 b kq - 0 10,"While still neglecting development, white is annoyed by black's light squared bishop and forces it to move."
20,Bh5,g4h5,r3k2r/pp1nbppp/2p1pn2/q6b/2B5/P1N3QP/1PPPNPP1/R1B2RK1 w kq - 1 11,"? An outright blunder. Black will drop the pawn on g7 with no compensation. Castling kingside will now be impossible as well. And yes, I did sing the four letter word song when I realized what I had done."
21,Qxg7,g3g7,r3k2r/pp1nbpQp/2p1pn2/q6b/2B5/P1N4P/1PPPNPP1/R1B2RK1 b kq - 0 11,"! White takes the freebie. I wish I could claim that I knew what I was doing here, but I wouldn't want to lie:)"
22,Rg8,h8g8,r3k1r1/pp1nbpQp/2p1pn2/q6b/2B5/P1N4P/1PPPNPP1/R1B2RK1 w q - 1 12,"Black attempts to get SOMETHING out of this deal. Rook to half open file is generally good strategy. This move turns out to be extremely strong as black will now own the g file with some aggressive tempo, as the enemy queen can now be chased. I would have given this move an ""!"" if I had seen how telling it would be, but once again I can't lie to you:)"
