Nh3 - this move gives the white lsb control over the d5 square and the white knight is eyeing up f4 or g5 which will hit out at e6 and it will need black to open up the kingside with g5 (if Nf4) or h6 (if Ng5), rather risky if I want to castle short."

Ion chooses to plonk it on e5 after I back my knight off to d8 to defend the stricken c pawn.  Note that with the knight on e5, Henry is prevented from defending c6 which would have released the black rook for action down the open b file."

41. f5 Ng5 
42. Rxg7  Kd8 
43. Rg6  - white could also force an exchange of rooks with Rxc7 which still wins but more slowly but I think this is the best move here (I will be a second pawn down and about to lose a third - the g and f pawns will become passed and the c pawn continues to be a target - this pawn will fall if I try to counter with my rook.  I do not think that my rook will be able to mop up Ion's pawns in time - therefore time to resign!)

So ends the lesson on how retarded development can be severely punished by the strong player.

Have a nice day everyone!
