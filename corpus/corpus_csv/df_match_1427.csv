1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is my second annotation ever so I apologize if there are any beginner's mistakes in my comments. Any constructive comments are highly welcome.

Standard opening."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,My usual response. I like to keep it simple.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Developing knight and attacking e5.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,Developing and defending e5.
5,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,Putting pressure on knight and indirectly on the e5 pawn.
6,d6,d7d6,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,Backup on e5. Knight is pinned
7,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/1B2p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,Developing and attacking e5. Though my guess was it would move on to d5 to attack the knight which is pinned. So...
8,exd4,e5d4,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/1B6/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"Pawn exchange ahoy! My thinking was: ""Stop the attack before it happens!!!"" Oh yeah, sometimes I'm smart like that. :P"
9,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/1B6/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,Logical move here. Ncxd4 can't occur because it is pinned by the LSB
10,Bd7,c8d7,r2qkbnr/pppb1ppp/2np4/1B6/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 6,Developing bishop and unpinning the knight
11,a4,a2a4,r2qkbnr/pppb1ppp/2np4/1B6/P2NP3/8/1PP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"Not sure why this move was made. Maybe a backup to the b5 bishop, though developing the other pieces or castling might have been a better option here."
12,Nxd4,c6d4,r2qkbnr/pppb1ppp/3p4/1B6/P2nP3/8/1PP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,Hate them pesky knights...especially ones i don't control
13,Qxd4,d1d4,r2qkbnr/pppb1ppp/3p4/1B6/P2QP3/8/1PP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 7,Getting material back and developing the queen. Might've been too early for the queen with some pieces still at home but I guess this move was kinda forced to get the material back.
14,c6,c7c6,r2qkbnr/pp1b1ppp/2pp4/1B6/P2QP3/8/1PP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 8,Developing (kinda) and pushing the bishop away from my territory. Black pawn pushing white bishop away from their territory (kinda opposite of how it is in real life in the US...sorry for being a little racist here...lol)
15,Bc4,b5c4,r2qkbnr/pp1b1ppp/2pp4/8/P1BQP3/8/1PP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 1 8,Keeping bishop in a good spot
16,Nf6,g8f6,r2qkb1r/pp1b1ppp/2pp1n2/8/P1BQP3/8/1PP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 2 9,developing knight
17,Bg5,c1g5,r2qkb1r/pp1b1ppp/2pp1n2/6B1/P1BQP3/8/1PP2PPP/RN2K2R b KQkq - 3 9,Developing bishop while pinning the knight
18,Be7,f8e7,r2qk2r/pp1bbppp/2pp1n2/6B1/P1BQP3/8/1PP2PPP/RN2K2R w KQkq - 4 10,Developing bishop and unpinning the knight as well as backing the knight
19,e5,e4e5,r2qk2r/pp1bbppp/2pp1n2/4P1B1/P1BQ4/8/1PP2PPP/RN2K2R b KQkq - 0 10,Not sure. Perhaps hoping I'll move the knight.
20,Nd5,f6d5,r2qk2r/pp1bbppp/2pp4/3nP1B1/P1BQ4/8/1PP2PPP/RN2K2R w KQkq - 1 11,"Which I did (forgot why...lol). Anyway, knight is near mid in a more offensive position."
