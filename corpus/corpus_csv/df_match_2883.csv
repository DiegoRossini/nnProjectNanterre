1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I have played enough games against Margeaux to know not to prepare a response to 1. e4. He always opens this way.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,? A curious early deviation which will open up some strategic possibilities for black later on. 3. c4 would have transposed into any of several King's Indian lines and been better.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 2,? A curious early deviation which will open up some strategic possibilities for black later on. 3. c4 would have transposed into any of several King's Indian lines and been better.
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,? A curious early deviation which will open up some strategic possibilities for black later on. 3. c4 would have transposed into any of several King's Indian lines and been better.
5,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,? A curious early deviation which will open up some strategic possibilities for black later on. 3. c4 would have transposed into any of several King's Indian lines and been better.
6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3p4/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"The first sign that 3. e3 was weak. The knight on e4 is strongly placed, and white should probably forgo his bishop pair here (7. Bxe4 dxe4) to get rid of it."
7,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3p4/3P4/3BPN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"The first sign that 3. e3 was weak. The knight on e4 is strongly placed, and white should probably forgo his bishop pair here (7. Bxe4 dxe4) to get rid of it."

13,Nbd2,b1d2,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/6p1/3p4/3Pn3/3BPN2/PPPN1PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - - 7 7,?? 8. ... Nxf2 9. Kxf2 Bxd3 and white loses a pawn. Better was 8. Nh4 to drive away the bishop.
14,Bf5,c8f5,rn1q1rk1/ppp1ppbp/6p1/3p1b2/3Pn3/3BPN2/PPPN1PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 8 8,?? 8. ... Nxf2 9. Kxf2 Bxd3 and white loses a pawn. Better was 8. Nh4 to drive away the bishop.

Nxf5 exf5 11. f3 Ng5, after which white has an imposing center and has created doubled pawns for black in exchange for being less developed. White is already trailing in development, and 9. cxd5 only exacerbates the issue."

24,Bd5,e4d5,r4rk1/ppp1ppbp/2nq2p1/3b2N1/2BP4/4P3/PP3PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 2 13,Note that black has needed to move his king's bishop and knight twice to force black away from the e4 square.

The threat of winning the exchange is not the primary use of the d3, but to be involved on the attack on the b2 square. White should have  defended with 17. Re2 Rab8 18. Qd5 Qxd5 19. exd5 Nxb2 20. Bxb2 Bxb2 21. Rxb2 Rxb2, where white is down the exchange and a pawn heading into a torturous endgame. Still, this is better than losing a rook outright."
