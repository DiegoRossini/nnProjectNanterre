This game is from the WTWALTR MT that starts off with the weirdest opening set up ever. I felt I played this game the best of all the games I played in the MT, win or lose, though in the end I blew the game due to a mistake that was not even supposed to be a mistake. Lets move ahead to the main set up >>>"

I actually had somebody criticize me when I was playing white that moving my pawn all the way up the a-file is bad chess. This is the first move of the MT and as bad as I am I would not do that (though in a current game I did move the h-file pawn up aggressively in response to the Modern Defense, as Bobby Fischer said this is a suitable response, though the commenter playing his quote with those !? deals)."

8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp3pp/P4n2/3ppp2/8/4P3/1PPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,This seemed a little overly aggressive but I figured he was sitting me up for an early kill.

10,c6,c7c6,rnbqkb1r/pp4pp/P1p2n2/1B1ppp2/8/4P3/1PPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,No need risking trading a bishop or knight as long as the pawn can do the jop.
11,axb7,a6b7,rnbqkb1r/pP4pp/2p2n2/1B1ppp2/8/4P3/1PPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 6,"In this MT that ""dangling"" pawn becomes a nuisance for both sides and I found, as did my opponent here, it is okay to just get rid of it early on. Not sure if that is the best way to go if you're a master, but I got tired of trying to hold on to it as white. Seems he felt the same way."

14,cxb5,c6b5,rn1qkb1r/pb4pp/5n2/1p1ppp2/8/4PN2/1PPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,Take it and wait to lose my e5 pawn.
15,Nxe5,f3e5,rn1qkb1r/pb4pp/5n2/1p1pNp2/8/4P3/1PPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,Fair trade and I feel a little good with a decent material lead against a higher ranked player early in the game. Just want to hang on to it is my plan for now.
