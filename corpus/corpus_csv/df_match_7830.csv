2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"3. Bc4 stumps me a little. I don't see it in my Sicilian book (which is admittedly quite old), nor do I see it referenced in a couple other books I have on general openings. I cannot even find it on wikipedia. I don't know what to call it. However, I do see it in the World DB and it has the highest winning percentage for white and also the highest rating of white players who choose this move. Despite that, it is played barely more than 1% of the time as white's 3rd move in this position. Further, I don't see the purpose. It makes no immediate threats and it doesn't really gain much ground in the center either. I may have just been better off with 3. d4."

I feel there is a slim possibility that if this game had played out, white might have had an outside chance at promoting one of those two pawns, but in all likelihood, black would have sacced a piece to prevent it (if it even got that far, which it probably wouldn't) and white still wouldn't have enough to win.
