3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Main line is 2d4. White is not a player that studies openings.
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"Better was probably Nc3 to defend the pawn, this loses the pawn, or trade queens and white can't castle."

13,h3,h2h3,r3kbnr/pp1npppp/2p5/8/4P1b1/5N1P/PPP1BPP1/RNBK3R b kq - 0 7,This move seems to weaken white's kingside.

19,Be3,c1e3,r3kb1r/pp1npppp/2p2nb1/8/4P1P1/2N1BN1P/PPP1BP2/R2K3R b kq - 4 10,white did not defend the pawn so I take it. I decided to take with my knight because my bishop was more valuable.
