1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,My favorite move because the pawn moves two spaces. Why does white go first and black second? Is chess racist?
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Attacking my pawn.
3,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Why not capture?
4,Qxd5,d8d5,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Black is clearly winning now because he controls all of the center and is more developed.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,The game is now equal because we are both developed with one piece.
6,Qd8,d5d8,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,White now has forced checkmate coming up soon because he is better.
7,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2B5/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 3 4,I have now developed my bishop.
8,Bd7,c8d7,rn1qkbnr/pppbpppp/8/8/2B5/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 4 5,This move is good for the bishop because it gives him more spaces to go.
9,Nf3,g1f3,rn1qkbnr/pppbpppp/8/8/2B5/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 5 5,My second pony has joined the battle
10,Bg4,d7g4,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2B3b1/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 6 6,This bishop wastes time and makes white better because it now has less spaces to go and because white has forced checkmate with Ne5 Bxd1 Bxf7#. That is what would have happened if I let my opponent fall into that trap but I didn't.
11,h3,h2h3,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2B3b1/2N2N1P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,The bishop needs to move from that square if it wants a future.
12,Bxf3,g4f3,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2B5/2N2b1P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,White is still better even though he is down a pony and black's bishop can go to more places.
13,Qxf3,d1f3,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2B5/2N2Q1P/PPPP1PP1/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 0 7,White will now win because he has 15 points of development and black has 0.
14,f6,f7f6,rn1qkbnr/ppp1p1pp/5p2/8/2B5/2N2Q1P/PPPP1PP1/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 0 8,Adding one to black's development and defending against checkmate.
15,Qxb7,f3b7,rn1qkbnr/pQp1p1pp/5p2/8/2B5/2N4P/PPPP1PP1/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 0 8,What is the air speed velocity of an unlaiden swallow?
16,Nd7,b8d7,r2qkbnr/pQpnp1pp/5p2/8/2B5/2N4P/PPPP1PP1/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 1 9,The happy pony can now run to the center where he can have fun.
17,Qd5,b7d5,r2qkbnr/p1pnp1pp/5p2/3Q4/2B5/2N4P/PPPP1PP1/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 2 9,This move blocks the path to happiness.
18,Rb8,a8b8,1r1qkbnr/p1pnp1pp/5p2/3Q4/2B5/2N4P/PPPP1PP1/R1B1K2R w KQk - 3 10,Rb8 moving the rook to the right (or his left)
19,Qf7#,d5f7,1r1qkbnr/p1pnpQpp/5p2/8/2B5/2N4P/PPPP1PP1/R1B1K2R b KQk - 4 10,The much delayed scholar's mate! I hope that this instructed game has made you a scholar too
