17,Nxe4,c3e4,rn1qkb1r/pp3pp1/2p1pnp1/6B1/3PN3/3Q4/PPP2PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 9,white exerts steady pressure in the center and on black's knight

There are ±'s to each plan. Though blacks Knight stands better on f6 and now black's bishop still has some dynamism, I would probably play this either way in the future."

21,Be2,f1e2,r2qkb1r/pp3pp1/2p1pnp1/6B1/3P4/3Q4/PPP1BPPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 1 11,a temporary location for the queen to engage white's queenside pawns and deter white from long castling. Though the deterrent is probably only psychological as white would still have a good game had he chosen to 0-0-0 here. White also has the option to let the pawn go to energize his rooks and black would be ill advised to take the b2 with white now capturing the b7 pawn and the ensuing pig on the 7th would be unenviable for black to say the least.
