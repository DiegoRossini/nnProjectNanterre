I don't see why the knight would be a greater threat than the bishop. I normally don't like to give my bishop for a knight. This is because knights are the stronger piece in cramped, closed positions, while bishops are stronger in open positions. So, you have to consider each game individually, but generally, as pieces get traded off, closed positions become open positions in the middle game and end game. As the position opens up, the bishops become stronger and stronger. So, although both pieces are technically the same value, the bishops are my piece of choice. I would not have traded if I were you. Now I have 2 bishops to go into the endgame, while you have a bishop and a knight. That may be just a personal thing though, because while most strong chess players agree with me, I've met some who disagree."
