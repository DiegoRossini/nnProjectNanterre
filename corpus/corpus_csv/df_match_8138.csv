1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,The young Glaswegian makes a radical first move.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"I expect him to go for the ""4 move checkmate"" as there has been a lot of talk about it lately. The clever shimmy from the pony stops his queen making this move."
3,e5,e4e5,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/4P3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,I've seen this one before. The young Tim has gone in for a dubious and half hearted attack on my wee poor pony.
4,Nd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/3nP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,Any other move here would have led to him eating me with his queen. I expect him to move something else to put me back under pressure again.
5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/3nP3/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 3,"Et voila. There isn't a lot I can do to move the horse from a danger into an attack, also, it would leave me open at the back."
6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4p3/3nP3/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 4,"Shore up the defence with a cheeky ""take me - take you"" confrontation. Will he now move his queen?"
7,f4,f2f4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4p3/3nP3/2B2P2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 4,"No, but I like the building move. A diagnal line of pawns is a strong line of pawns. He's obviously learnt valuable lessons from not carrying out the John Barnes 4-2-2-2."
8,Nxf4,d5f4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4p3/4P3/2B2n2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,"Now, if I was a betting man, I'd say he'll move that pawn to threaten my pony again...."
9,Qg4,d1g4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4p3/4P3/2B2nQ1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 1 5,Well suck me sideways! I have to have a decent think about this one. How do I stop him from eating my pony? Keep in mind a wrong move could be the end of the game in this position...
10,g5,g7g5,rnbqkb1r/pppp1p1p/4p3/4P1p1/2B2nQ1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 0 6,"What do you think of that then Campbel? I think that is near on genius. Not Michael Jackson ""he-hee touch kids"" genius, but genius none-the-less. What you gonna do now?"
