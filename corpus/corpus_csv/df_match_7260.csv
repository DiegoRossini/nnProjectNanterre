1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

I have my own version of events as to what happened at the Battle of Naseby which occurred on the 14th of June 1645.  The Royalists were headed by King Charles 1 (my opponent's name is Charles btw) and his cousin Rupert of the Rhine - they were called the Cavaliers - on the opposite side were the Roundheads headed by Oliver Cromwell.  In my story I am going to use some artistic licence of the conversations on the battlefield.  King Charles takes the field with his troops - he and his men are armed in white - his missus, the staunch Roman Catholic, Henrietta Maria has been practising sorcery along with her faith.  Therefore she is known to the Roundheads as the Wicked Witch of the West.  Now Oliver Cromwell was far too busy with administrative paperwork in London and setting Government Targets so he enlisted others to do his dirty work.  Henry Thomas Fairfax and his wife Glenda (who has also dabbled in Sorcery) have drawn the short straw.  They have been provided with two castles, two horsies to ride on, two clergy, Frenchmen by the name of Fou Lenoir and Fou Leblanc and eight footmen - I am one of those footmen, I am the a pawn.  I end up 3 squares shy of promotion to a queen but that is as far as I get.   All of Cromwell's Army are armed in black. King Charles and Queen Henrietta have also been provided with two castles, two horses to ride on and two unnamed clergy and eight footmen. Henry and Glenda have now arrived at the south side of the battlefield at Naseby and will head due north to fight King' Charles Army.  The first white pikeman (a pawn) makes his move to Sector e4."

Gareth turned round and said ..... Ah, stop moaning, at least Glenda thinks you have the know all to fight a battle after she saw you kill a roundhead the other day. I then said to Gareth that I Joanne had no choice as I was ensuring my chastity for my beloved husband, Ian.  Well good luck to you Joanne said Gareth!  Anyhow, the battle has started and our friend John has just moved to Sector e5."
