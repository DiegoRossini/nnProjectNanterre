3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"the Najdorf, probably the most popular sicilian variation at the top levels, black is behind in development but his solid structure makes up for it."

11,f3,f2f3,rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N2P2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"an agreesive continuation (but aren't they all really) intending g4 with a kingside pawn storm, it also maintains flexibility in the development of whites dark square bishop"
12,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/8/3NP3/2N2P2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,black plays the more restrained e6 rather than e5 which characterises the Najdorf and so adopts more of a Scheveningen type setup
13,Be3,c1e3,rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 7,"a nice agreesive square for the bishop, eyeing the dark squares on the queenside which can be of use to white if black is careless"

Nfd7 looks unatural but black wants a knight on b6 eyeing the c4 square and this keeps the kingside pawns as flexible as possible ready for the white attack."

18,Nb6,d7b6,rnbqkb1r/5ppp/pn1pp3/1p6/3NP1P1/2N1BP2/PPPQ3P/R3KB1R w KQkq - 3 10,"as planned. its quite amazing that black isn't losing here, he has only developed the one piece and white looks almost ready to attack. it just shows how solid the black pawn structure is"

27,Qe1,d2e1,2rqkb1r/1b3ppp/pn1pp3/1p2n3/3NP1PP/2NBBP2/PPP5/1K1RQ2R b k - 2 14,white moves the queen out of danger as i knight is inevitably going to land on c4. white does not want to play b3 as this severly weakens his kings position
28,Nbc4,b6c4,2rqkb1r/1b3ppp/p2pp3/1p2n3/2nNP1PP/2NBBP2/PPP5/1K1RQ2R w k - 3 15,"definatly he right knight, opening the queens line to the queenside and the other knight is better placed in the centre"
