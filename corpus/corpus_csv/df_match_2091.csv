1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I was pleased to see an attempt at the English. Often the play requires sharp thinking.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I reply with the common response.
3,d3,d2d3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/3P4/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,This varation is tried...
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2P5/3P4/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,...and I follow...
5,Be3,c1e3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2P5/3PB3/PP2PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 2 3,"-SLAM! And now the opening book has been metaphorically thrown out the window. This isn't in the lines of the English at all, and now I must think of how to proceed next."
6,Ng4,f6g4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P3n1/3PB3/PP2PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 3 4,"I really don't know how to proceed effectively here, so I try disrupting White's development."
7,Qd2,d1d2,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P3n1/3PB3/PP1QPPPP/RN2KBNR b KQkq - 4 4,"To stop the pawn from capturing if an exchange. But, that diagonal is looking extremely dangerous..."
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2P3n1/3PB3/PP1QPPPP/RN2KBNR w KQkq - 5 5,So I prepare to advance both my development and the first attack of this match.
9,d4,d3d4,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2PP2n1/4B3/PP1QPPPP/RN2KBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"I honestly don't know why this was played, but the computer reasonably doesn't like this move..."
10,Bb4,f8b4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/1bPP2n1/4B3/PP1QPPPP/RN2KBNR w KQkq - 1 6,Striking White with a queen pin already. The issue must be dealt with.
11,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/1bPP2n1/2N1B3/PP1QPPPP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 2 6,Forced.
12,Bxc3,b4c3,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2PP2n1/2b1B3/PP1QPPPP/R3KBNR w KQkq - 0 7,"Up until now, Computer Analysis had me at a +1.6 lead, but now it plummets down to .65. I really wanted to tempt a capture with the b pawn, but figured I still looked good, considering White hasn't touched the kingside at all this match so far."
13,Qxc3,d2c3,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2PP2n1/2Q1B3/PP2PPPP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 0 7,Maybe I shouldn't have given up my dark squared bishop so soon after all...
14,exd4,e5d4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/2Pp2n1/2Q1B3/PP2PPPP/R3KBNR w KQkq - 0 8,"So I decide to exchange again, hoping to hamper development even further. Obviously inaccurate."
15,Bxd4,e3d4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/2PB2n1/2Q5/PP2PPPP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 0 8,And this was why. g7 is under a lot of delicate pressure at the moment...
16,Nxd4,c6d4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/8/8/2Pn2n1/2Q5/PP2PPPP/R3KBNR w KQkq - 0 9,Yet I continue telling myself that I can just keep trying to attack.
17,Qxd4,c3d4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/8/8/2PQ2n1/8/PP2PPPP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 0 9,"And now I fully understand I just should have stopped. I want to play Nf6, but if I do that, then Qe3+ forces me to lose castling rights regardless if I trade queens or not."
18,Qg5,d8g5,r1b1k2r/pppp1ppp/8/6q1/2PQ2n1/8/PP2PPPP/R3KBNR w KQkq - 1 10,"But since the White Queen sits there, I can't just leave my knight unsupported either, so I must do something. The knight must be defended."
19,Nf3,g1f3,r1b1k2r/pppp1ppp/8/6q1/2PQ2n1/5N2/PP2PPPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 2 10,"And yet, now the kingside is ready to begin the harassment."
20,Qa5+,g5a5,r1b1k2r/pppp1ppp/8/q7/2PQ2n1/5N2/PP2PPPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 3 11,I must buy my knight enough time to escape the grip of the queen.
