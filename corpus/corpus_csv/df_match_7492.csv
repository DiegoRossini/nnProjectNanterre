1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

I finally decided to join the Traxler Mini-tournament and managed to finish my first game in it with a win today.  It was amazing just how it seemed to all come out of nowhere!"
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,3. ...... Nf6 - this move characterises the Two Knights Defense.  My next move which is Ng5 hits out at the weak f7 square and threatens a nasty Q + R fork on it.  The move d5 is normally played but here a counter-attack is spawned by the developing move Bc5 hitting out at f2.

8,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p1N1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 6 5,4. ..... Bc5 - this is the move that gives the opening it's name.  It was called the Wilkes-Barre Variation but is now known as the Traxler.

10,Ke7,e8e7,r1bq3r/ppppkBpp/2n2n2/2b1p1N1/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 1 6,7. Bd5 - this move is recommended by Wikipedia and is the most popular move in the World DB.

12,Rf8,h8f8,r1bq1r2/ppppk1pp/2n2n2/2bBp1N1/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 3 7,7. 0-0 with a semi-open f file it makes sense to oppose rooks on it.  The WR adds a defender to the f2 pawn which is under the hammer of Alex's dsb.

14,Ng4,f6g4,r1bq1r2/ppppk1pp/2n5/2bBp1N1/4P1n1/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 5 8,7. ...... Ng4 - what's this?  His knight is en prise.  Can I safely nab it?  On analysis I decided it was safe to do so.  In fact my opponent anticipated this capture because he put in the sneaky move d6 as a conditional!  No doubt he was hoping I would not notice Glenda was en prise!
15,Qxg4,d1g4,r1bq1r2/ppppk1pp/2n5/2bBp1N1/4P1Q1/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB2RK1 b - - 0 8,"9. Qg3 - but unfortunately for my opponent Glenda is alert and moves to g3.  Because my g5 knight is in the way, Glenda is a little camouflaged in her intentions, she is eyeing up that g7 square."

After finding myself in the Dentist's Chair a few times (The Dentist is a buddy of mine whose rating fluctuates between 1250 and 1350) I cannot afford to be complacent.
