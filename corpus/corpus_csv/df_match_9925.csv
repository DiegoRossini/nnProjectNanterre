The problem is that black can quickly force draw and there is very little that white can do about it. That is all theory, but at the time this game was played, I was unaware of that."

While that is of course a great outpost for a black knight, there might be no safe haven for black king in the future. The move played can also amount in a pawn sacrifice, as the g5 pawn is going to be somewhat weak. But even if black loses a pawn, white would lose some tempi in the hunt so the game is quite balanced, IMO."
