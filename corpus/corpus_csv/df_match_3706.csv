1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hey all! Seems like I post nothing but foolishly aggressive games these days, but at the risk of being redundant, here's another! This game opens quietly, but once both armies have taken their places on the battlefield and the first shot fired, the fighting doesn't stop until both sides are bloodied and one is soundly beaten. This game is brought to you by the phrase ""no quarter."" Enjoy!"
