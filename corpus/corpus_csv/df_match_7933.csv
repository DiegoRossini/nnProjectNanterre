1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I have been playing a whole lot of Queen Pawn Openings, and so I thought I'd mix things up a bit."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The Sicillian Defense.  This and the Caro Kann are the reasons I've stopped playing 1. e4.   So if you play me and I do 1. e4, please do French, Open Game, Pirc, Scandanavian, or anything that isn't 1...c5 or 1...c6.  Thank you!"
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,All right.  It's hyper-popular and the line I feel most comfortable with.
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"This is a very popular reply for black as well.  When I choose the Sicillian as black, I usually play 2...Nc6, but d6 usually comes later anyway."
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"The book move, opening up the center."
6,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"This move is virtually always played.  In fact, I would even go so far as to say that it is the whole foundation for the opening."
7,Nxd4,f3d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,Of course.
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,Standard.
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,Still within my book in this game.  It's really sad how shallow my opening knowledge is...
10,a6,a7a6,rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"This move is a sort of waiting move for black, though it also keeps white's bishop and knights from the sometimes-critical b5 square."
11,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"I think we're in the Najdorf, but I could be wrong.  Looking in the database when I got home, I found 6.Bg5, 6.Be3, and 6.Be2 are all more popular, but I don't think there's anything wrong with 6.Bc4.  Also, I recently read mybookrunesdeep's annotation and found mention of the sac, and I was already toying around with the idea at this point."
12,b5,b7b5,rnbqkb1r/4pppp/p2p1n2/1p6/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"Maybe this move makes white feel uncomfortable and explains the lack of popularity; personally, I have no qualms about playing 7. Bb3 and letting black get his queenside play going."
13,Bb3,c4b3,rnbqkb1r/4pppp/p2p1n2/1p6/3NP3/1BN5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,Moving to d3 or e2 just admits I misplayed on my 6th and have given white tempo in his plan.
14,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/5ppp/p2ppn2/1p6/3NP3/1BN5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,Blunting my bishop.  This is a popular move and probably pretty good.
15,O-O,e1g1,rnbqkb1r/5ppp/p2ppn2/1p6/3NP3/1BN5/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 8,"Black's queenside pawns have gotten some space.  Best not to castle long, especially since I want to open this game up!!  I'm feeling tactical."
16,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/4bppp/p2ppn2/1p6/3NP3/1BN5/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 9,Logical.  Black wants to castle.  Both sides are fine with how things have developed.
17,Be3,c1e3,rnbqk2r/4bppp/p2ppn2/1p6/3NP3/1BN1B3/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 3 9,"Just getting my pieces out.  This move is extremely unpopular in both the world and gameknot databases.  The favored move, 9. Qf3  was quickly discarded by me in the game, for I worried about 9...e5, but that move would only saddle black with a backward d-pawn.  Still, this move is slightly passive and white has better.  ?!"
18,Bb7,c8b7,rn1qk2r/1b2bppp/p2ppn2/1p6/3NP3/1BN1B3/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 4 10,"Why doesn't black castle?  This move leads to the interesting, but speculative sac.  After my reply, black told me he was busted and after the game, he felt that 9...0-0 was necessary."
19,Bxe6,b3e6,rn1qk2r/1b2bppp/p2pBn2/1p6/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 10,"I didn't calculate beyond the knight check, but I figured this had to be good for white.  I get at least three pawns for the piece and black's king is very exposed.  Is the sac sound.  I certainly don't know.  The one game in the gameknot database with my sac has black declining with 10...O-O.  The world database features a draw after a long game.  I felt that the practical difficulties it presented were worth the risk.  Plus, I was feeling tactical!"
20,fxe6,f7e6,rn1qk2r/1b2b1pp/p2ppn2/1p6/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 11,"Declining the sac didn't work in the database, and it shouldn't work anywhere else either.  White can move his bishop back, having won a pawn and crippled black's isolated d pawn.  White has a winning position.  Instead, black tells white to prove the sac is sound."
