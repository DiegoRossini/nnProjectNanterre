7,Be2,f1e2,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/4q3/8/2N5/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 3 4,"The key move, to prevent the knight's nasty jumps."
8,c6,c7c6,rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/4q3/8/2N5/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,"The key move, to prevent the knight's nasty jumps."
9,d4,d2d4,rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/4q3/3P4/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,"The good one. Normally, lower rated players go Nf3, that is not bad. But the played one has poison in it."
10,Qa5,e5a5,rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/q7/3P4/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 1 6,"Yes, now, it's a loss of tempo. But white cannot do much, despite the aggressive playing he can display. This is the ""bet"" of this line."
11,Nf3,g1f3,rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/q7/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 6,"From now on, white has the fantastic d5! that opens my game and is often lethal for black. 
But, for some reason, almost nobody plays it!"
12,Bf5,c8f5,rn2kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/q4b2/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 3 7,"I cannot defend against d5 with e3 because I trap my own bishop. After this, black is cramped. It is to be seen if black can consider it a ""lock"" and hold the game with it."
13,O-O,e1g1,rn2kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/q4b2/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 4 7,Second and last lost chance to play d5.
14,e6,e7e6,rn2kbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/q4b2/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,"Now d5 holds, but white has a ready-made attack with Re1. I still bet black can handle that."
15,Bf4,c1f4,rn2kbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/q4b2/3P1B2/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 1 8,"Ok, good, this is the poisonous diagonal. White has the advantage here, I admit it."
16,Bb4,f8b4,rn2k1nr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/q4b2/1b1P1B2/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 2 9,"The normal one is Nf6, with a known game. I tried something new."
17,Bxb8,f4b8,rB2k1nr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/q4b2/1b1P4/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 9,"? the bishop is much, much more valuable than the knight. Probably, white wanted to prevent a short-to-come o-o-o, that is somewhat double-edged, but is still my favourite, since it places the rook on the best spot connecting the rooks."
18,Rxb8,a8b8,1r2k1nr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/q4b2/1b1P4/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w k - 0 10,"Ok, so no o-o-o. Hmmm..."
19,d5,d4d5,1r2k1nr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/q2P1b2/1b6/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b k - 0 10,"Nice, and at last played. If cxd, Bb5+!, and if exd, Re1 becomes dangerous. So I tried to mix things up."
20,Bxc3,b4c3,1r2k1nr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/q2P1b2/8/2b2N2/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w k - 0 11,The main reason for this is that the knight covered the bishop's check in b5.
21,dxe6,d5e6,1r2k1nr/pp3ppp/2p1P3/q4b2/8/2b2N2/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b k - 0 11,"The pawn is less important than the initiative. I have to shield my king, and quickly!"

24,Rd8,b8d8,3rk1nr/pp3ppp/2p1b3/q7/8/2P2N2/P1P1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w k - 1 13,...but this move only helps him in defending c3 with tempo. A mistake.
25,Qe1,d1e1,3rk1nr/pp3ppp/2p1b3/q7/8/2P2N2/P1P1BPPP/R3QRK1 b k - 2 13,"Just in time. All of a sudden, the game becomes tactical!"
26,Nf6,g8f6,3rk2r/pp3ppp/2p1bn2/q7/8/2P2N2/P1P1BPPP/R3QRK1 w k - 3 14,"Just in time. All of a sudden, the game becomes tactical!"

28,Nd5,f6d5,3rk2r/pp3ppp/2p1b3/q2n4/2B5/2P2N2/P1P2PPP/R3QRK1 w k - 5 15,"Just in time. All of a sudden, the game becomes tactical!"
29,Nd4,f3d4,3rk2r/pp3ppp/2p1b3/q2n4/2BN4/2P5/P1P2PPP/R3QRK1 b k - 6 15,So it is seems than the f pawn will be taken on e6 sooner or later. I looked for the circumstance it would have been less dangerous for black.
30,Qxc3,a5c3,3rk2r/pp3ppp/2p1b3/3n4/2BN4/2q5/P1P2PPP/R3QRK1 w k - 0 16,Anything but a queen on the central columns.
31,Qxc3,e1c3,3rk2r/pp3ppp/2p1b3/3n4/2BN4/2Q5/P1P2PPP/R4RK1 b k - 0 16,"The less dangerous position for black is reached. I am pretty sure Rd7 is black's best move, but I was staring at an elegant knight replacement."
32,Nxc3,d5c3,3rk2r/pp3ppp/2p1b3/8/2BN4/2n5/P1P2PPP/R4RK1 w k - 0 17,"The less dangerous position for black is reached. I am pretty sure Rd7 is black's best move, but I was staring at an elegant knight replacement."
