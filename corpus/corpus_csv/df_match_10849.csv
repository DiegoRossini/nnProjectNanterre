1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game is a fair reminder of the importance of 1) king safety) and 2) piece development in the opening (they often go hand-in-hand). White embarks on a series of hopeful moves, leaving his king in the center. His kingside rook and bishop remain asleep all game."

6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3p4/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Easily Black's best. White's 3.Nc3 is positionally dubious, locking in the c-pawn and allowing Black to play ..d5 with strong central control. Note how Black dominates the central light squares. If allowed, he will contest the dark squares via ..Bg7, ..Na6/..Nbd7, and ultimately ..c5/..e5, etc. Black threatens an edge already."
7,Bf4,c1f4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3p4/3P1B2/2N2N2/PPP1PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,The only move to retain equality. White  develops his c1 bishop before closing the pawn chain.
8,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3p4/3P1B2/2N2N2/PPP1PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,"'!?' - Theory prefers the immediate ..c6 or ..0-0, both of which will be played anyway and offer more flexibility. Still, ..Bg4 fights for e5 and threatens to exchange Black's ""problem"" bishop with White's most promising minor piece, which is hard to argue against."

12,Na6,b8a6,r2qk2r/ppp1ppbp/n4np1/1N1p4/3P1Bb1/4PN2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 3 7,"'?!' - The beginning of a bad plan. White is still 2 moves from castling and this doesn't help matters. Black will hardly acquiesce central control via ..dxc4?, which is the only vindication for White's idea."
13,c4,c2c4,r2qk2r/ppp1ppbp/n4np1/1N1p4/2PP1Bb1/4PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"'?!' - The beginning of a bad plan. White is still 2 moves from castling and this doesn't help matters. Black will hardly acquiesce central control via ..dxc4?, which is the only vindication for White's idea."

White's failure to develop (and castle!) now combines with newly-created dark squared weaknesses (c4 opens the e1-h5 diagonal while the dark bishop is locked out of defense) to doom him."
15,Na3,b5a3,r2qk2r/pp2ppbp/n1p2np1/3p4/2PP1Bb1/N3PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 8,"'??' - In fact after this move, Black wins immediately.

This inaccuracy is no doubt related to Black's proclivity for playing many games concurrently (and fast-playing the less taxing ones), a habit he has since halted. And so Black reserves his right to make excuses for occasionally weak play!"
