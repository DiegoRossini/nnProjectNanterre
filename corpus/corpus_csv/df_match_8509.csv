1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Just finished this little unrated game against my Expert buddy Dave.  I first got to play Dave in IM Beafyness's mini-tournament.  I got canned by him as black but managed to make a battle of it in ""A Mating Attack Gone Wrong"" as white.  Well, things went quite a bit wrong here.  In trying to undouble my pawns I overlooked a rook fork and lost a pawn.  In order to avoid further damage I had to exchange down to a K & P ending which I have stressed over and over again is SCUICIDE!  However, in this case I decided to play on because I had a queenside pawn majority.  My plan nearly worked but guess what, I blundered again and got taught yet another lesson, anyhow, back to the beginning - Dave decides to give me the Caro-Kann Defense after I kicked off with 1. e4."
