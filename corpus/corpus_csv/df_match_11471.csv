1,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I'm not real familiar with playing against an E3 opening.  I was taught that I needed to be more aggressive in my first moves, so this is ""out of my book"".  I just play for control of the center like I was brought up."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"""Logical Chess, Move by Move"" by Iving Chernev.  Unsure whether I should respond with e6 or d6 I flip a coin."
3,Qh5,d1h5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p2Q/8/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 1 2,Clearly the wrong choice.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p2Q/8/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 2 3,"I want to attack his queen, but I have to support that pawn."
5,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p2Q/2B5/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 3 3,There's the threat...
6,d5,d7d5,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/3pp2Q/2B5/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 0 4,"I desperately want to punish him for bringing out his queen so early, but mate on f7 would suck, big time."
7,Bb3,c4b3,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/3pp2Q/8/1B2P3/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 1 4,There's what I've been waiting for!
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3pp2Q/8/1B2P3/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 2 5,There's what I've been waiting for!
9,Qf3,h5f3,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3pp3/8/1B2PQ2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 3 5,And with him on the run...
10,Bg4,c8g4,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3pp3/6b1/1B2PQ2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 4 6,I continue my attack...
11,Qg3,f3g3,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3pp3/6b1/1B2P1Q1/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 5 6,"I consider h5 here, but I want to stay aggresive and that just seems to give away the tempo."
12,Bd6,f8d6,r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2nb1n2/3pp3/6b1/1B2P1Q1/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 6 7,So I bring up my kings bishop thinking that with 6. ... e4 I may be able to trap his queen over on that side of the board
13,Bxd5,b3d5,r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2nb1n2/3Bp3/6b1/4P1Q1/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 0 7,But I overlook that my knight is pulling double duty and promtly lose a pawn.  That sucks.
14,h5,h7h5,r2qk2r/ppp2pp1/2nb1n2/3Bp2p/6b1/4P1Q1/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 0 8,"Better late than never, I support my bishop like I should have done earlier."
15,e4,e3e4,r2qk2r/ppp2pp1/2nb1n2/3Bp2p/4P1b1/6Q1/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 0 8,Now he starts competing for the center and I'm pissed at myself
16,O-O,e8g8,r2q1rk1/ppp2pp1/2nb1n2/3Bp2p/4P1b1/6Q1/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQ - 1 9,But I've learned my lesson in this game and start gathering up my defenses before I go on the attack.
17,h3,h2h3,r2q1rk1/ppp2pp1/2nb1n2/3Bp2p/4P1b1/6QP/PPPP1PP1/RNB1K1NR b KQ - 0 9,Now I've got to go almost all the way home because of my blunder
18,Bd7,g4d7,r2q1rk1/pppb1pp1/2nb1n2/3Bp2p/4P3/6QP/PPPP1PP1/RNB1K1NR w KQ - 1 10,"I consider Be3, but down in material I need to avoid trading pieces and muster up a counter attack."
19,d3,d2d3,r2q1rk1/pppb1pp1/2nb1n2/3Bp2p/4P3/3P2QP/PPP2PP1/RNB1K1NR b KQ - 0 10,He supports his center pawn and I look for an opening.
20,Re8,f8e8,r2qr1k1/pppb1pp1/2nb1n2/3Bp2p/4P3/3P2QP/PPP2PP1/RNB1K1NR w KQ - 1 11,"With his bishop on a clear path to h6 I need to avoid mate on g7.  I plan to counter Bh6 with g6, but that would cost me my rook unless I move him."
21,Bh6,c1h6,r2qr1k1/pppb1pp1/2nb1n1B/3Bp2p/4P3/3P2QP/PPP2PP1/RN2K1NR b KQ - 2 11,A good move.  I'm really fighting for survival now.
