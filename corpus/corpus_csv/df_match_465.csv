9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/2bP4/2P5/2N2N2/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 5,A step ahead. Now Qe2 gives black just a painful defence.

13,Be2,f1e2,rnb1k2r/ppp1qppp/5n2/2bp4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,Keeping the Q for future action.

15,O-O,e1g1,rnb1k2r/ppp1qppp/5n2/3p4/1bPP4/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 3 8,"I have to take urgent care of the e column, and be aware of the very dangerous Ng5 by white. So I can't just go on normally, castling, Re1, and the Q has no good square to go to."
16,Bxc3,b4c3,rnb1k2r/ppp1qppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/2b2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 9,A thret is a threat.

19,Qc2,d1c2,rnb1k2r/ppp1qppp/8/3p4/2PPn3/2P2N2/P1Q1BPPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 2 10,"Now, Bf4 seems good, but in fact black gets very few compensation if ever Ng3 is allowed (NxRf1). On the other side, cxd5 would leave my N without a pawn's support. White will try to move Nf3 in order to be able to kick it with f3, so my Royalties must be guarded soon. I can't count on Be6 if g5 is not protected by a pawn."
20,c6,c7c6,rnb1k2r/pp2qppp/2p5/3p4/2PPn3/2P2N2/P1Q1BPPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 0 11,Keep the central pawn. Any white's incursion on g5 is now parried with f6.

25,Bd3,e2d3,rnb2rk1/pp2qppp/8/3p4/3Pn3/2PB1N2/P1Q2PPP/R1B1R1K1 b - - 1 13,"I can go for a drastic Re8, and white will have had a lot of ways to go on with the attack. On the other side, this move would have left my R undefended on e8, and my Q must be free to go. I have a serious developement problem, but I have to find the way to survive."

(maybe!). On the other side, the obvious danger now is white moves the N so to be able to pay f3."

29,Ba3,c1a3,rnb2rk1/ppq3pp/8/3p1p2/P2Pn3/B1PB1N2/2Q2PPP/R3R1K1 b - - 2 15,Re8 self-pinned my N.
