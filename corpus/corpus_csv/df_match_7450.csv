1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

This was the final game of my Inter-Team 1700-1800 Mini-tournament.  It ended in a Low Draw but after my usual middle-game probs I was glad to avoid finishing on a low note.  If my opponent manages to beat Grandad then I will top the table, still, at worst I will come second, not bad, not bad at all.  Anyhow, my opponent now kicks off with the English Opening which is 1. c4."
