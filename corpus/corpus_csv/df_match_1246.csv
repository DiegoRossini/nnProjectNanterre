1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Standard opening, freeing up diagonals for Queen and Bishop"
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Black goes for the french defense.

 I haven't played this opening before, so instead of checking out youtube videos or whatever, i decided to go with my gut...."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"... by an obvious (at least to me) move. 
2. d4 seizes control of the center and opens up a diagonal for the Queen's bishop."
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Black puts a stake at the center and attacks my e-pawn, simultaneously freeing up a diagonal for his DSB.

Actually looking back this opening is very nice, as Black's d-pawn is now protected twice."
5,f3,f2f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/5P2/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"Defending my e-pawn.
Kinda not a big fan of this move, since that square is meant for the g-knight.
Nc3 would have been better, defending my e-pawn and developing a piece at the same time."
6,a6,a7a6,rnbqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p3p3/3p4/3PP3/5P2/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Preventing Bb5+

In retrospect i understand why Black would do that, but it's ultimately not a very good move, as he moved a pawn instead of developing a piece.
So i respond to this move...."
7,a3,a2a3,rnbqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p3p3/3p4/3PP3/P4P2/1PP3PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,".. By doing the same! ahahah :)
Lots of good, developing moves could have been done instead."
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1n1p3/3p4/3PP3/P4P2/1PP3PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"Black starts developing, at the same time attacking my d-pawn."
9,Be3,c1e3,r1bqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1n1p3/3p4/3PP3/P3BP2/1PP3PP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 2 5,"I decide to develop my DSB, defending the d-pawn twice"
10,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk1nr/1pp1bppp/p1n1p3/3p4/3PP3/P3BP2/1PP3PP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 3 6,"Black develops his DSB on the excellent square e7.
I love this move! It protects the King, and takes control of two strong diagonals."
11,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqk1nr/1pp1bppp/p1n1p3/3p4/3PP3/P1N1BP2/1PP3PP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 4 6,"More development, attacking e4 and d5 squares."
12,h6,h7h6,r1bqk1nr/1pp1bpp1/p1n1p2p/3p4/3PP3/P1N1BP2/1PP3PP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,"Again to prevent a move like Bg5.

Once again i understand the intention behind it as i also do that a lot, but in my opinion this is a bit of a waste of a move, that will ultimately put Black in a bad position in this game."
13,e5,e4e5,r1bqk1nr/1pp1bpp1/p1n1p2p/3pP3/3P4/P1N1BP2/1PP3PP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 7,"I seize the opportunity to take control of the e5 square!
The e-pawn is protected by the d-pawn, and is attacking two key squares, one of which (f6) prevents black from moving his g-knight."
14,b6,b7b6,r1bqk1nr/2p1bpp1/ppn1p2p/3pP3/3P4/P1N1BP2/1PP3PP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 8,"Gives Black's LSB space to develop, since he doesn't want to cramp up his Queen's path.
My guess is that he wanted to advance his a-pawn eventually and get the LSB in the game."
15,Bd3,f1d3,r1bqk1nr/2p1bpp1/ppn1p2p/3pP3/3P4/P1NBBP2/1PP3PP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 1 8,"Taking control of another very good diagonal, and especially preventing Black's Rook from leaving its original post.

At this point, White's development is almost complete, with a good control of the center squares.
Black is a bit cramped up, most of his pieces still being in their home squares. His DSB on e7 is very nice, but his kingside is very weak at the moment, and will be the target of my attack."
16,Bb7,c8b7,r2qk1nr/1bp1bpp1/ppn1p2p/3pP3/3P4/P1NBBP2/1PP3PP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 2 9,"Getting the LSB off the back rank, and defending his knight."
17,Nh3,g1h3,r2qk1nr/1bp1bpp1/ppn1p2p/3pP3/3P4/P1NBBP1N/1PP3PP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 3 9,"I actually spent quite some time pondering this move.
i stopped myself from moving 9.f4, 9.Qd2/9.Qe2 or even 9.Ne2.
it was important to me to finish developing and placing a piece on the kingside where i wanted to attack."
18,b5,b6b5,r2qk1nr/1bp1bpp1/p1n1p2p/1p1pP3/3P4/P1NBBP1N/1PP3PP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 10,"?

Moving into the queenside.
But why not 9. ... a5 ?
Maybe was afraid of of Bxa6 ?
It was probably a better idea to Qd7 and allowing the king to castle.."
19,f4,f3f4,r2qk1nr/1bp1bpp1/p1n1p2p/1p1pP3/3P1P2/P1NBB2N/1PP3PP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 10,"Protects the e-pawn, and frees up an important diagonal for my queen."
20,g5,g7g5,r2qk1nr/1bp1bp2/p1n1p2p/1p1pP1p1/3P1P2/P1NBB2N/1PP3PP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 11,"Attacking f-pawn. If i will take, his h-rook will be set free. Cannot have that, so i will go with something else."
