14,d5,d7d5,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/2PP4/2B1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 8,"Trying to open space for the cramped knight on b8.  White will not capture because of 8. cxd5 cxd5, and then the knight has regained his natural square on c6.  Also, Black should not capture on c4 because that will allow the bishop to develop while capturing, and gaining a tempo for White."

20,Nxc3,e4c3,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/2p1p3/4N3/2BP4/2n1P3/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 11,"? Another mistake from Black.  He trades his centralized Knight for a nonactive bishop, while allowing white to strengthen his center again by placing another pawn on c3."

Also, look at the difference in development.  White has castled safely, connected his rooks, and is already forming mate threats.  Conversely, Black has 3 pieces on their home squares and has made 5 pawn moves in the first 12 moves of the game.  You tell me who you think is winning..."

I am convinced that barring major blunder, White should win this game in the end anyway, simply because Black is so far behind in development and his pawn structure is far to over-exposed.
PM me if you want to tell me what I did right, wrong or otherwise, or you can leave comments, which I always read.  Thanks, JamesXC"
