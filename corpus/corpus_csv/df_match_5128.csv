1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi Everyone!

As my coach, Ionadowman would attest, I am an absolute tiger for punishment!  I am addicted to playing the big boys.  I guess it is because I feel there is everything to gain and little to lose so that is the upside of being the underdog.  I am playing in a MT called Jo against The Titans which consists of myself, 3 masters and 1 grandmaster!  Sadly, I did not get off to a very good start, going down like a lead balloon to a mating attack from Ken, who I have played 3 times before and lost the lot!  We both kick off with a double king pawn opening and then he gives me the King's Gambit with 2. f4 of which I accept.  Before I go any further here is the gameknot analysis.
