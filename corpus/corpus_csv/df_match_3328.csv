1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"Hi everyone!

This could be my very last game against The Coach.  I was hoping it would end on a fairly high note for Yours Truly but alas it wasn't to be.  Of what was intended to be a de-cramping exchange of bishops turned out to be something completely different.  Because Glenda was on the same line as Ion's dsb, Ion was able to take advantage of this by exchanging his rook for two of my pieces.  This exchange proved to be as disastrous as it could be and the end was almost comical - my rook was trying to evade Ion's swarming pieces but it was all in vain and I ended up resigning on the grounds of ruinous loss of material.  So how did this happen?  You can follow the game with this link. http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=18375546&fb=1&rnd=0.12734190257427663"
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,1..... d5 - Ion chooses to kick off with the Reti Opening and I played the standard response to it.

The a pawn where it stands becomes a target for Ion's dsb later on.  The bishop move indirectly bears down on Ion's rook on f1."

I played this game very badly but Coach Ion must take credit for the awesome way he manoeuvered his pieces to induce me to concede a ruinous amount of material.  Well played there.  At least I will soon have a much better game against an Expert to annotate.  This time I manage a draw .....
