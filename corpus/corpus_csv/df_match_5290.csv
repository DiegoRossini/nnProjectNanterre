3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,The usual move nowadays. 2 B-B4 was standard until the middle of the 19th century.
4,Qf6,d8f6,rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/5q2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,What the...? That's why he's an amateur. This is the worst possible way to defend the pawn. I'd play 2... P-KB3 before resorting to this.
