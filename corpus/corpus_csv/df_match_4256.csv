11,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk1nr/pp1pbppp/4p3/8/4P3/1NN5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 4 6,Simply O-O and White has a good game.  At this point I am thinking castling long which I now think is a mistake.

16,b5,b7b5,rnbqk1nr/4bppp/p2pp3/1p6/4P3/1NNBB3/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 9,Black starts a minority attack.
17,Qe2,d1e2,rnbqk1nr/4bppp/p2pp3/1p6/4P3/1NNBB3/PPP1QPPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 1 9,"Not to late to play O-O, but I stubbornly continue to play for O-O-O even though it means castling right into Black's attack."
18,Bb7,c8b7,rn1qk1nr/1b2bppp/p2pp3/1p6/4P3/1NNBB3/PPP1QPPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 2 10,"White still could play O-O.  The most popular idea in the datebase was for White to play a combination of f4 and O-O-O.  I had actually noticed that Black did well in those games, and that White did better when he castled short.  Playing f3 with the idea of playing a type of English Attack at least got me out of the database."

35,Bb5+,d3b5,r3k2r/1bq1bppp/1n1pp3/pB4P1/1n2P2P/1NN1BP2/1PP1Q2R/2KR4 b kq - 1 18,There was a time that I would have believed that for White to seek counterplay on the Queenside was strategically wrong.  This move takes advantage of the fact that Black has not castled yet and can't get his rooks into play as fast as White can.  I decided to seek active play on the queenside.  If I can trade some pieces to where I no longer need to fear a king hunt then I have an extra piece (the king) on the queenside and can fight effectively on that wing.
