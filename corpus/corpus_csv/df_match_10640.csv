1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game unfortunately cost me advancing past the first round of the GK tournament. It's not a well played game by either side, so don't expect brilliancies, unless they're comic ones. But perhaps we can learn something from our mistakes?"
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I am not a fan of 1 e4 e5 for Black, and neither the Sicilian nor Alekhine's have been working well for me as Black, so I have recently taken up the Caro-Kann defense -- with decent, if drawish, results. Perhaps I was a little too confident in this game that I could obtain at least a draw against an ""inferior"" player??"
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"I learned something about the Caro-Kann by studying lines against it as White. But I play the Main Line (3 Nc3) and would never play the Advance as White, thus I am out of my field of ""expertise""."

6,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pPb2/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,Following the book.
7,h3,h2h3,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pPb2/3P4/7P/PPP2PP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,Deviating from the book. 4. Nf3 or 4 Nc3 are to be preferred here.
8,e6,e7e6,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3pPb2/3P4/7P/PPP2PP1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"This is the correct 4th move for Black, but I'm not very comfortable with this position. My bishop is exposed and trapped in the centre and White has a very constricting central pawn chain. The pawn breaks at c5 or f6 need to played as soon as possible."
9,Nf3,g1f3,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3pPb2/3P4/5N1P/PPP2PP1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,I could have played 5 ...c5 immediately.
10,Nd7,b8d7,r2qkbnr/pp1n1ppp/2p1p3/3pPb2/3P4/5N1P/PPP2PP1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,I could have played 5 ...c5 immediately.
11,a3,a2a3,r2qkbnr/pp1n1ppp/2p1p3/3pPb2/3P4/P4N1P/1PP2PP1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"White should be developing his pieces to exploit his space advantage rather than wasting time moving flank pawns. Almost anything is better than the text move: 6 Nc3, Be2, Be3, c3, for example."
12,h6,h7h6,r2qkbnr/pp1n1pp1/2p1p2p/3pPb2/3P4/P4N1P/1PP2PP1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"6 ...h6?! A ""small"" innacuracy that is endemic of how I came to lose this game. Given how cramped I am, I can't afford to play on the flanks. I need to play 6 ...c5  or ...f6 to hit White's pawn chain ASAP."
13,Bd3,f1d3,r2qkbnr/pp1n1pp1/2p1p2p/3pPb2/3P4/P2B1N1P/1PP2PP1/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,"I feel that this move actually helps my position, because I can trade off my vulnerable bishop now. 7 Be2, Be3 or 7 Nc3 are good options for White here."
14,Ne7,g8e7,r2qkb1r/pp1nnpp1/2p1p2p/3pPb2/3P4/P2B1N1P/1PP2PP1/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 8,"I don't think this is bad given that my bishop is being attacked. I'm developing now, and given White's passive play I can afford to hold off on the pawn break for a little bit."
15,Nc3,b1c3,r2qkb1r/pp1nnpp1/2p1p2p/3pPb2/3P4/P1NB1N1P/1PP2PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 8,Putting pressure on the advanced pawn at e5 and freeing my king's bishop to back up my ...c5 break. 9 ...Nf5 is no good because of 10 g4 and then he castles queenside.
16,Bxd3,f5d3,r2qkb1r/pp1nnpp1/2p1p2p/3pP3/3P4/P1Nb1N1P/1PP2PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,Putting pressure on the advanced pawn at e5 and freeing my king's bishop to back up my ...c5 break. 9 ...Nf5 is no good because of 10 g4 and then he castles queenside.

20,c5,c6c5,r2qkb1r/pp1n1pp1/4p1np/2ppP3/3P4/P1NQBN1P/1PP2PP1/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 11,"Finally, I play the critical pawn break. 10 Be7 first is also feasible, waiting to see what side White castles to."
21,O-O,e1g1,r2qkb1r/pp1n1pp1/4p1np/2ppP3/3P4/P1NQBN1P/1PP2PP1/R4RK1 b kq - 1 11,"Objectively analysing the board, I'd say my current position is cramped but fully playable. White's pawn on d4 will be traded off soon and e4 will be a juicy target, while my king's bishop will become active and influential. I also have potential attacks down the c-file and pressure to be applied with ...Qb6 or c7. 

Meanwhile, White has played passively and will have a harder time finding attacking chances right away, but he's far from out of the game. His best strategy is probably to counter my queenside play with a kingside pawn storm. 

None of this, however, materialises...."
22,a6,a7a6,r2qkb1r/1p1n1pp1/p3p1np/2ppP3/3P4/P1NQBN1P/1PP2PP1/R4RK1 w kq - 0 12,"11 ...a6?! Playing to the flanks again, with the idea of queenside expansion and stopping Nb5 after I play ...Qc7. But 11 ...Be7 or 11 ...cxd4 are much healthier."

25,a4,a3a4,r3kb1r/1pqn1pp1/p3p1np/2ppP3/P2P4/1PNQBN1P/2P2PP1/R4RK1 b kq - 0 13,"This pawn chain is not very useful for White. After I've castled, ...b5 can break it all up, and I have that attack down the c-file on his backwards pawn."

In spite of my own passive play, White has permitted me to free up my position, while leaving me some weaknesses to exploit. But instead of playing the strong 14... Bc5, or even 14 ...Rc8, I ignore sound principles and greedily snatch a ""free"" pawn."
27,Bxd4,e3d4,r3kb1r/1pqn1pp1/p3p1np/3pP3/P2B4/1PNQ1N1P/2P2PP1/R4RK1 b kq - 0 14,"14 ...Ngxe5? My move totally neglects the obvious: castle dammit!!!
