1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game is a typical Rui Lopez'game (Ruy Lopez, Closed, Chigorin Defense). 
Both players will start a well kown line without any exchange 
In the early middle game agmac(Black) will start to lose several tempos using his N. High(White) will therefore increase his influence on the center, strengthening d5 and the whole chess board. Let's see what happened!"
