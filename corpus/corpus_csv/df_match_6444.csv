1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is a solid starting move, freeing pieces to move. This also takes control of the center."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"This is the Alekhine Defense. This was developed by former world champion Alexander Alekhine, hence the name. This opening opposes the center and attacks the e-pawn. Most people play e5, followed by Nd5 and then the game is mostly based on the e5 square."
3,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 2,"This is the Krejcik variation of the Alekhine. It is recommended to play d6 here, but the computer played Nxe4."
4,Nxe4,f6e4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/8/2B1n3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 3,Not a recommended move. I can now play Bxf7+ and force the king out of the way.
5,Bxf7+,c4f7,rnbqkb1r/pppppBpp/8/8/4n3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 3,"This is a terrible move. I get a tempo here, and might get a checkmate if everything goes well for me. Better was g6, Qd5+, d6. This gets a positional advantage for black."
6,Kxf7,e8f7,rnbq1b1r/pppppkpp/8/8/4n3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQ - 0 4,"This is a terrible move. I get a tempo here, and might get a checkmate if everything goes well for me. Better was g6, Qd5+, d6. This gets a positional advantage for black."

9,Qg4+,h5g4,rnbq1b1r/ppppp1pp/4k3/8/4n1Q1/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQ - 3 5,"A terrible move. I see people play Qf5+, d3, and c4+. These are all winning moves. I played Qf5+."
10,Kd5,e6d5,rnbq1b1r/ppppp1pp/8/3k4/4n1Q1/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQ - 4 6,"A terrible move. I see people play Qf5+, d3, and c4+. These are all winning moves. I played Qf5+."
11,Qf5+,g4f5,rnbq1b1r/ppppp1pp/8/3k1Q2/4n3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQ - 5 6,Now time to win the knight...
12,e5,e7e5,rnbq1b1r/pppp2pp/8/3kpQ2/4n3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQ - 0 7,Now time to win the knight...
13,c4+,c2c4,rnbq1b1r/pppp2pp/8/3kpQ2/2P1n3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQ - 0 7,Absolutely terrible move. I can have fun hunting the king down now that he is far enough away to get back to safety.
14,Kxc4,d5c4,rnbq1b1r/pppp2pp/8/4pQ2/2k1n3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQ - 0 8,Absolutely terrible move. I can have fun hunting the king down now that he is far enough away to get back to safety.
15,Qxe4+,f5e4,rnbq1b1r/pppp2pp/8/4p3/2k1Q3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQ - 0 8,"I need to give the king minimal time to get back to safety. Either way, white should win. Other moves I was considering were Nc3+ and Qd5+. I chose a4 because if things do not turn out well, I always will have my rook open and I can push the a-pawn further. Either way, I can always snatch the e5 pawn and the king will take feel like it will never get back to safety without giving anything more."
