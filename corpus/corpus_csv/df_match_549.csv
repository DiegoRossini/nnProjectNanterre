1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,[1 hr 12 min left] I arrived 3 min late. This is my favourite Alekhine's defense
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,[1 hr 12 min left] I arrived 3 min late. This is my favourite Alekhine's defense
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 2,Scandinavian variation of Alekhine's defense lets you avoid Vienna game or Sicilian.

5,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"3. e5 should be stronger, as it misplaces the black knight. However, then white has to be ready for the complications after 3... d4 4. Ne2 Ne4."
6,Nxd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3n4/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"One of the two main two lines, the other one being 4...Nb6"
7,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3n4/2B5/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 4,"One of the two main two lines, the other one being 4...Nb6"
8,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4p3/3n4/2B5/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,"One of the two main two lines, the other one being 4...Nb6"
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4p3/3n4/2B5/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,"Unfortunately, 5. Qf3 does not work in view of 6... Nb4 7. Bb3 N8c6! 7. Nge2 Na5 8. Ba4+ Bd7 9. a3 and here Black equalizes in all lines. I knew this bit of opening theory, so was not afraid of it."
10,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4p3/3n4/2B5/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 6,The main line is 6. d4. I do not see the point of playing 6.d3 when 6. d4 is possible.
11,d3,d2d3,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4p3/3n4/2B5/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,The main line is 6. d4. I do not see the point of playing 6.d3 when 6. d4 is possible.
12,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4p3/3n4/2B5/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 1 7,"[1 hr 11 min left] I should have played 7. ... Nxc3 here, before the knight runs away from c3 to e4. I saw Ne4, but did not evaluate it properly."
13,O-O,e1g1,rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4p3/3n4/2B5/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 2 7,"[1 hr 11 min left] I should have played 7. ... Nxc3 here, before the knight runs away from c3 to e4. I saw Ne4, but did not evaluate it properly."

15,Ne4,c3e4,rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/4p3/2pn4/2B1N3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 8,"[1 hr 9 min left] The best move according to computer. Strategically the place for a knight is perfect, as he cannot be displaced without creating long-term weaknesses for black."
16,Nc6,b8c6,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2n1p3/2pn4/2B1N3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 2 9,[1 hr 8 min left] I should continue developing.
17,a3,a2a3,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2n1p3/2pn4/2B1N3/P2P1N2/1PP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 9,[1 hr 9 min left] This ensures the bishop cannot be exchanged for a knight via Na5.
18,b6,b7b6,r1bq1rk1/p3bppp/1pn1p3/2pn4/2B1N3/P2P1N2/1PP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 10,"[1 hr 3 min left] Here I started thinking, and having spent 5 minutes could not find anything better than this not demanding developing move. The second bishop needs a place to stand."
19,Qe2,d1e2,r1bq1rk1/p3bppp/1pn1p3/2pn4/2B1N3/P2P1N2/1PP1QPPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 1 10,[1 hr 7 min left] 10. Re1 followed in Reinaldo Castineira (2448) vs. Ibarra Jerez (2435) Granada 2005 where the current position was reached via 1.e4 c4 move order :) My opponent continues playing fast.
20,Bb7,c8b7,r2q1rk1/pb2bppp/1pn1p3/2pn4/2B1N3/P2P1N2/1PP1QPPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 2 11,"[52 min left] Apparently Qd7 was not any worse, as White cannot yet start the attack on the kingside. E.g. 11... Qd7 12. Neg5 Nd4 13. Nxd4 cxd4 =. The move I made is not bad either, as it creates a thorn in the centre which cannot be easily removed (d4). I spent 10 minutes (from 1 hr 2 min to 52 min left) considering the disadvantages of weak pawn on d4, but found it well placed there. And if d4 pawn cannot be destroyed, then it creates nice space advantage for black."
21,Re1,f1e1,r2q1rk1/pb2bppp/1pn1p3/2pn4/2B1N3/P2P1N2/1PP1QPPP/R1B1R1K1 b - - 3 11,"[52 min left] Apparently Qd7 was not any worse, as White cannot yet start the attack on the kingside. E.g. 11...

23,Nxd4,f3d4,r2q1rk1/pb2bppp/1p2p3/2pn4/2BNN3/P2P4/1PP1QPPP/R1B1R1K1 b - - 0 12,"[1 hr 3 min left] I was surprised at this slow move. The position is roughly equal, and black has some space advantage. In my opinion White should concentrate their forces for an attack of the kingside. Thus 13. f4 or 13. Qh5 can be considered. Without confrontation black can concentrate his effort on getting hold of c and d files. Alternatively, 13. c3 had to be played, as d4 pawn hinders white's development."
24,cxd4,c5d4,r2q1rk1/pb2bppp/1p2p3/3n4/2BpN3/P2P4/1PP1QPPP/R1B1R1K1 w - - 0 13,"[1 hr 3 min left] I was surprised at this slow move. The position is roughly equal, and black has some space advantage.

26,Rc8,a8c8,2rq1rk1/pb2bppp/1p2p3/3n4/2BpN3/P2P4/1PPBQPPP/R3R1K1 w - - 2 14,"[48 min left] Rook on c8 is a long-term bonus. Now a number of threats appear, such as b5-b5, or Nd5-f6 with Bb7-d5. Fritz likes 13... Qd7 and 13... Qc7 too."
27,Bb3,c4b3,2rq1rk1/pb2bppp/1p2p3/3n4/3pN3/PB1P4/1PPBQPPP/R3R1K1 b - - 3 14,"[1 hr 1 min left] White's move has no purpose. but it is difficult to find a good plan now. 14. c3 dxc3 15. bxc3 Qd7 was good for black, as their coordination of pieces is good. 14. f4 b5 15. Bb3 a5 16. c4 dxc3 17. bxc3 Qb6 18. Kh1 a4 is also pleasant for black, as his space advantage grows."
28,Nf6,d5f6,2rq1rk1/pb2bppp/1p2pn2/8/3pN3/PB1P4/1PPBQPPP/R3R1K1 w - - 4 15,"[39 min left] At the beginning of the game Ne4-g5-e6 idea bothered me a lot, and I am sure this threat was visible to Armand. Thus, I almost expected Ng5, even though this is by no means required. Alternatively, 14... Qd7 could have been played. The position is equal. I spent 9 minutes on this move - more then necessary."
29,Ng5,e4g5,2rq1rk1/pb2bppp/1p2pn2/6N1/3p4/PB1P4/1PPBQPPP/R3R1K1 b - - 5 15,[59 min left] Expected move happened.
30,Bd5,b7d5,2rq1rk1/p3bppp/1p2pn2/3b2N1/3p4/PB1P4/1PPBQPPP/R3R1K1 w - - 6 16,"[39 min left] Intended continuation, with the idea of queenside pressure after bishop on b3 disappears. 15... Bd6 and 15...Nd5 were also possible."
31,Ba4,b3a4,2rq1rk1/p3bppp/1p2pn2/3b2N1/B2p4/P2P4/1PPBQPPP/R3R1K1 b - - 7 16,"[57 min left] This move is not very good in view of 16... b5. Either Nf3 or Rac1 should have been played instead. Unfortunately, the bishop will not survive."
