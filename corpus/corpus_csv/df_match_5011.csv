1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Another game from my fishy tournament. A draw would put me joint third and a win joint second with only one game left for me to play.

Despite making some poor moves and losing material, I made a bit of a fighting come back near the end, probably the best come back I have ever made, helped by a few mistakes from white."
