Ok, should black try to avoid drawn, by playing Kd8? This is the interesting part. White must take the rook in f7, and then it's black turn to go: Qe4 , Kf2 (forced, otherwise I lose a rook or more), Bd4  (if Qxc2  it leads more or less to the same, but with less danger for white - I think). White can release the danger with RxB, but it is not necessary, believe me: Kg3, Qe3 , Kh4! (it seems bad, but it is the good one. If Kg4, Qe2 , Kf4 - forced - and, via c2, the black queen goes to c8 and it leads to mate. Try if you don't believe me) 
Kh4, ok, then the only way for black to go on is Qf2 , Kh5. Now, black can try to defend or go on with the checks. Anyway, the material is equal, and white reached his objective, to be back in the game. 
Let's go a little further, it is fun: black goes Qe2 . Again, Kg6 is forced, otherwise is checkmate. Qxc2  and white goes f5! Now, black has to care for the bishop AND for the checks that can give the white queen... drawn is assured for white (for example: Be5, Qf8 , and the black king cannot escape to the c column because of the white rook in c1. If Qb2, instead of moving the bishop, Rh-c1 is even more dangerous for black. If Ra7 instead, Qg8 , Kd7, Qe6 , Kd8 and Qxd6  is really bad for black...)

Must WHITE try to take advantage before all this? No. Observe that after 27. ... Ke7, Qb7  wins a rook, but loses the game. 

So, apparently black must either stay with drawn, or face the loss of the f7 rook and get into a check labyrinth without being sure to get out of it..."
