1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Scotch game, considered fairly moribund until revivified somewhat late last century by Harry Kasparov."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Scotch game, considered fairly moribund until revivified somewhat late last century by Harry Kasparov."

6,exd4,e5d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,The most usual and probably best response.
7,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"This inaugurates the Scotch Game.  If White is more adventurous, he can try various gambits (Scotch, Goring) by 4.Bc4 or 4.c3.  Both lead to interesting play."
8,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b5/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"Black's range of options here is huge.  One possibility, a sometime favorite of W. Steinitz, is 4...Qh4.  I've tried it myself on GK, though on the second occasion it got me into some hot water..."
9,Nxc6,d4c6,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2N5/2b5/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"An automatic response, you might think, but in fact much more frequently played is 5...Qf6, threatening a mate on f2.  White usually responds with 6.Qf3, whereat Black takes 6...bxc6."
10,bxc6,b7c6,r1bqk1nr/p1pp1ppp/2p5/2b5/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"An automatic response, you might think, but in fact much more frequently played is 5...Qf6, threatening a mate on f2.  White usually responds with 6.Qf3, whereat Black takes 6...bxc6."
11,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqk1nr/p1pp1ppp/2p5/2b5/2B1P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"Instead, 6...Qh4 has been tried a number of times... with indifferent success..."

14,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/p1pp1ppp/2p2n2/2b5/2B1P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 4 8,"(!?) Completing the mobilisation of the minor pieces.  More usual here is 8.0-0, probably because it is safer."
15,Bf4,c1f4,r1bq1rk1/p1pp1ppp/2p2n2/2b5/2B1PB2/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 5 8,"(!?) Completing the mobilisation of the minor pieces.  More usual here is 8.0-0, probably because it is safer."
16,Re8,f8e8,r1bqr1k1/p1pp1ppp/2p2n2/2b5/2B1PB2/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 6 9,"(!) Attacking the centre before White's King can depart the scene.  Probably White ought to castle out of trouble right now: 9.0-0 Nxe4 10.Nxe4 Rxe4 11.Bxf7! (Desperado!) 11...Kxf7 12.Qf3 Rxf4 (White was threatening 13.Bxc7+) 13.Qxf4+ Kg6 (Not 13...Kg8 14.Qc4+ picking up the bishop).  White would have had work to do to survive with a rook for 2 bishops, but his prettier pawns will have been a help.  Possibly White could enquire after a draw by 14.Qg3+ with the idea 14...Qg5 15.Qxc7."
17,Qf3,d1f3,r1bqr1k1/p1pp1ppp/2p2n2/2b5/2B1PB2/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQ - 7 9,(?) 9.0-0
18,d5,d7d5,r1bqr1k1/p1p2ppp/2p2n2/2bp4/2B1PB2/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 10,(!) Very strong.  Black is about to smash open the centre.  White is in trouble...
19,Rd1,a1d1,r1bqr1k1/p1p2ppp/2p2n2/2bp4/2B1PB2/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/3RK2R b K - 1 10,"(??) ... and this move ought to have been fatal.  Probably best is to cover up by 10.e5 and hang on.  The pin on the e-pawn would be matched (more or less) by the one on Black's d-pawn.   Although not as effective as the bishop move, even 10.0-0-0 is better than the text, though 10...Bg4 would have been very nasty."
20,dxe4,d5e4,r1bqr1k1/p1p2ppp/2p2n2/2b5/2B1pB2/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/3RK2R w K - 0 11,"(?!) Not the best, as it happens.  10...Bg4 would just about have been curtains.  Now White gets a reprieve..."
21,Nxe4,c3e4,r1bqr1k1/p1p2ppp/2p2n2/2b5/2B1NB2/5Q2/PPP2PPP/3RK2R b K - 0 11,"(?) I think James must have overlooked the fact that after 11.Rxd8, the e8-rook would have been (half-)pinned, and could have been exchanged off.  After 11.Rxd8! exf3+ 12.Rxe8+ Nxe8 13.gxf3 Nd6 the game would have been near on even. Now Black wins a piece..."
22,Rxe4+,e8e4,r1bq2k1/p1p2ppp/2p2n2/2b5/2B1rB2/5Q2/PPP2PPP/3RK2R w K - 0 12,"(?) That Black has an immediately decisive continuation here is not easy to spot, as the move he does play (12...Qxd1+) seems so obvious, and it gives Black a big advantage as well.  Objectively best was 12.Be2, accepting the loss of a minor piece.  But Savielly Tartakover once observed with hard-headed acuity: 'Sometimes the second-best move is better than the best move!'"
23,Qxe4,f3e4,r1bq2k1/p1p2ppp/2p2n2/2b5/2B1QB2/8/PPP2PPP/3RK2R b K - 0 12,"(?)

24,Qxd1+,d8d1,r1b3k1/p1p2ppp/2p2n2/2b5/2B1QB2/8/PPP2PPP/3qK2R w K - 0 13,(!?) Black could have forced White's capitulation with 12...Bxf2+! 13.Ke2 Bg4+! winning White's Q whilst saving his own.
25,Kxd1,e1d1,r1b3k1/p1p2ppp/2p2n2/2b5/2B1QB2/8/PPP2PPP/3K3R b - - 0 13,"Mobilising his rook, and apparently pinning the knight against the empty e8-square.  Unfortunately, Black's knight is not pinned.  Of the two options available (...Nd6; and ...Nxf2+), Black chooses the more aggressive..."

31,Re5,e1e5,r5k1/p1p2ppp/2p5/2b1Rb2/2B2B2/8/PPP2nPP/2K5 b - - 3 16,"As you would expect.  Doesn't this rook fork win one of the bishops, and restore the material balance?"
32,Bxc2,f5c2,r5k1/p1p2ppp/2p5/2b1R3/2B2B2/8/PPb2nPP/2K5 w - - 0 17,"(?) Bringing the game back to near-equality.  With 16....Rd8! and the threat on mate on d1, Black would enabled himself to keep his extra piece, e.g.: 16...Rd8 17.Be2 Rd5!"
