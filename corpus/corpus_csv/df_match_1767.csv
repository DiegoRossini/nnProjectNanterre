I have three pieces developed and have castled to his four pieces developed.  My knights are on good squares influencing the center and my dark squared bishop supports my f6 knight and influences the central dark squares.  My long term chances are in my central pawn majority after trading my c-pawn for my opponent's d-pawn.  My opponent has more central space, controls my d5 square, and will have a battery along his half open d-file after castle long."

I know that is poor on my part with an opening I play so often but I do not enjoy studying the openings....I prefer getting right to the middle game and looking for tactics.  As it turns out, this move is still in book.  My analysis told me this loses a pawn but I went with it anyway due to seeing great activity for my army at the end of it.  I have been studying the difference between analysis and evaluation.  Analysis is calculating the material left after all the possible lines while evaluation is looking at the position after the captures are over.  Analysis put me down a pawn but evaluation gives compensation for the pawn.  Here is what I saw.....10. Nxd5 Nxd5 11. Nxc6 bxc6 12. exd5 cxd5 13. Qxd5.....nets a pawn for white."

25,Ne4,c3e4,r2q1rk1/p3ppbp/2p1b1p1/3n4/3BN3/5P2/PPPQ2PP/2KR1B1R b - - 3 13,I missed this idea and don't like my position.  I see that white can go Nc5 next which would threaten to exchange knight for bishop giving white the bishop pair with an open center.  I also don't like my queenside pawns being isolated.  It looks like either 9.....d5 or 12.....Be6 was an inaccuracy.

Looking at this after the game I realize that 13...Bxd4 is much better.  For some reason during the game I could not get away from the idea that I needed to keep my light squared bishop.
