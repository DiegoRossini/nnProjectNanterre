1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

I have been thinking more about the thread that Coach Ion started about Pawn Majorities in our Walking the Walk and Learning to Run Club.  I have two perfect examples of play between one of my fellow Club Members, Patzerblitzer (Chris), a Class B Player who is in Master Freddy (Easy19's) mentoring group C.  In both games, Chris played the opening and the middlegame very well but alas, for him, it all went awry in the endgame.  Why did this happen?  Well, somehow I managed to utilse pawn majorities in the endgame to my advantage and sadly this meant that it did not work out for Chris.  So, here is the first of these two games and Chris lurves to kick off with 1. d4 and I usually follow suit with d5."
