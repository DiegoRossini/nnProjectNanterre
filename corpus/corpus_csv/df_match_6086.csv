1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Today I finished my first GK game and would like to annotate this. The game was not too exciting, but there were some instructive points. My opponent starts out e4."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I play the sicilian defence, a solid line that gives black plenty of chances for advantage. Against this line I employ the Grand Prix Attack."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,white is probably going for an open sicilian.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,I play Nc6. The other 2 main moves here are d6 and e6.
5,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,white does go for the open sicilian. It is a very dynamic and sharp game.
6,cxd4,c5d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"I play the accelerated fianchetto. This dragon variation is a lot like the traditional one, but black has not played d6 yet, and should wait until it is necessary to play d6 to keep the game in the accelerated territory."
7,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"I play the accelerated fianchetto. This dragon variation is a lot like the traditional one, but black has not played d6 yet, and should wait until it is necessary to play d6 to keep the game in the accelerated territory."
8,g6,g7g6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"I play the accelerated fianchetto. This dragon variation is a lot like the traditional one, but black has not played d6 yet, and should wait until it is necessary to play d6 to keep the game in the accelerated territory."
9,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"this move is to be prefered over d6, as the pawn move is ""inflexible"" as the game shows."
10,Bg7,f8g7,r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,"this move is to be prefered over d6, as the pawn move is ""inflexible"" as the game shows."
11,Be3,c1e3,r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 3 6,"this move is to be prefered over d6, as the pawn move is ""inflexible"" as the game shows."
12,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/pp1pppbp/2n2np1/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 4 7,"this move is to be prefered over d6, as the pawn move is ""inflexible"" as the game shows."
13,Be2,f1e2,r1bqk2r/pp1pppbp/2n2np1/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 5 7,white plays the classical variation. the other line is to play the yugoslav attack.
14,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp1pppbp/2n2np1/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 6 8,"exclam(!). this is the reason why d6 was not played earlier. Most dragon players know that black's key move in the non maroczy variations is the freeing d5. In the traditional dragon, the d pawn takes 2 moves to reach d5, but in accelerated territory, the pawn move is accomplished in 1, thus saving an entire tempo, and here, I think black has a small edge. And the statistics for master games shows that black scores a very nice 59%"
15,O-O,e1g1,r1bq1rk1/pp1pppbp/2n2np1/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 7 8,"exclam(!). this is the reason why d6 was not played earlier.

17,Nxc6,d4c6,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2N2np1/3p4/4P3/2N1B3/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 9,one critical line.
18,bxc6,b7c6,r1bq1rk1/p3ppbp/2p2np1/3p4/4P3/2N1B3/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 10,"after this, black has 2 moves that give him an equality at least."

22,Nxe5,d7e5,r1bq1rk1/p3ppbp/2p3p1/3pn3/8/2N1B1P1/PPP1BP1P/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 12,this is very weakening on the kingside.
