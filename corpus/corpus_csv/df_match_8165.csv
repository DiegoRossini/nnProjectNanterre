1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Another Muzio gambit. This time around, the game did not go as planned as my opponent put on a dogged defence. I had to rely on setting up a trap and inviting a blunder to win. I would appreciate any comments as to where I went wrong in my development that allowed Black a remarkable fight."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,the first 4 moves a set by the tournament opening
3,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,The idea being offering up a whole knight for a pawn for a significant lead in developement
4,exf4,e5f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,There goes the pawn
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,protecting against a queen raid with check
6,g5,g7g5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/6p1/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,Black tries to hang on to this won pawn and seek to advance to attack the knight
7,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/6p1/2B1Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"White is preparing for an attack on the f7 pawn. In this opening, if Black accepts the gambit, he must also accept that he won't be able to castle"
8,g4,g5g4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/8/2B1Ppp1/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"The attack on the knight. The following move is the first free one in the tournament. I am not inclined to a loose the right to castle. I could take my knight to e5 and initiate a second attack on f7 but then Black would respond with 5...Qh4+ 6. Kf1 with a ready made attack with pawns and a queen to try and opening up my king's position. I must admit I do not like the games that emerge from this variation as the board becomes extremely complex.  For these reasons, I allow Black to take up the knight"
9,O-O,e1g1,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/8/2B1Ppp1/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 5,"I castle, allowing Black a free knight for a pawn"
10,gxf3,g4f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/8/2B1Pp2/5p2/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 6,"Question: Do is it better to take the pawn with the rook, allowing a line up rook/queen later or with the queen for a queen/rook? The first one seems to be more sensible given that the rook is less valuable, at the same time, there is nothing better than a check with a queen which argues for a queen first. Any thoughts?"
11,Qxf3,d1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/8/2B1Pp2/5Q2/PPPP2PP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 0 6,I choose to take the pawn with my queen
12,Bh6,f8h6,rnbqk1nr/pppp1p1p/7b/8/2B1Pp2/5Q2/PPPP2PP/RNB2RK1 w kq - 1 7,Black tries to protect the pawn. I think 6...Qf6 is a better move for black as it threatens a fork with check on the White bishop on c4 with 7...Qd4+
13,d4,d2d4,rnbqk1nr/pppp1p1p/7b/8/2BPPp2/5Q2/PPP3PP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 0 7,"Playing up the bishop first, allows White to double move the d pawn for a firm grip of the sweet centre and an attack on Black's f4 pawn"
14,Qf6,d8f6,rnb1k1nr/pppp1p1p/5q1b/8/2BPPp2/5Q2/PPP3PP/RNB2RK1 w kq - 1 8,A move late but there comes the threat of the fork with check that I must address in my next move
15,c3,c2c3,rnb1k1nr/pppp1p1p/5q1b/8/2BPPp2/2P2Q2/PP4PP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 0 8,"I shore up the d pawn. So far, So good? Thoughts?"
16,d6,d7d6,rnb1k1nr/ppp2p1p/3p1q1b/8/2BPPp2/2P2Q2/PP4PP/RNB2RK1 w kq - 0 9,White liberates his bishop. Very good play I thought. My bishop on c4 will come under pressure at some point
17,Na3,b1a3,rnb1k1nr/ppp2p1p/3p1q1b/8/2BPPp2/N1P2Q2/PP4PP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 1 9,"Instead of 9.Bxf4, which would have set in motion a series of capture/re-capture which would reduce my deficit to -2, I decide to continue developing hoping it would pay off later. Plus my next (or few) move would liberate my second rook. Or so I thought"
18,Be6,c8e6,rn2k1nr/ppp2p1p/3pbq1b/8/2BPPp2/N1P2Q2/PP4PP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 2 10,Black is now a just a couple of steps behind in development. White starts to panick... The gambit is about to fall flat. Any thoughts?
19,Bxf4,c1f4,rn2k1nr/ppp2p1p/3pbq1b/8/2BPPB2/N1P2Q2/PP4PP/R4RK1 b kq - 0 10,I take the f4 pawn at last
20,Bxf4,h6f4,rn2k1nr/ppp2p1p/3pbq2/8/2BPPb2/N1P2Q2/PP4PP/R4RK1 w kq - 0 11,re-capture
