1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I used to hate playing against d4, but I've grown used to seeing it now."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Since then, there's a certain varation of Queen's Gambit Declined that I've grown quite fond of..."
3,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"But we won't be seeing a Queen's Gambit this match. In fact, I don't even know the name of this kind of opening at all. Gameknot calls this ""The Stonewall Attack"". I've rarely ever encountered this."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"I'm walking in blind, so I go with a move I feel is just safer to do in unusual openings."
5,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,And we transpose back into a Queen's Gambit Declined. I can relax a little.
6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,So maybe I can play this guy like my other encounters against this opening...
7,a3,a2a3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/P3P3/1P3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,Not a chance. I've never seen a QGD go this way either.
8,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/2PP4/P3P3/1P3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"And I say, screw it. I'm just going to keep developing."
9,dxc5,d4c5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2Pp4/2P5/P3P3/1P3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,He captures. The GK Database says that the position here is very strong for Black. But I usually see a knight push before this pawn goes down. Notice how White has only moved pawns at this point.
10,Bxc5,f8c5,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2bp4/2P5/P3P3/1P3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"I have to exchange, but I've still hesitated already for a lot of the match. It's taken me 30 seconds to proceed this way, whereas White has taken only 5 seconds out of his clock after this next move:"
11,b4,b2b4,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2bp4/1PP5/P3P3/5PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,"He is still continuing to be very aggressive with his pawn pushes, but I can't see any problem with his moves right now. The tempo is bound to run out if he won't push out a back rank piece yet..."
12,Be7,c5e7,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/4pn2/3p4/1PP5/P3P3/5PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 7,"And, of course, a full retreat would be unacceptable. GK says I still have a slight edge."
13,Bb2,c1b2,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/4pn2/3p4/1PP5/P3P3/1B3PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 2 7,Not up for playing 7. c5? After coming all this way? Not sure how I feel about White right now.
14,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/4pn2/3p4/1PP5/P3P3/1B3PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQ - 3 8,"There's no way I want my king near this queenside action, so I tuck him away at once."
15,Nf3,g1f3,rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/4pn2/3p4/1PP5/P3PN2/1B3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQ - 4 8,White continues to develop.
16,dxc4,d5c4,rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/4pn2/8/1Pp5/P3PN2/1B3PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQ - 0 9,"With all these queenside pawns in the way of my development, I move to exchange the queens, thinking I've just gained a pawn after ...b5! Even if I wasn't planning that attack, the threat of c5 shutting down my Queenside back pieces is too great, and this pawn needed to die."
17,Qxd8,d1d8,rnbQ1rk1/pp2bppp/4pn2/8/1Pp5/P3PN2/1B3PPP/RN2KB1R b KQ - 0 9,And then I quickly found out that I don't have the time to play b5. C'est la vie.
18,Rxd8,f8d8,rnbr2k1/pp2bppp/4pn2/8/1Pp5/P3PN2/1B3PPP/RN2KB1R w KQ - 0 10,Forced.
19,Bxc4,f1c4,rnbr2k1/pp2bppp/4pn2/8/1PB5/P3PN2/1B3PPP/RN2K2R b KQ - 0 10,"Obvious, because it allows O-O and more development."
20,a6,a7a6,rnbr2k1/1p2bppp/p3pn2/8/1PB5/P3PN2/1B3PPP/RN2K2R w KQ - 0 11,Still planning b5. I need some sort of tempo against White after he castles.
