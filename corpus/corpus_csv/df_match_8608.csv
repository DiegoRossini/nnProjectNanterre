Bg5 merely invites Black to develop a minor piece in response (...Be7, ...Ne7, or ...Nf6) and probably commits the B to swapping off.  I prefer to contest control of e5 and d6."

Black's K is still stuck in the middle so this seems more attractive than Rc1 or any pawn moves or minor piece moves.  In the ideal scenario, White's KB will move to f1 and the e-pawn will advance to e5 and Black will be under pressure."
