4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,[%clk 0:05:06]
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"[%clk 0:05:03] Not the most common answer, but one of the best."
6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3P4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"[%clk 0:05:09] Icelandic, my favourite."
7,dxe6,d5e6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4Pn2/8/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,[%clk 0:05:02]
8,Bxe6,c8e6,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4bn2/8/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"[%clk 0:05:13] The point is black has two developed pieces and white none. It is actually not such a great advantage, though, and has to be handled carefully. I didn't."
9,Bg5,c1g5,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4bn2/6B1/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 5,[%clk 0:05:02]
10,Nbd7,b8d7,r2qkb1r/pppn1ppp/4bn2/6B1/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 2 6,"[%clk 0:05:14] Not forced still to employ the dsb on e7. I like it on d6. Now white can go d5, and if Bxd5, QxB, NxQ, BxQ, and black has Nb4 as a threat, forcing Bd6, NxB, cxN, after which black has still RxBd8 and is in good shape."
11,Nf3,g1f3,r2qkb1r/pppn1ppp/4bn2/6B1/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 3 6,[%clk 0:05:00]
12,Bd6,f8d6,r2qk2r/pppn1ppp/3bbn2/6B1/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 4 7,"[%clk 0:05:07] Where I want it. Of course white can reject it with c4-c5. Two tempos, and I can still go c6 and Bb4+."
13,Bd3,f1d3,r2qk2r/pppn1ppp/3bbn2/6B1/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 5 7,[%clk 0:04:47] I would say this is too passive.
14,h6,h7h6,r2qk2r/pppn1pp1/3bbn1p/6B1/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"[%clk 0:05:09] I plan all the way to castle queenside, so I'm not scared in opening the kingside. By playing this, I accept Bh4, g5 and the risky piece per two pawns sac. A fun game, the result difficult to predict. I also accept Bg3, and I will answer Qe7 and leave the exchange to him."
15,Be3,g5e3,r2qk2r/pppn1pp1/3bbn1p/8/3P4/3BBN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 1 8,[%clk 0:04:45] Does this look like a bad move?
16,c6,c7c6,r2qk2r/pp1n1pp1/2pbbn1p/8/3P4/3BBN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 9,[%clk 0:05:12] Sticking to my plan.
17,O-O,e1g1,r2qk2r/pp1n1pp1/2pbbn1p/8/3P4/3BBN2/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 1 9,[%clk 0:04:48] Thank you white. Can you see you are inviting me?
18,Qc7,d8c7,r3k2r/ppqn1pp1/2pbbn1p/8/3P4/3BBN2/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 2 10,[%clk 0:05:15]
19,h3,h2h3,r3k2r/ppqn1pp1/2pbbn1p/8/3P4/3BBN1P/PPP2PP1/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 0 10,"[%clk 0:04:49] c4 was strongly needed, in order to force the deployment of my dsb (I'll go to f4 in case of c5). This is a mistake, even fearing Ng4, because it opens the way to my g pawn."
20,O-O-O,e8c8,2kr3r/ppqn1pp1/2pbbn1p/8/3P4/3BBN1P/PPP2PP1/RN1Q1RK1 w - - 1 11,"[%clk 0:05:14] Maybe too slow, but hey, I'm losing too many games no to be a little wiser."
