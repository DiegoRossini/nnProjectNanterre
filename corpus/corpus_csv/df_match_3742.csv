1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"One of the most flexible moves to the start of a game, and perhaps the best. It opens up a line for the bishop and queen, and puts a pawn in the centre."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The King's pawn opening, a good opening if Black does not wish to do the Sicilian; 1. ...c5."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Both sides develop their knights.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,Both sides develop their knights.
5,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,"The Ruy Lopez, a exciting opening which has many lines."
6,a6,a7a6,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,"3. ...Nf6, the Berlin Defence, is also quite feasible, but he wishes to stick to the main line."
7,Ba4,b5a4,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"This move, the Caro Variation of the Ruy Lopez, is quite O.K, though no opponent against me has ever played it before."
8,b5,b7b5,r1bqkbnr/2pp1ppp/p1n5/1p2p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"This move, the Caro Variation of the Ruy Lopez, is quite O.K, though no opponent against me has ever played it before."
9,Bb3,a4b3,r1bqkbnr/2pp1ppp/p1n5/1p2p3/4P3/1B3N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,"In this position, Black can play the Norwegian Variation, which hunts the bishop with 5...Na5, or he can continue 5...Bc5, the Graz Variation, a sort of Classical Defence only with the pawns on a6 and b5. But Black chooses something else..."
10,h6,h7h6,r1bqkbnr/2pp1pp1/p1n4p/1p2p3/4P3/1B3N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,?! I consider this move as a waste of time. Why would the bishop come to g5 anyway?
11,c3,c2c3,r1bqkbnr/2pp1pp1/p1n4p/1p2p3/4P3/1BP2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,Proceeding along with my plan of advancing the pawns in the centre.
12,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/2pp1pp1/p1n2n1p/1p2p3/4P3/1BP2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 7,"A logical move, which makes me have to defend e4 before I advance my pawn to d4. I think if Black wanted to play this move, he should have played it on his fifth move, rather than ...h6."
13,Bc2,b3c2,r1bqkb1r/2pp1pp1/p1n2n1p/1p2p3/4P3/2P2N2/PPBP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 7,Defending my pawn.
14,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk2r/2pp1pp1/p1n2n1p/1pb1p3/4P3/2P2N2/PPBP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 3 8,"!? This position could also have been reached from the Graz; 5...Bc5 6. c3 Nf6 7. Bc2 h6. However, 7...0-0 is more popular than 7...h6."
15,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk2r/2pp1pp1/p1n2n1p/1pb1p3/4P3/2P2N2/PPBP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 4 8,"!? I could have plunged in to complications and played 9. d4, but I felt this was a little too loosening. So I decided to move the queen to e2, the bishop to e3, and exchange bishops. Then with some of the pressure off, I could play d4."
16,d6,d7d6,r1bqk2r/2p2pp1/p1np1n1p/1pb1p3/4P3/2P2N2/PPBP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 9,"!? I could have plunged in to complications and played 9. d4, but I felt this was a little too loosening. So I decided to move the queen to e2, the bishop to e3, and exchange bishops. Then with some of the pressure off, I could play d4."
17,d3,d2d3,r1bqk2r/2p2pp1/p1np1n1p/1pb1p3/4P3/2PP1N2/PPB2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 9,"!? I could have plunged in to complications and played 9. d4, but I felt this was a little too loosening. So I decided to move the queen to e2, the bishop to e3, and exchange bishops. Then with some of the pressure off, I could play d4."
18,Bg4,c8g4,r2qk2r/2p2pp1/p1np1n1p/1pb1p3/4P1b1/2PP1N2/PPB2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 10,"I think I should have played h3 sometime, so I played it now, instead of going along with my plan."
19,h3,h2h3,r2qk2r/2p2pp1/p1np1n1p/1pb1p3/4P1b1/2PP1N1P/PPB2PP1/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 10,?! This move is not positionally correct. White will open up the centre sooner or later and Black will do well to keep his bishops because it is said that bishops work well when the centre is open. Better is 10...Be6.
20,Bxf3,g4f3,r2qk2r/2p2pp1/p1np1n1p/1pb1p3/4P3/2PP1b1P/PPB2PP1/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 11,?! This move is not positionally correct.

21,Qxf3,d1f3,r2qk2r/2p2pp1/p1np1n1p/1pb1p3/4P3/2PP1Q1P/PPB2PP1/RNB2RK1 b kq - 0 11,!? Trying to get some queenside counterplay.
22,b4,b5b4,r2qk2r/2p2pp1/p1np1n1p/2b1p3/1p2P3/2PP1Q1P/PPB2PP1/RNB2RK1 w kq - 0 12,!? Trying to get some queenside counterplay.
23,Be3,c1e3,r2qk2r/2p2pp1/p1np1n1p/2b1p3/1p2P3/2PPBQ1P/PPB2PP1/RN3RK1 b kq - 1 12,"My plan has been done, but now Black has a advance in the centre which he played."
24,Bxe3,c5e3,r2qk2r/2p2pp1/p1np1n1p/4p3/1p2P3/2PPbQ1P/PPB2PP1/RN3RK1 w kq - 0 13,"My plan has been done, but now Black has a advance in the centre which he played."
25,Qxe3,f3e3,r2qk2r/2p2pp1/p1np1n1p/4p3/1p2P3/2PPQ2P/PPB2PP1/RN3RK1 b kq - 0 13,"My plan has been done, but now Black has a advance in the centre which he played."

27,exd5,e4d5,r2qk2r/2p2pp1/p1n2n1p/3Pp3/1p6/2PPQ2P/PPB2PP1/RN3RK1 b kq - 0 14,"!? Qe4 and Qe2 are okay, but I decided on a tricky move."
28,Nxd5,f6d5,r2qk2r/2p2pp1/p1n4p/3np3/1p6/2PPQ2P/PPB2PP1/RN3RK1 w kq - 0 15,"!? Qe4 and Qe2 are okay, but I decided on a tricky move."
29,Qc5,e3c5,r2qk2r/2p2pp1/p1n4p/2Qnp3/1p6/2PP3P/PPB2PP1/RN3RK1 b kq - 1 15,"!? Qe4 and Qe2 are okay, but I decided on a tricky move."
30,Nce7,c6e7,r2qk2r/2p1npp1/p6p/2Qnp3/1p6/2PP3P/PPB2PP1/RN3RK1 w kq - 2 16,?! The bad merit to this move is that it is a passive move. When the centre is opened you should play actively. It also leaves the pawn on e5 weak. I threatened to take it with my next move.
