1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"My first OTB game of the season, following a horrendous season last year, when I dropped from the 1st team to the 2nd team and still didn't do very well.  Nevertheless, hope springs eternal and the 1st team was short of players, so I filled in.  Things didn't start well for me as I turned up at their old venue and, as 7:30pm drew near, realised that there were no chess players present or boards being set up, so I asked at the bar and was directed to the new venue on the other side of town, arriving about 8 mins late.  Fortunately, the match had not yet started."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"The Trompowsky: not an opening I know very well.  I do have a 1998 book by Joe Gallagher on it but not only is it somewhat out of date but I haven't studied it very well, so this is a learnign experience for me."
3,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/6B1/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 2 2,"The Trompowsky: not an opening I know very well.  I do have a 1998 book by Joe Gallagher on it but not only is it somewhat out of date but I haven't studied it very well, so this is a learnign experience for me."
4,Ne4,f6e4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/6B1/3Pn3/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 3 3,"This seems the most active response, avoiding immediate doubled pawns or pins but it requires accurate play."
5,Bh4,g5h4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/8/3Pn2B/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 4 3,"I got into trouble in a recent Gameknot game against 3. h4, so I was glad not to see that.  Gallagher comments that ""3. Bh4 used to be the main line but has been discredited somewhat in recent years"".  As the game went on, I found this bishop to be a major thorn in my side as it severely inhibited my development."
6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3Pn2B/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Gallagher describes this as ""a solid move which, in my opinion, fails to exploit the position of the bishop on h4.""  He prefers 3....c5 or 3....g5 or 3....c6, citing one of his own games as an example of 3....g5, which he drew against Illescas in 1985.  It leads to some bizarre-looking pawn formations."
7,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3Pn2B/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"This is not mentioned by Gallagher, so it's either a modern innovation or not very good.  It seems to me to be a natural developing move that doesn't create any weaknesses in White's position or provoke any particular response from Black."
8,c6,c7c6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3Pn2B/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"After quite a long think, I decided on this conservative approach, hoping to exploit the absence of White's DSB from the queenside.  I was already worrying about how to develop my kingside, given that the e-pawn was pinned against my Q and that both ...f6 and ...g5 looked ugly to me.  So I planned to get the Q away from the pin, then play ...e6, followed by developing my DSB and castling kingside.  Given the passivity of my resulting game, I think in retrospect that 4....g5 would have been the better option."
9,Nd2,b1d2,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3Pn2B/4P3/PPPN1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 1 5,"White challenges Black's central N with his own N, rather than pushing at it with 5. f3."
10,Qa5,d8a5,rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/2p5/q2p4/3Pn2B/4P3/PPPN1PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 2 6,"In accordance with my plan, I deferred the decision whether to swap Ns or retreat but continuing with my plan for developing my kingside and taking the opportunity to pin White's N.  This move is much less effective than it would have been if we had omitted 3....d5 4. e3 when the Q could have swung across to h5."
11,c3,c2c3,rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/2p5/q2p4/3Pn2B/2P1P3/PP1N1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,The natural response.
12,Nxd2,e4d2,rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/2p5/q2p4/3P3B/2P1P3/PP1n1PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,"Now I decided to follow Yelena Dembo's maxim that one should only retreat when absolutely necessary or advantageous, so, rather than retreat to d6, I swapped."
13,Qxd2,d1d2,rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/2p5/q2p4/3P3B/2P1P3/PP1Q1PPP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 0 7,"The natural recapture, which could possibly facilitate Q-side castling but that looks a bit dangerous with Black's Q ready to pounce."
14,Bf5,c8f5,rn2kb1r/pp2pppp/2p5/q2p1b2/3P3B/2P1P3/PP1Q1PPP/R3KBNR w KQkq - 1 8,"At this point, I first considered continuing with my plan for kingside castling with 7....e6 but I didn't like the way that it would box my LSB in, especially with my remaining N being so limited in options.  Moreover, if I did develop with 7...e6 and 8...Be7, White could capture on e7, forcing my K to recapture and I wouldn't be able to castle anyway; so I delayed those moves by developing this B outside the intended pawn fortress, leaving for later the decision on how I would develop the kingside."
15,Bd3,f1d3,rn2kb1r/pp2pppp/2p5/q2p1b2/3P3B/2PBP3/PP1Q1PPP/R3K1NR b KQkq - 2 8,"I hadn't really considered deeply enough this obvious response.  No bishop retreats looked attractive and 8....Be4 just seemed to encourage White to play 9. f3, building a strong centre with tempo.  I didn't really consider 8...Bg4 for the same reason, so ...."
16,Bxd3,f5d3,rn2kb1r/pp2pppp/2p5/q2p4/3P3B/2PbP3/PP1Q1PPP/R3K1NR w KQkq - 0 9,"I decided to swap, despite bringing his Q onto a powerful square that threatens h7 and can be followed up quickly with Ng1-f3-g5."
17,Qxd3,d2d3,rn2kb1r/pp2pppp/2p5/q2p4/3P3B/2PQP3/PP3PPP/R3K1NR b KQkq - 0 9,"As discussed before, ...e6 still did not look attractive, so I developed the N to the more central of its 2 options, whence it could, hopefully, eventually nestle on f6 or support a pawn thrust to e5 or c5."
18,Nd7,b8d7,r3kb1r/pp1npppp/2p5/q2p4/3P3B/2PQP3/PP3PPP/R3K1NR w KQkq - 1 10,"As discussed before, ...e6 still did not look attractive, so I developed the N to the more central of its 2 options, whence it could, hopefully, eventually nestle on f6 or support a pawn thrust to e5 or c5."
19,f4,f2f4,r3kb1r/pp1npppp/2p5/q2p4/3P1P1B/2PQP3/PP4PP/R3K1NR b KQkq - 0 10,"So much for entertaining notions of 10....e5 ... A good aggressive move by White, surely to be followed by the N developing and castling kingside."
20,e6,e7e6,r3kb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1p3/q2p4/3P1P1B/2PQP3/PP4PP/R3K1NR w KQkq - 0 11,"Finally, I decided that I had no choice but to play this, even though I wasn't very happy with it."
21,Nf3,g1f3,r3kb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1p3/q2p4/3P1P1B/2PQPN2/PP4PP/R3K2R b KQkq - 1 11,As predicted.
22,Bd6,f8d6,r3k2r/pp1n1ppp/2pbp3/q2p4/3P1P1B/2PQPN2/PP4PP/R3K2R w KQkq - 2 12,"As discussed previously, 11....Be7 was unattractive due to 12. Bxe7 but I was still determined to castle and, with d8 covered by White's DSB, queenside castling was out of the question.  So my DSB went to the only available square that wasn't covered by a White pawn or piece."
