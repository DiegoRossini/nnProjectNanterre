1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The game starts with [1.e4], King's pawn opening - that indicates a game with fast found tactics."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"My latest fashionable reply is [1.c5], a Sicilian - which creates an non symmetrical position where both sides have opportunities for attack and to try for an advantage."
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,This leads to a closed Sicilian.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,Continuing the mainline of the Closed Sicilian.
5,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 3,"The usual standard move [3.g3], is played with a modern styled bishop fight for the center. The standard line goes [1.e4 c5  2. Nc3 Nc6  3.g3 g6  4.Bg2 Bb7  5.d3 d6  6.f4 e5 (...e6, ...Nf6)]. My evaluation is that the text move fights for the center using an alternate approach. It does not appear to cause any major weaknesses for white and does develop in preparation for king-side castling. It differs from the main line in that it is not an aggressive approach to fighting for the center, which may afford black opportunities for gaining the initiative."
6,e6,e7e6,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Playing into uncharted (for me) territory, I play in the style of a Paulsen pawn formation, which controls d5 preventing [Nc3-d5] while providing the f8 bishop some mobility. The plan is development for king-side castling. When faced with unusual openings I try to envision a similar opening formation and look for positional weakness and piece mobility considerations. This position affords white 2 ready knights, but neither can move forward because of preventative play by black. The flank pawn at c5 is ready exchange after [d2-d4]."
7,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/1Bp5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"I was looking at this idea when [3.Nf3] was played. It presents a pseudo pin on the knight (because of the pawn at d7), and threatens to exchange [BxN]. But what is gained by such a move? Lets evaluate the position: the c6 knight is influencing the center by preventing [Nf3-e5], but it is not guarding any pieces, so an exchange by say [4...a6 5.Bxc6  bxc6] has the effect of strengthening the center for black by bringing the b7 pawn to c6 where it controls d5 and c5, which works against the c3 knight. The result is a half-open b file for the black rook, and a bishop advantage for black, and strong central control. This appears to offer black advantages in the center and quality of pieces and position. For this reason the move appears questionable (?!), and would require some proof of concept to see what it gains. The exchange does allow [Nf3-e5] where it influences (g6,f7,d7,c6) and does take some work to extricate by black with perhaps (...a6, ...Qc7, ...d6), and meanwhile there is an open diagonal for white [Qg4  Nf6], but castling must wait until the weakness of g7 is resolved (weak because the f8 bishop must develop before castling)."
8,a6,a7a6,r1bqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p1n1p3/1Bp5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"The bishop must be questioned because it presents uncomfortable leverage against the knight. The point of this move was to instigate an exchange, with the secondary idea of chasing the bishop to a position where it is constricting the position for white [Bb5-e2]."
9,Bxc6,b5c6,r1bqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p1B1p3/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"White plays immediately in the center, changing the game from what typically would be a closed position to an open one. But of course this is not a typical closed Sicilian."
10,bxc6,b7c6,r1bqkbnr/3p1ppp/p1p1p3/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"White plays immediately in the center, changing the game from what typically would be a closed position to an open one. But of course this is not a typical closed Sicilian."
11,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/3p1ppp/p1p1p3/2p5/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"White plays immediately in the center, changing the game from what typically would be a closed position to an open one. But of course this is not a typical closed Sicilian."
12,d5,d7d5,r1bqkbnr/5ppp/p1p1p3/2pp4/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,This move is made with the idea of making use of the c6 pawn in the event of [7.exd5 cxd5] which gains the center for black. The pawn at c5 is safe by the bishop and can also exchange later to take complete control of the center.
13,e5,e4e5,r1bqkbnr/5ppp/p1p1p3/2ppP3/3P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,"The text move creates an uncomfortable positional pressure for black, but the pawn may find itself soon alone. An idea black hopes to use to advantage."
14,cxd4,c5d4,r1bqkbnr/5ppp/p1p1p3/3pP3/3p4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"Or [8.Qxd4 ?!] was possible, but uncertain for advantage after [8...c5  9.Qg4]."
15,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/5ppp/p1p1p3/3pP3/3N4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,"Or [8.Qxd4 ?!] was possible, but uncertain for advantage after [8...c5  9.Qg4]."
16,f6,f7f6,r1bqkbnr/6pp/p1p1pp2/3pP3/3N4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,Playing for positional development at the expense of a pawn. This was an unplanned sacrifice. You could call it a Homer sacrifice (Homer Simpson of course).
17,Nxc6,d4c6,r1bqkbnr/6pp/p1N1pp2/3pP3/8/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 9,"The knight attacks (e7,d8,b8,a7), but it is unsupported. The queen is at risk and must move to a square with the most influence while also counter-attacking the knight. There are 2 choices (c7,b6), where [...Qd8-b6] appears best due to the pressure at (b2,f2)."
18,Qb6,d8b6,r1b1kbnr/6pp/pqN1pp2/3pP3/8/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 10,I was not expecting this move and it caught me off guard. The consequences of [10...Qxc6] is [11.f7  Kxf7  12.Qf3 ] and black finds an unpleasant situation after attacking play by white. The best move for black appears to be [...Nxf6] developing a piece while preparing [...0-0].

20,Nxf6,g8f6,r1b1kb1r/6pp/pqN1pn2/3p4/8/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 11,The text move appears the best choice because of [11.Nd4 Bc5] can go to [12.Nf3? Bxf2 ] or no better is [12.Be3 e5!  13.Nb3 Bxe3  24.fxe3 Qxe3 ]. The position calls for black to develop the f8 bishop with an attack.
21,Ne5,c6e5,r1b1kb1r/6pp/pq2pn2/3pN3/8/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 11,The text move appears the best choice because of [11.Nd4 Bc5] can go to [12.Nf3? Bxf2 ] or no better is [12.Be3 e5!  13.Nb3 Bxe3  24.fxe3 Qxe3 ]. The position calls for black to develop the f8 bishop with an attack.
22,Bd6,f8d6,r1b1k2r/6pp/pq1bpn2/3pN3/8/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 12,"Now a fight for the knight occurs. Black gains nothing from [BxN BxB], and has no continued attacking developing moves that play for an advantage other than [...0-0]."
23,Bf4,c1f4,r1b1k2r/6pp/pq1bpn2/3pN3/5B2/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 3 12,"Now a fight for the knight occurs. Black gains nothing from [BxN BxB], and has no continued attacking developing moves that play for an advantage other than [...0-0]."
24,O-O,e8g8,r1b2rk1/6pp/pq1bpn2/3pN3/5B2/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 4 13,White plays tactically to save the knight.

26,Bc5,d6c5,r1b2rk1/6pp/pq2pn2/2bpN3/8/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 6 14,"The text move (?) is a nice forking attack, but it allows black to free both queen and knight from danger. Better was [14.Bxc5] for an equal trade and material edge."
27,Na4,c3a4,r1b2rk1/6pp/pq2pn2/2bpN3/N7/4B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 7 14,"The text move (?) is a nice forking attack, but it allows black to free both queen and knight from danger. Better was [14.Bxc5] for an equal trade and material edge."
28,Qa5+,b6a5,r1b2rk1/6pp/p3pn2/q1bpN3/N7/4B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 8 15,The text move (!) counter-attacks with a fork (check and QxN).
