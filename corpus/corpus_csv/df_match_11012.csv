1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I was White in this game in an online tournament. I carefully maneuvered an attack against Black's frozen position, after sacrificing a piece."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"1...c5 is the most common move against e4, because it leads to complicated imbalanced play, while 1...e5 simply matches me in the centre, while I have the tempo."
3,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"I play King's Gambit a lot in short time control games. Although I never play it in longer games or correspondence games since the opening is considered unsound, meaning Black should be able to recover from his underdeveloped position, and hold onto his extra pawn."
4,exf4,e5f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Black chooses to accept the pawn. If he doesn't want it, he can play Bc5."
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"3.Bc4 was the sharpest move, but to play it, you have to know the Qh4  Kf1 variation, and I also want to preserve the option of developing my bishop to c4 or d3. Knights before Bishops."
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,"I consider this a terrible move. MUCH better moves are Nf6, g5, Be7, or even simply d6."
7,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3PPp2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"Now I have more compensation for the pawn than I should have, since Nc6 was a pointless move."
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/3PPp2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"This position is totally winning for Black since he's up a pawn, but it's hard for Black to win accurately since this was a fast timed game, and it's easier for me to find good moves than it is for Black."
9,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/3PPp2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,"I considered d5, but it leads to an incredibly boring position. I want to defend my central pawns where they control much of the centre."
10,Bb4,f8b4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/1b1PPp2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 3 6,"This isn't much of a threat, since I can simply defend while developing a piece. Pins are usually stronger on g4 and g5, than they are on b4 and b5."
11,Bd3,f1d3,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/1b1PPp2/2NB1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 4 6,"Nh5 would've held the pawn effectively, but if Black doesn't make accurate moves, he may get crushed, especially since this is a fast paced game. Giving me back the pawn immediately is safer, but leaves me with a lead in development."
12,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/1b1PPp2/2NB1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 5 7,"Nh5 would've held the pawn effectively, but if Black doesn't make accurate moves, he may get crushed, especially since this is a fast paced game. Giving me back the pawn immediately is safer, but leaves me with a lead in development."
13,Bxf4,c1f4,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/1b1PPB2/2NB1N2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 7,Black is strengthening my pawn structure by letting me pull a flank pawn toward the centre.
14,Bxc3+,b4c3,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/3PPB2/2bB1N2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 8,Black is strengthening my pawn structure by letting me pull a flank pawn toward the centre.
15,bxc3,b2c3,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/3PPB2/2PB1N2/P1P3PP/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 8,"Although my position seems a lot superior, Black's position seems solid, so it may take a sacrifice to kill Black's position."
16,d6,d7d6,r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/8/3PPB2/2PB1N2/P1P3PP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 9,"Although my position seems a lot superior, Black's position seems solid, so it may take a sacrifice to kill Black's position."
17,Ng5,f3g5,r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/6N1/3PPB2/2PB4/P1P3PP/R2QK2R b KQ - 1 9,"Bg5 is probably accurate here, but I made this odd looking move because I intend to sacrifice."
18,h6,h7h6,r1bq1rk1/ppp2pp1/2np1n1p/6N1/3PPB2/2PB4/P1P3PP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 10,"I offered Black my knight since my knight isn't very important, and Black's defensive h-pawn is."
19,O-O,e1g1,r1bq1rk1/ppp2pp1/2np1n1p/6N1/3PPB2/2PB4/P1P3PP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 10,"I offered Black my knight since my knight isn't very important, and Black's defensive h-pawn is."
20,hxg5,h6g5,r1bq1rk1/ppp2pp1/2np1n2/6p1/3PPB2/2PB4/P1P3PP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 11,Accepting the sacrifice I think is bad.
21,Bxg5,f4g5,r1bq1rk1/ppp2pp1/2np1n2/6B1/3PP3/2PB4/P1P3PP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 11,"For compensation for the piece, I have frozen Black's position. All my pieces can join in the attack against Black, while Black's position can hardly breathe."
22,Nb8,c6b8,rnbq1rk1/ppp2pp1/3p1n2/6B1/3PP3/2PB4/P1P3PP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 1 12,"Black actually played Re8 in this position, but I don't want to redo my entire annotation just because of one mistake in analysis. Black played Re8 before Nb8. Black's knight does nothing on c6, so he wants to redevelop it to d7 to defend his helpless pinned knight."
23,Qe1,d1e1,rnbq1rk1/ppp2pp1/3p1n2/6B1/3PP3/2PB4/P1P3PP/R3QRK1 b - - 2 12,Threatening e5.
24,Re8,f8e8,rnbqr1k1/ppp2pp1/3p1n2/6B1/3PP3/2PB4/P1P3PP/R3QRK1 w - - 3 13,"This stopped e5 for now (on move 11), but I don't want to complicate the game playing e5"
