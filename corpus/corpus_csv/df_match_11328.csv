1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This game shows how a simple tactic can leave me with an easily won game on move 10.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The Philidor is somewhat passive, but it is safer than the sharper Nc6."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"The Philidor is somewhat passive, but it is safer than the sharper Nc6."
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"The Philidor is somewhat passive, but it is safer than the sharper Nc6."
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,Capturing is better because then Black can make a useful developing move instead of moving the queen to an unimportant square.
6,Qe7,d8e7,rnb1kbnr/ppp1qppp/3p4/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,Capturing is better because then Black can make a useful developing move instead of moving the queen to an unimportant square.
7,Bd3,f1d3,rnb1kbnr/ppp1qppp/3p4/4p3/3PP3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 4,"I thought about playing Nc3 here, but I wanted to get castled as soon as possible to get my king off the queen's file and to have Re1 to defend my centre pawn."
8,exd4,e5d4,rnb1kbnr/ppp1qppp/3p4/8/3pP3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"Black's e-file threats are not dangerous because once I castle and get my rook to e1, I will control the e-file."
9,Nxd4,f3d4,rnb1kbnr/ppp1qppp/3p4/8/3NP3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"Black's e-file threats are not dangerous because once I castle and get my rook to e1, I will control the e-file."

11,O-O,e1g1,rnb1kbnr/ppp1qppp/8/3p4/3NP3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 6,"Black doesn't have time to chase away my bishop with 7...h6? because I am threatening 8. Bxf6 Qxf6 9. exd5, winning a pawn. And Black won't be able to take my knight with 9...Qxd4?? because I play 10.Bb5  winning the queen."
12,Nf6,g8f6,rnb1kb1r/ppp1qppp/5n2/3p4/3NP3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 7,"Black doesn't have time to chase away my bishop with 7...h6? because I am threatening 8. Bxf6 Qxf6 9. exd5, winning a pawn. And Black won't be able to take my knight with 9...Qxd4?? because I play 10.Bb5  winning the queen."

14,dxe4,d5e4,rnb1kb1r/ppp1qppp/5n2/6B1/3Np3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 0 8,"Black's d5 move earlier was a mistake because I can force the opening of the e-file, where my rook can become a threat to black's king and queen, and black will have to waste a move developing his bishop because of his incorrect Qe7 move."
15,Re1,f1e1,rnb1kb1r/ppp1qppp/5n2/6B1/3Np3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RN1QR1K1 b kq - 1 8,"Black has to block the e-file from attack by my rook. When you castle early and control the centre files with rooks or a queen, you can often create tactics against an uncastled king in the centre, giving you an easily won game on move 10."
16,Be6,c8e6,rn2kb1r/ppp1qppp/4bn2/6B1/3Np3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RN1QR1K1 w kq - 2 9,"Black has to block the e-file from attack by my rook.

Black's e6 bishop is especially weak, so Black needs to be on the lookout for tactics along the e-file."
18,h6,h7h6,rn2kb1r/ppp1qpp1/4bn1p/6B1/3NR3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RN1Q2K1 w kq - 0 10,"9...h6??
A losing blunder. Black still doesn't have time to chase away my attacking pieces. His only hope was to play 9...Nbd7 and try to castle queenside, where my advantage isn't immidiately winning like with 9..h6??"
19,Rxe6,e4e6,rn2kb1r/ppp1qpp1/4Rn1p/6B1/3N4/3B4/PPP2PPP/RN1Q2K1 b kq - 0 10,"Black wasn't aware of the tactical dangers on the e-file, so now I have an easily won game."
20,fxe6,f7e6,rn2kb1r/ppp1q1p1/4pn1p/6B1/3N4/3B4/PPP2PPP/RN1Q2K1 w kq - 0 11,Now I am driving Black's king to the open d-file where my queen dominates.

22,Kd7,e8d7,rn3b1r/pppkq1p1/4pnBp/6B1/3N4/8/PPP2PPP/RN1Q2K1 w - - 2 12,The other choice Kd8 results in the same fate as Kd7 played in the game.
