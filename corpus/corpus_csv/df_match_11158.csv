1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"A Petrosian patent. Most if not all of Petrosians chess games as white are opened with either d4 or c4. However, just for the beginners out there it is important to note that neither e4, d4 nor c4 (and Nf3 and g3) are all equal openings with neither one being more effective than the other. It is only a matter of preference."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Korchnoi responds with d5 which is slightly odd for his style of play as most of the time (86% of the time in fact) Korchnoi replies to 1.d4 with Nf6 and either a Gruenfeld or an Indian. So with d5 Korchnoi might have something prepared... 

On 1...d5 Black is simply mimicking white's move. This can lead to the many variations in the Queens Gambit Declined such as the Slav, Tarrasch, Semi-Tarrasch Defence as well as the Torre Attack and other uncommon opening variations. It is a perfectly logical and playable move."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Less common then c4 but perfectly playable.
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,Once again mimicking whites move. White now has two main choices c4 which leads to the QGD or Bg5 which may become a Torre Attack depending on other moves played.
5,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,Accepting the 'gambit' pawn is playable but white can easily win back the pawn. (4.Qa4  or 4.e3 b5 5.a4 c6 6.axb cxb 7. b3!)
6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,Accepting the 'gambit' pawn is playable but white can easily win back the pawn. (4.Qa4  or 4.e3 b5 5.a4 c6 6.axb cxb 7. b3!)
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,We have now reached the main line of the Queens gambit declined which is usually reached after the move order 1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Nf3 (Although 4.Bg5 is more common.) Now after 4...Be7 and 5.Bg5 play continues as normal but with blacks next move he introduces the Tarrasch Defence.
8,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Here we are at the Tarrasch Defence. 

Usually in the QGD blacks main goals are e5 or c5. Here with the Tarrasch Defence black achieves this goal early however, it can lead to a slight strategic advantage to white."
9,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pP4/3P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"By far the best and most common move. If 5...exd then the Tarrasch Defence is introduced or if 5...Nxd5 then the Semi-Tarrasch is introduced.

With the Tarrasch Defence black accepts an isolated d pawn for smooth development and plenty of space. Many GM's have played the Tarrasch Defence now and again including former World Champion Garry Kasparov until Karpov with the white pieces outplayed him in the World Championship match. In this defence white plays against black's isolated pawn while black tries to use his piece mobility to lauch an attack.

Unlike it's cousin, the Semi-Tarrasch Defence does not give black an islolated d-pawn but instead allows white to build a strong center. (See game)"
10,Nxd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4p3/2pn4/3P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,After a slightly uncommon move order we reach the Semi-Tarrasch Defence. As said before white obtains an advantage after the following moves.
11,e4,e2e4,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4p3/2pn4/3PP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,Logical and in my opinion the best move. Black is voluntarily allowing his knight to be driven around the board there is no reason why white should not do just that.
12,Nxc3,d5c3,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4p3/2p5/3PP3/2n2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,The only correct move as it gains tempi and trades off pieces to lessen a future attack. However the disadvantages are obvious as white's b pawn has now been converted to a c pawn increasing white's centeral majority.
13,bxc3,b2c3,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4p3/2p5/3PP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,A critical point in the opening. Black has allowed white to obtain a large central space advantage and with 3 minor pieces on the board he should be looking to trade off pieces to lessen a future attack of white's. This is exactly what this move and Bb4  accomplish.
14,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4p3/8/3pP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,A critical point in the opening. Black has allowed white to obtain a large central space advantage and with 3 minor pieces on the board he should be looking to trade off pieces to lessen a future attack of white's. This is exactly what this move and Bb4  accomplish.
15,cxd4,c3d4,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/5N2/P4PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,As mentioned this is played to trade off the minor pieces however after the trade black will be left with a very passive white bishop compared to white's active bishop. Therefore other ways of reaching equality have been tried such as Nc6 9. Bc4 b5! as played by Fischer against Spassky as Bxb5 loses to Qa5 .
16,Bb4+,f8b4,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/4p3/8/1b1PP3/5N2/P4PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 9,As mentioned this is played to trade off the minor pieces however after the trade black will be left with a very passive white bishop compared to white's active bishop. Therefore other ways of reaching equality have been tried such as Nc6 9. Bc4 b5! as played by Fischer against Spassky as Bxb5 loses to Qa5 .
17,Bd2,c1d2,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/4p3/8/1b1PP3/5N2/P2B1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 2 9,Although black has suceeded in exchanging two sets of minor pieces white doesn't really mind as his two minor pieces are very well placed.
18,Bxd2+,b4d2,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/5N2/P2b1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 10,Although black has suceeded in exchanging two sets of minor pieces white doesn't really mind as his two minor pieces are very well placed.
19,Qxd2,d1d2,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/5N2/P2Q1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 10,Although black has suceeded in exchanging two sets of minor pieces white doesn't really mind as his two minor pieces are very well placed.
20,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/5N2/P2Q1PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 1 11,"Now that the position has simplified we can analyse the position. There are only two sets of minor pieces on the board but white's bishop can come into play actively unlike black's white bishop while white's knight is also actively placed. White also has a large centeral majority and although the king looks awkward in the center its is perfectly safe. 

Because of his small centeral majority, black's chances are on the queenside with his 2-1 pawn majority on the left wing. However, it will only be towards the endgame when black can exploit this and he must be content with developing and defending himself for now. 

White on the other hand is looking for the d5 advance to create a passed pawn and even if it is not queened it will draw blacks forces away from his king where upon white will lauch an attack."
21,Bc4,f1c4,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4p3/8/2BPP3/5N2/P2Q1PPP/R3K2R b KQ - 2 11,"The best spot for the bishop as it helps the d5 advance. Furthermore, Bd3 and Be2 block the e and d files which white will want to place his rooks on."
22,Nc6,b8c6,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2n1p3/8/2BPP3/5N2/P2Q1PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 3 12,"At first sight this is a simply logical move as it develops the knight to the 'best' square. However, if white can get the d5 advance in black will be forced to lose time moving his knight a second time. Therefore there is alot to be said about Nd7. So, blacks move is completely in contrary with what is required and there is nothing wrong however it should be noted that Nd7 should also be considered as a possible move."
23,O-O,e1g1,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2n1p3/8/2BPP3/5N2/P2Q1PPP/R4RK1 b - - 4 12,White needs his rooks on the open files to break through. Also after the coming d5 exd exd the e-file will be open and white's king could be vulnerable.
24,b6,b7b6,r1bq1rk1/p4ppp/1pn1p3/8/2BPP3/5N2/P2Q1PPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 13,Blacks best move. He prepares the fianchetto which will activate his trapped bishop.
25,Rfe1,f1e1,r1bq1rk1/p4ppp/1pn1p3/8/2BPP3/5N2/P2Q1PPP/R3R1K1 b - - 1 13,"Whites rooks mobolise as quickly as possible. Another possible move is Rfd1 when the a-rook goes to c1 however the prospects for the e-file opening are very good. Furthermore, white needs a protector of e4 as after Bb7 black might have nasty discoveries on the unprotected pawn."
