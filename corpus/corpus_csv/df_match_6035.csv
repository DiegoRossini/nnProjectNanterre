Lagraves move stops the a - pawns advance and prevents the b - pawn going to the b4 square. Polgar wants to move the knight to play f5 we probably should be trying to start a kingside attack. In this fianchetto variation it seems that white is going after the queen side and we should be going after the kingside. I'm not sure we should have played c6 earlier. If you consider the direction of the pawns ours are pointing kingside. We probably should have gone with Polgar's move."
