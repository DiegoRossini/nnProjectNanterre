5,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/p1pppppp/1p3n2/8/2PP4/7P/PP2PPP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,Moving the bishop here might lead to either trading it for the knight or wasting tempos moving the bishop from pawn attack by h6 and g5. Worst situation is that the bishop might get shut off from the fight after black plays d6.
