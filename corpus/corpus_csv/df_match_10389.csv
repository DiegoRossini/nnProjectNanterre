1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"As round 3 of the 2007 Alabama State Championship begins, I am confronted by a kid whom I've met once. A class B friend of mine tells me he is severely under rated, as he has just begun playing. Great, I tell myself - this may be a little challenging. In the game, I get so wrapped up in winning the exchange that I ultimately lose the game. They say that annotating your losses is cathardic. I hope so - this is gonna be a little painful. No excuses here, I just flat get out played. So much for running the table in this tourney.....White opens with my personal favorite, 1.d4. FYI - this kid went on to win the Reserve section."

4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,!? Intersting. I was expecting 3. c4. White gets his LSB active.

6,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2pp4/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,?! Somewhat akin to a Queen's Gambit with colors reversed. I'm trying to clear room for my Nb8 while introducing the Qa5  threat.

13,Be2,f1e2,r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/3p4/2pP2b1/2P1PN2/PPQNBPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 5 7,! Argh. I didn't see this coming. White thretaens to dominate the center.

17,O-O,e1g1,r2qkb1r/p4ppp/2n1pn2/1p1p4/2pPP1b1/2P2N2/PPQNBPPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 1 9,Kudos to my opponent for exhibiting good restraint. There is no hurry to play e5 yet. Better to secure his king and get another gun into the fight.

I have delusional fantasies of controlling f4, and white turns up the heat immediately. His advantages start multiplying exponentially. Once again, I have listened to the voices in my head that try to convince me that I can channel Mikhail Tal at will."
