The game move 14...Qf6 was not well regarded by my opponent in our post game discussions.  Nevertheless, despite Jan's protestations to the contrary, I think the move is playable and not very damaging to Black's position.  There is coverage of 14...Qf6 in Victor Bologan's on page 282 of the New in Chess publication ""Bologan's Ruy Lopez"", which is a Black side repertoire book.  However there is noner in David Vigorito's somewhat older ""Understanding the Marshall Attack"" (2010).  If you ever wonder who needs a good database you have an answer.  My guess for a good alternative to 14...Qf6 would lead to 14...Rfe8 which John Nunn and Tim Harding analyze to a ""drawn"" ending in their seminal ""The Marshall Attack"" (Batsford, 1990) on page 108.  Again no coverage of 14...Qf6. Nunn-Harding state 14..Qd7 is bad based on Smagin - Geller, Moscow GMA 1989.  I did no research to see if their assessment has been overturned.  A point ripe for home analysis!"
