20,c6,c7c6,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2pp1n2/4p3/2P1P3/2B2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 w - - 0 11,At this pont i think I have the upper hand. My main thoughts at this point were to smash my way through the h3 pawn. I intended it to happen very soon but I did not want to make a single mistake so spent a few moves removing all my weakness.

I also see the white knight moving to g4 after i move bxh3. This would attack my bishop and open then queens path to move onto the kings side. h6 prevents this.
27,a5,a4a5,r4rk1/pp1q1pp1/2ppbn1p/P3p3/2P1P3/1PB2N1P/2P2PP1/R2QR1K1 b - - 0 14,I don't know what white was doing here but I was thankful for it.

I was really pleased with my flat pawn wall holding up everything. The wall was controlling key squares and could not be broken up as white had a locked pawn and a doubled pawn.
32,Qc7,d7c7,3r1rk1/p1q2pp1/Ppppbn1p/4p3/2P1P3/1PB1RN1P/2P2PP1/R2Q2K1 w - - 2 17,"I wanted to throw  a curve ball at white now so move.,,"

If white moves his g pawn out to kick me off it leaves his h pawn very vunerable. My main thought was that he has to move his queen, now giving me a bishop and a knight attack on the h pawn. (Why it was so important for me to free my knight of defensive duty)."
