1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"White playes e4. I play e4 myself too. The downside of e4 is that it allows black to decide what kind of game it's gonna be. King's pawn game e5, pirc d6 french e6 caro kann c6 sicilian c5 scandinavian d5 and there are even more variations. There are a lot less variations in other openings white can play."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"But I play this move, e5."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Attacks the pawn and develops a piece.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,Protects the pawn and develops a piece. d6 is sometimes played but I don't like it becuase it locks the bsb.
5,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,This is the italian game and I play it myself too.
6,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,"Most common reply. Now Nxe5 doesn't work, because of 4Nxe5 Nxe5 5 d4 Nxc4 and white simply lost a piece."
7,d4,d2d4,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2BPP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,"This is not played a lot, it simply loses a pawn. However because I was not concentrated enough I chose the wrong piece to hit the pawn."
8,Nxd4,c6d4,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/2BnP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,Taking with either the pawn or the bishop (I prefer the bishop) is much better
9,Ng5,f3g5,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p1N1/2BnP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,But white didn't see he could simply play Nxe5 here which has the same effect as this. A bit of luck on my side.
10,Ne6,d4e6,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/4n3/2b1p1N1/2B1P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 6,Nh6 is also possible here but at least it forces white to do something because white's knight is attacked twice and only defended once with the queen.
11,Bxe6,c4e6,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/4B3/2b1p1N1/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,White decided to trade his bishop for the knight.
12,fxe6,f7e6,r1bqk1nr/pppp2pp/4p3/2b1p1N1/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"Always capture to the center, and now I have a half open c-file. If I took with the d-pawn then white could have traded queens and I couldn't castle anymore."
13,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk1nr/pppp2pp/4p3/2b1p1N1/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 7,White could have played Qh5 but the threat looks to have no use. 7Qh5+ g6 8Qf3 Nf6.
14,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/pppp2pp/4pn2/2b1p1N1/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 8,"Develops the knight, prepares castling and stops any annoying queen move."
15,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqk2r/pppp2pp/4pn2/2b1p1N1/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 3 8,White develops his knight
16,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pppp2pp/4pn2/2b1p1N1/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 4 9,I castle to safety.
17,Na4,c3a4,r1bq1rk1/pppp2pp/4pn2/2b1p1N1/N3P3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 5 9,"White moves the same piece twice. Better was to develop the bishop, maybe with fianchetto on b2."
18,Be7,c5e7,r1bq1rk1/ppppb1pp/4pn2/4p1N1/N3P3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 6 10,"I do not want to trade bishops, I think this bishop is best placed here."
19,Re1,f1e1,r1bq1rk1/ppppb1pp/4pn2/4p1N1/N3P3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - - 7 10,Better is probably to develop the bishop.
20,b6,b7b6,r1bq1rk1/p1ppb1pp/1p2pn2/4p1N1/N3P3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 0 11,"Looking back I think c6 and then d5 may have been better, but I was afraid it was too slow."
