1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"Hi again everyone!

It is like two buses.  You wait a long while for one and then two turn up at the same time.  It is a similar tale with my annotations.  I am annotating this one hot on the heels of my last one because the denouement had a similar ring to that of my last one.  Bwaa copped Old Matey as a result of his back row not being adequately covered and the same sort of thing has happened here.  So, how did all this happen?  Well, we start with 1. Nf3 - the Reti Opening."
