1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is the first time I have played macduffee, but I usually answer d4 with ...Nf6 to keep my central pawn options open."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"An interesting move that leads me to think a Colle is coming. I used to play the Colle quite a bit as white, but more recently have moved to the Scotch Game. It would be fun to play the black side of a Colle."
3,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"An interesting move that leads me to think a Colle is coming. I used to play the Colle quite a bit as white, but more recently have moved to the Scotch Game. It would be fun to play the black side of a Colle."
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Keeping my options open should white play c4 and transpose into more normal lines.
5,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"And we are back at a more normal position. I can play ...Bb5  if I want to head into a Bogo-Indian, but that is not what I play with black."
6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,I prefer a Queen's Gambit Declined.
7,c5,c4c5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/2Pp4/3P4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"And now we are out of book. This can't be a good move theoretically, but as a surprise tactic, it may be playable. It certainly caught me by surprise."
8,b6,b7b6,rnbqkb1r/p1p2ppp/1p2pn2/2Pp4/3P4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"Threatening to win a pawn with ...bxc5 and ready to meet cxb6 with axb6, opening the a file for my rook."
9,b4,b2b4,rnbqkb1r/p1p2ppp/1p2pn2/2Pp4/1P1P4/4P3/P4PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,But white wants to bolster his pawn on c5.
10,a5,a7a5,rnbqkb1r/2p2ppp/1p2pn2/p1Pp4/1P1P4/4P3/P4PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,So I attack the defender.
11,b5,b4b5,rnbqkb1r/2p2ppp/1p2pn2/pPPp4/3P4/4P3/P4PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,"This drops a pawn, but white seems more interested in gaining queenside space."
12,bxc5,b6c5,rnbqkb1r/2p2ppp/4pn2/pPpp4/3P4/4P3/P4PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,"Finally developing a piece, but I'm not sure what this accomplishes. Maybe looking to trade on f8 if black plays ...cxd4, but that trade doesn't really do anything for white."
13,Ba3,c1a3,rnbqkb1r/2p2ppp/4pn2/pPpp4/3P4/B3P3/P4PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 7,"Finally developing a piece, but I'm not sure what this accomplishes. Maybe looking to trade on f8 if black plays ...cxd4, but that trade doesn't really do anything for white."
14,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkb1r/2p2ppp/4pn2/pP1p4/3p4/B3P3/P4PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 8,So I will take another pawn.
15,Bxf8,a3f8,rnbqkB1r/2p2ppp/4pn2/pP1p4/3p4/4P3/P4PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 8,"And now black can castle by hand with ...Ke7, ...Re8, ...Kf8. But for the time being, the king is safe where he is."
16,Rxf8,h8f8,rnbqkr2/2p2ppp/4pn2/pP1p4/3p4/4P3/P4PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQq - 0 9,"And now black can castle by hand with ...Ke7, ...Re8, ...Kf8. But for the time being, the king is safe where he is."
17,exd4,e3d4,rnbqkr2/2p2ppp/4pn2/pP1p4/3P4/8/P4PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQq - 0 9,"Getting back one of the pawns, but I don't see that white has enough compensation for his sacrificed pawn."
18,c6,c7c6,rnbqkr2/5ppp/2p1pn2/pP1p4/3P4/8/P4PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQq - 0 10,"Hoping for bxc6, when I can recapture with the knight and increase my lead in development."
19,bxc6,b5c6,rnbqkr2/5ppp/2P1pn2/p2p4/3P4/8/P4PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQq - 0 10,And white obliges.
20,Nxc6,b8c6,r1bqkr2/5ppp/2n1pn2/p2p4/3P4/8/P4PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQq - 0 11,"After 10 moves we can take stock of the opening. Black is up a pawn and has both knights developed. The only piece white has that isn't on its starting square is the d4 pawn. If this was a boxing match, white would get a standing eight count."
21,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkr2/5ppp/2n1pn2/pB1p4/3P4/8/P4PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQq - 1 11,Developing a piece with an attack. Maybe this will be a game after all.
22,Bd7,c8d7,r2qkr2/3b1ppp/2n1pn2/pB1p4/3P4/8/P4PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQq - 2 12,"As I am up a pawn, I will look for ways to trade down to an endgame. This prepares to offer a trade of bishops. Oh yeah, and it breaks the pin :)"
23,Nf3,g1f3,r2qkr2/3b1ppp/2n1pn2/pB1p4/3P4/5N2/P4PPP/RN1QK2R b KQq - 3 12,Nice developing move that prepares castling.
