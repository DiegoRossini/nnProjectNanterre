1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This was a blitz game played on Gameknot. White opened with 1.e4 and instead of my favorite response 1... c5 I played 1...e5 which I have been doing more in Blitz to try and enhance my play of double king pawn openings. We went into a Ruy Lopez and White blundered early and resigned after the 8th move.
