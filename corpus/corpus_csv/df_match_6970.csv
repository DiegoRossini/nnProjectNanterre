8,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/5b2/3PN3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,This is the standard reply forcing his knight to flee.  Instead he surprised me by comprimising his kingside on the next move
9,f3,f2f3,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/5b2/3PN3/5P2/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,His h4-e1 diagonal is exposed.  But there are no immediate attacks.
10,e6,e7e6,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/5b2/3PN3/5P2/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,This allows me to develop my dsb.  If I develop my kings knight instead this would put my Queen on f6 after the knight exchange.  This would be more favorable to white.
