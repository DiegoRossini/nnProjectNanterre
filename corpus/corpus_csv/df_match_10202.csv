1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I altered my annotation a little bit so that people won't try to make corrections (marinvukusic) he must've just thought that I was a weak 1200 and he could say whatever he wanted without much thought, but I'm confident I could beat him and his corrupted analysis if he really analyzes the way he did.  Well almost all of his corrections were wrong. Amazing how I can do this with a simple G/20 game. I had to alter my annotation because I haven't won 5 games yet so I can't comment yet. My ego was offended by misleading comments, please forgive that I had to correct them."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"sicilian defense, my favorite opening to play on either side."
3,c3,c2c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"The alapin variation. In my preparation, this line is always a slight advantage for white, not sure if winning. If you're having trouble against the sicilian, then I recommend this opening as the easiest way of dealing with sicilian. If you like to attack and tactically overwhelm your opponent then play open sicilian. I used to play it and still occasionally do."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,Many consider this to be the sharpest response to the Alapin variation. Almost any 2700  fide GM plays only this line when faced with the Alapin.
5,e5,e4e5,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p1P3/8/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"Any other move gives black, at the least, easy equality."
6,Nd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/8/2pnP3/8/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"Only reasonable move, puts the knight in the center. If Ne4 then d3 traps the knight."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/8/2pnP3/8/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,"Develops, but doesn't commit to immediate d4."
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n5/2pnP3/8/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 3 5,Nice flexible move
9,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n5/2pnP3/2B5/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 4 5,"I don't play d4 early so that I can play this kind of variation, a favorite of GM Tiviakov (fide about 2700)"
10,Nc7,d5c7,r1bqkb1r/ppnppppp/2n5/2p1P3/2B5/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 5 6,Nc7? He may of just wanted to get me out of my repoirtoire but in any case this move is bad and I will take advantage of the terribly placed knight. There was no need to lose a tempo and put it there. Nb6 or e6 would have been better.
11,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkb1r/ppnppppp/2n5/2p1P3/2B5/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 6 6,Before castling I considered Bxf7  but then I realized that it doesn't work(Bxf7 Kx Ng5 Ke8 Qf3 Nxe5) was my analysis after about 10 seconds. So o-o seems best here. If d5 here then exd6 is slight advantage for white.
12,e6,e7e6,r1bqkb1r/ppnp1ppp/2n1p3/2p1P3/2B5/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,If he wanted to play e6 then why put the knight on c7? At least he is doing something.
13,d4,d2d4,r1bqkb1r/ppnp1ppp/2n1p3/2p1P3/2BP4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,Now I complete my center and make plans to complete my development.
14,d5,d7d5,r1bqkb1r/ppn2ppp/2n1p3/2ppP3/2BP4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq d6 0 8,"I suppose he wanted to complicate the game but this further downgrades his position, he's taking away the mobility of the knight on c7. Better was probably cxd4 cxd4 d6. exd6 gave a nice advantage to white also but Bd3 is more precise and actually exploits my advantage faster."
15,Bd3,c4d3,r1bqkb1r/ppn2ppp/2n1p3/2ppP3/3P4/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 8,"I considered taking with exd6 but after about 30 seconds of analysis, Bd3 made sense, puts my bishop on a nice attacking diagonal and lets him self-destruct, since he occupies the d5 square with a pawn now. In general all of my pieces will become better than his. His Knight on c7 and Bishop on c8 and Q on d8 will take many moves to develop effectively if at all. His best piece is his knight on c6 which has a little pressure on d4 and e5."
16,c4,c5c4,r1bqkb1r/ppn2ppp/2n1p3/3pP3/2pP4/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 9,"He's trying to make some progress on his queenside play, but he'll have to face it soon, just how bad the combined moves of Nc7 and d5 really were."
17,Bc2,d3c2,r1bqkb1r/ppn2ppp/2n1p3/3pP3/2pP4/2P2N2/PPB2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 9,Keeps my bishop on the strong diagonal.
18,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/ppn1bppp/2n1p3/3pP3/2pP4/2P2N2/PPB2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 10,"Preparing to play f4 and bring yet another piece into play, my rook. In fact the Ne1-f4 combo is what I need to bring all of my pieces into play."
19,Ne1,f3e1,r1bqk2r/ppn1bppp/2n1p3/3pP3/2pP4/2P5/PPB2PPP/RNBQNRK1 b kq - 3 10,"Preparing to play f4 and bring yet another piece into play, my rook. In fact the Ne1-f4 combo is what I need to bring all of my pieces into play."

Also if black plays f5 here then Rf3-h3 will lead to the crush. If you ever intend to challenge my analysis then please provide a well thought out variation by both sides.
