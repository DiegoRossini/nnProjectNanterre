3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"My friend, Clark showed me this opening and its ferocious power. It is the unusually played Center Game."
4,Qh4,d8h4,rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/3PP2q/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"My opponent, I don't think, knows this opening and decides to attack my e4 pawn and threaten the four move mate, but I will hold him at bay."
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/3PP2q/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 3,I play the wrong Knight for sure because I could have used this move's purpose at a later time. 3.Nc3 exd4 4.Qxd4 and the game is equal.
6,Qxe4+,h4e4,rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/3Pq3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,I try plotting to get my pawn back while I'm being vibrated with these checks.
7,Be3,c1e3,rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/3Pq3/4BN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"This move and 4.Be2 are equal, but I start getting concerned about the future of my d-pawn."
8,Bb4+,f8b4,rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/1b1Pq3/4BN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,I have other uses for the Knight besides getting pinned by the Bishop.
9,c3,c2c3,rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/1b1Pq3/2P1BN2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,I have other uses for the Knight besides getting pinned by the Bishop.
10,Be7,b4e7,rnb1k1nr/ppppbppp/8/4p3/3Pq3/2P1BN2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,"Now, I get my pawn back because he showed too much aggression."
11,Nxe5,f3e5,rnb1k1nr/ppppbppp/8/4N3/3Pq3/2P1B3/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"I just about had it with his Queen invading my position, so I attempt to ward him away."
12,Qf5,e4f5,rnb1k1nr/ppppbppp/8/4Nq2/3P4/2P1B3/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,"I just about had it with his Queen invading my position, so I attempt to ward him away."
13,Bd3,f1d3,rnb1k1nr/ppppbppp/8/4Nq2/3P4/2PBB3/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 2 7,"Now that I hindered his developement, I can now finish mine."

15,Qf3,d1f3,rnb1k1nr/ppppbppp/4q3/4N3/3P4/2PBBQ2/PP3PPP/RN2K2R b KQkq - 4 8,"After moving there, I start thinking about 8.Nd2 instead."
16,Nh6,g8h6,rnb1k2r/ppppbppp/4q2n/4N3/3P4/2PBBQ2/PP3PPP/RN2K2R w KQkq - 5 9,"Inaccurate. If I were Black, I would have played 8...Nf6, or Nc6."
17,Bxh6,e3h6,rnb1k2r/ppppbppp/4q2B/4N3/3P4/2PB1Q2/PP3PPP/RN2K2R b KQkq - 0 9,"Inaccurate. Better was either a developing move (preferrably 9.Nd2), or castling."
18,f6,f7f6,rnb1k2r/ppppb1pp/4qp1B/4N3/3P4/2PB1Q2/PP3PPP/RN2K2R w KQkq - 0 10,"I guess he wants me to win an extra point and get chased, but that's fair enough, right?"

23,Bf7,g6f7,rnbk3r/ppppbB1p/4qp1B/4N2Q/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/RN2K2R b KQ - 2 12,Forget about that pawn for now. I will rob Black of his Rook first.
