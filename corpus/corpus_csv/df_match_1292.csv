1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"My traditional style. The good thing about the opening choice is that it very versatile. With all the different openings that you turn into, t can be used against any opponent as you can change your game plan early on. I like to control pace and create slow method games. I too like to be flexible which is another benefit. Early on I spend time learning to avoid traps with it. Now I know them and defend against them well."
