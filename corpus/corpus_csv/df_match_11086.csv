4,Bd6,f8d6,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/3b4/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,Bd6 I don't like this move because it blocks the advance of the d-pawn.
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/3b4/4p3/4PP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 3,Nf3 White develops a knight.

7,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqk1nr/pppp1pp1/3b3p/4p3/2B1PP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,Bc4 White develops a second piece putting pressure on the f7 square and exerting influence in the center.
8,exf4,e5f4,rnbqk1nr/pppp1pp1/3b3p/8/2B1Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,exf4 King's Gambit Accepted.
9,O-O,e1g1,rnbqk1nr/pppp1pp1/3b3p/8/2B1Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 5,0-0 White castles to the kingside putting more pressure on the f7 square.
10,Bc5+,d6c5,rnbqk1nr/pppp1pp1/7p/2b5/2B1Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 6,Bc5  Black is not developing properly but has a king check here.
11,d4,d2d4,rnbqk1nr/pppp1pp1/7p/2b5/2BPPp2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 6,d4 Check refuted.
12,Bb6,c5b6,rnbqk1nr/pppp1pp1/1b5p/8/2BPPp2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 7,Bxd4 White has three pieces developed now as he recaptures a pawn.
13,Bxf4,c1f4,rnbqk1nr/pppp1pp1/1b5p/8/2BPPB2/5N2/PPP3PP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 0 7,Bxd4 White has three pieces developed now as he recaptures a pawn.

16,g4,g5g4,rnbqk1nr/pppp1p2/1b5p/8/2BPP1p1/5N2/PPPB2PP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 0 9,"g4 Black continues pushing the g-pawn and forces the knight to move. Another blunder, perhaps White should have let the pawn take the knight and recapture with the queen putting more pressure on the f7 square."
