1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Someone reminded me it was a while since I did an annotation.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,So I thought I'd do one.
3,Bf4,c1f4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P1B2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 2 2,My opponent plays The London System - very fashionable at the moment.
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p1n2/8/3P1B2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,I was prepared for it - I had seen a few of his games.
5,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p1n2/8/3P1B2/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,I'm not convinced it is that good.
6,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bqkb1r/pppnpppp/3p1n2/8/3P1B2/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,I threaten e7-e5
7,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkb1r/pppnpppp/3p1n2/8/3P1B2/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,"So he stops that, but rules out an attacking formation with Be2 and h2-h4-h5, which I had seen him play in one of his games. I am not sure it is any good, but decided to avoid it just in case."
8,g6,g7g6,r1bqkb1r/pppnpp1p/3p1np1/8/3P1B2/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,now that is ruled out I can safely fianchetto.
9,Be2,f1e2,r1bqkb1r/pppnpp1p/3p1np1/8/3P1B2/4PN2/PPP1BPPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 1 5,He continues to develop.
10,Bg7,f8g7,r1bqk2r/pppnppbp/3p1np1/8/3P1B2/4PN2/PPP1BPPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 2 6,So do I.
11,h3,h2h3,r1bqk2r/pppnppbp/3p1np1/8/3P1B2/4PN1P/PPP1BPP1/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 0 6,He prepares a retreat for his bishop. It is quite usual in this variation.
12,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pppnppbp/3p1np1/8/3P1B2/4PN1P/PPP1BPP1/RN1QK2R w KQ - 1 7,I castle.
13,O-O,e1g1,r1bq1rk1/pppnppbp/3p1np1/8/3P1B2/4PN1P/PPP1BPP1/RN1Q1RK1 b - - 2 7,So does he.
14,Qe8,d8e8,r1b1qrk1/pppnppbp/3p1np1/8/3P1B2/4PN1P/PPP1BPP1/RN1Q1RK1 w - - 3 8,I threaten e7-e5 again.
15,c3,c2c3,r1b1qrk1/pppnppbp/3p1np1/8/3P1B2/2P1PN1P/PP2BPP1/RN1Q1RK1 b - - 0 8,"After the game I glanced at a book on this opening which thought that c4 was better here, as the Nf3 may have to retreat to d2, and so the Nb1 needs to develop at c3."
16,e5,e7e5,r1b1qrk1/pppn1pbp/3p1np1/4p3/3P1B2/2P1PN1P/PP2BPP1/RN1Q1RK1 w - - 0 9,I carry on with my plan.
17,Bh2,f4h2,r1b1qrk1/pppn1pbp/3p1np1/4p3/3P4/2P1PN1P/PP2BPPB/RN1Q1RK1 b - - 1 9,He retreats.
18,Ne4,f6e4,r1b1qrk1/pppn1pbp/3p2p1/4p3/3Pn3/2P1PN1P/PP2BPPB/RN1Q1RK1 w - - 2 10,"Given the comment in the last note, maybe this is inaccurate too, as it allows an exchange of knights. Qe7 is more usual, but I didn't know that at the time."
19,Nbd2,b1d2,r1b1qrk1/pppn1pbp/3p2p1/4p3/3Pn3/2P1PN1P/PP1NBPPB/R2Q1RK1 b - - 3 10,He develops and challenges my knight.
20,d5,d6d5,r1b1qrk1/pppn1pbp/6p1/3pp3/3Pn3/2P1PN1P/PP1NBPPB/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 11,"Maybe over-ambitious? What do you think dear reader? Previously only Nxd2 had been played, resulting in draws. Fritz seems to prefer Nxd2."
