1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Here's a recent game that has, for now, taken me to the top of D1: probably not for long!  It also helped me to even my score against grietje.

1.d4 continues my policy against higher rated players, which seems to be working OK at present.  I'm generally reserving 1. e4 for lower rated players."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Leading into the Slave or Semi-Slav, one of Black's strongest replies to 1. d4 d5 2. c4"
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Leading into the Slave or Semi-Slav, one of Black's strongest replies to 1. d4 d5 2. c4"
4,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Leading into the Slave or Semi-Slav, one of Black's strongest replies to 1. d4 d5 2. c4"
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"Laying claim to e5 immediately and preparing for early kingside castling.  This seems to be preferred to 3. Nc3, which looks more natural."
6,dxc4,d5c4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/2pP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Taking the gambit pawn.  Black can try to hold on to this or he can return it in the interests of quick piece development.  If he tries to hold on to it, White can waste a lot of time and effort trying to recapture, or he can ignore it and proceed with normal development, but the pawn on c4 can interfere quite a lot."
7,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/2pPP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"Taking advantage of the fact that Black's d-pawn has been diverted to c4.  This is White's most aggressive and consistent move, it seems to me."
8,b5,b7b5,rnbqkbnr/p3pppp/2p5/1p6/2pPP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Black decides to hold on to the pawn.  In the QGA, Black wouldn't already have a pawn on c6, so White would be able to inhibit this move by playing Nc3 before directly attacking the pawn."
9,a4,a2a4,rnbqkbnr/p3pppp/2p5/1p6/P1pPP3/5N2/1P3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,White tries to divert or undermine the defender
10,Bb7,c8b7,rn1qkbnr/pb2pppp/2p5/1p6/P1pPP3/5N2/1P3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,Black develops his bishop rather than be diverted. This os a square with high potential!
11,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qkbnr/pb2pppp/2p5/1p6/P1pPP3/2N2N2/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 6,"Pressing on with the attack on the defender, while developing to a good central square and also defending the e-pawn, should Black release the B on b7 by playing ... c5"
12,a6,a7a6,rn1qkbnr/1b2pppp/p1p5/1p6/P1pPP3/2N2N2/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,reinforcing the defence at the expense of another pawn move
13,b3,b2b3,rn1qkbnr/1b2pppp/p1p5/1p6/P1pPP3/1PN2N2/5PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,Now attacking the spearhead directly
14,cxb3,c4b3,rn1qkbnr/1b2pppp/p1p5/1p6/P2PP3/1pN2N2/5PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,taking the opportunity to swap off the doubled pawn but allowing White to develop his Q to a good square
15,Qxb3,d1b3,rn1qkbnr/1b2pppp/p1p5/1p6/P2PP3/1QN2N2/5PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 8,"finally another piece develops.  Like White's earlier Nc3, this flexible move fulfils a number of objectives: preparing ... c5, ... Rb8, ...e5, ... Ndf6 or ... Ngf6 depending on how the game develops.  Alternatively, the N could go to b6, contesting d5."
16,Nd7,b8d7,r2qkbnr/1b1npppp/p1p5/1p6/P2PP3/1QN2N2/5PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 1 9,"finally another piece develops.

19,O-O,e1g1,r2qkbnr/1b1n1ppp/p1p1p3/1p6/P2PP3/1QNB1N2/5PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 1 10,"pinning the N against the Q and thus more or less forcing Black to play the move he wants to anyway.  This is clearly the most aggressive square for this bishop but it often results in a tame series of swaps.  An alternative strategy would be to develop it quietly on b2, with the longer term potential on the long diagonal if Black castles kingside, which Black doesn't have to do..."
