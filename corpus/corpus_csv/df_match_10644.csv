1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone! Here is an instructive game I played at my local chessclub RSR Ivoren Toren in Rotterdam, the Netherlands (hence the name of this game).

I needed this win to be able to qualify for promotion to the next group and quite coincidentally I got the white pieces against Rampersad. 
A couple of weeks ago I was present when he was analyzing one of his games where he also had the black pieces and they had played the QGD, symmetrical variation, wich ended in a draw. But I had checked out the opening at home and found a small improvement for white, so now it was a good opportunity to show it! Enjoy..."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,At this point ofcourse I was wondering:''Will he play 2...c5?''. I remember the adrenaline pumping trough my body....
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,At this point ofcourse I was wondering:''Will he play 2...c5?''. I remember the adrenaline pumping trough my body....
4,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Yes...ofcourse, like I said, the last game he played with this variation ended in a draw ( against the leading player in our group ), so why not try it again..."
5,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pP4/3P4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,The best move here.
6,Qxd5,d8d5,rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pq4/3P4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Going for the same line he played against Fung*. 
*( M. Fung was the leading player at the moment in our group with a current KNSB rating of 1816. The game I played against him ended in a quick draw.)"
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pq4/3P4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"! Though not really worthy of an exclamation mark, this move is my first improvement. Fung had played 4.Nc3 when the game continued with 4...Qxd4 5.Qxd4 (5.Nf3!) 5....cxd4 6.Nb5 Kd8 6.Nxd4"

9,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/8/3q4/3p4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"This is all known theory ofcourse. Black has two common responses, 5...Qa5 and 5...Qd8. But allready white has won a tempo, since the queen must retreat."
10,Qd8,d5d8,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/8/3p4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,"White has developed both knights, while black has yet to develop a piece!"
11,Nxd4,f3d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/8/3N4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"It's more common to take with the queen here, but I decided I didn't want to swap queens, going for sharp play and avoiding a draw."
12,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/8/3N4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,Black has to start bringing his pieces into action.

17,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/4pn2/6B1/3N4/2NBP3/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 2 9,"Perhaps 11.Nf3 is slightly better here, but I wanted to stop the c6-knight from jumping to b4, since I was planning to move my queen to c2."

27,Rad1,a1d1,2r1k2r/pp1bbppp/1q2pn2/6B1/3P4/P1NB4/1PQ2PPP/3R1RK1 b k - 4 14,!? This pawn sacrifice is just too tempting.
28,Qxd4,b6d4,2r1k2r/pp1bbppp/4pn2/6B1/3q4/P1NB4/1PQ2PPP/3R1RK1 w k - 0 15,"To say this is a blunder goes too far, but I would have considered another move  here. Actually 14...h6!? is the best chance for black here; 15.Be3 O-O with a more or less equal position."
29,Bb5,d3b5,2r1k2r/pp1bbppp/4pn2/1B4B1/3q4/P1N5/1PQ2PPP/3R1RK1 b k - 1 15,"Now white has a clear edge, because the black king is in a vulnerable position, for example 15...Qg4 16.Bxd7  Nxd7 17.Bxe7 Kxe7."
30,Qc5,d4c5,2r1k2r/pp1bbppp/4pn2/1Bq3B1/8/P1N5/1PQ2PPP/3R1RK1 w k - 2 16,Ok...what now? I'm still a pawn down...
31,Bxd7+,b5d7,2r1k2r/pp1Bbppp/4pn2/2q3B1/8/P1N5/1PQ2PPP/3R1RK1 b k - 0 16,"? Computer analysis shows a better alternative here: 16.Bxf6 Bxb5 17.Bxg7 Bxf1 18.Bxh8 wich is winning for white. But hey, my name is not Fritz, so I came up with another plan..."
