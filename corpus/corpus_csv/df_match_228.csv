1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"In this game I played the Marshall Gambit line of the Ruy Lopez. This has been analyzed all over the place. But I like this line and don't get to play it often so I thought I'd write up my thoughts on it as well. I also play what I think is not the currently ""in style"" line so you can catch people unaware (though not my opponent this game, who played quite well except for one little mistake) I hope you enjoy."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Going into the Spanish. Black can go into mainline Spanish with a6 or to the Berlin with Nf6.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Going into the Spanish. Black can go into mainline Spanish with a6 or to the Berlin with Nf6.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,Going into the Spanish. Black can go into mainline Spanish with a6 or to the Berlin with Nf6.
5,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,Going into the Spanish. Black can go into mainline Spanish with a6 or to the Berlin with Nf6.
6,a6,a7a6,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,"And as I don't want to play ""boring"" Berlin games I don't play the Berlin. The line is very popular a high levels but leads to a lot of draws and it isn't that fun to play. I'm also not great at endings...so I try to avoid them."
7,Ba4,b5a4,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,White can take if they like and go into exchange versions or play this.
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,"d6, Nge7 are possible. There are a few other possiblities as well that are not played at the highest level but can work for fun, like f5."
9,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 3 5,An interesting line is 5..Nxe4 6. d4 b5 7. Bb3 d5 8. dxe5. I don't like it as black because the pawn on e5 really cramps blacks position but it is more open and interesting to try if you're interested in that type of position.

11,Re1,f1e1,r1bqk2r/1pppbppp/p1n2n2/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq - 5 6,Once we reach this position I aim for d5 and playing the Marshall.
12,b5,b7b5,r1bqk2r/2ppbppp/p1n2n2/1p2p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq - 0 7,"This move is white's last move to avoid the Marshall by playing 8. h3. h3 seems like it wastes a tempo and provides a target for black to aim at but it also prevents black's knight from coming into g4, which i one of black's ideas after playing d5. h3 then is quite double edged. another possible move that has been tried recently is a4. I have little experience with these types of lines but it also gives both sides chances and high level players often try it. c3 though is the most common move with the obvious idea of playing d4 at the right moment and the less obvious idea of giving the bishop the c2 square should black play Na5 trying to trade for the knight. Mostly commonly black will respond with d6 and there will be a long closed game with both sides having trumps and ideas but needing to be very careful with the other sides pieces. There is a lot of theory in this position if you are interested."

The idea is to give up a pawn for a strong attack on the kingside. White can accept the pawn and try to hold on or play d4 and watch the center dissolve toward an evenish endgame.
17,exd5,e4d5,r1bq1rk1/2p1bppp/p1n2n2/1p1Pp3/8/1BP2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQR1K1 b - - 0 9,Accepting the gambit.

22,Nf6,d5f6,r1bq1rk1/2p1bppp/p4n2/1p2R3/8/1BP5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ2K1 w - - 1 12,"The knight is attacked twice and defended once. c6 is actually a more common move and gives black a slight advantage with compensation for the pawn, but less of an attack. This move seems to be a quiet retreating move but actually have quite a bite to it with the pressure that is about to exist against h2."
23,d4,d2d4,r1bq1rk1/2p1bppp/p4n2/1p2R3/3P4/1BP5/PP3PPP/RNBQ2K1 b - - 0 12,Black is guaranteed to have compensation for the pawn. Maybe more.

28,Nxf2,g4f2,r1bq1rk1/2p2ppp/p2b4/1p6/3P4/1BP4P/PP3nP1/RNBQR1K1 w - - 0 15,"! Sacrificing the knight (kind of).  The other possible move is Qh4, with pressure along the file. If white takes then black will flush the king out and kill them in the open board with good technique."

Black will give up the knight now for both pawns and play for a long term compensation given by 3 connected past pawns and an endgame. Well found by my opponent.

Black is looking for Re8 and getting all the pieces in. Note white's queenside. Totally undeveloped. And not really going anywhere that soon. It's tied up and they need to defend the passed pawns."
