1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This was an open challenge
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I decided to try the Caro Kann which I am not very familiar with
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"advance variation, it looks as though I could be a little cramped here"
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"advance variation, it looks as though I could be a little cramped here"
5,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"advance variation, it looks as though I could be a little cramped here"
6,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pPb2/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"Still well within the database here, though it seems to me that this is a good time to move my lsb as I am looking at e6 and don't want my lsb blocked in"
7,Bf4,c1f4,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pPb2/3P1B2/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 2 4,"This is getting interesting, white has a strong grip on the dark squares on the centre and I have the light ones"
8,e6,e7e6,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3pPb2/3P1B2/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"This is getting interesting, white has a strong grip on the dark squares on the centre and I have the light ones"
9,Nf3,g1f3,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3pPb2/3P1B2/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"This is getting interesting, white has a strong grip on the dark squares on the centre and I have the light ones"
10,Bb4+,f8b4,rn1qk1nr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3pPb2/1b1P1B2/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,This move takes us out of the gameknot database. Whites stranglehold on the dark squares n the centre is going to make my dsb passive for a while
11,c3,c2c3,rn1qk1nr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3pPb2/1b1P1B2/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,This move takes us out of the gameknot database. Whites stranglehold on the dark squares n the centre is going to make my dsb passive for a while

14,Bb6,a5b6,rn1qk1nr/pp3ppp/1bp1p3/3pPb2/1P1P1B2/2P2N2/P4PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,The primary reason I chose this was that if he castled kings side it would be nicely lined up on the king. I'm still not sure if Bc7 would be better?
15,h3,h2h3,rn1qk1nr/pp3ppp/1bp1p3/3pPb2/1P1P1B2/2P2N1P/P4PP1/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,"This move seems to me to be uneccessary, if I were white I would have concentrated on developing"

17,Bg5,f4g5,rn1qk2r/pp2nppp/1bp1p3/3pPbB1/1P1P4/2P2N1P/P4PP1/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 2 9,"Again this doesn't really achieve a lot, the knight isn't really going anywhere. I was expecting him to develop his knight or lsb"
18,a5,a7a5,rn1qk2r/1p2nppp/1bp1p3/p2pPbB1/1P1P4/2P2N1P/P4PP1/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 10,"This may be a little premature, however I wanted to break up his pawn structure a little and try to get my dsb more active"
19,b5,b4b5,rn1qk2r/1p2nppp/1bp1p3/pP1pPbB1/3P4/2P2N1P/P4PP1/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 10,"getting my king safe and avoiding cxb5, Bxb5+ which allows white to develop his lsb with tempo, particularly as that bishop would be tough to extract"
20,O-O,e8g8,rn1q1rk1/1p2nppp/1bp1p3/pP1pPbB1/3P4/2P2N1P/P4PP1/RN1QKB1R w KQ - 1 11,"getting my king safe and avoiding cxb5, Bxb5+ which allows white to develop his lsb with tempo, particularly as that bishop would be tough to extract"

24,h6,h7h6,rn3rk1/1p1qnpp1/1bp1p2p/pP1pPbB1/2PP4/2N2N1P/P4PP1/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 13,This was to give my lsb a hidey hole if it should be needed
