2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I like playing the french a lot, i have very good results with it."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"The advanced variation. Against this particular variation i like playing against, i think that black has very good play by putting pressure in the center with c5, Nc3, Ne7-f5, Qb6, and so on,  having an equilibriated game and a very good initiative."

6,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,The typical french pawn structure
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"The literature recommends here to play c3, defending directly d4 with a pawn, making a more solid structure."
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2ppP3/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,Adding some more pressure to d4
9,Be3,c1e3,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2ppP3/3P4/4BN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 3 5,?! Inaccuracy. I think c3 was better. Be3 doesn´t defend d4 well.
10,Nge7,g8e7,r1bqkb1r/pp2nppp/2n1p3/2ppP3/3P4/4BN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 4 6,With the intention of playing Nf4 adding more pressure on d4 and threatening Nxe3
11,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/pp2nppp/2n1p3/2ppP3/3P4/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 5 6,"?! Again, c3 was better. His center is going to fall soon."
12,Nf5,e7f5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2ppPn2/3P4/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 6 7,?? I can´t figure out what was the plan of the guy at that moment. That move is bad because the knight has to go back after a6. He had to develop his pieces instead.
13,Nb5,c3b5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1p3/1NppPn2/3P4/4BN2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 7 7,?? I can´t figure out what was the plan of the guy at that moment. That move is bad because the knight has to go back after a6. He had to develop his pieces instead.
14,a6,a7a6,r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1n1p3/1NppPn2/3P4/4BN2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,??

17,exd6,e5d6,r1bqk2r/1p3ppp/p1nPp3/2pp1n2/3P4/4BN2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 9,"The guy lost a pawn but i don´t know why. Maybe because he was trying to relieve the pressure on the center, and then equalizing by 10. dxc5, thinking that i couldn´t take the pawn because it was protected by the bishop. But instead he will be punished."

21,fxe3,f2e3,r1b1k2r/1p3ppp/p1nqp3/2Pp4/8/4PN2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 11,"Another line is 11. cxd6 Nxd1 12. Rxd1 Kd7, the black pawn structure is pretty stable and the white passed pawn is hopeless."

23,Qd2,d1d2,r1b1k2r/1p3ppp/p1n1p3/2qp4/8/4PN2/PPPQ2PP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 1 12,With the intention of castle long
24,e5,e6e5,r1b1k2r/1p3ppp/p1n5/2qpp3/8/4PN2/PPPQ2PP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 13,"Controlling the center, and preparing the white squared bishop to enter the action."
