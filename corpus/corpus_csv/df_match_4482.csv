1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I know, I know. My choice. I know this system won't hold against good players, but I have worked a lot on it."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I know, I know. My choice. I know this system won't hold against good players, but I have worked a lot on it."

4,Qxd5,d8d5,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"I know, I know. My choice. I know this system won't hold against good players, but I have worked a lot on it."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"Yes, because the queen must aim to c7, the right place."
6,Qe5+,d5e5,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/4q3/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"Yes, because the queen must aim to c7, the right place."
7,Qe2,d1e2,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/4q3/8/2N5/PPPPQPPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 3 4,"But ok, this is the other good white move I often face. Nc6 is not an option, since after QxQ, QxQ, Nd5 creates problems. The queen can go to a5, but I read and article called ""The Qa5 phallcy"", and I play it only on a determined line, as a way to c7 anyway."
8,Qxe2+,e5e2,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/8/2N5/PPPPqPPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"Said that, the only other option (Qc5 is an ugly place to go) is this, I normally play."
9,Bxe2,f1e2,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/8/2N5/PPPPBPPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 0 5,"Ok, now black is underdeveloped, and it is sadly necessary to play this to control the white knight. But black has no weaknesses, no inmediate threat on him, and should manage."
10,c6,c7c6,rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/8/2N5/PPPPBPPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 0 6,"Ok, now black is underdeveloped, and it is sadly necessary to play this to control the white knight. But black has no weaknesses, no inmediate threat on him, and should manage."
11,Bf3,e2f3,rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/8/2N2B2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 1 6,weird.
12,Bf5,c8f5,rn2kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/5b2/8/2N2B2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 2 7,"Developement with tempo taken, thank you!"
13,d3,d2d3,rn2kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/5b2/8/2NP1B2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 0 7,"...and, more important, white lost the chance to play d4!, with a good space control on the centre.
Now, I normally go on with e5. White attacks it, but my developement movements help defending it, and f6 is possible. 
But this time I wanted to try a new idea."
14,Nf6,g8f6,rn2kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/5b2/8/2NP1B2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 1 8,"He cannot do d4, right? So I prefer developing a piece than creating an outpost (e5) to be attacked by white."
15,Nge2,g1e2,rn2kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/5b2/8/2NP1B2/PPP1NPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 2 8,"It worked. Of course, he is near castling and Re1, now."
16,e5,e7e5,rn2kb1r/pp3ppp/2p2n2/4pb2/8/2NP1B2/PPP1NPPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 0 9,"Throwing away all my nice thoughts. A wise e6 would have been better. Let's say that I wanted to go in troubles by purpose, intending that if white played 9. d4, I would have repied with e4. White must then go 10. g4, Bg6 (mocking at him :-), and white must lose the bishop for a pawn the most. 
It does sound nice, doesn't it?"
17,Ng3,e2g3,rn2kb1r/pp3ppp/2p2n2/4pb2/8/2NP1BN1/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 1 9,"Stable again. He can save his bishop, but he cannot play d4 because he plainly loses it."
18,Bg6,f5g6,rn2kb1r/pp3ppp/2p2nb1/4p3/8/2NP1BN1/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 2 10,"Stable again. He can save his bishop, but he cannot play d4 because he plainly loses it."
19,O-O,e1g1,rn2kb1r/pp3ppp/2p2nb1/4p3/8/2NP1BN1/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 3 10,"Ok, normal. I am two moves away from castling, so let's play for it."
20,Nbd7,b8d7,r3kb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p2nb1/4p3/8/2NP1BN1/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 4 11,Queenside castling? Why not? Because or the lsb? Nooooo... impossible. :-)
21,Re1,f1e1,r3kb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p2nb1/4p3/8/2NP1BN1/PPP2PPP/R1B1R1K1 b kq - 5 11,"Two developement moves that defend e4. Will it be enough? In two moves, a rook will be on e8."

24,Nxe4,f6e4,r3k2r/pp1n1ppp/2pb2b1/4p3/4n3/3P1BN1/PPP2PPP/R1B1R1K1 w kq - 0 13,"Even BxN would have worked, but I didn't want to risk against a bishop pair."

The other option, fxe5, leaves a bad hole on g5 white can exploit. 
It comes that the best move is Bxe5, I realize now."
