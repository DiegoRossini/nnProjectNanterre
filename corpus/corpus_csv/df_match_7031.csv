I thought at the time before this move that if 9...Bxd4 then 10. a3 and I might recapture the bishop with my queen, but then there's Qc5 or Qb6, which will make my position all the more worse. Other moves I considered were Bb5+ and Bd2, but for the latter after 9...Qxd4 I thought of playing Be3, but then there's 10. Qxd1+ Kxd1 Bxe3 fxe3, which isn't any better."
