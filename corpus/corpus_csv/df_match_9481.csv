1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

I played through an unrated game with my mentor, Ionadowman and lost.  Here I was trying out the Vienna against him as this was an old opening and one which I thought I could try out on someone else if it worked out.  Maybe the choice of opening was OK but it was perhaps some injudicious piece placement in the middle game that cost me this game."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,2. Nc3 - The Vienna Game - this move was popular with Austrians in the 18th/19th century - not played very often nowadays.
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,2. Nc3 - The Vienna Game - this move was popular with Austrians in the 18th/19th century - not played very often nowadays.
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,3. f4 - the main line of the Vienna.
5,f4,f2f4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,3. f4 - the main line of the Vienna.
6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3pp3/4PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,6. d4 - deviating from the main line a little but this move used to be popular years ago.  It does have a drawback in that white's queenside pawn structure is about to be busted by a knight exchange on c3.

8,Nxe4,f6e4,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3pP3/4n3/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,6. d4 - deviating from the main line a little but this move used to be popular years ago.  It does have a drawback in that white's queenside pawn structure is about to be busted by a knight exchange on c3.
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3pP3/4n3/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,6. d4 - deviating from the main line a little but this move used to be popular years ago.  It does have a drawback in that white's queenside pawn structure is about to be busted by a knight exchange on c3.

12,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qk2r/ppp1bppp/8/3pPb2/3Pn3/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,"8. Qe2?! - this seemed a reasonable choice from the database.  However, thinking back it was time to break free from it.  8. Bd2 may well have been better as it would have avoided the bust up of the queenside pawns.  

Ion did have this to say in the Chat, however - ""I don't think there's anything wrong with the 6.d4 line. I think you have to count on Black exchanging at c3 - he doesn't particularly want to, but it's the best he's got probably. The pawn formation you get isn't really bad at all. It has its weaknesses (the isolated rook pawn, the doubled c-pawn), but it has its upaide as well. The pawns are ""doubled towards the centre"", your centre is very strong on the dark squares, and the e-pawn (in this game) remains mobile and hard to blockade effectively .""

Yes, this choice may not have been fatal, and it did have it's merits, but it does not pay to make your task harder - this is the one case where following the database (I used the World Database here) is not always a good thing.

So when playing an Expert 350 points north of your rating - keep it simple!"

""I formed the impression that early on your responded maybe too defensively to a number of casual shortrange threats - such as 14.Bb2. But that move wasn't fatal: in fact there were some lines in which you might have played Ba3, forcing the DSBs off, or maybe attacking the f8-rook. """

""But 15.Ne1 was definitely a surprise. I thought I had the better of it after that. I had anticipated something like 15.Nh4 Bxc2 with this possible continuation: 16.Nf5 Bxf5 17.Qxf5 Nxd4! 18.cxd4 Qd2 with a fork against both your bishops. Probably you would get one pawn back, but you would probably have had to rely on a more active game for at least partial compensation for the other pawn deficit. 

Even after 15.Ne1, though, I don't think you were out of it until 18.Qe2. That really was a mistake, though an understandable one. The only other move was 18.Qg3 (Rxf1  19.Kxf1 Rf8  20.Ke2 after which I was still tossing up whether to bring the Q back to d8 (preparing ...Bh4) or the N (preparing ...Ne6).
