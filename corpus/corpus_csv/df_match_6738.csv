1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Operation Joblock has resulted in another Expert Draw for me.   Dongoodman has kindly commented on my previous annotations so I thought it would be nice to challenge him.  The endgame worked out well.  I believed I was able to lock him out so I offered him a draw and he accepted it.  So how did this happen?  We pick up the action on Move 5 where I castled short.  The opening is a Ruy Lopez Exchange Variation."
