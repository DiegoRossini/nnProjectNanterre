Black knight moves again attacking the bishop at a4 whilst the knght at e5 is taken care of by the LB at e6 should he decide to attack.  DB is still waiting to fianchetto and black needs to castle.

17,Nd3,e5d3,r1q1kb1r/pp2pp1p/1np1bnp1/3p4/B2P4/1P1NPQ2/P1P2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 4 9,White decides to move knight back to d3 to protect his d4 pawn from pawn advance on c file which may be coming.
18,Bg7,f8g7,r1q1k2r/pp2ppbp/1np1bnp1/3p4/B2P4/1P1NPQ2/P1P2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 5 10,Black fianchetto's his DB to g7 and this is the final piece to be developed.  Time to castle.
19,Ba3,c1a3,r1q1k2r/pp2ppbp/1np1bnp1/3p4/B2P4/BP1NPQ2/P1P2PPP/RN2K2R b KQkq - 6 10,White moves DB to a3 attacking e7.  Black moves queen to d2 and now black can castle.
20,Qd7,c8d7,r3k2r/pp1qppbp/1np1bnp1/3p4/B2P4/BP1NPQ2/P1P2PPP/RN2K2R w KQkq - 7 11,White moves DB to a3 attacking e7.  Black moves queen to d2 and now black can castle.

Threats are knight at f4 on black's bishop on e6 which is not major.  The queen is at f3 on the a8 diagonal but has a chain of pawns to d5 square.  The bishops are on the a file and DB is aimed at e7 but this is protected by queen at d7.  White king is in the centre still and knight still at b1.
22,O-O,e8g8,r4rk1/pp1qppbp/1np1bnp1/3p4/B2P1N2/BP2PQ2/P1P2PPP/RN2K2R w KQ - 9 12,White moves d knight to f4 and black castles.  I think black's pieces are looking quite good.
