7,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/ppppp2p/5np1/5pB1/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,With the Kingside for Black already so far forward I thought the potential of pinning the Knight was worth while although Black can break this at any time with h6.
8,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppppp1bp/5np1/5pB1/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 2 5,I'm not sure if a fianchetto is normal in the variation but it seems to me Black should be developing his Queenside in the hopes of castling in that direction.
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk2r/ppppp1bp/5np1/5pB1/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 3 5,This move seemed odd to me as well as it blocks the c6 square for the Knight although it does allow the Queen escape room
10,d6,d7d6,rnbqk2r/ppp1p1bp/3p1np1/5pB1/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,This move seemed odd to me as well as it blocks the c6 square for the Knight although it does allow the Queen escape room

12,c6,c7c6,rnbqk2r/pp2p1bp/2pp1np1/5pB1/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,This move seemed odd to me as well as it blocks the c6 square for the Knight although it does allow the Queen escape room
13,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqk2r/pp2p1bp/2pp1np1/5pB1/2PP4/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 7,I totally did not see this one coming but perhaps it is normal for the variation. With the f-pawn so advanced it seems like the b3-g8 long white squared diagonal is ripe for attack
14,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp2p1bp/2pp1np1/5pB1/2PP4/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 2 8,I totally did not see this one coming but perhaps it is normal for the variation. With the f-pawn so advanced it seems like the b3-g8 long white squared diagonal is ripe for attack
15,O-O,e1g1,rnbq1rk1/pp2p1bp/2pp1np1/5pB1/2PP4/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 3 8,Another error I think as it pins the Knight which is Black's best piece at the moment and gives me a pawn in the exchange to follow

21,exf6,e5f6,r1bq1rk1/pp1n2bp/2p2Pp1/5pB1/2P5/2NBP3/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 11,Also possible is 11. Bxf6 Bxf6 12. exf6 Qxf6 but I thought this left Black in a better state of development
