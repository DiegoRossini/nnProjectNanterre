1,b3,b2b3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"White pulls an unorthodox opening, the Greek Attack, Bent Larsen's pet opening (commonly called Larsen's Opening in his honor).  The idea here is to fianchetto the black-square bishop and control the center, somewhat in hypermodern fashion.  Larsen himself used it to try to force an opponent who may not have seen this very much to play on his merits alone, rather than knowledge of openings, and I suspect my opponent may have done the same."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Black chooses not to do something bizarre in response and goes into a normal opening.
3,Bb2,c1b2,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/1P6/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"Based on the first move, there is no reason not to move the bishop there, with the added benefit that it attacks Black's e-pawn."
4,f6,f7f6,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4p3/8/1P6/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Some might try Bd6 to defend the pawn but that traps the white-squared bishop or forces it into a similar fianchetto.
5,g3,g2g3,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4p3/8/1P4P1/PBPPPP1P/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,More with the fianchetto...
6,Bc5,f8c5,rnbqk1nr/pppp2pp/5p2/2b1p3/8/1P4P1/PBPPPP1P/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,Black chooses not to counter the fianchetto (on either side) and is intent on center development rather than flanking.
7,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqk1nr/pppp2pp/5p2/2b1p3/8/1P4P1/PBPPPPBP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 2 4,White follows through.
8,d6,d7d6,rnbqk1nr/ppp3pp/3p1p2/2b1p3/8/1P4P1/PBPPPPBP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,Black now has a nice pawn wedge in the center and defends the bishop as well.
9,h4,h2h4,rnbqk1nr/ppp3pp/3p1p2/2b1p3/7P/1P4P1/PBPPPPB1/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,White continually trying to flank-attack.
10,Be6,c8e6,rn1qk1nr/ppp3pp/3pbp2/2b1p3/7P/1P4P1/PBPPPPB1/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 1 6,This is a decent move - the bishop lies in wait and is a good defender in the middle.
11,a4,a2a4,rn1qk1nr/ppp3pp/3pbp2/2b1p3/P6P/1P4P1/1BPPPPB1/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 0 6,More on the flanks - it makes for a bizarre-looking position.
12,c6,c7c6,rn1qk1nr/pp4pp/2ppbp2/2b1p3/P6P/1P4P1/1BPPPPB1/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 0 7,Black looks to be trying to attack the b5 square.
13,h5,h4h5,rn1qk1nr/pp4pp/2ppbp2/2b1p2P/P7/1P4P1/1BPPPPB1/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 0 7,"Truly bizarre. An isolated h-pawn swerves little purpose other than to get the rook in the fray early, and that doesn't appear to be viable at all here."
14,g5,g7g5,rn1qk1nr/pp5p/2ppbp2/2b1p1pP/P7/1P4P1/1BPPPPB1/RN1QK1NR w KQkq g6 0 8,"Not the best move in the world - Black  is trying to construct a stonewall but he appears to forget about the en passant capture (8. hxg5), which would throw a wrench into his kingside defense."
15,d3,d2d3,rn1qk1nr/pp5p/2ppbp2/2b1p1pP/P7/1P1P2P1/1BP1PPB1/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 0 8,White passes up the en passant to make a foray into the center.
16,Nh6,g8h6,rn1qk2r/pp5p/2ppbp1n/2b1p1pP/P7/1P1P2P1/1BP1PPB1/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 1 9,"A good move, getting the knight into a position by which he begin to harass White's formation."
17,a5,a4a5,rn1qk2r/pp5p/2ppbp1n/P1b1p1pP/8/1P1P2P1/1BP1PPB1/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 0 9,More weird flank moves.  The same goes here as for move 7.
18,b6,b7b6,rn1qk2r/p6p/1pppbp1n/P1b1p1pP/8/1P1P2P1/1BP1PPB1/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 0 10,"Black's got a plan to get his queen out, possibly, and certainly is worried about the isolated pawn on that side.  He is not content to block that one as he's done on the h-file."
19,axb6,a5b6,rn1qk2r/p6p/1Pppbp1n/2b1p1pP/8/1P1P2P1/1BP1PPB1/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 0 10,White gets greedy here and obliges - a6 would have been arguably better.
20,Bxb6,c5b6,rn1qk2r/p6p/1bppbp1n/4p1pP/8/1P1P2P1/1BP1PPB1/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 0 11,"Slightly questionable, as a queen capture would have gotten her involved, but Black continues to play defensive and the move isn't bad."
