1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"After working with flank openings for months, I've started playing e4 with some success. I think the flank opening experience has helped me certainly, but I will be playing e4 for a while."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I really like this move. I prefer aggressive play. It is my favorite response to e4. Unfortunately, I don't quite have it totally worked out yet, as will be shortly witnessed."
3,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"I was hoping he would bring the queen out, more experience there. I hadn't opposed this previously, so needed to referenced the Game Database."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"I was hoping he would bring the queen out, more experience there. I hadn't opposed this previously, so needed to referenced the Game Database."
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"This move seemed interesting. I don't like open e file, but there's some time."
6,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/3P2b1/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"Was a little surprised at this move, this would seem to give me an advantage by allowing LSB development and future castling potential. Hmmm... seems almost to simple."
7,f3,f2f3,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/3P2b1/5P2/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"Paranoid, I rethink my strategy and decide to push a pawn. Disrupts my future castle a bit, but I think I'll be ok."
8,Bf5,g4f5,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P1b2/3P4/5P2/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"Chased the bishop away, which gives me some confidence."
9,Bb5+,f1b5,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/1B1P1b2/3P4/5P2/PPP3PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 5,Wondering if this was premature.
10,Nbd7,b8d7,r2qkb1r/pppnpppp/5n2/1B1P1b2/3P4/5P2/PPP3PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 3 6,"In hindsight, not sure why black didn't respond with ..c6. It would seem the exchanges to follow would lead to a serious black advantage."
11,c4,c2c4,r2qkb1r/pppnpppp/5n2/1B1P1b2/2PP4/5P2/PP4PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 6,Trying to protect d5.
12,e6,e7e6,r2qkb1r/pppn1ppp/4pn2/1B1P1b2/2PP4/5P2/PP4PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 7,And there's the threat.
13,Nc3,b1c3,r2qkb1r/pppn1ppp/4pn2/1B1P1b2/2PP4/2N2P2/PP4PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 7,Additional stress on d5
14,exd5,e6d5,r2qkb1r/pppn1ppp/5n2/1B1p1b2/2PP4/2N2P2/PP4PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 8,"That was mean, he wasn't hurting anyone."
15,cxd5,c4d5,r2qkb1r/pppn1ppp/5n2/1B1P1b2/3P4/2N2P2/PP4PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 8,Glad the knight is in place.
16,a6,a7a6,r2qkb1r/1ppn1ppp/p4n2/1B1P1b2/3P4/2N2P2/PP4PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 9,I've faced this a lot and always wonder what to do. Take the knight? Bring the bishop back home to e2? I am pretty sure anything but a4 is ok.
17,Ba4,b5a4,r2qkb1r/1ppn1ppp/p4n2/3P1b2/B2P4/2N2P2/PP4PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 9,"So I played the move I dislike the most. Frankly, not sure happened here at all. I think maybe this was the morning I was late for work and spilled a cup of coffee on my shirt. Yea, I'm going with that for now."
18,b5,b7b5,r2qkb1r/2pn1ppp/p4n2/1p1P1b2/B2P4/2N2P2/PP4PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 10,<sarcasm>What a surprise move.</sarcasm>
19,Bc2,a4c2,r2qkb1r/2pn1ppp/p4n2/1p1P1b2/3P4/2N2P2/PPB3PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 10,"If I would have pulled the bishop back earlier, I wouldn't have wasted those moves. I considered Bb3, but the bishop just didn't seem happy there. I figured I would force a bishop exchange. His bishop was fairly advanced and mine has been around the board and back, so I thought it might be a good idea. I also thought I had a master plan involving a queen pin in the future."
20,Bxc2,f5c2,r2qkb1r/2pn1ppp/p4n2/1p1P4/3P4/2N2P2/PPb3PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 11,So black takes.
21,Qe2+,d1e2,r2qkb1r/2pn1ppp/p4n2/1p1P4/3P4/2N2P2/PPb1Q1PP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 1 11,"Game losing move. I really thought there was an interesting play here when he pinned my queen, but I simply didn't consider all his defenses."
