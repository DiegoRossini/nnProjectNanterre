The main ideas of this opening are: Black will generally be prepared to relinquish the bishop pair by playing Bxc3. As dynamic compensation, Black often doubles White's c-pawns, which represent a static weakness, and gains play against the central light squares d5 and e4, even in those instances where White is able to recapture with a piece after ...Bxc3. Black will aim to close the position to reduce the scope of White's bishops. To this end, Black must blockade the white pawn centre from advancing and neutralize White's attacking chances on the kingside."
