1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,So he starts with the most popular
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,and I reply with my normal
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"In this case leading to a closed variation of the Sicilian, although sometimes White follows up with Nf3 or Ne2 and following it up with d4, going back into the Open Sicilian"
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,So I keep my options open
5,g3,g2g3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/2N3P1/PPPP1P1P/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"and he confirms a closed Sicilian. An immediate 2. g3 is best met with d5, so 2. Nc3 prevent this"
6,g6,g7g6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/2p5/4P3/2N3P1/PPPP1P1P/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,So I can play this without any fear of him transposing into the Yugoslav attack against the Sicilian Dragon
7,Bg2,f1g2,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/2p5/4P3/2N3P1/PPPP1PBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 4,The natural follow up
8,Bg7,f8g7,r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/2p5/4P3/2N3P1/PPPP1PBP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 2 5,and I do likewise
9,d3,d2d3,r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/2p5/4P3/2NP2P1/PPP2PBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,He develops again
10,e6,e7e6,r1bqk1nr/pp1p1pbp/2n1p1p1/2p5/4P3/2NP2P1/PPP2PBP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,"This is my usual in this variation, planning Ng-e7 and d5, as opposed to the usual plan of playing for b5"
11,Be3,c1e3,r1bqk1nr/pp1p1pbp/2n1p1p1/2p5/4P3/2NPB1P1/PPP2PBP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 1 6,He hits the c pawn
12,b6,b7b6,r1bqk1nr/p2p1pbp/1pn1p1p1/2p5/4P3/2NPB1P1/PPP2PBP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 0 7,"In line with my plan. I was thinking that d5 will now threaten d4 forking Be3 and Nc3. After the game Stuart said that he had had this position before, and black had then played d6, and he had continued as in the game."
13,Qd2,d1d2,r1bqk1nr/p2p1pbp/1pn1p1p1/2p5/4P3/2NPB1P1/PPPQ1PBP/R3K1NR b KQkq - 1 7,Going for a king side attack.
14,Nge7,g8e7,r1bqk2r/p2pnpbp/1pn1p1p1/2p5/4P3/2NPB1P1/PPPQ1PBP/R3K1NR w KQkq - 2 8,So I continue to develop
15,Bh6,e3h6,r1bqk2r/p2pnpbp/1pn1p1pB/2p5/4P3/2NP2P1/PPPQ1PBP/R3K1NR b KQkq - 3 8,He plays very agressively
16,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/p2pnpbp/1pn1p1pB/2p5/4P3/2NP2P1/PPPQ1PBP/R3K1NR w KQ - 4 9,Calmly castling!
17,h4,h2h4,r1bq1rk1/p2pnpbp/1pn1p1pB/2p5/4P2P/2NP2P1/PPPQ1PB1/R3K1NR b KQ - 0 9,"On this the attack. He is already threatening h5, exchanging on g6, exchanging on g7 and Qh6 followed by mate on h7, but there are defences."
18,Bxh6,g7h6,r1bq1rk1/p2pnp1p/1pn1p1pb/2p5/4P2P/2NP2P1/PPPQ1PB1/R3K1NR w KQ - 0 10,So I take
19,Qxh6,d2h6,r1bq1rk1/p2pnp1p/1pn1p1pQ/2p5/4P2P/2NP2P1/PPP2PB1/R3K1NR b KQ - 0 10,He takes back
20,f6,f7f6,r1bq1rk1/p2pn2p/1pn1pppQ/2p5/4P2P/2NP2P1/PPP2PB1/R3K1NR w KQ - 0 11,"Now h5 can be met with g5 and his queen is in risk. I also have the option of Rf7 protecting h7. Also I have a long term plan - now that black squared bishops are exchanged, put all my pawns on white squares and then my bishop can weave in and out of them. Afterwards I found out that this was played in Perez Garcia, Hâ€¦ (2255) vs. Lemmers, Oscar (2385), black won in 61 moves."
