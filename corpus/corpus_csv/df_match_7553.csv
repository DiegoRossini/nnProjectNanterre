Nf3, after which Black's best move is 6...h6, making sure White won't get an easy grip on d5. But why is such a natural retreat frowned upon so severely? It's very common in many other Sicilian lines, where White usually gets good play. The following moves by Black should shed some light on why this move is considered very weak, probably worse is only 6. Nxc6, after which Black gets a very game because he will play d5 in good conditions."
