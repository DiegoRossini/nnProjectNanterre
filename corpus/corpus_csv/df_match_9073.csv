It is very tempting to make this capture and I got suckered into it because it doubled up black's kingside pawns.  May have been OK had a pawn been on f3 and c3 but they ain't there here!  As a result black got a good centre.  Two question marks may seem harsh but I think it is a good idea to give this doubling up idea here the skull and crossbones!
