1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I begin the game with a typical opening e4. At that moment I was getting ready to play the Italian game but black destroyed my plans.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Sycilian defence! c5 begins the opening and black is ment to gt ready to attack on the queen side.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,A most often played move for black's second move after c5. Black is going to play the dragon version of the syclian.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,A most often played move for black's second move after c5. Black is going to play the dragon version of the syclian.
5,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,d4 is a strong move to play in that position. White(me) fights for the centre and usually forces black to exchange.
6,cxd4,c5d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,Black exchanges
7,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"g6 gets the bishop ready to concere the two centre squares, e5 and d4."
8,g6,g7g6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"g6 gets the bishop ready to concere the two centre squares, e5 and d4."
9,Nxc6,d4c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2N3p1/8/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,Since I'm not so strong in that opening I wanted to avoid any problems. Safest way is to exchange the knights.
10,bxc6,b7c6,r1bqkbnr/p2ppp1p/2p3p1/8/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,Black takes the knight with the b pawn to help fight for the centre
11,c3,c2c3,r1bqkbnr/p2ppp1p/2p3p1/8/4P3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,I played c3 to avoid any problems when the black bishop moved to g7. Then the b2 square would be on attack and had to be deffended at all times to later avoid losing the rook.
12,Bg7,f8g7,r1bqk1nr/p2pppbp/2p3p1/8/4P3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,As said before
13,Bd3,f1d3,r1bqk1nr/p2pppbp/2p3p1/8/4P3/2PB4/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 7,Played the bishop to defend the pon before the knight on b1 was activated.
14,d6,d7d6,r1bqk1nr/p3ppbp/2pp2p1/8/4P3/2PB4/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,Prepares black for a later possibility of e5 and opens the line for the bishop.
15,Be3,c1e3,r1bqk1nr/p3ppbp/2pp2p1/8/4P3/2PBB3/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 1 8,"You are propobly thinking, why did I play the bishop on e3 and not on f4? If I played Bf4 black would play d5 and I would have to move i t back anyway. Also I am planing in advance to play f4 and attack alittle bit on the kingside."
16,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/p3ppbp/2pp1np1/8/4P3/2PBB3/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 2 9,This one of my favourite position when I am playing white. I really likemwhen I have the bishop on d3 and the queen on c2. That way I have some attack on the far pon on h7.
17,Nd2,b1d2,r1bqk2r/p3ppbp/2pp1np1/8/4P3/2PBB3/PP1N1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 3 9,This one of my favourite position when I am playing white. I really likemwhen I have the bishop on d3 and the queen on c2. That way I have some attack on the far pon on h7.
18,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/p3ppbp/2pp1np1/8/4P3/2PBB3/PP1N1PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 4 10,This one of my favourite position when I am playing white. I really likemwhen I have the bishop on d3 and the queen on c2. That way I have some attack on the far pon on h7.
19,Qc2,d1c2,r1bq1rk1/p3ppbp/2pp1np1/8/4P3/2PBB3/PPQN1PPP/R3K2R b KQ - 5 10,This one of my favourite position when I am playing white. I really likemwhen I have the bishop on d3 and the queen on c2. That way I have some attack on the far pon on h7.
20,Nd7,f6d7,r1bq1rk1/p2nppbp/2pp2p1/8/4P3/2PBB3/PPQN1PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 6 11,"Completely do not understand that move, but when I come to think about it , I know it had something to do with opening the line for the bishop."
21,f4,f2f4,r1bq1rk1/p2nppbp/2pp2p1/8/4PP2/2PBB3/PPQN2PP/R3K2R b KQ - 0 11,Maybe I came a bit to late with that move but I want to place my knight behing the pon and move forward.
22,e6,e7e6,r1bq1rk1/p2n1pbp/2ppp1p1/8/4PP2/2PBB3/PPQN2PP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 12,"A good and defensive move. Now I have little chance with attacking with only the pons and bishops. I need to get ""reinforcements""."
23,g3,g2g3,r1bq1rk1/p2n1pbp/2ppp1p1/8/4PP2/2PBB1P1/PPQN3P/R3K2R b KQ - 0 12,Hold the entire structure together.
24,Bb7,c8b7,r2q1rk1/pb1n1pbp/2ppp1p1/8/4PP2/2PBB1P1/PPQN3P/R3K2R w KQ - 1 13,As planned.
25,Nf3,d2f3,r2q1rk1/pb1n1pbp/2ppp1p1/8/4PP2/2PBBNP1/PPQ4P/R3K2R b KQ - 2 13,As planned.
26,Nf6,d7f6,r2q1rk1/pb3pbp/2pppnp1/8/4PP2/2PBBNP1/PPQ4P/R3K2R w KQ - 3 14,Useless move. Just couple of moves ago black moved it from that place for no reason and now he is coming back there.
