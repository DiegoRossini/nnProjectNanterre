2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"The idea is to play the Budapest anyway, with e5, and if dxe5, Ng4, exd6, Bxd6, with some developement for the pawn."

5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p1n2/8/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,I'll be able to throw in the Q's exchange... maybe just a plain mistake.
6,e5,e7e5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,I'll be able to throw in the Q's exchange... maybe just a plain mistake.
7,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/3P4/3BPN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,But my opponent blundered like this!
8,e4,e5e4,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/8/3Pp3/3BPN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"Good. At least, I'll spend a tempo for the piece."
9,O-O,e1g1,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/8/3Pp3/3BPN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 5,"Good. At least, I'll spend a tempo for the piece."
10,exd3,e4d3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/8/3P4/3pPN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 6,"? d5 was necessary. Ne5 is less dangerous than c4, Nc3..."
11,Qxd3,d1d3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/8/3P4/3QPN2/PPP2PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 0 6,"? d5 was necessary. Ne5 is less dangerous than c4, Nc3..."

13,b3,b2b3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2p1p/3p1np1/8/3P4/1P1QPN2/P1P2PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 0 7,"Normally, if I plan to castle, my B will be defended, and his won't. So the opposite fianchettoes - as a general principle - are stronger when the K is castled and the B defended. Otherwise, they can be a weakness."
14,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppp2pbp/3p1np1/8/3P4/1P1QPN2/P1P2PPP/RNB2RK1 w kq - 1 8,"Finally I ""saw"" that this move was dued, but now maybe now. Anyway, white was too shy in not taking advantage of e4 at once, and I had to put something in the way."
15,Bb2,c1b2,rnbqk2r/ppp2pbp/3p1np1/8/3P4/1P1QPN2/PBP2PPP/RN3RK1 b kq - 2 8,"Finally I ""saw"" that this move was dued, but now maybe now. Anyway, white was too shy in not taking advantage of e4 at once, and I had to put something in the way."

17,Nbd2,b1d2,rnbqk2r/ppp2pbp/5np1/3p4/3P4/1P1QPN2/PBPN1PPP/R4RK1 b kq - 1 9,"It's true I'm not developing, but I have no hurry since white's has to define his choices for me to react adequately. I didn't want to compromise myself to some Nc6, Qb5 or things like that."
18,Qe7,d8e7,rnb1k2r/ppp1qpbp/5np1/3p4/3P4/1P1QPN2/PBPN1PPP/R4RK1 w kq - 2 10,"I further secured e4, confident in being able to castle the next move or so."

28,Nb4,d5b4,r3k2r/pp1bqpbp/2p3p1/8/1n1PP3/1P1Q4/PB1N1PPP/R4RK1 w kq - 1 15,"If Ba6, NxQ, BxQ, KxB."
29,Qc4,d3c4,r3k2r/pp1bqpbp/2p3p1/8/1nQPP3/1P6/PB1N1PPP/R4RK1 b kq - 2 15,"Difficult to see a a mistake. The Q has only f,g,h3 to go."
