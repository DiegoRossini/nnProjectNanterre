1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was a rubber match against an opponent I had already lost a game to.  I have specialized in the Scandinavian, at about the club player level.  The Scandinavian, also known as the Centre Counter, gives Black the initiative on the first move.  YouTube has videos on the opening."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The signature move.  Black challenges White's e4 pawn, and one of the main lines goes exd, Qxd, and the Black Queen is vulnerable to attack.  I don't like this line and choose the ""Modern Variation"" which gambits the pawn."
3,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,The Modern Variation of the Scandinavian Defense.  Black gains a tempi in development as the White K pawn has moved twice and is now threatened with extinction.
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,The Modern Variation of the Scandinavian Defense.  Black gains a tempi in development as the White K pawn has moved twice and is now threatened with extinction.
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"This is the variation that I like least.  White could also try Nc3, Bb5 or Bc5 and c2-c4 in hopes of holding onto the pawn.  These usually give Black more initiative.  Here, White gives the pawn back and continues his development, also opening lines for the c1 Bishop."
6,Nxd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3n4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"This is what I don't like about this variation.  Black now loses a tempi, especially if the N retreats to f6.  The ""book"" recommends the following move by Black."
7,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3n4/2PP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"This is what I don't like about this variation.  Black now loses a tempi, especially if the N retreats to f6.  The ""book"" recommends the following move by Black."
8,Nb6,d5b6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/1n6/8/2PP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"Now, if c4-c5, then the N gets a fine outpost on d5.  But the Black N on b6 is marginalized, somewhat, and White has a commanding center."
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/1n6/8/2PP4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,"Black wants to develop in a way that also gives a threat, and nullifies the power of the N on f3 because of the pin on the queen."
10,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/1n6/8/2PP2b1/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 3 6,"Black wants to develop in a way that also gives a threat, and nullifies the power of the N on f3 because of the pin on the queen."
11,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/1n6/8/2PP2b1/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 4 6,"White would have been advised to play Be2, breaking the pin and preparing to castle."
12,e6,e7e6,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/1n2p3/8/2PP2b1/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,To free the f8 Bishop and prepare for castling.  Black also eyes the f8-a3 diagonal
