1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,This game shows lots of principles in action I've been teaching my students recently. No real mating threats or strong combinations -- but a game decided by who controls the initiative.

So why did I use the bishop? I got tired of dealing with the pin. And I was wondering how I could get some initiative if I used the knight. 
  - My queen would still need to stay on e2 or f1 to guard the pawn on f2.
  - If the queen's on e2, then the knight's still pinned.
  - My queen and rook are guarding another pawn on e4.
  - I can't play Be3 to block his threats without losing the pawn on e4 (and opening up difficulties with Qxb2).
So I decided to use the bishop. I wondered if he would play Bxh3. I'll play g4 and end up trading two pawns for the bishop, but my king would be wide open. Fortunately, his queen's on the other side of the board."
