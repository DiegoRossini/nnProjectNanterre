1,a4,a2a4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/P7/8/1PPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

This opening is the Meadow Hay Opening and it comes from Easy19's suggestion that I create a themed MT out of this opening.  I ended up playing against a very strong expert in this MT and I seemed to be doing OK.  But then my opponent conjured up Old Matey out of nowhere.  I could have avoided copping this mate but only at the cost of ruinous loss of material.  So, how did this happen?  Firstly I will begin commentary with black's move on Move 4 because that is where the fixed moves end.  The database has completely run out so each player is on their own."
