1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Another installment of the ongoing match between RemohGramps and myself. The title was set when the game began, and it is a reference to the fact that my opponent has yet to win any games against me since our first, which I timed out for personal reasons. He's vowed to keep going until he wins one. This time I'm white and, feeling adventurous, I stray from the epine dorsale and open with 1. d4."

A knight anywhere on the edge of the board only had 4 moves (2 if it's in a corner or 3 if it's next to a corner). In this case, three of the black knight's moves are blocked by black pawns and the fourth, b3, is instant death by axb3. Best might be 6. ... b6 to defend the knight but this allows white to gain a pawn with 7. dxc6, though it's doubtful that white can hold onto that far-flung pawn."
