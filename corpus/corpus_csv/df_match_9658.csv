1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is an attack I use against the Caro-Kann. I found it while surfing the web on chess games. If you google Apocalypse attack, you will find more information on The Kenilworthian: Apocalypse Attack web page. I pick it up because, it takes both the players out of the book moves and I needed a system.  Before playing the apocalypse attack I knew of the Classical, Advance, exchange, etc., and etc. But I like this better! In Euorpe, several grandmasters have played this line in tournaments hence why I also play it"

Playing the caro kann has taught me to play defensively,  forgo castling and staying in the center with my king and teaching me how to move my king as a combative piece! Capablanca and Karpov played this aginst e4."

If you also notice white has broken classical theory, making two pawn and knight moves in first four moves! The knight on e5 is safe. Black cannot play f6 due to: Qh5 ;...g6 and I think you know the rest. Notice the open e file, the diagonal a4 to e8, and the Knight attacking c6, d7, f7, g6, g4."

8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3pN3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,good move. Bad for black is d4
9,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3pN3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,Anything that black plays you ought to play d4. Now if you were to play the classical exchange Caro-Kann and on the fifth move you played nf3 black has the option of playing Bg4 pining it against your queen.
