2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I usually start with an ""open"" opening and this is a typical move my opponent is used to make against 1. e4."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Moving on to French Defence, which is one of my most hated openings. I always seem to fall into trouble in this one."
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Typical play by black. I usually play 3. e5 to avoid the exchange variation, in which I do not see any good attacking possibilities."
5,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,As said.

10,Ne7,g8e7,rnb1kb1r/pp2nppp/1q2p3/2ppP3/3P4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 3 6,"After this move I can develop my light-squared bishop. If vkoval had played 5. ... Nc6, this would not be possible since the d4 pawn would be left unguarded."
