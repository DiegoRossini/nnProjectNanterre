The Yugoslav is a fairly good tool by white against the Dragon variation of the Sicilian defense.  Some notable differences are present here:  Black gained time by deploying the bishop to e7 where the g6 pawn push was unnecessary.  If white exchanges knight for bishop, Black will have a strongly fortified g7 square and the diagonal control sought by the typical fianchetto move.  Also, Black can  defend the d5 pawn without too much trouble.  Opposite castling quite often leads to pawn storms.  Because Black is more secure than in the pure Dragon formations, he has more leeway to start a strong queen-side initiative."

Second, c8 is a great place for a rook.  Third, the knight needs to be developed.  If Qd7, then the b knight must wait for pawn advances or obscure a pawn's cooperation in the initiative."

Black's attack, once begun, is likely to be fast.  White is behind in development and has neglected the typical counterplay.  The only useful motive here is freeing the c knight from the defense of the a pawn.  White has a handful of more useful moves most of which mobilize the kingside."
20,c5,c7c5,rn3rk1/pp2qppp/4bb2/2pp4/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1QPPP/1K1R1B1R w - - 0 11,I partly wonder whether Rc8 first was more accurate.  The queen is not best situated on c5 (should White decide to exchange).

White is in no real jeopardy and has some real tactical threats that can force concessions by black.  White also solved the problem, at least temporarily of the f pawn."

26,fxe6,f7e6,rnr3k1/pp2q1pp/4pb2/1Q1p4/8/2N5/PPP2PPP/1K1R1B1R w - - 0 14,Black not only gets rid of the isolated pawn but secures a fairly strong center too.  This comes at the cost of the bishop pair.
27,Nxd5,c3d5,rnr3k1/pp2q1pp/4pb2/1Q1N4/8/8/PPP2PPP/1K1R1B1R b - - 0 14,I actually kind of like this move.  White gets active play at the rough cost of a pawn.  He also removes the possibility Rxc3 which is fairly strong in Sicilian-like play.
28,exd5,e6d5,rnr3k1/pp2q1pp/5b2/1Q1p4/8/8/PPP2PPP/1K1R1B1R w - - 0 15,Excellent move.

32,Qc7,f7c7,rnr3k1/ppq3pp/5b2/1Q6/8/8/PPP2PPP/1K1R1B1R w - - 3 17,Threatening a mate sequence.
33,Bd3,f1d3,rnr3k1/ppq3pp/5b2/1Q6/8/3B4/PPP2PPP/1K1R3R b - - 4 17,I think this move is good.
34,a6,a7a6,rnr3k1/1pq3pp/p4b2/1Q6/8/3B4/PPP2PPP/1K1R3R w - - 0 18,Time for black to catch up in development and start a minority attack.
