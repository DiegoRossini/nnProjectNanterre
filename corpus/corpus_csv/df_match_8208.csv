1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"Hi everyone!

You may all recall me saying a few months ago that to exchange down into a pure K & P ending a pawn down was scuicide.  Well, my buddy Jim Friar (a very strong expert who has an optimum rating of 2092 and has a victory against an International Master stamped on his Gameknot chessic CV) made me eat some of my words!  Towards the end you will see that Jim deliberately exchanged down into such an ending and won!  How, well you will just have to read on!  I start off with the Reti Opening, 1. Nf3."
