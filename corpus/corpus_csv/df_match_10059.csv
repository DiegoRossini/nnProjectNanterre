1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I had a peak at my opponents past games and seen he played the Sicilian when posed with 1.e4 and I though that it would be an interesting game seeing as I had come off of some nice positions in previous games against the Sicilian. Except against Marin.....that doesn't count :)
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"As expected. Here i was thinking of playing 2.d4 and attempting the morra gambit where white loses material for development after cxd4 3. c3, dxc3 4. Nxc3. However i had never played that gambit before and was unsure where it would lead so played the sounder 2.Nf6."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Sicilian Najdorf Ivkov variation which usually leads to interesting middle games so i have read and so it turns out. Here i was expecting Qa5 which would continue the mainline to which white would respond with Qd2. Also all moves to date are book and on the GK database pretty popular.

14,Ne5,d7e5,r1bqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/4n1B1/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 4 8,"This was a pretty unusual move and i couldn't find a variation on any website when i was doing this annotation to talk about it more. Although it forces the LSB back it has no real benefit as now white can win more territory and gain a tempi from black after Bb3, Nc6 reverting to another line of the Sicilian. Perhaps black should have waited and continued with the mainline so he can achieve more development as at the moment black has an inactive bishop."
15,Bb3,c4b3,r1bqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/4n1B1/3NP3/1BN5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 5 8,"This now makes the bishop more active but also closes the LSBs path, It also pins the knight to the queen these are typical in the sicilian opening, but perhaps something that could be exploited."
16,e6,e7e6,r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/4n1B1/3NP3/1BN5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 9,"This now makes the bishop more active but also closes the LSBs path, It also pins the knight to the queen these are typical in the sicilian opening, but perhaps something that could be exploited."
17,f4,f2f4,r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/4n1B1/3NPP2/1BN5/PPP3PP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 9,A very aggressive response by white taking a stronger stance in the centre of the board and forcing the knight to go on the run.
18,Ng6,e5g6,r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppnn1/6B1/3NPP2/1BN5/PPP3PP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 1 10,(?) I am giving this as Nc6 seems more benficial and continues the strength of the sicilian where this now gives attacking options to white. IMHO white looks slighty stronger after this move.
19,f5,f4f5,r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppnn1/5PB1/3NP3/1BN5/PPP3PP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 10,Continuing the pursuit of the knight to the view white should come out looking as strong as it went in and has the opportunity to exploit blacks 8th move e6.
20,exf5,e6f5,r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2p1nn1/5pB1/3NP3/1BN5/PPP3PP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 11,"The idea behind this is 11...., fxe4 12. Bxf6, gxf6 13. Nxe4, Be7 14. Qf3 giving white a good position although a pawn down, however after blacks next move white has a good advantage and should be able to capitalise."

Applying pressure along the e file with a view to add more pressure to the knight with bishop and queen. Blacks position is soley a defensive counter attacking position so white still has to be careful of the king on g1, as a check on him could hand back an advantage to black, even though white does have the slightest of advantages."

31,Rad1,a1d1,r4rk1/1pqbbppp/p2p1n2/4nP2/3N1B2/1BN5/PPP1Q1PP/3RR1K1 b - - 8 16,(?) This allows a neat combo (reason for Ra-d1 it will become apparent why) which gives white a good attacking option and black a headache! I can see why it was played so black can move Ne5 and protect the bishop. Although i think Bc6 is much better.
