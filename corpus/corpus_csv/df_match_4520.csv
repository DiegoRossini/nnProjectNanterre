I don't like this variation as after 5. Bb3 black can't follow up with the normal na5 due to the hanging pawn on e5. White has played Bxf7+ even, but that's shaky at best."

If 7...exd4 then 8. e5 causes trouble. If 8...ne4 then 9. Bd5! Threatening nxd4 regaining the pawn with lots of threats. If instead 8...ng4 9. Re1 followed by h3 and black is struggling to hold on to everything. Better for black is the game continuation, getting things developed and ignoring free pawns!"

I think I would simplify with Bxc6 qxc6 d5 qd7 then I can head off the inevitable e4 with h3. The sacrifice Bxh3 is ok because I have nh2 holding everything together with two extra pieces.

If black can cause difficulty before they get out, there is hope. I was expecting f4, for that very reason. After 17...f4 18. Bc1 (keeping d2 for the knight) f3! was one idea.
