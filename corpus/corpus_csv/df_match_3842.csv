1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is one game of a team match (the other may be found here: http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/complications?gm=45162 ). I find myself on the receiving end of a King's Gambit, an opening I'm quite fond of with the White pieces despite its instabilities and apparent ""refutations"". My opponent quickly gambits two additional pawns in a manner I've never seen, resulting in my pawns being very overextended but White hard-pressed to actually win them and complete his development. I eventually manage to turn my spatial advantage into a developmental one, and engineer a strong push down the center of the board. Enjoy!"
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The King's Gambit, one of the game's oldest documented openings. No longer very popular at high levels, it nonetheless retains some stalwart Master and Grandmaster supporters. White offers the f-pawn in exchange for a strong center and developmental lead."

4,exf4,e5f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Black accepts the gambit. This is probably the most common response, though many ways of declining it, or offering countergambits, exist, such as 2...Bc5 and 2...d5."
5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 3,"White continues with the Bishop's Gambit, a particularly aggressive line. Slightly more common is 3.Nf3, preventing ...Qh4+, but 4.Kf1 and 5.Nf3, driving the Queen away, is considered fine for White, and his developmental advantage will continue to grow."
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/2B1Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 4,"3...Nf6 is much more common. Instead, Black chooses a waiting move--the Maurian Defense. The Knight may become a target for White's d-pawn, but White may risk overextending."
7,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/2B1Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 4,"The standard continuation is 4.d4, but this is perfectly playable (transposing into more of a King's Knight's Gambit). White prepares to castle and d2-d4 is still an option."
8,g5,g7g5,r1bqkbnr/pppp1p1p/2n5/6p1/2B1Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"Black reinforces f5 and prevents White from castling immediately: 5.O-O g4! 6.Ne1 and White's position is looking ugly. Of course, White can play 6.d4 gxf3 7.Nc3 fxg2 8.Bxf7+, with an attack similar to the Muzio Gambit."
9,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1p1p/2n5/6p1/2BPPp2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,White establishes a strong center and threatens to move on the Black Knight.
10,Bg7,f8g7,r1bqk1nr/pppp1pbp/2n5/6p1/2BPPp2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 6,"Black develops the Bishop to a natural location, leaving e7 open in case he decides to get his Knight over to g6."
11,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqk1nr/pppp1pbp/2n5/6p1/2BPPp2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 6,"White continues development and defends his e-pawn, as e7 could soon host a Black Queen."
12,d6,d7d6,r1bqk1nr/ppp2pbp/2np4/6p1/2BPPp2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"This move gives a position something like the Fischer Defense, freeing the Black LSB and preventing a White Knight from landing at e5."
13,e5,e4e5,r1bqk1nr/ppp2pbp/2np4/4P1p1/2BP1p2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,"?! White wants to press the attack while leaving the a2-g8 diagonal open for his Bishop. This seems premature to me though; he could afford to castle first and get a Rook onto the e-file, making this thrust much more potent."
14,dxe5,d6e5,r1bqk1nr/ppp2pbp/2n5/4p1p1/2BP1p2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"Black invites the trade, since he's already ahead a pawn and if he can remove some of White's pieces from the board, his advanced kingside pawns may be difficult to hold back."
15,Ne2,c3e2,r1bqk1nr/ppp2pbp/2n5/4p1p1/2BP1p2/5N2/PPP1N1PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 8,"??! Apparently White was only bluffing about the trade he offered on e5--now he wastes a move getting his Knight out of harm's way instead of simply retaking. This additional two-pawn gambit does nothing, as far as I can see, to weaken Black's position besides potentially overextending his center, and certainly does not improve White's development. 8.Qe2 might have been a stronger way to decline retaking the pawn right away."

17,Bb5,c4b5,r1bqk1nr/ppp2pbp/2n5/1B4p1/3p1p2/5N2/PPP1N1PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 9,"Seeing his pieces in disarray, White relinquishes pressure on f7 and instead threatens to win the d-pawn."

The d- or g-pawn is forfeit, but Black can afford to give back a little material in exchange for consolidating his position somewhat."
