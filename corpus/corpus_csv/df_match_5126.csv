This is essentially the beginning of the end for black since I pretty much ""drive the bus"" from this point.  White has control of the center, superior development, and greater space (+3 P.C.).  Black has the half-open d file, an entire series of pawn holes (weak-square complex), a compromised king side, and his king is now held in the middle (-2 P.C.) putting White around 5 points ahead (despite what the computer analysis says).  Even counting the material (which is difficult in sacrifice scenarios--I'm about to be down a pawn), White is ahead by around 2 points."
