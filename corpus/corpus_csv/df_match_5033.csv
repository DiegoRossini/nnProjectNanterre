I would have preferred to get the black's lsb out before it, but I think it is a matter of personal choice. The bishop out of the pawn chain gets eventually exchanged, but at a cost for white, if he goes for it, or it keeps controlling the good white diagonal, otherwise. I think it keeps more control of the game, but I know this is not so easy. Can experts say something about this?"

The problem of it is the weakening of black's kingside, if black allows dxe6 - fxe6. Because it seems easy for white exploit the ""hole"" in g6 - but not inmediately. Black has a potential semiopen f file in reutrn. Now, before Nh5, all this must have been calculated, and the games' continuation shows that black went, in fact, for the semiopen f column. I wouldn't, but who am I? And what do experts think?"
