1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"1963, 2 American masters play against each other. I'm not sure which tournament they play in."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Pretty common.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Ruy Lopez. There are many variations including d6, f5 nf6 and bc4. Weinstein responds with this pawn push."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"Ruy Lopez. There are many variations including d6, f5 nf6 and bc4. Weinstein responds with this pawn push."
5,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,"Ruy Lopez. There are many variations including d6, f5 nf6 and bc4. Weinstein responds with this pawn push."
6,a6,a7a6,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,The pawn push is the most common way of meeting the Ruy Lopez. It is known as the Morphy defense and the idea is pretty simple. Since white can't capture the e4 pawn immediately blaack will try to kick off the bishop and play b5 if needed.
7,Ba4,b5a4,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,Ba4 is the retreat variation. It is the most popular variation. The other variation is the exchange variation which is aimed to damage the pawn structure of black but white ends up exchanging his most powerful minor piece for it.
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,These are pretty standard moves. I guess this could be also called the Berlin defense deferred?
9,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 3 5,Black has a choice here. Black can either play 5. ... Nxe4 and play the open variation or Be7 which is the closed variation.
10,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/1pppbppp/p1n2n2/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 4 6,"I forgot about the Marshall counter-attack. Can someone tell me? 

This move Re1 protects the pawn and threaten to grab the e5 pawn with Bxc6 and the Nxe4."
11,Re1,f1e1,r1bqk2r/1pppbppp/p1n2n2/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq - 5 6,"I forgot about the Marshall counter-attack. Can someone tell me? 

This move Re1 protects the pawn and threaten to grab the e5 pawn with Bxc6 and the Nxe4."
12,b5,b7b5,r1bqk2r/2ppbppp/p1n2n2/1p2p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq - 0 7,This move kicks the bishop back.
13,Bb3,a4b3,r1bqk2r/2ppbppp/p1n2n2/1p2p3/4P3/1B3N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq - 1 7,Only move. If FIscher wanted to he could've played Bxb5 but i'm sure that he wouldn't. This square is also a powerful place for the bishop where it strikes f7 and d5.
14,d6,d7d6,r1bqk2r/2p1bppp/p1np1n2/1p2p3/4P3/1B3N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq - 0 8,Protects the pawn if the centre is ripped with d4.
15,c3,c2c3,r1bqk2r/2p1bppp/p1np1n2/1p2p3/4P3/1BP2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq - 0 8,Provides an escape square for the bishop incase off Na5 and reinforces the d4 thrust.
16,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/2p1bppp/p1np1n2/1p2p3/4P3/1BP2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQR1K1 w - - 1 9,Finally black castles.
17,h3,h2h3,r1bq1rk1/2p1bppp/p1np1n2/1p2p3/4P3/1BP2N1P/PP1P1PP1/RNBQR1K1 b - - 0 9,"A silent move. This prevents Bg4. Although the pin isn't too effective, it would discourage d4 because white would have doubled pawns on the f file if he wanted to keep a pawn. It also would damage whites pawn structure."
18,Na5,c6a5,r1bq1rk1/2p1bppp/p2p1n2/np2p3/4P3/1BP2N1P/PP1P1PP1/RNBQR1K1 w - - 1 10,Attack the light squared bishop and prepare for a c5 thrust. Nowadays you usually see black play Nb8 trying to reroute the knight.
19,Bc2,b3c2,r1bq1rk1/2p1bppp/p2p1n2/np2p3/4P3/2P2N1P/PPBP1PP1/RNBQR1K1 b - - 2 10,Only square.
20,c5,c7c5,r1bq1rk1/4bppp/p2p1n2/npp1p3/4P3/2P2N1P/PPBP1PP1/RNBQR1K1 w - - 0 11,Clamps down on the d4 square.
21,d4,d2d4,r1bq1rk1/4bppp/p2p1n2/npp1p3/3PP3/2P2N1P/PPB2PP1/RNBQR1K1 b - - 0 11,Black could play anything. It is msot logical to take with the because black doesn't want to give up a central pawn so early in the game.
22,cxd4,c5d4,r1bq1rk1/4bppp/p2p1n2/np2p3/3pP3/2P2N1P/PPB2PP1/RNBQR1K1 w - - 0 12,Black doesn't want to play exd4 because it's going to leave too many weaknesses and he's going to get crushed.
23,cxd4,c3d4,r1bq1rk1/4bppp/p2p1n2/np2p3/3PP3/5N1P/PPB2PP1/RNBQR1K1 b - - 0 12,Black doesn't want to play exd4 because it's going to leave too many weaknesses and he's going to get crushed.
24,Bb7,c8b7,r2q1rk1/1b2bppp/p2p1n2/np2p3/3PP3/5N1P/PPB2PP1/RNBQR1K1 w - - 1 13,"Weinstein plays this incredible move Bb7. It's temporarily sacrficing a pawn.  If 13. dxe5 dxe5 14. Nxe5 , White is up a pawn temporarily but...  14. ....  Qxd1 15. Rxd1 then Bxe4. Regardless of whichever piece white recapture with on move 15, black will regain the pawn. Fischer however, being the chess master who plays different moves played"
