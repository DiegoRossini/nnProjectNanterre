1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was one of my tournament games.  I am annotating this game not because of the outcome, but because my opponent made a choice that surprised me, and I wanted to explain why sacrificing a full Rook was his best move rather than moving out of check.  I was really HOPING he'd just move out of check!  Read on, and enjoy!"

My experience has been that a weak pawn chain in the end game can often be the difference in winning and losing in a close game.  It's a good idea to look for these opportunities and take them whenever you can.

Should Black choose to exchange pawns with 5... exd4, this would leave him way behind on development, and White still in full control of the center."
