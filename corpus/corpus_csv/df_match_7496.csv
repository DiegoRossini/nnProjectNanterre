I suspected this one was slightly old-fashioned as it's not strictly necessary yet, given that White plans castling Queenside, but White needs to protect c2 and e4 against potential attacks in the myriad variations possible from this sort of position.

White launches his attack before Black can launch his.  It's a classic castled-on-opposite-sides-of-the-board race.  Strategically, this suits both players in the Najdorf: Black hopes to withstand White's attack, which will probably waste pieces and pawns in unsuccessful sacrifices, and then finish White off with a surgical strike at his King.  White hopes to win his Kingside attack, never allowing Black to strike."
