I thought maybe the point of this move was to try hit at the b-pawn, although it can simply advance at the moment if the b-file were to open. Perhaps Black just wants to weaken White's queenside pawns generally."

Qxg6 Qg8 26.Rc2 and now both 26...Bf6 and 26...Bxa3 are good for Black. So it starts off awfully tempting to trade the d4 pawn for the f7 pawn, but Black is not obliged to do that and seems to be fine even if he plays every expected move in the variation. Then I considered 18.Rf2 to double rooks, but if White recaptures on f3 with a rook, a knight capture on d4 becomes bothersome. Then I considered 18.Qd2 to defend the d-pawn, but now ...Bg4 also opens up skewers with ...Bg5. What about 18.h3 which prevents ...Bg4 and could allow White to liquidate the doubled pawn with g3-g4-g5? It leaves the dark squares around the white king weak and White is already missing the DSB. So I ended up playing 18.Rd1, which also defends the d-pawn and is a slower way to double rooks, but it could still be done if desired."

Black's only consistent reply is to give up the two bishops with 19...Bxe2, otherwise I just put the knight back on f3. 20.Ngxe2 will be forced (20.Ncxe2 Qe7), and Black has quite a few options for his 20th move, including 20...Ne6, 20...Qe7, and 20...b6. Those moves are useful at some point no matter what White's 19th move; trying to predict what he will do now, at the expense of the knight, seemed unwise."

It could well be Black has no plans to draw and is using a psychological ploy, but there's no reason the same logic from White's 19th move would not apply on the 21st move."

The queen and the knight on c3 in particular could be put to better use, perhaps the queen on f5 or the knight on a4. A possible point to 23.Qf5 would be dropping it to f2 and reinforce the d-pawn and freeing the e2-knight for another action. If 23.Na4 Black could try to stop the knight from continuing to b6 with 23...Qa5 (24.Nb6 Bd8 and 25.Nd7 Rc8 26.Ne5 fails to 26...Nxd4), but 24.b4, a move that is probably going to be played at some point anyway, would change that. Even from a4, while on the rim, the knight would still freeze Black's queenside pawns. However, it weakens e4."

The good news is, with Black's queen now on e7, I didn't hate ...b6, so moving the knight back felt okay even though it gives up tempi. (But like I said, I began regretting 23.Na4 before Black replied.)"

It would destroy his kingside pawn structure, remove an attacker of d4, and make f5 a nice-looking square for a knight. However, White's pieces are not in very good spots to take advantage of these factors. For instance, the quickest way to get a knight to f5 is to advance the g-pawn (allowing Ne2-g3-f5), but the half-open g-file gives Black counterplay against that pawn. Black also keeps his counterplay down the b-file. Trying to set up the sacrifice with 25.Qd2 was also considered but found wanting and Black could also reply 25...Bg5. White just doesn't have a strong enough position to sacrifice material."
