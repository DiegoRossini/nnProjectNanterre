Black's pieces are better coordinated than White's, and Black has a lead in development. Plus it appears that Black will be able to maintain the extra pawn for the moment. I don't like the computer's recommendation of 10...Be6, as it puts it in a precarious position. If 11. d5, Ne5 will suffice, but if 10.gxf4, Black has nothing better than 10...d5, which gives white a protected passed e-pawn."
