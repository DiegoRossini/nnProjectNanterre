8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/4pQ2/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 4 5,Hopewell blocks by moving out his other knight.  This is also a good move because he continues to develop his pieces...and he can move the knight to d4 to threaten my queen.
9,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/4pQ2/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 5 5,I pose a double threat on the pawn and also prevent knight to d4 without causing a knight exchange.
10,d5,d7d5,r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1n2n2/3ppQ2/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 6,EXCELLENT MOVE by Hopewell!  This move threatens my queen with his bishop (revealed check) and threatens my bishop at the same time.  This is going to cost me a three point lead and a major piece.  Hard to swallow--but I must move the queen...and lose the bishop.
