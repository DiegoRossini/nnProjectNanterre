2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I reply normally - I don't play any openings - my favourite is 1. d5 for white - I rely on tactics to win the game.

5,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"This; I believe, is the scotch. I have no further replies than exd4."
6,exd4,e5d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Now, I expected for my opponent to take the pawn, however, he did not."
7,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"Probably attacking f7; I do not see this move as a beginner's move; rather, a sensible one."
8,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b5/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,I protect my d4 pawn and develop my bishop.

10,dxc3,d4c3,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b5/2B1P3/2p2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,... not knowing that I was to fall for a beginner's (?) trap.
11,Bxf7+,c4f7,r1bqk1nr/pppp1Bpp/2n5/2b5/4P3/2p2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"Not taking the bishop would be awkward, but taking the bishop isn't much better."
12,Kxf7,e8f7,r1bq2nr/pppp1kpp/2n5/2b5/4P3/2p2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 0 7,Leaving d5 a forking square.
13,Qd5+,d1d5,r1bq2nr/pppp1kpp/2n5/2bQ4/4P3/2p2N2/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 1 7,This forks the unprotected bishop on c5.

17,Bxb2,c1b2,r1bqk1nr/pppp2pp/2n5/2Q5/4P3/5N2/PB3PPP/RN2K2R b KQ - 0 9,"The bishop takes its long laser aim at g7. Is this position in any way better for white - this disables my ability to castle, but is this strictly better for white? Black is still a pawn up. Take a moment to look at this position."
18,d6,d7d6,r1bqk1nr/ppp3pp/2np4/2Q5/4P3/5N2/PB3PPP/RN2K2R w KQ - 0 10,Chasing away the queen and opening the lines for my bishop - note that Bxg7 is irrelevant as the queen is attacked.
19,Qd5,c5d5,r1bqk1nr/ppp3pp/2np4/3Q4/4P3/5N2/PB3PPP/RN2K2R b KQ - 1 10,"The threat on g7 is renewed. Note that after 10. Qh5+?! g6 the queen is attacked, thus the rook on h8 is safe."
