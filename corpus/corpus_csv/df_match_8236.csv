1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

I try again to get piece activity, it lasts a while but alas I could not maintain it.  A dubious pawn push on my part results in me getting tied up in knots yet again.  Freddy wins 2 pawns and forces liquidation into a lost K & P ending while maintaining his 2 pawn advantage.  I start with e4 and Freddy springs another favourite response of his, the Alekhine's Defense."
