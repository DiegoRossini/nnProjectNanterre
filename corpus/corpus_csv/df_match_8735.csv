Experts seem to agree this is not black's strongest line. Even Bird himself lost more games than his combined wins and draws playing this line. On the up-side, I don't have much in the way of material on this, so I'm already feeling my way through the opening."

White loses a tempo, but then black must retreat or advance his bishop, also losing a tempo. White cannot conveniently support the pawn at e5 without disrupting his castle or first removing the black pawn from d4, so the white pawn on e5 seems to be a little fragile out there so early."
