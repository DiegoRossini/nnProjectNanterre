7,Be2,f1e2,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 5 4,"Nothing *wrong* with this move, but it doesn't really take the game to black the way the other lines do."
8,d5,d7d5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3pp3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"It's just my preference, but if my opponent is going to play passively, that's every invitation for me to come out aggressively.  Why not be the one controlling the action; after all, attacking is a lot easier than finding the right defense!"
9,exd5,e4d5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3Pp3/8/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"Understandably, not wishing to allow d4."
10,Nxd5,f6d5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/3np3/8/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,The only logical move.
11,Nxd5,c3d5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/3Np3/8/5N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"Unnecessarily trading pieces, where black's d5 knight will be replaced by his queen.  Not necessarily fatal, of course, but any number of moves, such as 0-0, d3, or Bb5 (finding a better square for the e2 bishop) look better."
12,Qxd5,d8d5,r1b1kb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/3qp3/8/5N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"After this recapture, black may already be slightly better."
13,O-O,e1g1,r1b1kb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/3qp3/8/5N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 7,"While d3 should also be considered here, as it prevents black from playing e4, 0-0 looks at least just as good to me."
14,Be7,f8e7,r1b1k2r/ppp1bppp/2n5/3qp3/8/5N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 8,"I considered e4 for some time here, as it seems like it can't possibly be bad to boot the knight to e1.  But after that, black lacks a good follow-up, and white's eventual d3 will give the knight new life."
15,b3,b2b3,r1b1k2r/ppp1bppp/2n5/3qp3/8/1P3N2/P1PPBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,"?!  But if white plays b3 now, black's e4 will carry a much stronger punch.  The open diagonal to the a1 rook becomes a weakness, as either the black queen or e7 bishop can strike at it, ""forcing"" white to play c3, making a potential d3 much less effective."
16,e4,e5e4,r1b1k2r/ppp1bppp/2n5/3q4/4p3/1P3N2/P1PPBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 9,"The logical move, as discussed last note."
17,Bc4,e2c4,r1b1k2r/ppp1bppp/2n5/3q4/2B1p3/1P3N2/P1PP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 9,"?  On the surface, it appears that white has found a good in-between move.  This should force the black queen away from her powerful position on d5, while the temporary presence of the knight on f3 still guards e5 and d4, preventing the queen from threatening the a1 rook.

But black has a shot."
18,Qh5,d5h5,r1b1k2r/ppp1bppp/2n5/7q/2B1p3/1P3N2/P1PP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 10,"!  This move wins the knight.  The only ""safe"" square for the knight, e1, would cause white to lose his queen thanks to this move.  A couple of small mistakes followed by one tactical oversight puts white at a large disadvantage.  But there is still a lot of chess to be played."
19,Re1,f1e1,r1b1k2r/ppp1bppp/2n5/7q/2B1p3/1P3N2/P1PP1PPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq - 3 10,"An interesting try.  I was expecting Be2, with exf3 being followed by Bxf3, at least chasing the queen and giving white another tempo for his knight.  But the rook's threat down the e-file could turn out to be useful down the line."
20,exf3,e4f3,r1b1k2r/ppp1bppp/2n5/7q/2B5/1P3p2/P1PP1PPP/R1BQR1K1 w kq - 0 11,"Of course, if black doesn't claim his prize now, he won't have an opportunity to."
21,d4,d2d4,r1b1k2r/ppp1bppp/2n5/7q/2BP4/1P3p2/P1P2PPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq - 0 11,"A slightly confusing move to see.  Why play b3 at all if the plan isn't to move the bishop to b2?  Still, black must be careful not to lose his c6 knight the same way white lost the one on f3."
22,Qg6,h5g6,r1b1k2r/ppp1bppp/2n3q1/8/2BP4/1P3p2/P1P2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w kq - 1 12,"?  And here's my first real mistake of the game!  Threatens mate, and if Qxf3, threatens Qxc2, so how can this be bad?  Well, it isn't nearly as good as Qg4, which not only threatens mate, but can meet Qxf3 in any number of ways, and increases the pressure on the newly-far-flung d4 pawn.  White is still losing here, but black could have made this game a lot easier for himself!"
23,Qxf3,d1f3,r1b1k2r/ppp1bppp/2n3q1/8/2BP4/1P3Q2/P1P2PPP/R1B1R1K1 b kq - 0 12,And now it's painfully clear why Qxc2 wasn't a real threat after all; white gets a monster attack on f7 and e7 if the queen leaves the defense of the f7 square!
24,O-O,e8g8,r1b2rk1/ppp1bppp/2n3q1/8/2BP4/1P3Q2/P1P2PPP/R1B1R1K1 w - - 1 13,"No time like the present to free the bishop on e7, get the king to safety, add another defender to f7 and get the rook more active all at once.  This, my friends, is why we castle!"
25,c3,c2c3,r1b2rk1/ppp1bppp/2n3q1/8/2BP4/1PP2Q2/P4PPP/R1B1R1K1 b - - 0 13,"Saves the c-pawn, but also takes the d4 and b4 squares away from black's knight."
