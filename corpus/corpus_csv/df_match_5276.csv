14,c5,c7c5,r1bq1rk1/pp1nbppp/4pn2/2pp2B1/2PP4/2N1PN2/PPQ2PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 0 8,This is best. Black can now recapture with a pawn and leave himself with an isolated QP or recpature with the Knight and concede central control. Perhaps cxd4 is best which leads to a bit of a boring level position. What my opponent replied is the most common reply.
