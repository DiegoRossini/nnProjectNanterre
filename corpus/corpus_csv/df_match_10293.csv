1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is a game between my Dad and me to prepare for the 4th George Washington Open, June 15-17, 2007.  I think we agreed to a gentlemanly draw in the end, though I probably deserved to lose.  I open with e4.  At that time, e4 was scary territory for me (and still is to some extent).  e4 tends to lead to a wide-open game, which is exciting but also nerve-wracking."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Looks like the Sicilian.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"This particular opening sets up for an early castle and uses bishop pressure on the king.  Based on the GK database, this opening appears to do well against the Sicilian."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"Pretty standard, but this favors white at this point."
5,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,Here's the bishop pressure.
6,Qc7,d8c7,r1b1kbnr/ppqppppp/2n5/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,"a6 might be better here except that it allows for the possibility of stacked pawns, which isn't always a disadvantage, depending on how it's played."
7,Bxc6,b5c6,r1b1kbnr/ppqppppp/2B5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,"Absolutely no pressure to capture here.  Yet, somewhat surprisingly, according to the GK database, this capture still favors white."
8,Qxc6,c7c6,r1b1kbnr/pp1ppppp/2q5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"Stacking pawns is usually not good, so this makes sense."
9,d3,d2d3,r1b1kbnr/pp1ppppp/2q5/2p5/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,One can immediately castle or develop at this point.
10,e6,e7e6,r1b1kbnr/pp1p1ppp/2q1p3/2p5/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"The GK database suggests Nf6 here, which Dad does in the next move."
11,O-O,e1g1,r1b1kbnr/pp1p1ppp/2q1p3/2p5/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 6,A relatively early castle.
12,Nf6,g8f6,r1b1kb1r/pp1p1ppp/2q1pn2/2p5/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 7,"At this point, there were only 4 games in the GK database with a slight advantage to white."
13,Bg5,c1g5,r1b1kb1r/pp1p1ppp/2q1pn2/2p3B1/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 3 7,"I'm not sure what I was pressuring, but I guess this doesn't hurt and it forces black to consider the possibility of stacked pawns if nothing is done to back it up."
14,Be7,f8e7,r1b1k2r/pp1pbppp/2q1pn2/2p3B1/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 4 8,I think this is the best response to such an attack.
15,c4,c2c4,r1b1k2r/pp1pbppp/2q1pn2/2p3B1/2P1P3/3P1N2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 0 8,"I've since come to learn that leaving d3 in this position is considered weak, particularly when the queen is forced to defend.  Nb-d2 might have been better.  On the other hand, it blocks up the middle."
16,h6,h7h6,r1b1k2r/pp1pbpp1/2q1pn1p/2p3B1/2P1P3/3P1N2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 0 9,"I tend to do this myself.  Why invite trouble from the bishop?  This weakens the castle, but it's almost a necessity at some point."
17,Be3,g5e3,r1b1k2r/pp1pbpp1/2q1pn1p/2p5/2P1P3/3PBN2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 1 9,Retreat with pressure on c5.
18,b6,b7b6,r1b1k2r/p2pbpp1/1pq1pn1p/2p5/2P1P3/3PBN2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 0 10,A good response to the bishop pressure.
19,Nc3,b1c3,r1b1k2r/p2pbpp1/1pq1pn1p/2p5/2P1P3/2NPBN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 1 10,Developing move.  Now all mid-level pieces are out and the back rank is set up with some flexibility.
20,O-O,e8g8,r1b2rk1/p2pbpp1/1pq1pn1p/2p5/2P1P3/2NPBN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 2 11,"With the open queenside, a short castle seems to make sense."
