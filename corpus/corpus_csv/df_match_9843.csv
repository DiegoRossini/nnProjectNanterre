1,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/2N5/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 1,A passive first move for white.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/2N5/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,This move will probably transpose the opening into an open game.
3,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Nf6 would have been a little more aggressive. After ...Bb4 I could've put pressure on the middle. But instead I decide to keep this calm game as such.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,Nf6 would have been a little more aggressive. After ...Bb4 I could've put pressure on the middle. But instead I decide to keep this calm game as such.
5,d3,d2d3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,White is keeping things very passive here.
6,h6,h7h6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1pp1/2n4p/4p3/4P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Stopping a Knight or Bishop move to g5.
7,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1pp1/2n4p/4p3/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"Usually white puts the pressure on one of black's knights, so I decide to flip it around. I've made two defensive moves so far, time for some offense."
8,Bb4,f8b4,r1bqk1nr/pppp1pp1/2n4p/4p3/1b2P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,"Usually white puts the pressure on one of black's knights, so I decide to flip it around. I've made two defensive moves so far, time for some offense."
9,Bd2,c1d2,r1bqk1nr/pppp1pp1/2n4p/4p3/1b2P3/2NP1N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 3 5,This move opens up my white-squared bishop and is great timing since my black-squared bishop is already in front.
10,d6,d7d6,r1bqk1nr/ppp2pp1/2np3p/4p3/1b2P3/2NP1N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,This move opens up my white-squared bishop and is great timing since my black-squared bishop is already in front.

12,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/ppp2pp1/2np1n1p/4p3/1b2P3/2NP1N1P/PPPB1PP1/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,I decided against the trade here as I felt my bishop's presence and pressure from the queen-side was worth preserving.
13,a3,a2a3,r1bqk2r/ppp2pp1/2np1n1p/4p3/1b2P3/P1NP1N1P/1PPB1PP1/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,I decided against the trade here as I felt my bishop's presence and pressure from the queen-side was worth preserving.
14,Ba5,b4a5,r1bqk2r/ppp2pp1/2np1n1p/b3p3/4P3/P1NP1N1P/1PPB1PP1/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,I decided against the trade here as I felt my bishop's presence and pressure from the queen-side was worth preserving.

16,Bb6,a5b6,r1bqk2r/ppp2pp1/1bnp1n1p/4p3/1P2P3/P1NP1N1P/2PB1PP1/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 9,I felt this pawn move brought white's front line too far forward and I would gain tempo from attacks behind the pawns.

18,Nd4,c6d4,r1bqk2r/ppp2pp1/1b1p1n1p/1P2p3/3nP3/P1NP1N1P/2PB1PP1/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 10,"An even exchange, and I like where my bishop ended up."
19,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqk2r/ppp2pp1/1b1p1n1p/1P2p3/3NP3/P1NP3P/2PB1PP1/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 10,"An even exchange, and I like where my bishop ended up."
20,Bxd4,b6d4,r1bqk2r/ppp2pp1/3p1n1p/1P2p3/3bP3/P1NP3P/2PB1PP1/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 11,"An even exchange, and I like where my bishop ended up."
21,a4,a3a4,r1bqk2r/ppp2pp1/3p1n1p/1P2p3/P2bP3/2NP3P/2PB1PP1/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 11,Losing tempo to protect the b5 pawn.
22,c6,c7c6,r1bqk2r/pp3pp1/2pp1n1p/1P2p3/P2bP3/2NP3P/2PB1PP1/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 12,Opening a lane for my queen.
23,Ra3,a1a3,r1bqk2r/pp3pp1/2pp1n1p/1P2p3/P2bP3/R1NP3P/2PB1PP1/3QKB1R b Kkq - 1 12,White saw the ...Qa5 move so decided to double protect the knight at c3 early.
24,Qb6,d8b6,r1b1k2r/pp3pp1/1qpp1n1p/1P2p3/P2bP3/R1NP3P/2PB1PP1/3QKB1R w Kkq - 2 13,Putting pressure on f2.
25,Qf3,d1f3,r1b1k2r/pp3pp1/1qpp1n1p/1P2p3/P2bP3/R1NP1Q1P/2PB1PP1/4KB1R b Kkq - 3 13,I understand the reasoning to go all the way to f3. More open lines for the queen and leaving a spot for Be2. But I still think Qe2 would have been better. Protecting the bishop at d2 as well as the f2 pawn and keeping closer to the king. White is in defense mode now and needs to overprotect in order to gain a tempo for any kind of counter attack.
26,Be6,c8e6,r3k2r/pp3pp1/1qppbn1p/1P2p3/P2bP3/R1NP1Q1P/2PB1PP1/4KB1R w Kkq - 4 14,My first thought was Qc5 forcing his rook to b3 and then ...Be6 forcing his rook to abandon the knight at c3 losing a minor piece. I then thought I could trap the rook by first doing Be6. After I moved I realized I was better off following my first plan as it gauranteed a minor piece. White is still in big trouble here though.
27,Be3,d2e3,r3k2r/pp3pp1/1qppbn1p/1P2p3/P2bP3/R1NPBQ1P/2P2PP1/4KB1R b Kkq - 5 14,A better move here would have been to retreat the knight to d1. White is desparate and trying to counter attack somehow.
28,Qc5,b6c5,r3k2r/pp3pp1/2ppbn1p/1Pq1p3/P2bP3/R1NPBQ1P/2P2PP1/4KB1R w Kkq - 6 15,Adding more pressure.
29,Bxd4,e3d4,r3k2r/pp3pp1/2ppbn1p/1Pq1p3/P2BP3/R1NP1Q1P/2P2PP1/4KB1R b Kkq - 0 15,White felt trapped here so tried to trade off some pieces. A better move would be Nb1 to protect the rook at a3 and the c3 square.
