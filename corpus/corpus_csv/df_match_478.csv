1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I was a few minutes late for the start.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,I play my usual.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 2,I paused here and eventually played.
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,This
5,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,White gradually steers the game into a mainline Grünfeld Defence.
6,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,I continue to develop.
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,White threatens e2-e4.
8,d5,d7d5,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3p4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,So I switch it to a Grünfeld Defence.
9,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3P4/3P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,And he opts for the exchange variation. I was rather expecting 5. Qb3 Russian System as white has already played Nf3. It is generally thought that an early Nf3 was weak in the Exchange Variation because it allowed Black too much pressure on the centre with ...Bg4.
10,Nxd5,f6d5,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/6p1/3n4/3P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,I take back.
11,e4,e2e4,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/6p1/3n4/3PP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,He seizes the centre.
12,Nxc3,d5c3,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/2n2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,I exchange.
13,bxc3,b2c3,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,He takes back.
14,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 1 8,I castle.
15,Bc4,f1c4,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/6p1/8/2BPP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 2 8,"This is rather unusual with Nf3.  In the late 1970s Karpov, Kasparov and others found different methods to play the Exchange Variation with White, with Nf3, often involving an early Rb1 to remove the rook from the sensitive a1–h8 diagonal, as well as attempting to hinder the development of Black's queenside. Another, relatively recently developed system involves quickly playing Be3, Qd2, and Rc1 or Rd1 to fortify White's centre, remove White's rook from the diagonal, and possibly enable an early d5 push by White."
16,c5,c7c5,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/2p5/2BPP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 9,I hit the centre.
17,h3,h2h3,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/2p5/2BPP3/2P2N1P/P4PP1/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 9,"He prevents the pin by ....Bg4, but at the cost of losing a valuable tempo."
18,Nc6,b8c6,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2n3p1/2p5/2BPP3/2P2N1P/P4PP1/R1BQK2R w KQ - 1 10,"I hit d4 again. I'm now attacking it 4 times, with pawn, knight, bishop and queen. He is only protecting it 3 times."
19,Be3,c1e3,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2n3p1/2p5/2BPP3/2P1BN1P/P4PP1/R2QK2R b KQ - 2 10,So he protects d4 again.
20,cxd4,c5d4,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2n3p1/8/2BpP3/2P1BN1P/P4PP1/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 11,I take.
