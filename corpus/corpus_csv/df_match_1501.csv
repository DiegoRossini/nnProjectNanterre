1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is a short cheeky game in which I blundered but managed to catch out my opponent with a checkmate while still in the opening stage of the game.

I was relying on my opponent wanting to exchange pieces after I lost a piece, and also offered up a somewhat innocent looking exchange.

Enjoy!"

What I learned from this is whatever the stage of the game it is always important to consider the threats and defences of both sides.

I got caught out by some unusual pawn moves but I got my revenge by moving the queen out early and offering up an exchange."
