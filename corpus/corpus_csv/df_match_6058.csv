Here's why: In this early stage in the opening, you don't know what squares will be best for the bishops, and you know the knights are best on c3 & f3. The best squares for the bishops is determined by the pawn structure and the other pieces (especially pawns). So it is best to move the knights out, and see what develops in the pawns and pieces before moving the bishops. It turns out this was not the best square for the bishop. The consequences are evidenced in 2 ways: 1. I forced you to move the bishop a 2nd time, gaining development for me and losing it for you. 2. More important, after your later Qe2, the bishop had very little space to move to, so I cornered and slayed him (poor guy)."

14,Kf8,e8f8,rnbq1k1r/pp2bppp/5n2/1Bpp4/8/2N2N2/PPPPQPPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 4 8,"(!?) So conventional chess theory would say, ""Block the check with the bishop or knight. Don't relinquish the right and privilege of being able to castle."" I've never been one to hold to conventional theory. I am an innovator, always seeking out new ideas. In our previous game*, I stated ""Every principle has some exceptions"". I gave the example of a natural, man made law - to stop at a red light - which most people would violate if given the right circumstance. I made an imaginary scenario of you having an injured loved one in critical condition. There is no ambulance in your town, so you have to drive half an hour to the hospital. You may go through a red light or two. Similarly, chess principles are guidelines only - they should not be adhered to dogmatically. 

Ajay, you may remember, I took several days to make this move, as I suggested to you at the beginning, ""Analyze, Analyze, Analyze!"". So here are my thoughts that brought about this strange move: 

I. The bishop on b5 is restricted. The only square he can go to which ""seems"" safe is a4. I say seems because as we see, it is really deadly for the bishop. Moving to d3 is not safe as 8. ... c4 traps the bishop. 

II. If I block the check with a knight or Bishop, then when I harass the bishop you can get him out of trouble by trading.

III. I can trap the bishop via:

A. 8. ... a6 followed by 9. ... b5 and 10. c4.
B. If 8. a3 a6 9. Ba4 c4 still traps him. This is the line that was played.

IV. Although White gets the 1st move, in this position, he only has 4 development moves, while black has 5 development moves. So Ajay, do you know how to count development moves? If not, send me a note to say you need more info and I will explain. Until then, suffice to say that Black is ahead in development, while white has some compensation due to the Black king's position. I was planning on manually castling via g6, ... Kg7, ... Re8. On one hand. manually castling loses development because instead of 1 move to castle, it takes 4 moves on king-side castling (2 moves for the king, 1 pawn push and the rook move). On the other hand, I was already ahead in development and I was planning on forcing you to lose more development. (See point IV below.) So I felt manually castling was justified. I also had the prospect of winning your bishop (not yet forced). As it turned out I never did manually castle. I always saw a stronger move.

V. White can move his queen to make space for the bishop. Then if 8. ... a6, 9. Be2 (9. Bf1? would further impede his development). If he moves his queen, the queen only has 3 safe squares to go to: d1, f1 & e5 (8. Qe3? d4 forking the queen and knight).

A. If 8. Qd1 a6 9. Be2, you would be even further behind in development. You would only have 3 development moves, while Black has 5, plus it's Black's move, making it 6. 

B. If 8. Qf1 a6 9. Be2, you are even further behind than example A, since your queen blocks you from Kingside castling.

C. If 8. Qe5, (See comment below)"
15,a3,a2a3,rnbq1k1r/pp2bppp/5n2/1Bpp4/8/P1N2N2/1PPPQPPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 0 8,"(?) You might have expected 8. ... a6 9. Ba4 b5 10. Bb3 c4 11. Ba2. While not winning the bishop, this would have seriously impeded your LSB. Yet the line I played was stronger: 8. a6 9. Ba4 c4, the move you stated was a surprise! It's important in chess to look at what I call ""crazy moves"". It's the moves that are ridiculously outlandish, that are frequently the best! For example, in this game: 7. ...Kf8! & 9. ... c4! (especially Kf8).

For more on ""crazy moves"" study the games of masters such as Bobby Fischer and José Raúl Capablanca. To make some of the moves they made, they definitely would have seemed insane. But the analysis that followed proved they were solid moves."
