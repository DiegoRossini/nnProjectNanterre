9,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkbnr/pp1n1ppp/2p5/3pp3/8/3P1NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 5,Completing the setup
10,Ngf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p2n2/3pp3/8/3P1NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 6,Completing the setup
11,Na3,b1a3,r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p2n2/3pp3/8/N2P1NP1/PPP1PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 3 6,? The knight is out of play here and can't return easily because b5 and c4 are guarded. Better would be 6.Nbd2 to prepare 7.e4.
12,Bd6,f8d6,r1bqk2r/pp1n1ppp/2pb1n2/3pp3/8/N2P1NP1/PPP1PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 4 7,This is my setup.
13,c4,c2c4,r1bqk2r/pp1n1ppp/2pb1n2/3pp3/2P5/N2P1NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,I'd like a strong player to comment on whether the e4 break is a better plan here.
14,d4,d5d4,r1bqk2r/pp1n1ppp/2pb1n2/4p3/2Pp4/N2P1NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,"7...dxc4 would open up the center when behind in development, and allowing 8.cxd5 would do the same thing and make the central pawns weak. Now my plan is to castle kingside, play ...Re8, and prepare ...e4."
15,Nc2,a3c2,r1bqk2r/pp1n1ppp/2pb1n2/4p3/2Pp4/3P1NP1/PPN1PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 8,8.Nb1 is better. The knight is dead here.
16,a5,a7a5,r1bqk2r/1p1n1ppp/2pb1n2/p3p3/2Pp4/3P1NP1/PPN1PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 9,This move was played to take b4 away from the c2 knight and prepare a safe square on c5 for the d7 knight. ...Nc5 will allow development of the c8-bishop and support an ...e4 break.
17,Bd2,c1d2,r1bqk2r/1p1n1ppp/2pb1n2/p3p3/2Pp4/3P1NP1/PPNBPPBP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 1 9,Here I was thinking about 10.b4 and concluded that the open files after 10. b4 axb4 N/Bxb4 would favor me.
18,Nc5,d7c5,r1bqk2r/1p3ppp/2pb1n2/p1n1p3/2Pp4/3P1NP1/PPNBPPBP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 2 10,Here I was thinking about 10.b4 and concluded that the open files after 10. b4 axb4 N/Bxb4 would favor me.
19,e3,e2e3,r1bqk2r/1p3ppp/2pb1n2/p1n1p3/2Pp4/3PPNP1/PPNB1PBP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 10,"?! This leaves the d3 pawn en prise, but it also threatens exd4, which in turn threatens dxe5 fork. I spent 15 minutes on this move. I was looking at 10...Nxd3 11. exd4 Nxb2 12. Qc1 (12. Qe2 e4) Nxc4 13. dxe5, and it didn't look good. Then I found 10...Nxd3 11. exd4 e4!? which is unclear. NM Heisman teaches ""always choose unclear over equal so you can learn something."" I chose unclear and won."

24,Bg4,c8g4,r2qk2r/1p3ppp/2pb1n2/p7/2PPp1b1/3n2P1/PPNB1PBP/R2QNRK1 w kq - 2 13,Developing with tempo.

26,Be2,g4e2,r2qk2r/1p3ppp/2pb1n2/p7/2PPp3/3n2P1/PPNBbPBP/RQ2NRK1 w kq - 4 14,Wins the exchange.
27,Nxd3,e1d3,r2qk2r/1p3ppp/2pb1n2/p7/2PPp3/3N2P1/PPNBbPBP/RQ3RK1 b kq - 0 14,? I overlooked White's next move. I thought the attack on c2 would win the exchange.
