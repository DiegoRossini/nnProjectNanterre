1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Good, sharp opening.  WAstes no time setting up a position in the centre.  One of the most standard openings, and one of Bobby Fischer's favourites is the e4.  Grabs space right in the middle, opens up white's LSB and queen."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"So I respond with the Sicilian.  Other possible responses are 2...e5 for a sharp, exciting game, or 2...Nc6.  Still, the Sicilian is one of the more common responses to the king pawn opening."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Now asserting control over the dark squares, supplementing the light square pawn on e4.  Other responses might have been Nc3, which reinforces grab on light square in teh centre.  The pawn is not protected, but since I'm not threatening it, white continues to develop his pieces."
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"I think this is the Taimanov Sicilian, but I'm not sure.  Still, trying to keep it conservative.  Note that my dark bishop is totally hemmed in on this side, so I'll have to fianchetto it.  Still, this is so far, pretty standard play on both sides.  Another response might be 2...Nc6.  Note that 2...Nf6 attacking the pawn would be bad, as 3. e5 has a defended pawn, and my knight would have to run around.  2...d6 is necessary for ...Nf6."
5,Bb5+,f1b5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 3,"Sharp play, basically calling for the bishop trade, or for me to lose my knight for his bishop.  Strange to check so early, but not that there's anything wrong with it."
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 4,"I do this odd move again and again, it seems.  I'll have to stop.  This doesn't threaten the bishop, and just wastes time for me, since I'll have to unpin my knight later."
7,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 3 4,"Castles at leisure, although probably could have developed Nc3, d3, b3, or even d4 instead, since I'm nowhere near a counterattack."
8,a6,a7a6,r1bqkbnr/1p2pppp/p1np4/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 5,Putting the question to the bishop.
9,Bxc6+,b5c6,r1bqkbnr/1p2pppp/p1Bp4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 5,"My knight dies.  I'm still exerting influence over the dark squares in the middle from my pawns though.  This brings up one of the common debates in chess.  Which is better, the bishop or the knight?  The Ruy Lopez basically prefers the knight in the opening, but it's far from settled.  Still, from this move, white seems to be more comfortable playing down a bishop."
10,bxc6,b7c6,r1bqkbnr/4pppp/p1pp4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 6,"On the plus side, this opens the b file.  On the negative side, I have doubled pawns. Still, now I have pawn control over the d5 square, which I wouldn't have had otherwise."
11,c4,c2c4,r1bqkbnr/4pppp/p1pp4/2p5/2P1P3/5N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 6,"The Maroczy wall, asserting control over the d5 square.  Still, this opens up a potential outpose on d4, if his knight ever moves.  My knight that could have got to that outpost easiest is dead, however."
12,e5,e7e5,r1bqkbnr/5ppp/p1pp4/2p1p3/2P1P3/5N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,"Reassert centre control, and exerts influence over f4."
13,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/5ppp/p1pp4/2p1p3/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP1P1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 7,"This isn't necessarily bad, but it's unclear what this knight is supposed to do.  It can't really go anywhere from there, and this move wasn't necessary to develop other pieces.  Might have made more sense to do 7. b3, setting up the fianchetto."
14,g6,g7g6,r1bqkbnr/5p1p/p1pp2p1/2p1p3/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP1P1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,"So I take advantage to set up my own fianchetto.  however, it's a bit weak, as my own pawn is blocking my DSB influence on the long diagonal."
15,d3,d2d3,r1bqkbnr/5p1p/p1pp2p1/2p1p3/2P1P3/2NP1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,"now his DSB is activated, although there is still a hole on d4.  White should keep his DSB at this point, as his centre pawns are mostly on light squares."
16,Bg7,f8g7,r1bqk1nr/5pbp/p1pp2p1/2p1p3/2P1P3/2NP1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 1 9,Complete the fianchetto.
17,Bd2,c1d2,r1bqk1nr/5pbp/p1pp2p1/2p1p3/2P1P3/2NP1N2/PP1B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 2 9,"Not clear what this accomplishes.  White may be making a break for the queenside, since this doesn't gain any new influence for the bishop.  Certainly the rook isn't moving to c1."
18,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/5pbp/p1pp1np1/2p1p3/2P1P3/2NP1N2/PP1B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 3 10,Getting ready to castle.
19,h3,h2h3,r1bqk2r/5pbp/p1pp1np1/2p1p3/2P1P3/2NP1N1P/PP1B1PP1/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 10,"Stops ...Bg4, if I was interested."
20,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/5pbp/p1pp1np1/2p1p3/2P1P3/2NP1N1P/PP1B1PP1/R2Q1RK1 w - - 1 11,Possibly in anticipation of b4 cxb4 which opens up one of the files for white's rook.
21,a3,a2a3,r1bq1rk1/5pbp/p1pp1np1/2p1p3/2P1P3/P1NP1N1P/1P1B1PP1/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 11,Possibly in anticipation of b4 cxb4 which opens up one of the files for white's rook.
