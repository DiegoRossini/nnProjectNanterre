1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I basically always play e4. I'm a huge fan of regular, open, tactical sharp play."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"He plays e5- I relax, these are the games where I can use openings I'm a lot more familiar with."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"So I play Nf3, again, my usual."
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"And Black goes for the Philidor's Defense. I'm not a real fan of this opening for Black. I think it's a tad passive, and allows White to just charge right into the center with attacking power. I can't remember any time where this opening gave me pause- is there a value in e5-d6 this soon at all?"
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"So, like I said, I just eagerly charge right in. Main line for White."
6,exd4,e5d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,He takes. Probably best- I can't see much value in Bg4 if White has dxe5.
7,Nxd4,f3d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"I prefer Nxd4. Qxd4 apparently does equally well in the databases, but say if you've played the Scandinavian defense as White, Qxd4 is usually immediately met by Black playing Nc6. Why throw a queen out when it just gets chased away?"
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"Black develops, sensing a more urgent need to castle instead of trying maybe Nc6."
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,"I continue my development, seizing more control over d5 and e4."
10,a6,a7a6,rnbqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"He plays this, apparently the so-called Berger variation. I don't like this line at all. Yes, this stops White from putting either knight or the Bishop on b5, but this is passive for Black's developing and it's not like Black can't hold a grip on c6 in case I were to try and go in that way. If Black's king were in danger, I think the alternative ...Be7 would help get the King in a position to hide away sooner."
11,Be2,f1e2,rnbqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"This bishop has nowhere good to go now, on the other hand, so I push it here to further prevent Bg4 from Black and I ready myself to castle."
12,h6,h7h6,rnbqkb1r/1pp2pp1/p2p1n1p/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"Once again, opting to passively protect the two strongest squares for the bishops to be on, but I think this is mostly a waste of time for Black. Black only has 1 back rank piece and no stake in the center, against my near perfect control of the center and three developed back pieces! White is clearly better here."
13,O-O,e1g1,rnbqkb1r/1pp2pp1/p2p1n1p/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 7,"Putting my king away and allowing several possibilities for White's next best moves, ranging anywhere from f4, Re1, Bc4... the list continues."
14,Bd7,c8d7,rn1qkb1r/1ppb1pp1/p2p1n1p/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 8,"Once again, I think he's worrying about the wrong bishop. Why not Be7?"
15,Be3,c1e3,rn1qkb1r/1ppb1pp1/p2p1n1p/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 3 8,"This was more of a waiting move. It maintains control over d4, and opens the door for the Queen to join the bishop on a possible h6 attack if the Black King castles short. Black must consider carefully."
16,Nh7,f6h7,rn1qkb1r/1ppb1ppn/p2p3p/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 4 9,"...Okay, I'm out of ideas. Why this???"
17,Bg4,e2g4,rn1qkb1r/1ppb1ppn/p2p3p/8/3NP1B1/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 5 9,"I miscalculated the strength of his next move, or even the strength of my bishop compared to his here. Frankly, looking back, I wish I tried f4 here or something."
18,Nf6,h7f6,rn1qkb1r/1ppb1pp1/p2p1n1p/8/3NP1B1/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 6 10,"He moves the knight back. Not sure if I like the repetition of moves out of Black... the other knight on b8 was already protecting the Bd7 with the Queen. Heck, would even Ng5 be better?"
19,Bf5,g4f5,rn1qkb1r/1ppb1pp1/p2p1n1p/5B2/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 7 10,"I know that I can't move the bishop to h3, and retreating seems like ripping a page out of the book I'm preaching against. So, I try to make the most out of a miscalculation, hoping to tempt Black into playing g6 and weakening the kingside even further."
20,Be7,f8e7,rn1qk2r/1ppbbpp1/p2p1n1p/5B2/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 8 11,"Black finally plays this, aiming to castle, not seeming to mind the thought of my bishop on f5 yet."
