1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone, this game is about two sides attacking one another.  The moral here though is that the side with the greater amount of forces in the enemy camp will work effectively together as a team and force checkmate whereas if you only have one piece in the enemy camp and your other pieces are stuck at home then, as you will see, God help you!"

I thought that rather than sit back and allow my Expert opponent to dominate in the way he did in our last few matches, I would try a more aggressive approach.  It made the game a little more interesting but unfortunately I still got the same result - the blob!"

I played this because the Poisoned Pawn Variation is a recognised spur of the Latvian and it did have a good win percentage in the Expert's database but not so in the Gameknot database.  The drawback to this variation is, as you will see, Glenda and Henry will be the only pieces to move in the entire game!"
