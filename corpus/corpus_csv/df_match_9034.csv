1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!  After the trials and tribulations of Beafyness' tourney it is nice to report that I beat someone in just 13 moves.  The Dentist is back after a sabbatical in Vietnam.  This game goes a long way to exorcise the memory of what happened the last time I was black against him (see The Dentist has his day).  He starts off with the Patzer's Opening, an opening you should underestimate at your peril as an Expert played this against me and won."

Even with the queens off, white was punished for slow development.  All his queenside pieces are at home where black is fully developed.  My battle with passivity continues.  What I am now trying to do is study what moves are thematic to what opening, in particular pawn moves so that I do not get squeezed.  Just hope I have some more good news to post here.  Have a nice day everyone!  - Joanne"
