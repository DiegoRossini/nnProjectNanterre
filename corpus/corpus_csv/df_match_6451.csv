1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"My limited knowledge of opening theory equals that I am out of the book (even if there was theory for this, I wouldn't know). White should play e4 instead of the text move to shut down the a8-h1 diagonal. The LSB will be a real nuisance, and White misses his chance to limit the Bishop.
I chose e3 instead, mainly because after e4, the queenside Knight would have to be developed to d2, also shutting off the DSB. c5 is a common move from Black in the closed games, and should it happen that Black takes the d-pawn, I prefer to take back with a pawn instead of the Knight, even if the pawn becomes isolated. While White's DSB should be developed to the Kingside before shutting him off, I have experienced that the DSB will either regain it's mobility after a pawn exchange in the centre, or can support a Queenside advance if the centre stays fixed. It probably is a consequence of my d-pawn preference."

White will have to take the pawn to get the Knight to c3, which is needed there to have a look over the squares d5 and e4, consequence of 3. e3.

The pawn on b5 serves two purposes; preventing not only c5, but the queenside Knight cannot develop until that pawn disappears. Black's d-pawn won't move, otherwise e6 will get weak and allows counterplay, especially after Black castles. While c4 is a better square for White's LSB, 7. ...ab forces the retake immediatly.

Freddy later remarked that it seems that I preferred active defense over passive defense, but I am not one that thinks ""active defense or get off my lawn"". The art of defense includes passive defense, and I don't shy away from it if I think I can hold it. While it seems inferior to exchange the Bishop for the Knight, it has its values for White. The LSB can't play against e6 as long as the pawn on d7 is there. It also can't switch to the Kingside, while the black Knight can. If the Knight appears on g6, the white Knight is again denied from e5. The main point of the exchange is to occupy e5 and block the b8-h2 diagonal. As long as the DSB stays on e6, the white Knight is a good compensation. Black has to move the LSB after the exchange, which gives White the needed tempo to prevent Qg5.

Freddy suggested 16. a4 after I had moved. Back then, I didn't see the point - just later I found that it was helping in keeping out the rook from a4."
