6,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,A common idea played to secure the d4 square and make a push to either d4 or b4 if given the opportunity.

9,d3,d2d3,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,Played with the simple idea of protecting e4 and making way for the bishop and the knight.
10,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 1 6,"White had plenty of other good alternatives such as Nbd2 or Bb3. With b4, white plans a pawn storm on the queen-side to try and create some weaknesses there."
11,O-O,e1g1,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 2 6,"White had plenty of other good alternatives such as Nbd2 or Bb3. With b4, white plans a pawn storm on the queen-side to try and create some weaknesses there."

14,Bb6,c5b6,r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/1bnp1n2/4p3/1PB1P3/2PP1N2/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 1 8,Continuing the plan and also threatening to trap the bishop.
15,a4,a2a4,r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/1bnp1n2/4p3/PPB1P3/2PP1N2/5PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 0 8,Continuing the plan and also threatening to trap the bishop.
16,a5,a7a5,r1bq1rk1/1pp2ppp/1bnp1n2/p3p3/PPB1P3/2PP1N2/5PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 0 9,"8...a6 doesn't seem like a bad alternative either. The upside to this move is that is stops the a4 pawn in its tracks, but it does allow white to go on with 9. b5."
17,b5,b4b5,r1bq1rk1/1pp2ppp/1bnp1n2/pP2p3/P1B1P3/2PP1N2/5PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 0 9,"This is the most effective square for the knight, looking to get to f4 when the time is right. It is also adding extra support to the e5 pawn and prepares a d5 push."
18,Ne7,c6e7,r1bq1rk1/1pp1nppp/1b1p1n2/pP2p3/P1B1P3/2PP1N2/5PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 1 10,"This is the most effective square for the knight, looking to get to f4 when the time is right. It is also adding extra support to the e5 pawn and prepares a d5 push."
19,Nbd2,b1d2,r1bq1rk1/1pp1nppp/1b1p1n2/pP2p3/P1B1P3/2PP1N2/3N1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 2 10,"This is the most effective square for the knight, looking to get to f4 when the time is right. It is also adding extra support to the e5 pawn and prepares a d5 push."
20,Ng6,e7g6,r1bq1rk1/1pp2ppp/1b1p1nn1/pP2p3/P1B1P3/2PP1N2/3N1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 3 11,"This is the most effective square for the knight, looking to get to f4 when the time is right. It is also adding extra support to the e5 pawn and prepares a d5 push."
21,Ba2,c4a2,r1bq1rk1/1pp2ppp/1b1p1nn1/pP2p3/P3P3/2PP1N2/B2N1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 4 11,"This moves makes a lot of sense. This makes the c4 square available for both the c-pawn or the knight to press harder on the queen side. Additionally, with the bishop on a2 instead of b3 it allows the a-rook to have more control over the b-file after Rb1."
22,d5,d6d5,r1bq1rk1/1pp2ppp/1b3nn1/pP1pp3/P3P3/2PP1N2/B2N1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 12,This move also makes a lot of sense. The pawn on d5 attacks e4 while also preventing the knight from coming to c4.
23,Qc2,d1c2,r1bq1rk1/1pp2ppp/1b3nn1/pP1pp3/P3P3/2PP1N2/B1QN1PPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 1 12,Qc2 gives more protection to the d3-e4 pawn chain. White can now be able to safely take on d5 in order to open the e-file for the rook.
24,c6,c7c6,r1bq1rk1/1p3ppp/1bp2nn1/pP1pp3/P3P3/2PP1N2/B1QN1PPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 0 13,Played to try and create a weakness by exchanging on b5.
25,Rb1,a1b1,r1bq1rk1/1p3ppp/1bp2nn1/pP1pp3/P3P3/2PP1N2/B1QN1PPP/1RB2RK1 b - - 1 13,"Obviously, white does not want to allow black to have a passed pawn after cxb5, axb5. So white just slides the rook to activate it."
26,Re8,f8e8,r1bqr1k1/1p3ppp/1bp2nn1/pP1pp3/P3P3/2PP1N2/B1QN1PPP/1RB2RK1 w - - 2 14,"A couple of simple development moves, followed by this prophylactic move of h6 just to make sure that nothing can get on g5."
27,Re1,f1e1,r1bqr1k1/1p3ppp/1bp2nn1/pP1pp3/P3P3/2PP1N2/B1QN1PPP/1RB1R1K1 b - - 3 14,"A couple of simple development moves, followed by this prophylactic move of h6 just to make sure that nothing can get on g5."

29,c4,c3c4,r1bqr1k1/1p3pp1/1bp2nnp/pP1pp3/P1P1P3/3P1N2/B1QN1PPP/1RB1R1K1 b - - 0 15,Now the action starts. White is practically forcing black to relieve some tension in the center since the pawn push to c5 forcing the bishop into passiveness can't be allowed.
30,dxe4,d5e4,r1bqr1k1/1p3pp1/1bp2nnp/pP2p3/P1P1p3/3P1N2/B1QN1PPP/1RB1R1K1 w - - 0 16,"This seems more reasonable than 15...dxc4, which could follow up with 16. Nxc4 Bc7, and it seems that whites position is very comfortable."
31,Nxe4,d2e4,r1bqr1k1/1p3pp1/1bp2nnp/pP2p3/P1P1N3/3P1N2/B1Q2PPP/1RB1R1K1 b - - 0 16,The knight exchange make sense as it loosens white's grip on c5.
32,Nxe4,f6e4,r1bqr1k1/1p3pp1/1bp3np/pP2p3/P1P1n3/3P1N2/B1Q2PPP/1RB1R1K1 w - - 0 17,The knight exchange make sense as it loosens white's grip on c5.
33,dxe4,d3e4,r1bqr1k1/1p3pp1/1bp3np/pP2p3/P1P1P3/5N2/B1Q2PPP/1RB1R1K1 b - - 0 17,Note that white can't play 17. Rxe4?? because of Bf5.
34,Bc5,b6c5,r1bqr1k1/1p3pp1/2p3np/pPb1p3/P1P1P3/5N2/B1Q2PPP/1RB1R1K1 w - - 1 18,"So now black must do something about the threat of a pawn push to c5. My first thought would be been to play 17...c5, but that leaves the bishop in an awkward position on b6. This keeps the bishop active."
35,Be3,c1e3,r1bqr1k1/1p3pp1/2p3np/pPb1p3/P1P1P3/4BN2/B1Q2PPP/1R2R1K1 b - - 2 18,Both sides are now just finishing development.
36,Qe7,d8e7,r1b1r1k1/1p2qpp1/2p3np/pPb1p3/P1P1P3/4BN2/B1Q2PPP/1R2R1K1 w - - 3 19,Both sides are now just finishing development.
