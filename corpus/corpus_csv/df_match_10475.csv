1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"I've gotta confess, I was not feeling too good about seeing this.  I haven't faced 1. Nf3 before, and so I figured my best option was to just do some safe, kingside developing for awhile and wait for white to make a commitment."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 2,"no commitment yet, so I'm content to think about Nf6, g6, Bg7, and 0-0, and go from there."
3,g3,g2g3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/8/5NP1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,"no commitment yet, so I'm content to think about Nf6, g6, Bg7, and 0-0, and go from there."
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/8/5NP1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,Still no reason to think otherwise...
5,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/8/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 3,Still no reason to think otherwise...
6,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/8/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 4,"At this point, I said to myself that if he's not going to make a bid for the center, then *I will*."
7,O-O,e1g1,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/8/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 3 4,"At this point, I said to myself that if he's not going to make a bid for the center, then *I will*."
8,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppppppbp/5np1/8/8/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 4 5,"At this point, I said to myself that if he's not going to make a bid for the center, then *I will*."
9,d3,d2d3,rnbq1rk1/ppppppbp/5np1/8/8/3P1NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 0 5,"At this point, I said to myself that if he's not going to make a bid for the center, then *I will*."
10,d5,d7d5,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3p4/8/3P1NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 0 6,"For better or worse, I'm staking my claim."
11,Re1,f1e1,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3p4/8/3P1NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQR1K1 b - - 1 6,"And this seemed a logical follow-up.  If he's going to give me a space advantage, I'll gladly take it."
12,c5,c7c5,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/5np1/2pp4/8/3P1NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQR1K1 w - - 0 7,"And this seemed a logical follow-up.  If he's going to give me a space advantage, I'll gladly take it."
13,Nbd2,b1d2,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/5np1/2pp4/8/3P1NP1/PPPNPPBP/R1BQR1K1 b - - 1 7,"Was he planning Nb3?  After all, my c-pawn is defenseless with my dark-squared bishop on g7."
14,Nc6,b8c6,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2n2np1/2pp4/8/3P1NP1/PPPNPPBP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 2 8,"Still, simple development seems best."
15,c3,c2c3,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2n2np1/2pp4/8/2PP1NP1/PP1NPPBP/R1BQR1K1 b - - 0 8,Really giving me a free big center.  (Sound like an internet giveaway!)
16,e5,e7e5,r1bq1rk1/pp3pbp/2n2np1/2ppp3/8/2PP1NP1/PP1NPPBP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 0 9,So here we are -- and I don't know if he's going to strike back with e4 or let me have the center.
17,e4,e2e4,r1bq1rk1/pp3pbp/2n2np1/2ppp3/4P3/2PP1NP1/PP1N1PBP/R1BQR1K1 b - - 0 9,I like this move!  Things look very even and there's a lot of tension now.
18,d4,d5d4,r1bq1rk1/pp3pbp/2n2np1/2p1p3/3pP3/2PP1NP1/PP1N1PBP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 0 10,"Gives him c4 as a knight outpost, but gives me a space advantage and blocks in his Bg2.  (Also blocks in my Bg7...)"
19,Nc4,d2c4,r1bq1rk1/pp3pbp/2n2np1/2p1p3/2NpP3/2PP1NP1/PP3PBP/R1BQR1K1 b - - 1 10,"As expected, and threatening to win the e5 pawn."
20,Bg4,c8g4,r2q1rk1/pp3pbp/2n2np1/2p1p3/2NpP1b1/2PP1NP1/PP3PBP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 2 11,"A nice tactical defense of the e-pawn, as the pin on the knight is strong."
21,h3,h2h3,r2q1rk1/pp3pbp/2n2np1/2p1p3/2NpP1b1/2PP1NPP/PP3PB1/R1BQR1K1 b - - 0 11,and so white decides it must be broken.
22,Bxf3,g4f3,r2q1rk1/pp3pbp/2n2np1/2p1p3/2NpP3/2PP1bPP/PP3PB1/R1BQR1K1 w - - 0 12,"Practically forced, as Bh5 get embarrassed by g4, and any other move surrenders the e-pawn."
23,Qxf3,d1f3,r2q1rk1/pp3pbp/2n2np1/2p1p3/2NpP3/2PP1QPP/PP3PB1/R1B1R1K1 b - - 0 12,"And now this boots the knight, giving black his space advantage after all!  (It's a nice feeling to set a goal and succeed!)"
24,b5,b7b5,r2q1rk1/p4pbp/2n2np1/1pp1p3/2NpP3/2PP1QPP/PP3PB1/R1B1R1K1 w - - 0 13,"And now this boots the knight, giving black his space advantage after all!  (It's a nice feeling to set a goal and succeed!)"
25,Nd2,c4d2,r2q1rk1/p4pbp/2n2np1/1pp1p3/3pP3/2PP1QPP/PP1N1PB1/R1B1R1K1 b - - 1 13,"I was feeling good with a space advantage here, even though I didn't have the 2 bishops, and so I got a little careless."
26,Bh6,g7h6,r2q1rk1/p4p1p/2n2npb/1pp1p3/3pP3/2PP1QPP/PP1N1PB1/R1B1R1K1 w - - 2 14,"Black's bishop didn't look like it had much scope, so I prepared to exchange bishops when the knight moves."
27,Qd1,f3d1,r2q1rk1/p4p1p/2n2npb/1pp1p3/3pP3/2PP2PP/PP1N1PB1/R1BQR1K1 b - - 3 14,"There was, apparently, nothing for the queen on the kingside except to block in white's own f-pawn."
