1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I had never played Allen before -- a very spirited player (who's big on the spirits, too)"
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Asking for the Vienna gambit (2. ... Nf6 3. f4!)
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,Asking for the Vienna gambit (2. ... Nf6 3. f4!)
4,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2p5/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,??  This is odd; I expected black to develop a piece.  This move takes the c6 square away from the knight on b8.
5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2p5/4p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 3,"I don't know what awaits me, so I go for simple development, and guard against black seizing the center with d5."
6,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2pp4/4p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 4,"So instead of d5, black opts for d6.  This opens up the c8-h3 diagonal for the light-squared bishop, but blocks in the dark-squared one!"
7,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2pp4/4p3/2B1PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 4,"Trying to open lines, as I've got the advantage.  Black is inclined to take, since otherwise f5 really puts a bind on black's development."
8,exf4,e5f4,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2pp4/8/2B1Pp2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,"Now, I've got a third piece developed -- although this was necessary to dissuade Qh4 , which can be devastating in the related King's Gambit accepted."
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2pp4/8/2B1Pp2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,"Now, I've got a third piece developed -- although this was necessary to dissuade Qh4 , which can be devastating in the related King's Gambit accepted."
10,f6,f7f6,rnbqkbnr/pp4pp/2pp1p2/8/2B1Pp2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"?  Alright, at this point, I realize that black is way underdeveloped, and I've got an ideal king's gambit/vienna gambit type setup.  All I have to do is get the rest of my pieces out and focus on attacking the black king."
11,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp4pp/2pp1p2/8/2BPPp2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"d3 would have sufficed, but why not grab the extra square?"
12,Ne7,g8e7,rnbqkb1r/pp2n1pp/2pp1p2/8/2BPPp2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 7,"Finally developing his first piece on move 6; this is definitely coming a lot later than it ought.  The knight doesn't have many options, in any case, as white dominates the center."
13,Bxf4,c1f4,rnbqkb1r/pp2n1pp/2pp1p2/8/2BPPB2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 7,"And now there's a 4-1 edge in piece development for white.  I don't see a breakthrough yet, but there are many useful moves for me in waiting (0-0, for instance), while black has very little in the way of options."
14,b5,b7b5,rnbqkb1r/p3n1pp/2pp1p2/1p6/2BPPB2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"?  Alright, this is just silly now.  There's no reason not to try to develop pieces at this stage.  I took a look at Nxb5 here, since I have such a developmental edge, but white lacks a good follow-up to 8. Nxb5 cxb5 9. Bxb5# Bd7, so I reserve the decision here..."
15,Bb3,c4b3,rnbqkb1r/p3n1pp/2pp1p2/1p6/3PPB2/1BN2N2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 8,"Bd3 should also be worth considering, but I didn't want to lessen my presence on black's kingside."
16,g5,g7g5,rnbqkb1r/p3n2p/2pp1p2/1p4p1/3PPB2/1BN2N2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 9,"??  Now this is unbelievable.  If I clear the knight out of f3, the queen can deliver a devastating check on h5.  I couldn't calculate all of the complications, but simply thought whether it would be better to have a knight or bishop for the attack, and to sac the other on g5."
17,Bxg5,f4g5,rnbqkb1r/p3n2p/2pp1p2/1p4B1/3PP3/1BN2N2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 9,"Taking with the bishop first, although in hindsight taking with the knight would have been very strong also."
18,fxg5,f6g5,rnbqkb1r/p3n2p/2pp4/1p4p1/3PP3/1BN2N2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 10,"At this point, it's clear that white is going to go in for the kill, and while black may be able to defend, he certainly has his work cut out for him!"
19,Nxg5,f3g5,rnbqkb1r/p3n2p/2pp4/1p4N1/3PP3/1BN5/PPP3PP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 10,"At this point, it's clear that white is going to go in for the kill, and while black may be able to defend, he certainly has his work cut out for him!"
20,h6,h7h6,rnbqkb1r/p3n3/2pp3p/1p4N1/3PP3/1BN5/PPP3PP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 11,"?  If moving pawns has gotten black this far, why change strategies now, I suppose?"
21,Qh5+,d1h5,rnbqkb1r/p3n3/2pp3p/1p4NQ/3PP3/1BN5/PPP3PP/R3K2R b KQkq - 1 11,Bringing the queen into the attack.
22,Kd7,e8d7,rnbq1b1r/p2kn3/2pp3p/1p4NQ/3PP3/1BN5/PPP3PP/R3K2R w KQ - 2 12,Forced.
23,Nf7,g5f7,rnbq1b1r/p2knN2/2pp3p/1p5Q/3PP3/1BN5/PPP3PP/R3K2R b KQ - 3 12,"Forking queen and rook, but black has an interesting attempt at defence."
