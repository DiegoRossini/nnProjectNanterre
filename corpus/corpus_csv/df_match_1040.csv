GM Cyrano (Afro) asked me to annotate this game and another against his opponent, Akjoltoy who needs just one rating point to get to 2700 - wow!  I will give the commentary and hopefully somebody can provide a little deeper analysis, so here goes.   Afro opens with 1. e4 and his opponent responds with e6 which is the French Defense."
