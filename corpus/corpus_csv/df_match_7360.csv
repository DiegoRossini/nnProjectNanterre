1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

This is the first time I have annotated a game since suffering the Big Slump Part 2 which robbed me of my Class A Status.  Still, I got there once and I could get there again - there are still a couple of games in my active list that I could lose, however, after that, depending on my other positions it will be start from scratch.  Anyhow, at least this won game game and another win against a 1400+ player gave me some respite from the slump.  Anyhow, here is a game where I quickly got into difficulties but my opponent adopted the wrong plan to take full advantage.  He failed and eventually took a pawn which led to him losing his king.  We start with a double king pawn opening and then my opponent plays the Philidor with 2. d6."
