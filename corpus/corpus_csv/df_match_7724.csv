3,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P1P2/8/PPP1P1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"...although I'm not sure why my opponent would move out the pawn staring in front of this bishop on the kingside. This may have been a waste of a move, or is there a plot developing?"
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3p4/3P1P2/8/PPP1P1PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"I take advantage of this move by bringing out a knight. I have more control of the centre, although the e5 square is mainly controlled by my opponent, and I'm not trying to take the pawn on d4, as the queen is protecting it."

9,Nxe4,c3e4,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n5/3p4/3PNP2/5N2/PPP1P1PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"...and we do end up exchanging knights, with me having doubled paws on the e-file, after six consecutive knight moves. These pawns are relatively strong, as my KBP is still in its starting position, so they can potentially support it. My opponent's remaining knight is actually under attack from the pawn..."

11,Ne5,f3e5,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n5/4N3/3PpP2/8/PPP1P1PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"...but although my opponent offers it as bait to my own knight, I capture the pawn instead, to get ahead. I think that was quite a good move, as my knight is the only piece between the queens, and should it retreat back to its old square, a queen exchange is possible, although it may have been a little dodgy, with the possibility of doubled isolated pawns on the c-file, along with an isolated pawn on a7, even if I do have an extra pawn..."
