1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game is more or less focuses on the d7 square, and a pin on Black's knight on that square which I held since move 9. If I had dedicated myself more to the attack on the square on d7, I may have had a pretty strong attack..."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,King's pawn opening - I deviate from my normal pattern of the English Opening (I wanted a solid position given the rating difference of me and david1223
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,a symmetrical position so far
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,a symmetrical position so far
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 3,bringing out knight #2 and threatening the d5 square
6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"I remember another annotated game where a knight sacrifice on taking that e6 pawn led to White decimating Black (but that was with the Queen's pawn opening... I may be wrong on this, but I can't remember what the game was, it was awhile ago)"
7,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p2B1/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,I like to play moves like this when I am in doubt of what else to do
8,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bqkb1r/pppn1ppp/4pn2/3p2B1/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,"brings out the other knight, and that knight stays there for the rest of the game"
9,Qd2,d1d2,r1bqkb1r/pppn1ppp/4pn2/3p2B1/3P4/2N2N2/PPPQPPPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 3 5,"Black takes advantage of this move later in the game, but for now this seems like a good move - it opens up castling opportunities and allows a rook-and-queen formation on the d-file when I do castle (I considered Qd3 but felt that Qd2 was safer)"
10,c5,c7c5,r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/4pn2/2pp2B1/3P4/2N2N2/PPPQPPPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 6,challenging the center - if I retake White's center control is weakened considerably
11,e3,e2e3,r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/4pn2/2pp2B1/3P4/2N1PN2/PPPQ1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"this is where I see a chance to pin the knight at d7, and focus on that, but after that I pretty much forget the idea of castling"
12,h6,h7h6,r1bqkb1r/pp1n1pp1/4pn1p/2pp2B1/3P4/2N1PN2/PPPQ1PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 7,keeping the pressure on that knight

14,cxd4,c5d4,r1bqkb1r/pp1n1pp1/4pn1p/3p4/3p3B/2N1PN2/PPPQ1PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 8,pawn trade
15,exd4,e3d4,r1bqkb1r/pp1n1pp1/4pn1p/3p4/3P3B/2N2N2/PPPQ1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 8,pawn trade
16,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/pp1nbpp1/4pn1p/3p4/3P3B/2N2N2/PPPQ1PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 1 9,"I was expecting g5 here... I should have taken that knight straight away, but I don't realise the significance of this move until it was too late"
17,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqk2r/pp1nbpp1/4pn1p/1B1p4/3P3B/2N2N2/PPPQ1PPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 2 9,the pin I mentioned at the beginning
18,a6,a7a6,r1bqk2r/1p1nbpp1/p3pn1p/1B1p4/3P3B/2N2N2/PPPQ1PPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 10,chasing my bishop...

20,b5,b7b5,r1bqk2r/3nbpp1/p3pn1p/1p1p4/B2P3B/2N2N2/PPPQ1PPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 11,"I was expecting this, and then I saw a possible move that could give me the advantage. Was I right?"
21,Nxb5,c3b5,r1bqk2r/3nbpp1/p3pn1p/1N1p4/B2P3B/5N2/PPPQ1PPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 0 11,"? No, I wasn't - this move drops me down a piece due to the position of my queen - any other situation and this move would have been great. I saw this as a gambit that was beneficial for White - for the sake of just one point, White could maintain the pin on the h7 knight and create passed pawns on my a and b file (of course, White could simply break the pin by castling, but then I'd just opt for the exchange - the less pieces stopping my pawns, the better)"
22,axb5,a6b5,r1bqk2r/3nbpp1/4pn1p/1p1p4/B2P3B/5N2/PPPQ1PPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 12,(!) ouch! This move guarantees Black a piece advantage
23,Bxb5,a4b5,r1bqk2r/3nbpp1/4pn1p/1B1p4/3P3B/5N2/PPPQ1PPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 0 12,(!) ouch! This move guarantees Black a piece advantage
