Here is my latest annotation, although this is not my best game but I'm interested to annotate this as a part of lesson in chess. I almost lost on this position but at the end I managed to win because of white careless and overconfidence. Please free to feed any of your criticism and feeback. My opponent open d4 I replied usually against d4 opening by Nf6."
