1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,rooks and knight vs. queen: wins
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,The fast attempt threatening a poor check on f7. I tried this once. But that was not funny.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,The fast attempt threatening a poor check on f7. I tried this once. But that was not funny.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,The fast attempt threatening a poor check on f7. I tried this once. But that was not funny.
5,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,The fast attempt threatening a poor check on f7. I tried this once. But that was not funny.
6,h6,h7h6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1pp1/2n4p/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,"That basicly covers g6, the spot for the white knight. Although not yet necessary at this point - g6 is still covered by the queen"
7,d3,d2d3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1pp1/2n4p/4p3/2B1P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,Now h6 is necessary if I'm counting right.
8,a6,a7a6,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1pp1/p1n4p/4p3/2B1P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"Avoiding white to pin the queenside knight against the king with his bishop on c4. This ended up in a bad trade too often. Also this is preparing b5, attacking the bishop on c4."
9,a4,a2a4,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1pp1/p1n4p/4p3/P1B1P3/3P1N2/1PP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,White avoids b5. Now this would end up in my rook to be captured.
10,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk1nr/1ppp1pp1/p1n4p/2b1p3/P1B1P3/3P1N2/1PP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 6,"Now I am threatening a poor check, trying to catch up a bit with my castle :)"
11,Be3,c1e3,r1bqk1nr/1ppp1pp1/p1n4p/2b1p3/P1B1P3/3PBN2/1PP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 2 6,"Well, at least I am trying. But I am still behind as white has figured correctly. 
Actually, that seems to be an interesting trade. I think I will try this one day."
12,d6,d7d6,r1bqk1nr/1pp2pp1/p1np3p/2b1p3/P1B1P3/3PBN2/1PP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"but not today. I am not ignoring the bishop on c4, by the way."
13,Bxc5,e3c5,r1bqk1nr/1pp2pp1/p1np3p/2B1p3/P1B1P3/3P1N2/1PP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 0 7,"Thats an interesting trade, Mr. White."
14,dxc5,d6c5,r1bqk1nr/1pp2pp1/p1n4p/2p1p3/P1B1P3/3P1N2/1PP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 8,Nice view for the black queen :)
15,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqk1nr/1pp2pp1/p1n4p/2p1p3/P1B1P3/2NP1N2/1PP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 8,"Thats ok, now d5 is clearly in whites hands.
As is b5 buy the way. But there is no attack yet."
16,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/1pp2pp1/p1n2n1p/2p1p3/P1B1P3/2NP1N2/1PP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 9,Ketchup.
17,b3,b2b3,r1bqk2r/1pp2pp1/p1n2n1p/2p1p3/P1B1P3/1PNP1N2/2P2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 9,looks a bit like the white bishop is pushed into an attack :). Probably white expects 9. ... be6 and does not really want let the queens face each other if I decided to play tit for tat.
18,Bg4,c8g4,r2qk2r/1pp2pp1/p1n2n1p/2p1p3/P1B1P1b1/1PNP1N2/2P2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 1 10,But I am going to be mean today. I will take the knight!! Also I am happy that I have catched up with the castling options.
19,h3,h2h3,r2qk2r/1pp2pp1/p1n2n1p/2p1p3/P1B1P1b1/1PNP1N1P/2P2PP1/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 10,"This will not scare me away, sorry. Otherwise I would have gone to e6 before. Usually."
20,Bxf3,g4f3,r2qk2r/1pp2pp1/p1n2n1p/2p1p3/P1B1P3/1PNP1b1P/2P2PP1/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 11,"This time I will take the knight because it is covering d4. Sorry, was covering... 
the view for my queen improved dramatically"
21,Qxf3,d1f3,r2qk2r/1pp2pp1/p1n2n1p/2p1p3/P1B1P3/1PNP1Q1P/2P2PP1/R3K2R b KQkq - 0 11,what I had expected. White now has two castling positions. Thats why a bishop/knight trade on the kingside does not hurt too much. Usually.
22,Qd4,d8d4,r3k2r/1pp2pp1/p1n2n1p/2p1p3/P1BqP3/1PNP1Q1P/2P2PP1/R3K2R w KQkq - 1 12,"This really is a beautiful position for the black queen. She is scaring whites remaining knight to death. All ways to safe it, are bad or dangerous. 
All 4 of them are killing two rooks. 
12. Nb5 or Ne5 would allow a fork on c7, but what is one lost black rook against two white rooks?"
23,Kd2,e1d2,r3k2r/1pp2pp1/p1n2n1p/2p1p3/P1BqP3/1PNP1Q1P/2PK1PP1/R6R b kq - 2 12,"There is a fifth option that I did not really expect. This is weakening the white king. I had expected a kingside castle, abandoning the knight and rescuing the rooks. Thats a noble king, I am impressed."
