11,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3p1n2/2pP4/8/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"Choosing non-committally.  Will White play the Knight's tour Variation, or revert to the Main Line?"
12,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pp3p1p/3p1np1/2pP4/8/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,Knight's Tour it is...
13,Nd2,f3d2,rnbqkb1r/pp3p1p/3p1np1/2pP4/8/2N5/PP1NPPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 7,Knight's Tour it is...
14,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/8/2N5/PP1NPPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 8,"...or maybe not.  The GK engine still calls this 'book', but for mine, it is already 'seat-of-the-pants' country.  My opening play ever was indifferent."
15,e4,e2e4,rnbqk2r/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N5/PP1N1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,"...or maybe not.  The GK engine still calls this 'book', but for mine, it is already 'seat-of-the-pants' country.  My opening play ever was indifferent."
16,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N5/PP1N1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 1 9,"One of the beauties of this opening from Black's point of view is that the early programme is simple and straightforward: fianchetto, castle, check out the Q-side..."
17,Be2,f1e2,rnbq1rk1/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N5/PP1NBPPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 2 9,"Of all the choices of destination for the Bishop, this seemed to be the most circumspect.  Any Black incursion at g4 is ruled out, and the Bishop presents much less of a target than he would at c4 and b5.  Although in some systems the Bishop would have still well at d3, it seems that it doesn't in this, again because it presents more of a target than doing anything useful."
18,Re8,f8e8,rnbqr1k1/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N5/PP1NBPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 3 10,"Striking towards White's semi-backward e-pawn.  This move is multi-purpose, the rook being very handy on the e-file: discouraging e4-e5; hitting the e-pawn, and with veiled threats down the whole length of the file."
19,O-O,e1g1,rnbqr1k1/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N5/PP1NBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 4 10,"OK, there will be no pins down the e-file!"
20,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bqr1k1/pp1n1pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N5/PP1NBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 5 11,"A pretty standard and thematic move.  It further restrains White's projected advance of the e-pawn, and even contemplates a blockade by ...Ne5 (though this doesn't often happen).  Further, there is the possibility of slotting in at c5 if the pawn presently there were to advance."
21,a4,a2a4,r1bqr1k1/pp1n1pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/P3P3/2N5/1P1NBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 11,That Black has not yet played forward her flank pawns does not stop White from getting in this restraining move.
22,a6,a7a6,r1bqr1k1/1p1n1pbp/p2p1np1/2pP4/P3P3/2N5/1P1NBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 12,"Thematic, though usually in this opening, Black gets it in before White's a4 advance.    But also possible was 11...Ne5!? with the idea 12.f4? Neg4! threatening a Q/R fork at e3.  After the text move,  I could have played 12.a5, but chose instead to build up the centre."
23,f4,f2f4,r1bqr1k1/1p1n1pbp/p2p1np1/2pP4/P3PP2/2N5/1P1NB1PP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 12,"This advance goes towards the central plan of breaking through in the centre, if possible.  But it also keeps the Black Knight out of e5."
24,Rb8,a8b8,1rbqr1k1/1p1n1pbp/p2p1np1/2pP4/P3PP2/2N5/1P1NB1PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 13,At this point we leave the GK engine's opening book.  The rook supports an advance by Black's b-pawn.
25,Kh1,g1h1,1rbqr1k1/1p1n1pbp/p2p1np1/2pP4/P3PP2/2N5/1P1NB1PP/R1BQ1R1K b - - 2 13,"[!?]  Now, why did I play this?  All sorts of moves come to mind to play here, but I chose this non-committal - almost a 'waiting' move - for reasons that I can no longer recall to memory!  Very likely it had something to do with the possibility of a bishop check at d4 (or a queen at b6), but why it should have worried me at this point is hard to fathom.  I hadn't yet foreseen the way this game would go... I suspect I had seen something similar in a recent game, and thought it would be appropriate here."
26,b6,b7b6,1rbqr1k1/3n1pbp/pp1p1np1/2pP4/P3PP2/2N5/1P1NB1PP/R1BQ1R1K w - - 0 14,[?!] Surprisingly restrained.  I was expecting the thematic 13...b4.
27,Qc2,d1c2,1rbqr1k1/3n1pbp/pp1p1np1/2pP4/P3PP2/2N5/1PQNB1PP/R1B2R1K b - - 1 14,"Over-protecting e4, as the d2-knight will soon be heading to c4."
28,Nf8,d7f8,1rbqrnk1/5pbp/pp1p1np1/2pP4/P3PP2/2N5/1PQNB1PP/R1B2R1K w - - 2 15,"Clearing the line of the c8-bishop, with the view of bringing a knight in to g4, and again threatening a knight-fork at e3.  E.g. 15.Nc4 Bg4  16.Bxg4? Nxg4.  It is probable that  it was in view of a line such as this that I played the pragmatic Kh1 move."
29,h3,h2h3,1rbqrnk1/5pbp/pp1p1np1/2pP4/P3PP2/2N4P/1PQNB1P1/R1B2R1K b - - 0 15,Keep out!
30,Qc7,d8c7,1rb1rnk1/2q2pbp/pp1p1np1/2pP4/P3PP2/2N4P/1PQNB1P1/R1B2R1K w - - 1 16,Over-protecting the e5-point.  That is something Black always has to be aware  - and beware - of: the weakness at d6 undermining Black's centre.
31,Nc4,d2c4,1rb1rnk1/2q2pbp/pp1p1np1/2pP4/P1N1PP2/2N4P/1PQ1B1P1/R1B2R1K b - - 2 16,"At last the knight reaches its destination, from which he strikes at Black's tender point at d6."
