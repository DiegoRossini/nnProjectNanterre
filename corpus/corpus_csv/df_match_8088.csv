1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"Umm, I know this is a common opening, but I rarely ever play it. Also, in the annotation, if at any time i use [brackets], I'm asking for specific advice."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,"I usually reply to 1. Nf3 with d5 or Nc6, so i decided to mix it up a bit."
3,c3,c2c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/8/2P2N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,"This confused me. Quite a passive play, aiming to set up a pawn at d4. Normally, people would respond with 2. c5, resulting in the symettrical english position, that I hate oh so much."
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/8/2P2N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"Gain control of the center, also follows one of my other favorite openings, which i would say, but people would just tell me its a crappy opening."
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/3P4/2P2N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"Contesting the center, as expected. Taking on d4, to either post a knight which could be chased away with e5, or take with the pawn, resulting in a semi-what symmetrical position [would that be an even position for black, or advantageous for white?]"
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/2pp4/3P4/2P2N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,"Put pressure on the d4 pawn, developing the knight, and if 4. dxc5 then 4. ... e5 [good idea?]. Kind of a flipped version of QGD. Or something like that."
7,Bf4,c1f4,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/2pp4/3P1B2/2P2N2/PP2PPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,"Preventing e5, develops the bishop, and prepares e3, to further fortify the d4 pawn and develop the LSB"
8,e6,e7e6,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2pp4/3P1B2/2P2N2/PP2PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Protecting the c5 pawn, opening up my DSB, but sadly, blocking in the LSB."
9,e3,e2e3,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2pp4/3P1B2/2P1PN2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,Expected.
10,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2pp4/3P1B2/2P1PN2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,"Developing, aiming for e4 if needed, but probably not."
11,h3,h2h3,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2pp4/3P1B2/2P1PN1P/PP3PP1/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"Preventing Ng4, which would have been useful later on. [Is this too passive for white?]"
12,a6,a7a6,r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1n1pn2/2pp4/3P1B2/2P1PN1P/PP3PP1/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"Preparing b5 with the hopes of Bb7, to actually make my bishop useful"
13,Qa4,d1a4,r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1n1pn2/2pp4/Q2P1B2/2P1PN1P/PP3PP1/RN2KB1R b KQkq - 1 7,"Threatening Bb5, which will end up wrecking my queenside, and probably losing material."
14,Bd7,c8d7,r2qkb1r/1p1b1ppp/p1n1pn2/2pp4/Q2P1B2/2P1PN1P/PP3PP1/RN2KB1R w KQkq - 2 8,"Preventing Bb5, and threatening a discovered attack, which wouldn't result in much at the moment, maybe just a single pawn, which might be useful. 7. ... b5 isn't an option due to Bxb5, and i can't take back because of the unprotected rook."
15,Qb3,a4b3,r2qkb1r/1p1b1ppp/p1n1pn2/2pp4/3P1B2/1QP1PN1P/PP3PP1/RN2KB1R b KQkq - 3 8,"Retreats to avoid the discovered attack, and attacking b7. [Poisoned pawn?]"
16,b5,b7b5,r2qkb1r/3b1ppp/p1n1pn2/1ppp4/3P1B2/1QP1PN1P/PP3PP1/RN2KB1R w KQkq - 0 9,"Preventing Qxb7, and gaining control of a LOT of light squares. [Would Na5 be better here?]"
17,a3,a2a3,r2qkb1r/3b1ppp/p1n1pn2/1ppp4/3P1B2/PQP1PN1P/1P3PP1/RN2KB1R b KQkq - 0 9,"Preventing...? I don't really know. Maybe preparing a future b4, preventing me playing b4. But it blocks in the Knight on b1, which could use a3 to develop quite nicely."
18,c4,c5c4,r2qkb1r/3b1ppp/p1n1pn2/1p1p4/2pP1B2/PQP1PN1P/1P3PP1/RN2KB1R w KQkq - 0 10,"And now the light squares belong to me. However, he does control a lot of dark squares, but he can't access them as well as I can access the Light Squares."
19,Qc2,b3c2,r2qkb1r/3b1ppp/p1n1pn2/1p1p4/2pP1B2/P1P1PN1P/1PQ2PP1/RN2KB1R b KQkq - 1 10,"Retreats, but aims at h7. Oh and did i mention i got quite a bit more space than he does?"
20,g6,g7g6,r2qkb1r/3b1p1p/p1n1pnp1/1p1p4/2pP1B2/P1P1PN1P/1PQ2PP1/RN2KB1R w KQkq - 0 11,"Preparing to fianchetto my bishop to g7. I viewed this as better than Be7 because it fortifies the kingside, and it is slightly more active than on e7. Plus it keeps the option of Ne7 followed by Nf5 or something like that. It also keeps the e7 square open for the queen, which can't use c7 due to whites DSB. [Which is better?]"
