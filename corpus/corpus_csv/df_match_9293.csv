I begin the game with my standard 1.e4 looking for a fight."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Black plays the beginning of a Sicilian indicating a reciprocal desire to fight. This opening provides an unbalanced position which provides both sides opportunities for play.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Following the standard main line of the Sicilian. The knight is played for development and for center control.
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"Fletch2280 steps out of the standard book move of [2... Nc6, d6]. The text move begins the fianchetto position typical of a Dragon, but without the normal move sequence. This move does not offer an advantage because it is a tempo behind the action that takes place at d4 after [3. d4]."
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,Fletch2280 makes an out of sequence move which attacks the e4 pawn. Better perhaps is [3...cxd4  4.Nxd4 Nf6  5.Nc3].
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppp1p/5np1/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,Fletch2280 makes an out of sequence move which attacks the e4 pawn. Better perhaps is [3...cxd4  4.Nxd4 Nf6  5.Nc3].
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppp1p/5np1/2p5/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,Protecting the e4 pawn. There is little fear from [4...cxd4] because of [5.Nxd4].
8,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppp1p/5np1/8/3pP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"The recapture with the knight seems more appropriate than with the queen because of [5...Nc6]. It is true that if instead [5.Qxd4 Nc6] there could follow [6.Qa4], but this seems to offer little positional advantage and the queen is played off sides and not able to influence the center files d and e effectively."
9,Nxd4,f3d4,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppp1p/5np1/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"The recapture with the knight seems more appropriate than with the queen because of [5...Nc6]. It is true that if instead [5.Qxd4 Nc6] there could follow [6.Qa4], but this seems to offer little positional advantage and the queen is played off sides and not able to influence the center files d and e effectively."
10,e5,e7e5,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1p1p/5np1/4p3/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,This move attacks the knight and should be okay if followed by [6...d6].  The idea [6.Bg5 exd4  7.Qxd4] where the pinned knight is recaptured by force fails to [6...h6  7.Bh4 g5] and the pin is broken.
11,Ndb5,d4b5,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1p1p/5np1/1N2p3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"Played by Kasparov in many Sicilians, this move presents the tactical attack on d6 where if [7.Nd6 Bxd6  8.Qxd6] and black finds unbearable positional pressure with no kingside castling and no easy counterattack."
12,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk2r/pp1p1p1p/5np1/1N2p3/1b2P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 7,"A positional blunder. This move overlooks the tempo gained by [7.Nd6 ], and the followup positional pressure that white is able to maintain."
13,Nd6+,b5d6,rnbqk2r/pp1p1p1p/3N1np1/4p3/1b2P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 7,
14,Bxd6,b4d6,rnbqk2r/pp1p1p1p/3b1np1/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,
15,Qxd6,d1d6,rnbqk2r/pp1p1p1p/3Q1np1/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 8,"What options are available for black at this point?  Consider [8...Qb6  9.Nb5! Qxd6  10.Nxd6 ] if then [10...Kd8 to protect the bishop, then [11.Nxf7 !] and the rook is lost. Not effective for black is [8...Qb6  8.Nb5! a6?  9.Nc7 ]. No better is expecting [8...Qe7  9.Qxe7 Kxe7], because there is still the knight move [8...Qe7 9.Nb4! a6?  10.Nc7  Kf8  11.Qxe7  Kxe7  12.Nxa8] and white stands better. Another bad try [8...a6  9.Bg5!] and the knight is both pinned and lost with a queen attack pending and mate to follow. The real problem for black in this position is the serious bind placed on the d and f pawns, the lack of development, lack of a black squared bishop. The text [8...Nc6] is an attempt to clear some pieces on the back rank to activate the rook, but there is not enough time."
16,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk2r/pp1p1p1p/2nQ1np1/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 1 9,
17,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqk2r/pp1p1p1p/2nQ1np1/1B2p3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 2 9,Here I overlook completely the better [9.Bb5!]. The text move does little to contribute to the attack.
18,h5,h7h5,r1bqk2r/pp1p1p2/2nQ1np1/1B2p2p/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 0 10,A blunder because the knight needed to be safeguarded against the pin by 9...h6]. Even a move like [9...Qe7] would have been better. I am very happy to see this move.
19,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqk2r/pp1p1p2/2nQ1np1/1B2p1Bp/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 1 10,I finally find the correct idea and place the bishop accordingly.
20,Nxe4,f6e4,r1bqk2r/pp1p1p2/2nQ2p1/1B2p1Bp/4n3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 11,"This move is a blunder. Fritz7 suggests the line [10... Qe7 {desperation} 11. Qxe7  Kxe7 12. Nd5  Ke6 13. Bxf6 Rh7] gaining a piece. The text move has the appearance of mixing it up with tactics, but all the tactics favor white."
21,Nxe4,c3e4,r1bqk2r/pp1p1p2/2nQ2p1/1B2p1Bp/4N3/8/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 0 11,Eliminating the threat while protecting the bishop.
