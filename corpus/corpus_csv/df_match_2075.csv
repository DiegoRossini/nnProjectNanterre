1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,I like to start games slow and safe. Losing in the opening is never a satisfying experience.
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,"I found this move immediately odd - developing the minor pieces seems much more logical. I see Black's idea though: he wants to cut off my knight from the flight square g5 in the case of a future e4 push and to take away the g5 square from my dark-squared bishop. But then again, the dark squared bishop is not used early in the game in the King's Indian Attack."

9,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkbnr/ppp2pp1/2n4p/3pp3/8/3P1NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 5,I thought this was an interesting choice: it almost appeared that black was wanting to castle queenside.
10,Be6,c8e6,r2qkbnr/ppp2pp1/2n1b2p/3pp3/8/3P1NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 6,I thought this was an interesting choice: it almost appeared that black was wanting to castle queenside.

13,Re1,f1e1,r3kbnr/pppq1pp1/2n1b2p/3pp3/8/3P1NP1/PPPNPPBP/R1BQR1K1 b kq - 5 7,"Well, the idea about castling queenside is finished. I wondered why he activated his queenside early instead of his kingside - seemed a bit counter-intuitive."
14,Rd8,a8d8,3rkbnr/pppq1pp1/2n1b2p/3pp3/8/3P1NP1/PPPNPPBP/R1BQR1K1 w k - 6 8,"Well, the idea about castling queenside is finished. I wondered why he activated his queenside early instead of his kingside - seemed a bit counter-intuitive."

Also, the queenside seemed like the most desirable place to attack since the center was closed and the kingside appeared to be well-guarded."
