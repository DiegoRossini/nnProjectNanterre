1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This move has been played against me a couple of times recently and though at first I was a bit taken aback I rather like playing against it now. Symmetrical English positions aren't usually my happiest hunting ground but with e4 systems I really quite enjoy them

6,e5,e7e5,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n5/2p1p3/2P1P3/1P6/P2P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,This is rarely good in these English structures. A general rule is to maintain the tension with d3 with whoever either captures and resolves the position first normally having the inferior pawn structure. By playing exf5 the backward White d pawn is a bit more vulnerable and Black gains activity for his pieces.

12,Bxf5,c8f5,r2qkbnr/pp4pp/2np4/2p1pb2/2P5/1PN5/PB1P1PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,This feels wrong. White is lagging in development and his king is very liable o get caught in the middle or the f pawn getting attacked if he wastes tempi

The fact that White's bishop gets centralised isn't too relevant as if the knight develops before the bishop retreats to g2 then Bh3 and Bg5 cement the White's king in the exposed centre.

24,Bh3,f5h3,r2q1r1k/pp2b1pp/2np4/2pBp3/2P5/1P1P2Pb/PB2NP1P/R2QK2R w KQ - 3 13,"Very anti-positional as opening the e file just makes White's defensive task harder. No moves look much better though with Qc2 running into Nb4 and Qd2 into Bg5, f4, Bh6 with pressure. It's very hard to find a means to coordinate the White pieces at this point."
25,f4,f2f4,r2q1r1k/pp2b1pp/2np4/2pBp3/2P2P2/1P1P2Pb/PB2N2P/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 13,"Very anti-positional as opening the e file just makes White's defensive task harder.

27,fxe5,f4e5,r2q1r1k/pp2b1pp/3p4/2pBP3/2Pn4/1P1P2Pb/PB2N2P/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 14,This isn't good either as the d3 pawn is now very weak in the long term and more importantly the rook on f8 is potentially going to cause havoc on the open file that can;t be contested.

1. Qc2, Be3, Bc1??, Qf1+!, Rxf1, Rxf1+, Ke2, Rf2+ picking up a clear rook as the king can't get to the queen (Kd1, Bg4+) 

2. Qc2, Be3, Bxa8, Rxa8, and the king can't flee to the queenside now because Qf3+ can always meet Kd1. Without this resource Black can just play Re8 and pick the king off. 

3. Qe2 fails to Bg4! (Qh6 with the idea of Be3 and Rf2 isn't clear as Bxa8 buys White some time in this line and the king may be able to run via d1 to safety) after which Qc2, Rae8, Bc1, Qf3!, Rg1, Bxc1 and there is no defence to both Qf2 and Qe3)."
