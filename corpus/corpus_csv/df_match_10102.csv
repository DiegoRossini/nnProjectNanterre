1,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I start off slowly with a single move forward. It'll release my bishop and queen to open a can of whoop ass on Bird.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Bird fires stright back with a big pawn push. No real concern at this time.
3,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B5/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,"I move into an open position to give attacking options, I expect him to threaten it with his pawn currently on B7"
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/2B5/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 3,"Aye, well, the old boy has played a good move there and has killed off my attack. I cannae take that pawn because his queen will eat me."
5,Bb5+,c4b5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/1B1pp3/8/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 3,I move in for a cheeky check. Try and convince him (and myself) that I can play an attacking game.
6,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2p5/1B1pp3/8/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 4,It was a mistake.... I anticipated this move but never really thought about the consequences.
7,Ba4,b5a4,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2p5/3pp3/B7/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 4,In a panic and running. Here was another mistake and I'll be punished for it.
8,b5,b7b5,rnbqkbnr/p4ppp/2p5/1p1pp3/B7/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,I'm buggered.
9,Bb3,a4b3,rnbqkbnr/p4ppp/2p5/1p1pp3/8/1B2P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 5,Out of harms way for now but I'm pinned here and he knows it.
10,Be6,c8e6,rn1qkbnr/p4ppp/2p1b3/1p1pp3/8/1B2P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 6,"Not really sure what he's upto, but I'll try and bait his bishop into a trap."
11,h4,h2h4,rn1qkbnr/p4ppp/2p1b3/1p1pp3/7P/1B2P3/PPPP1PP1/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 6,"I've opened a route for my wee castle to get out if needed, Birds speciality is nipping down the side and cleaning out your back corners."
12,c5,c6c5,rn1qkbnr/p4ppp/4b3/1pppp3/7P/1B2P3/PPPP1PP1/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 7,I see what he was doing now but its too late to do anything about it. I'll try a move away from that area of the board to try and distract him.
13,Nf3,g1f3,rn1qkbnr/p4ppp/4b3/1pppp3/7P/1B2PN2/PPPP1PP1/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,Genius
