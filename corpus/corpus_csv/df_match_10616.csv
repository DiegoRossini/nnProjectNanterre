1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I played this game at a tournament at LAX Hilton in Los Angeles. White and I were both in the running for second in the U1800 section.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"This is the most common response to e4. Slightly less common are e5, e6, and c6."
3,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,The most common move is Nf3. This variation is somewhat dubious since it's too early to decide where the bishop should be developed. But there is nothing totally wrong with early Bc4 since it could transpose to a Sozin Attack.
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 3,"I usually play d6 on the second move, but I think this is slightly more accurate since it blocks the bishop's path to f7, while I also have an idea of playing d5."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 3,White blocks d5 and has good control over the light squares.
6,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/3pp3/2p5/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 4,"Although White already has three pieces developed, my central structure is quite solid, so White's development lead isn't as important as it would be if the center was open"
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/3pp3/2p5/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"Although White already has three pieces developed, my central structure is quite solid, so White's development lead isn't as important as it would be if the center was open"
8,a6,a7a6,rnbqkbnr/1p3ppp/p2pp3/2p5/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"Nf6 I think is sharper. I don't think this is very necessary. I wanted to play b5 next move, but then decided not to. You should always have a plan and don't keep changing your plans every move. My position is somewhat passive and underdeveloped, so overextending with b5 may not be a good idea"
9,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/1p3ppp/p2pp3/2p5/2BPP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,White wants to open the position to capitalize on his lead in development
10,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/1p3ppp/p2pp3/8/2BpP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"Now this has transposed into some kind of Sozin Attack. If I play Nf6 here, then it will transpose into the main line of Sozin. I'm not familiar with the main line, so I tried some different moves."
11,Nxd4,f3d4,rnbqkbnr/1p3ppp/p2pp3/8/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"Now this has transposed into some kind of Sozin Attack. If I play Nf6 here, then it will transpose into the main line of Sozin. I'm not familiar with the main line, so I tried some different moves."
12,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk1nr/1p2bppp/p2pp3/8/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 7,"Some may question my passively played opening. I don't think there's anything wrong with playing passive if your position is solid, but you need to be prepared for razor-sharp moves like White's next"
13,f4,f2f4,rnbqk1nr/1p2bppp/p2pp3/8/2BNPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,"Some may question my passively played opening. I don't think there's anything wrong with playing passive if your position is solid, but you need to be prepared for razor-sharp moves like White's next"
14,Nd7,b8d7,r1bqk1nr/1p1nbppp/p2pp3/8/2BNPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 8,"Some may question my passively played opening. I don't think there's anything wrong with playing passive if your position is solid, but you need to be prepared for razor-sharp moves like White's next"
15,Bxe6,c4e6,r1bqk1nr/1p1nbppp/p2pB3/8/3NPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,"White sacrifices a piece to severely weaken my position, so that it isn't solid anymore."
16,fxe6,f7e6,r1bqk1nr/1p1nb1pp/p2pp3/8/3NPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,"Here I think Bd2 is better than Nxg7  because my queen is misplaced and the knights will be strong on e6 and d5, attacking my c7 weakness. After the knight gives check, the knight can no longer post itself on e6, so it isn't a strong attacker anymore"
17,Nxe6,d4e6,r1bqk1nr/1p1nb1pp/p2pN3/8/4PP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 9,"Here I think Bd2 is better than Nxg7  because my queen is misplaced and the knights will be strong on e6 and d5, attacking my c7 weakness. After the knight gives check, the knight can no longer post itself on e6, so it isn't a strong attacker anymore"
18,Qa5,d8a5,r1b1k1nr/1p1nb1pp/p2pN3/q7/4PP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 10,"Here I think Bd2 is better than Nxg7  because my queen is misplaced and the knights will be strong on e6 and d5, attacking my c7 weakness.

19,Nxg7+,e6g7,r1b1k1nr/1p1nb1Np/p2p4/q7/4PP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 10,"Here I think Bd2 is better than Nxg7  because my queen is misplaced and the knights will be strong on e6 and d5, attacking my c7 weakness.

20,Kf7,e8f7,r1b3nr/1p1nbkNp/p2p4/q7/4PP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 1 11,I wasn't comfortable with Kf8 or Kd8 since White has another check with Ne6
21,Nf5,g7f5,r1b3nr/1p1nbk1p/p2p4/q4N2/4PP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 2 11,"Now White has three pawns for the piece, which gives a major imbalance to the position. It's hard to tell who is better here, but I would prefer my position since a piece in the opening is usually better than three pawns. The three pawns are usually only better than the piece in endgames."
22,Ngf6,g8f6,r1b4r/1p1nbk1p/p2p1n2/q4N2/4PP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 3 12,This blocks a dangerous Qh5 check.
23,Nxd6+,f5d6,r1b4r/1p1nbk1p/p2N1n2/q7/4PP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 12,"I was relieved when White took the pawn, because it's usually good for the defending side to trade passive pieces for the attacker's active pieces."
24,Bxd6,e7d6,r1b4r/1p1n1k1p/p2b1n2/q7/4PP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 13,"Here I was happy with my position since my king is pretty much safe, and I have a slight lead in development."

27,Qd5+,d6d5,r1b4r/1p1n1k1p/p7/q2Q4/4nP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 1 14,"Since pawns are worth more in the endgame, White wants to trade queens to increase the power of his 6 to 3 majority of overall pawns."
28,Qxd5,a5d5,r1b4r/1p1n1k1p/p7/3q4/4nP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 0 15,My bishop should be strong on the long diagonal since White can no longer block it with f3.
29,Nxd5,c3d5,r1b4r/1p1n1k1p/p7/3N4/4nP2/8/PPP3PP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 0 15,My bishop should be strong on the long diagonal since White can no longer block it with f3.

31,O-O,e1g1,r1b4r/3n1k1p/p7/1p1N4/4nP2/8/PPP3PP/R1B2RK1 b - - 1 16,"It's usually better to have your king in the center during the endgame, but it's uncertain whether this can be considered an endgame. There are still many pieces on the board, so this is just a middlegame without queens."
