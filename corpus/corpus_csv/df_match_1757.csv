1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Manfred12g and I are old chess rivals and GK friends I feel. If I am ever in Australia I plan on checking out his Farm full of wildlife down there. But our games can be tough and bloody. He has a very direct and in your face approach which can be daunting but over time I have begun to learn to roll with the punches and let the chips fall and then see what happens. I am not too aggressive in the early part of the game myself and tend to wait for my opponent to make some error in their haste, and that often happens at my level of play where we 1200 to 1500ish player have a few tricks up our sleeves but not enough to work the miracles we envision at the start. He starts with E4."
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I go for the Caro-Kann as from experience I know manfred's style favors me playing E5 and him coming in like a battering ram. This sort of throws off the game of players like that and I have played enough to not be lost by the odd looking boards about ten moves in.
3,a3,a2a3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/P7/1PPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,I do not know what is up here. I would figure E5 or KnC3. I continue with the line as I know it.
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4P3/P7/1PPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"The advance variation which used to frustrate me, but now can lead into a sort of French Defense set up with a little work."
5,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pP3/8/P7/1PPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"The advance variation which used to frustrate me, but now can lead into a sort of French Defense set up with a little work."
6,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pPb2/8/P7/1PPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"This keeps the pawn from advancing more and, more importantly, frees up the LS bishop that can get trapped and rendered impotent later in the game. Typically there will be an exchange later and best not to try and resist it too much."
7,d4,d2d4,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pPb2/3P4/P7/1PP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,It winds up looking like a typical caro- kann only it is all one move behind because of his pawn to A3 mover earlier.
8,e6,e7e6,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3pPb2/3P4/P7/1PP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,This just following the line as I learned it from videos and databases.
9,Nf3,g1f3,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3pPb2/3P4/P4N2/1PP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"Over time I find I favor this move. Now the game has transposed somewhat into a French Defense only with the
LS bishop freed. I saw this on a video by Dereque Kelley on YouTube. It opened my eyes to how lines of play are inter- connected at times. I knew that in a way, but never saw it. Before."
10,c5,c6c5,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppPb2/3P4/P4N2/1PP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Over time I find I favor this move. Now the game has transposed somewhat into a French Defense only with the

11,Bb5+,f1b5,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/1BppPb2/3P4/P4N2/1PP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"This is something one has to learn to live with when playing the FD. It is pesky really and the only way to avoid it is to move pawn to A6 earlier, but the book more or less says not to worry about it and let it play out.  I guess. In a real FD and not a CK mutation game one would trade off LS bishops here, and white has in a way helped black by getting rid of the bishop that would otherwise be trapped and prevent a Queenside castle if needed later."
12,Nc6,b8c6,r2qkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/1BppPb2/3P4/P4N2/1PP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 7,I think maybe taking the knight before castling would have been a little better for white. Gives me a little time to sort things out and prevent doubling up pawns maybe.
13,O-O,e1g1,r2qkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/1BppPb2/3P4/P4N2/1PP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 3 7,I think maybe taking the knight before castling would have been a little better for white. Gives me a little time to sort things out and prevent doubling up pawns maybe.
14,Nge7,g8e7,r2qkb1r/pp2nppp/2n1p3/1BppPb2/3P4/P4N2/1PP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 4 8,I think maybe taking the knight before castling would have been a little better for white. Gives me a little time to sort things out and prevent doubling up pawns maybe.
15,dxc5,d4c5,r2qkb1r/pp2nppp/2n1p3/1BPpPb2/8/P4N2/1PP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,This actually works out better for me as I will avoid doubled pawns by taking with my B7 pawn after the piece exchange that I know is coming. 9 out of 10 people will take the exchange and one has to learn to accept it and see that is not necessarily a negative thing for black in this set up.
16,a6,a7a6,r2qkb1r/1p2nppp/p1n1p3/1BPpPb2/8/P4N2/1PP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 9,"Here I think white retreating a bit and trading off bishops may have been better. But some players hate to retreat or be pushed back a square or forced into exchanging pieces and will resist with tenacity in having to do something they do not want to do, even when it is the better thing. But this is okay too I suppose though I would like to keep the knight there there is no real reason now, as the E5 pawn it is to pressure is no longer there."
17,Bxc6+,b5c6,r2qkb1r/1p2nppp/p1B1p3/2PpPb2/8/P4N2/1PP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 9,"Here I think white retreating a bit and trading off bishops may have been better.

It does not fluctuate much game to game and of course there are many other players like this. I think the idea is to ""simplify"" the board by taking pieces off of it, but of course that does not simplify anything and can only make things more complicated in the end game for the slightly weaker player."
19,Bg5,c1g5,r2qkb1r/4nppp/p1p1p3/2PpPbB1/8/P4N2/1PP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 1 10,"This is manfred's style really and over time I have adjusted to it.

21,Bxe7,g5e7,r2qkb1r/4Bpp1/p1p1p2p/2PpPb2/8/P4N2/1PP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 0 11,"Here white can retreat a bit with the knowledge he weakened black's castled position but many people do exactly this and by ten or so moves into the game have decided that a bishop pair in the end game is not something they need. I begin to think that there is an idea that some players want to kill off the other guy's knights for some reason, when a bishop pair at the end is considered the bigger threat."
22,Bxe7,f8e7,r2qk2r/4bpp1/p1p1p2p/2PpPb2/8/P4N2/1PP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 0 12,"Again, the trade off helps me to castle sooner. So do not panic with equal exchange players. It is when you are losing a pawn and a piece for a piece, or losing position and territory for a piece that you really must fret. It can be annoying but not really that much if you go through it over and over."
23,c3,c2c3,r2qk2r/4bpp1/p1p1p2p/2PpPb2/8/P1P2N2/1P3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 0 12,I was thinking he would do pawn to B4.
24,Bxc5,e7c5,r2qk2r/5pp1/p1p1p2p/2bpPb2/8/P1P2N2/1P3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 0 13,It would have worked better to guard the pawn than to just attack a piece that can easily retreat to a new position here.

27,Nbd2,b1d2,r2qk2r/5pp1/pbp1p2p/3pPb2/1P6/P1P2N2/3N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 2 14,"I begin to think I might be keeping my LS bishop here. Not common to keep it in the CK. That is Caro-Kann, not Calvin Klein, okay?"
