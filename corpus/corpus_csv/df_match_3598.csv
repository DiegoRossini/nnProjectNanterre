1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Today we get to see what happens when you don't make a simple safety check before each and every move! Especially in a long format like here on GK where you have plenty of time for each move, there's no reason to have to rely on your calculations from a move ago--check again! In this game, I miss a couple of simple tactics and pay for it dearly. Enjoy!"
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"?! The fun but dubious Latvian Gambit. I have a large number of annotations that go into more detail about this opening, so I won't cover it in-depth here."

5,Nxe5,f3e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4Np2/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,This is the main line.
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/2n5/4Np2/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,?! The Fraser Variation. More common are 3...Qf6 or 3...Nf6.
7,Qh5+,d1h5,r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/2n5/4Np1Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 2 4,"?! Unusual. At this point it's usually better for White to simply win the Rook and then ride out whatever attack Black can produce, ie. after 5.Nxg6 Nf6 6.Qh3 hxg6 7.Qxh8 Qe7."
8,g6,g7g6,r1bqkbnr/pppp3p/2n3p1/4Np1Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"?! Unusual. At this point it's usually better for White to simply win the Rook and then ride out whatever attack Black can produce, ie. after 5.Nxg6 Nf6 6.Qh3 hxg6 7.Qxh8 Qe7."

10,dxc6,d7c6,r1bqkbnr/ppp4p/2p3p1/5p1Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"?! Preparing to castle as well as putting pressure on f5. White doesn't want to allow Black to develop his Bishops with tempo (ie. 7.exf5? Bxf5), for sure, though this move also stifles White's own DSB. I think 7.Nc3 or 7.d3 would have been simpler here."
11,Qf3,h5f3,r1bqkbnr/ppp4p/2p3p1/5p2/4P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"?! Preparing to castle as well as putting pressure on f5. White doesn't want to allow Black to develop his Bishops with tempo (ie. 7.exf5? Bxf5), for sure, though this move also stifles White's own DSB. I think 7.Nc3 or 7.d3 would have been simpler here."

The trade is even materially, but it releases the tension and frees White's pieces while creating some problems for Black. 8...Bd7 was better, preparing for queenside castling."
15,O-O,e1g1,r1b1kb1r/ppp1q2p/2p2np1/5p2/4P3/3B1Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 5 8,"? I thought a while about this one and ultimately I think I made the wrong choice.

23,Re1,e4e1,2kr1b1r/ppp1q2p/2p1b1p1/8/8/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1R1K1 b - - 2 12,"I think 12.Qe3 would have been a stronger alternative. This allows potential tactics down the e-file for Black. Obviously something had to be done to prevent ...Bd5, winning, but this move was needlessly passive in my opinion. Also good were 12.Nc3 or even better, 12.c4."

29,Qe3,f3e3,2kr1r2/ppp3bp/2pqb1p1/8/8/2NPQ3/PPP2PPP/R1B1R1K1 b - - 2 15,"?? No safety check. The idea is that White cannot retake on f2 because of 16...Bd4! and Black will give a Rook and Bishop for a Queen and pawn, the initiative, and vastly superior activity, but I overlooked a critical intermezzo, which would have been easy to catch if I'd only looked... Not to mention that 16.Qxf2 Bd4 17.Be3 Rf8 just loses a piece anyway, for basically no compensation (good catch tiger_lilov)"

32,Qxe6,d6e6,2kr4/ppp3bp/2p1q1p1/8/8/2NP4/PPP2rPP/R1B1R1K1 w - - 0 17,"?! Black must make the absolute most of his 2nd-rank Rook if he is to stay in the game. He still has a slight advantage in activity, but this move gives up his initiative--I think 18...Bxe3 19.Rxe3 Rxc2 20.Rb1 Rd2 would have been much better."

41,Re7,e6e7,2k5/ppp1R2p/2p3p1/8/4N3/3r4/PPr3PP/R5K1 b - - 1 21,"! White locks the BK out (for now, though of course he can eventually bring himself to bear via ...b6, Kb7-a6-b5 etc) and places his own Rook on the seventh rank, choosing aggressive trades rather than passive defense, which is always the correct choice when slightly ahead in a Rook endgame. White also sets a trap..."
