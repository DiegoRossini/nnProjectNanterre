1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This is from a tournament game. My first tournament in the advanced class. I decided to annotate this game for posterity as it took my rating over 1600 for the first time ever. There are a number of mistakes on both sides but in the end it was pretty close
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,D4 is my preferred opening as white. I suspect I may have to change that if my rating continues to rise. Up to know it has served me well partly I suspect as some of my opponents don't know it as well as other openings
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Tries to pressure me into either a3 or Bd2
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,Tries to pressure me into either a3 or Bd2
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 3,Tries to pressure me into either a3 or Bd2
6,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 3 4,Tries to pressure me into either a3 or Bd2
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 4 4,"I ignore the pressure and continue to develop  as I normally do. In the past Bxc3,bxc3 has often proved to my advantage despite the weaker pawn structure as the doubled pawns have given me more influence over the centre"
8,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 5 5,Looking at h7 but also allows me to prevent my pawns being doubled if he takes my knight. I normally move e3 too which defends both my c and d pawns
9,Qc2,d1c2,rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N2N2/PPQ1PPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQ - 6 5,Looking at h7 but also allows me to prevent my pawns being doubled if he takes my knight. I normally move e3 too which defends both my c and d pawns
10,d5,d7d5,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/1bPP4/2N2N2/PPQ1PPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ - 0 6,Trying to seize the initiative and attacking my undefended c pawn
11,a3,a2a3,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/1bPP4/P1N2N2/1PQ1PPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQ - 0 6,Attack is the best form of defence they say though I am still not sure if c5 would have been better here. I was reluctant to take his d pawn as it would give a half open e file to my still uncastled king
12,Bxc3+,b4c3,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/P1b2N2/1PQ1PPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ - 0 7,"I'm not sure this was wise as black loses his best developed peice, though it does prevent a loss of tempo"
13,Qxc3,c2c3,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/P1Q2N2/1P2PPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQ - 0 7,A strong outpost for the knight which is difficult to shift
14,Ne4,f6e4,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PPn3/P1Q2N2/1P2PPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ - 1 8,A strong outpost for the knight which is difficult to shift
15,Qc2,c3c2,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PPn3/P4N2/1PQ1PPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQ - 2 8,"Loses a tempo, however this seems the best place for my queen, putting it on d3 will restrict my lsb, similarly Qb3 will block my b pawn"
16,Nd7,b8d7,r1bq1rk1/pppn1ppp/4p3/3p4/2PPn3/P4N2/1PQ1PPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ - 3 9,Blocks in the lsb completely and slightly restricts the queen. Is this a sign of a forthcoming pawn storm on the queens side?
17,Bf4,c1f4,r1bq1rk1/pppn1ppp/4p3/3p4/2PPnB2/P4N2/1PQ1PPPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 4 9,Allows me to finally move e3 and may restrict his a rook a little if the pawn storm materialises
18,c6,c7c6,r1bq1rk1/pp1n1ppp/2p1p3/3p4/2PPnB2/P4N2/1PQ1PPPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 0 10,"This seems a very passive move to me though it gives the queen a little more room to move, I think I would have been tempted by c5"
19,e3,e2e3,r1bq1rk1/pp1n1ppp/2p1p3/3p4/2PPnB2/P3PN2/1PQ2PPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 0 10,"I'm not clear why he did this, presumably an attempt to get me to move my king with something like 11: Nd2, Nxd2  12: Qxd2, Qxd2  13:Kxd2"
20,Qa5+,d8a5,r1b2rk1/pp1n1ppp/2p1p3/q2p4/2PPnB2/P3PN2/1PQ2PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 1 11,"I'm not clear why he did this, presumably an attempt to get me to move my king with something like 11: Nd2, Nxd2  12: Qxd2, Qxd2  13:Kxd2"
21,b4,b2b4,r1b2rk1/pp1n1ppp/2p1p3/q2p4/1PPPnB2/P3PN2/2Q2PPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 0 11,This is exactly why Qc2 was probably the best move at move 8
22,Qd8,a5d8,r1bq1rk1/pp1n1ppp/2p1p3/3p4/1PPPnB2/P3PN2/2Q2PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 1 12,"Pretty much the only option, so black has lost tempo and still can't develop his lsb"
23,Bd3,f1d3,r1bq1rk1/pp1n1ppp/2p1p3/3p4/1PPPnB2/P2BPN2/2Q2PPP/R3K2R b KQ - 2 12,As well as pressuring his knight I can now (finally) castle
24,Ndf6,d7f6,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/1PPPnB2/P2BPN2/2Q2PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 3 13,Black seems a little cramped now. it's still going to take him a couple of moves to complete his development
25,O-O,e1g1,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/1PPPnB2/P2BPN2/2Q2PPP/R4RK1 b - - 4 13,"That completes my development and links my rooks. I have a nice line of pawns on b,c and d, ready to push forward, a reasonable diagonal for my dsb - h2-b1 and my queen and lsb are aiming straight at h7. My knight has a number of options, such as e5 and g5. at e5 it would be difficult to move and would cramp black further, though it would block my dsb's diagonal"
26,Bd7,c8d7,r2q1rk1/pp1b1ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/1PPPnB2/P2BPN2/2Q2PPP/R4RK1 w - - 5 14,The predicted pawn storm isn't forthcoming so I threaten one of my own
