At this point I started thinking. The board is opening up in the center. And I really would like to save that dark squared bishop. And I spot a way to do that."

I was thinking he'd take the knight Nxd4 then Bxe5 forks knight and queen. Note that I had missed that Qe3 then would have made me loose material (2 pawns for a knight.) since I can't take the knight because I would have lost my queen. Actually here he can take my knight with his queen straight away. And I would have lost a knight for only one pawn. This is a really silly move. More to come."

33,Qh6,f4h6,r1b1qBk1/1pp2p1p/p3nbpQ/4Pp2/8/P4N2/1PP2PPP/R2K3R b - - 3 17,Seems my opponent doesnt want the bishop exchange either. Maybe he is also thinking about having bishops in a fairly open game.

38,Bd7,c8d7,r3q1kb/1ppb1p1p/4n1pQ/p3Pp2/8/P1B2N2/1PP2PPP/R2K3R w - - 2 20,"this is a free pawn, but..."

41,Ke2,d1e2,r3q1kb/1p1b1p1p/4n1pQ/p1p1Pp2/P7/2B2N2/1PP1KPPP/R6R b - - 1 21,I think this was just to link his rooks.
42,Bc6,d7c6,r3q1kb/1p3p1p/2b1n1pQ/p1p1Pp2/P7/2B2N2/1PP1KPPP/R6R w - - 2 22,This is the proof. I hadn't spotted the fact that the a4 pawn is loose.
