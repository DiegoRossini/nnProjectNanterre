1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"White indicated he was interested in playing the Benoni with me, rather than the Sicilian."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"However, I am not entirely prepared with the Benoni, so I decide to mirror his opening move and see what the master player has in mind. I am hoping for a QG game, as I'm pretty good there as well. 

In this game, because of the next few decisions stay fixed for much of the game resulting in a relatively closed game."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Queens gambit! White applies immediate pressure to the d5 pawn. Black has various choices here, in no particular order: dxc4 (QGA), e6 (QGD), Nf3 (Marshall), c6 (Slav, after c6), among others. I've not studied all of these well enough. I've reviewed Marshall (Nf3), but have spent more time with either QGA (dxc4) or QGD (e6). 

In addition, given my opponent's rating he could probably play these positions blindfolded, so I thought maybe playing something this typical might produce a complacent move. Let's see how it turns out."
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"QG declined. Black decides to not accept the pawn at c4 and instead moves to defend d5. Cramping a bit the LSB, but he'll be ok with it in a while."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,Normal developing move pressuring the d5 pawn.
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,and black responds counter with the same move. Pressure mounting.
7,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 3 4,White pins the knight to the Queen reducing the defense on d5 and threatening to double the pawns on the file spoiling a kingside castle.
8,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 4 5,"further development for black, removes the benefit for white to exchange at f6 and moves closer to the castle."
9,e3,e2e3,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"this move further supports the d4 pawn, but more importantly opens lines or the LSB and Queen. Specifically, the LSB now defends the c4 pawn and the Queen line prevents black from moving Ng4 anytime soon."
10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR w KQ - 1 6,castle
11,Nf3,g1f3,rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 2 6,normal development
12,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bq1rk1/pppnbppp/4pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 3 7,"I debated here whether to move Nd7 (Orthodox defense) or h6 (Neo Orthodox). I decided on the Orthodox even though it is a bit more cramped. 

I am not as strong with knights as I would like to be. In fact, in general I do not like knights at all, not my favorite piece. The Orthodox line depends on piece exchange for black to stay in the game and I figured this would be one way to remove those pesky critter knights. :)"
13,cxd5,c4d5,r1bq1rk1/pppnbppp/4pn2/3P2B1/3P4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 7,"so the opening attack begins, white strikes first at the center!"
14,Nxd5,f6d5,r1bq1rk1/pppnbppp/4p3/3n2B1/3P4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 8,black retakes offering up his first knight!
15,Bxe7,g5e7,r1bq1rk1/pppnBppp/4p3/3n4/3P4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 8,Nice bishop fork.
16,Qxe7,d8e7,r1b2rk1/pppnqppp/4p3/3n4/3P4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 9,"Good exchange for white. The white DSB was less valuable then the black DSB given center pawn structure. Now black is stuck with a LSB that can't move easily, while white has a nice line for his LSB."
17,Nxd5,c3d5,r1b2rk1/pppnqppp/4p3/3N4/3P4/4PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 9,"one knight down, three to go."
18,exd5,e6d5,r1b2rk1/pppnqppp/8/3p4/3P4/4PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 10,"two knights down, two more to go! I'm loving life right now. I simply don't like them."
19,Bd3,f1d3,r1b2rk1/pppnqppp/8/3p4/3P4/3BPN2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 1 10,The white LSB opens up his look and gives white the option to castle.
20,Nf6,d7f6,r1b2rk1/ppp1qppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/3BPN2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 2 11,"Protects the h7 pawn and the d5 pawn... the f6 knight is overloaded. However, I am prepared to exchange if I can manage it!"
