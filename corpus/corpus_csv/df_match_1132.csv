1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,One of seldom seen answers. It has a little disadvantage if black wants to keep the bishop.
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,One of seldom seen answers. It has a little disadvantage if black wants to keep the bishop.
3,Bf4,c1f4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P1B2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,One of seldom seen answers. It has a little disadvantage if black wants to keep the bishop.
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P1B2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,One of seldom seen answers. It has a little disadvantage if black wants to keep the bishop.

6,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P1Bb1/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 4 4,One of seldom seen answers. It has a little disadvantage if black wants to keep the bishop.
7,Nbd2,b1d2,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P1Bb1/5N2/PPPNPPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 5 4,"In my scheme, this N has to go there and later in the kingside, so this is the logical move."
8,e6,e7e6,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3P1Bb1/5N2/PPPNPPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Good, since it opens the way for the dsb. The counterside is that it seals the fate of Bg4."
9,h3,h2h3,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3P1Bb1/5N1P/PPPNPPP1/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,I start harassing the B. I'm not worried about Nb5 because I plan to play c3 anyway.
10,Bh5,g4h5,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p3b/3P1B2/5N1P/PPPNPPP1/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,"Black has to think twice before playing this. He will be tied into preserving the B. It's playable, but you do must know exactly where and when give it away for a WN."
11,g4,g2g4,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p3b/3P1BP1/5N1P/PPPNPP2/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,I'm obviously not planning to castle kingside!
12,Bg6,h5g6,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pnb1/3p4/3P1BP1/5N1P/PPPNPP2/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,"This is to 1) support g4 (I want to play h5) and 2) to prevent h6 (NxB, fxN should follow, weakening black's kingside)."
13,Ne5,f3e5,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pnb1/3pN3/3P1BP1/7P/PPPNPP2/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 2 7,"This is to 1) support g4 (I want to play h5) and 2) to prevent h6 (NxB, fxN should follow, weakening black's kingside)."
14,c5,c7c5,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/4pnb1/2ppN3/3P1BP1/7P/PPPNPP2/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,"This is very good for black, he has to seek for countergame. h6 is not possible now. Nc6, of course, threats to exchange the N so to avoid my previous threats. I would have answered with Nd2-f3 so to keep a N in e5"
15,e3,e2e3,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/4pnb1/2ppN3/3P1BP1/4P2P/PPPN1P2/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,"? This is bad, because now black can play Qb6 and press both b2 and d4. Nb3 defends both, but it doesn't work because of c4, kicking th"
16,cxd4,c5d4,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/4pnb1/3pN3/3p1BP1/4P2P/PPPN1P2/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 9,My opponnent didn't see it! Easier for me.
17,exd4,e3d4,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/4pnb1/3pN3/3P1BP1/7P/PPPN1P2/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 9,This also gives space to my dsb.
18,Nc6,b8c6,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pnb1/3pN3/3P1BP1/7P/PPPN1P2/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 10,"This way I can breath. I must play this move instead of Nd2-f3 because otherwise Nb4 would be strong for black. I would be forced to play BxN (to avoid threats on c2 and d3) and with axN black would have opened the column for his R, which I don't like."
19,c3,c2c3,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pnb1/3pN3/3P1BP1/2P4P/PP1N1P2/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 10,"This way I can breath. I must play this move instead of Nd2-f3 because otherwise Nb4 would be strong for black.

21,dxe5,d4e5,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/4pnb1/3pP3/5BP1/2P4P/PP1N1P2/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 11,"The standard answer (to me). Playing the B there seems logical, but since black can play Bd6, it has little point. This way, black hasn't solved his developement problems yet. Of course, I want to avoid d4, and if Ne4 I will exchange, if needed closing the white diagonal with f3."
22,Nd7,f6d7,r2qkb1r/pp1n1ppp/4p1b1/3pP3/5BP1/2P4P/PP1N1P2/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 12,"Passive move by black, but avoiding complications and pawn's scrambling."
23,h4,h3h4,r2qkb1r/pp1n1ppp/4p1b1/3pP3/5BPP/2P5/PP1N1P2/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 12,"...and condeding me a tempo to carry on with my plan. The obvious threat is to trap the B. Black, curiousely, didn't want to play a6."

25,Nf3,d2f3,r2qkb1r/pp1n2pp/4ppb1/3pP3/5BPP/2P2N2/PP3P2/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 13,"I didn't like to exchange on f6, freeing his Q and the other piece, and I am not ready to take advantage of Qh5+, so I better defend. From this square, the WN can go to d4, threatening e6, which would be a good way of further tie down black."

27,Nxe5,f3e5,r2qkb1r/pp1n2pp/4p1b1/3pN3/5BPP/2P5/PP3P2/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 14,"Another ""intermediate"" sequence has been added to the lsb's threat, and now I do have a strong bishop in the center. After Bd6 by black, I'll play Qd4, and my Q can't be easily chased away."

30,Qb6,d8b6,r3kb1r/pp4pp/1q2p1b1/3pB3/6PP/2P5/PP3P2/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 16,"Very good again, even if it was late. Pressure on b2 is one of black's strong points in this scheme."
