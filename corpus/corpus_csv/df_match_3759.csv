1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

I reached the important milestone of Near-Expertdom with this game - just 97 points south of it!  I did get a bit of a leg up from timeouts/early resignations from Masters Freddy and Chrisobee but, after being anchored in the high 1700s for months on end I decided to enter into Concordborn's MT to try and pick up rating points against 1500-1700 players.  Thankfully I managed to get the wins which boosted me up to where I am now - 1903.  This is the game which finally got me to those dizzy heights.  Here is the analysis.  I will start with move 7 as the first 6 moves are set moves from the MT."
