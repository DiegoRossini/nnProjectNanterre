1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"Hi everyone!

At last some happy news to post on another battle on the Expert's Playing Field - a draw game against my expert buddy Michael.  We did follow the World DB for most of the game - I deviated on move 23 to exchange down into an opposite bishop ending to give me the chance to play through an ending with an expert on a level playing field.  Michael thought it was a little too level and offered me a draw!  Although it would have been interesting to play it through I decided that the chance to obtain only my third Expert Draw in my chessic career was too good to pass up, especially given my atrocious record against the Experts.  Anyhow, on with the game, I decide to have another stab at the Reti Opening with 1. Nf3."
