23,Re1,f1e1,r1bqr1k1/ppp2ppp/2n5/3p4/3P4/2P2N2/P1P1BPPP/R2QR1K1 b - - 4 12,Not sure what your intention was with this move but it looks like it is not doing anything special. Instead I believe you should have continued to focus on getting your pieces out and attack down the e-file. May I suggest 12. Bg4 in the future. As a general rule you should focus on piece deployment over pawn moves in the early stages of the game. The reason being is that pawn moves tend to create more weaknesses than they are worth.

Overall your opening choice and play was good, with the exception of 12...a5. As a rule you should put a premium on piece deployment over pawn moves in the early stages. Where you could improve on is spotting combinations and tactics. You missed two killer ones on move 14. and 17. After this your opponent rebounded and turned thing on your head. The real turning point was when you unnecessarily offered the queen exchange. This gave your opponent the upper hand in center and queen side. Also take note how you survived as you continued to play actively and set problems for your opponent(we call this counter play) who lacked the endgame knowledge to put you to bed."
