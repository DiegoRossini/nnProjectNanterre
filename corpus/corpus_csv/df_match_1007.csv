1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Good morning all. This game is currently unfinished. but the board finds itself in a fun position being a bit of material down. but having good queen side pressure i believe. 

all comments are appreciated."

6,Ng4,f6g4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/2P3n1/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,most common reply to take back the pawn
7,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/2P3n1/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,gives back the material immediately. some people can choose to develop their Gknight or DSB to protect their pawn advantage
8,Nxe5,g4e5,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4n3/2P5/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"and so i take back. in another game here i tried more development before recapturing like nc6. it lead to a tangled fight and took a while to get back the material and that game isnt over heading into 40ish moves i believe.

i also tried leaving the opponent the pawn edge playing d6 in another game to induce fxd6 to reply Bxf6 but that also lead to a tangled game,

and so this third game is why i go with the immediate retake,"
9,a3,a2a3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4n3/2P5/P3P3/1P3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,hinders the DSBs check development and possible double pawn tactic on the c file
10,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/ppppbppp/8/4n3/2P5/P3P3/1P3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,i decide to clear the way for an early castle.
11,b4,b2b4,rnbqk2r/ppppbppp/8/4n3/1PP5/P3P3/5PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,further pushes pawns down
12,c5,c7c5,rnbqk2r/pp1pbppp/8/2p1n3/1PP5/P3P3/5PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,offer a pawn exchange and the c file would become a nice file for my DSB was my thought behind this move. i was also going to push queen side. i didnt think he would push by putting 2 pawns in front of his LSB's diagonal. but i may be wrong
13,Bb2,c1b2,rnbqk2r/pp1pbppp/8/2p1n3/1PP5/P3P3/1B3PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 7,"i didnt like this pressure, i also didnt want to play f7,  maybe d6 was a good move. or developing my B knight,

but i felt like exploring a new line see if i can come out on top with a knight sacrifice.  

so i devised my plan from here. ill be able to take out his C B and A pawns at the cost of my knight and c pawns. and my objective will be to simplify out the remaining LSB connect my rooks behind my B and A pawns and have a pressure fight with 2 passed pawns.

lets see if things go according to plan"
14,Nxc4,e5c4,rnbqk2r/pp1pbppp/8/2p5/1Pn5/P3P3/1B3PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 8,and so i allow the LSB development
15,Bxc4,f1c4,rnbqk2r/pp1pbppp/8/2p5/1PB5/P3P3/1B3PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 0 8,keep eating the pawns.  i was hoping he would recapture here with the A pawn and i could take with my DSB and thought he would offer DSB exchanges to block the check
16,cxb4,c5b4,rnbqk2r/pp1pbppp/8/8/1pB5/P3P3/1B3PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 0 9,keep eating the pawns.  i was hoping he would recapture here with the A pawn and i could take with my DSB and thought he would offer DSB exchanges to block the check
17,Qb3,d1b3,rnbqk2r/pp1pbppp/8/8/1pB5/PQ2P3/1B3PPP/RN2K1NR b KQkq - 1 9,"hmm unanticipated. puts alot of presure on the king.  but looking at the scenario i feel i can defend it at the cost of a pawn if he decides to launch his attack. but i have to look to castle ASAP now, im happy the way is clear."
18,bxa3,b4a3,rnbqk2r/pp1pbppp/8/8/2B5/pQ2P3/1B3PPP/RN2K1NR w KQkq - 0 10,so after feeling comfortable being able to defend atleast 1 turn before castling and i complete the plan to take all the queen side pawns off the board
19,Bxa3,b2a3,rnbqk2r/pp1pbppp/8/8/2B5/BQ2P3/5PPP/RN2K1NR b KQkq - 0 10,anticipated reply. now i liked this position would make it easier to simplify out the bishops and head to the position i had planned before my knight sacrifice.
