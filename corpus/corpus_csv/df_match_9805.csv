27,Qxa8,d5a8,Q1b2rk1/p1q1ppbp/6p1/8/8/4BP2/PPP3PP/2KR1B1R b - - 0 14,14.Qc5 is normal response but 14.Qxa8 is really intresting as white changes his queen to rooks. This move might look odd but its totally okay.
28,Bf5,c8f5,Q4rk1/p1q1ppbp/6p1/5b2/8/4BP2/PPP3PP/2KR1B1R w - - 1 15,Its not easy for white to defend and black has to be cautious too. This is intresting situation.

33,b3,b2b3,1q3k2/p3ppbp/6p1/5b2/8/1P2BP2/P1PR2PP/2K2B1R b - - 0 17,My opponent plays really accurately and he has shown to me that he knows Dragon variation really well. Smyslov-Gufeld game continued 17.Bb5 h5 18.Rhd1 Bxb2  19.Kxb2 Qxb5  and black has better position.
34,h5,h7h5,1q3k2/p3ppb1/6p1/5b1p/8/1P2BP2/P1PR2PP/2K2B1R w - - 0 18,My computer offered 17...e6 18.Bc4 Qe5 19.Bd4 but I think that 17...h5 is as good as 17...e6.

38,Kh7,g8h7,1q6/p3ppbk/6p1/5b1p/2B4P/1P2BP2/P1PR2P1/2K4R w - - 3 20,"I dont know where from my head I heard ""19.Kh7, opponent will take take pawn and then you won"" it was quite intresting that I had about 21min on my clock and I spent only 30s to make this move. My computer offered better option 19...Qe5 20.Bd4 Qa5 21.Bxg7 Kxg7 22.Re1 Qxa2 23.Kd1 Qa1  24.Ke2 and position is better for black."
