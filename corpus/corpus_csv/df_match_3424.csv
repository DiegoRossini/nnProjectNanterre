5,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2p2P2/4P3/PP1P2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,defending carefully and preventing b8 knight or queen going to d4
6,b5,b7b5,rnbqkbnr/p1p1pppp/8/1p6/2p2P2/4P3/PP1P2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,normal reaction : defending the c4 position. Wicht is not such a good idea in my opinion because my king will go to king side anyway so pressure on queen side could be lost time
