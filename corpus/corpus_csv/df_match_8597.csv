1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"One of my first games on GK and first games in years. Its been over 2 years since I played the game, I remember it been a real sucker punch so I thought I'd try to annotate it and recap some of my thinking! 
Even worse is the fact this match was for records, if I won I got £30 worth of records if I lost then I had to give him £10 of records, as well as the others in the RR!!"
