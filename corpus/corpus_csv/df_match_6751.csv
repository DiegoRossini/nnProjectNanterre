6,g5,g7g5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/6p1/3PPp2/8/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,i don't know about this move the chess opening database on gameknot (which i use regurarly) doesn't say what move black should play after 3.d4 but i think my opponent's move wasn't the best i would have played 3 .. Qh4+ instead because i would be forced to move my king!
