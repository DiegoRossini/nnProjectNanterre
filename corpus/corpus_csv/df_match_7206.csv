1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone! I have just got back from freezing cold Hastings, where I was competing in the Weekend Longplay tournament, in the U120 ECF grades section. Although only graded 99, I was very pleased with my performance, since I ended up with 3.5 points out of 5. I am going to annotate my games, in no particular order. This last-round game was the quickest out of all my games: it only lasted 1 hour 20 minutes or so. White, an ungraded opponent, opened with the King Pawn."
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"So I replied with my usual French Defence, allowing White to take the centre temporarily with 2.d4, and then striking back at the centre with 2...d5."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"White's usual second move, placing two pawns in the centre in order to pave the way to quick development. Another feasible option for White is to play 2.Nf3. Also respectable is 2.d3, leading towards a King's Indian Attack."
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"So I continued with Black's crucial 2nd move, striking back against White's centre. The onus is now on White to decide what to do with his e-pawn. He can advance it forwards, locking the central pawn-structure and grabbing a space advantage - 3.e5, the Advance Variation - and Black will then try to undermine White's structure on the queenside. White can also exchange pawns on d5, the Exchange Variation 3.exd5, although this is quite a quiet and (for me) boring opening, in which White's only advantage is that of moving first. Or, White can defend the pawn and develop a piece with 3.Nc3 (main line) or 3.Nd2 (Tarrasch Variation)."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"White plays the main line 3.Nc3, so Black renews the pressure on White's e-pawn by pinning the defending knight, signalling the start of the lively Winawer Variation. Here, White's most usual choice is to advance the e-pawn: the main line runs 4.e5 c5 5.a3 Bxc3+ 6.bxc3. Another feasible option, which several tournament opponents have played against me, is to transpose into an Exchange Variation with 4.exd5. However, White's next move is one that I have never played against before."
6,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/1b1PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"White plays the main line 3.Nc3, so Black renews the pressure on White's e-pawn by pinning the defending knight, signalling the start of the lively Winawer Variation.

7,Bd2,c1d2,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/1b1PP3/2N5/PPPB1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 3 4,"(?!) This move sacrifices the e-pawn after 4...Bxc3 5.Bxc3 or 5.bxc3 dxe4. I could see nothing wrong with grabbing the pawn, so I moved accordingly."
8,Bxc3,b4c3,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/2b5/PPPB1PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"The most obvious continuation I could see for White was 6.f3, turning the pawn sacrifice into a gambit: 6...exf3 7.Nxf3 and White has a lead in development of 2 minor pieces to 0. However, I did not feel that White had compensation for his sacrificed pawn. Another idea I could see for White was 6.d5, discovering an attack against Black's g7-pawn, but 6...Nf6 and I did not feel that this attack had any real bite. White may ruin Black's pawn-structure in the future with Bxf6 when Black's queen is not defending, but that's all."

13,Bb5+,f1b5,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/1B1P4/4p3/2B5/PPP2PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 2 7,"Again, this aggressive move might look a bit worrying, but it really has no bite whatsoever. In fact, it may even be a mistake, as Black's blocking move paves the way to a queen exchange, which is the best way for Black to consolidate his extra pawn."
14,c6,c7c6,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/1B1P4/4p3/2B5/PPP2PPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 0 8,"White chooses to exchange his pawn off: this is the only way to avoid losing even more material. However, Black can now exchange queens, which greatly lessens the counterplay that White might try."

I was now expecting White to start trying some counterplay against my extra pawn: for example, building up pressure on it with Ng1-e2-g3, Bxf6. I might simply have returned the pawn to White, so as not to get too hung up defending it."

I was expecting 12.Ng3, threatening 13.Bxf3 gxf3 14.Nxe4 winning the pawn back. White's choice here is tamely allowing all the pieces to be exchanged off. Looking at this move, it does not even look as if White is trying to win the game."
