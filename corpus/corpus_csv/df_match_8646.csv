1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!  I thought I would talk to you about chess blunders.  Don't we all get that horrid sinking feeling when we have made a blunder.  Well, thankfully it was my opponent that blundered.  I got into my usual jstevens1 type position and the disease passivitis struck again - incredibly my 1700+ opponent failed to take full advantage and later on he made a serious oversight which brought about instant resignation - well less talk - more action.  After getting used to the Sicilian Defense I find myself fronted with the French."
