1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,e4! the most noble of openings!
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I pretty much exclusively respond to e4 with the Caro-Kann. It leads to a solid end-game position for black and i don't have to get to bogged down in theory, which i believe is the case with the Sicilian."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,A standard reply.
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,fighting for the middle of the board.
5,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3P4/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"He decides to exchange. Personally, i prefer to keep the tension in the middle but it is by no means a bad move."
6,cxd5,c6d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3p4/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,developing with a check.
7,Bb5+,f1b5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/1B1p4/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,developing with a check.
8,Bd7,c8d7,rn1qkbnr/pp1bpppp/8/1B1p4/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,"enticing the exchange of bishops, usually in the Caro-Kann i find that i'm left with Knights on the board while exchanging bishops."
9,Qe2,d1e2,rn1qkbnr/pp1bpppp/8/1B1p4/8/5N2/PPPPQPPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 3 5,?! I've never seen this reply before...
10,Nf6,g8f6,rn1qkb1r/pp1bpppp/5n2/1B1p4/8/5N2/PPPPQPPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 4 6,"After a short pause, i decided this was not too significant and continued with development."
11,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qkb1r/pp1bpppp/5n2/1B1p4/8/2N2N2/PPPPQPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 5 6,And so does he.
12,e6,e7e6,rn1qkb1r/pp1b1ppp/4pn2/1B1p4/8/2N2N2/PPPPQPPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 0 7,"This is all somewhat standard, aside from maybe the queen move he made."
13,a3,a2a3,rn1qkb1r/pp1b1ppp/4pn2/1B1p4/8/P1N2N2/1PPPQPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 0 7,"I don't like this move. It takes away the b4 square from my bishop; however, i didn't plan on moving my bishop there in the first place. Better would of been to move the d pawn and develop the bishop."
14,Bd6,f8d6,rn1qk2r/pp1b1ppp/3bpn2/1B1p4/8/P1N2N2/1PPPQPPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 1 8,I'm going to keep developing.
15,d4,d2d4,rn1qk2r/pp1b1ppp/3bpn2/1B1p4/3P4/P1N2N2/1PP1QPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 0 8,Activates the bishop and stakes a claim in the center of the board.
16,O-O,e8g8,rn1q1rk1/pp1b1ppp/3bpn2/1B1p4/3P4/P1N2N2/1PP1QPPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 1 9,Getting that king nice and tucked away with his pool table. Standard opening procedure.
17,Bg5,c1g5,rn1q1rk1/pp1b1ppp/3bpn2/1B1p2B1/3P4/P1N2N2/1PP1QPPP/R3K2R b KQ - 2 9,"Pins the Knight to the queen. It isn't too big a threat by any means, but i dislike it because it keeps my queen stationed at d8 for the time being. I dislike having the integrity of my castle questioned, especially with such a nice pool table inside."
18,h6,h7h6,rn1q1rk1/pp1b1pp1/3bpn1p/1B1p2B1/3P4/P1N2N2/1PP1QPPP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 10,In retrospect i shouldn't of done this. It merely weakens the white squares around my castle. It was a poor attempt to shoo away the bishop.
19,Bh4,g5h4,rn1q1rk1/pp1b1pp1/3bpn1p/1B1p4/3P3B/P1N2N2/1PP1QPPP/R3K2R b KQ - 1 10,The best reply.
20,a6,a7a6,rn1q1rk1/1p1b1pp1/p2bpn1p/1B1p4/3P3B/P1N2N2/1PP1QPPP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 11,"My goal here was to entice the exchange of bishops. If he does exchange, i am able to develop my Knight to its usual square in this defense, as well as connect the Knights."
21,Bxd7,b5d7,rn1q1rk1/1p1B1pp1/p2bpn1p/3p4/3P3B/P1N2N2/1PP1QPPP/R3K2R b KQ - 0 11,Excellent
