1,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was an uncommon Bird's opening, we were out of theory just after move 5, both black and white's light square bishops were exchanged by knights, but white allowed some damage to his pawn structure, white then followed a good plan to fianchetto his remaining bishop queen side, but with a bad timing he wasn't able to change his plan according to black's moves and lost a pawn and allowed further damage to his pawn structure, black was a bit underdeveloped, but white willingness to exchange the queens and the rooks allowed them an superior endgame B + extra pawn vs N, finaly I'll sacrifice a pawn to get the white king out of the fight and to force a promotion of my c pawn and to finally convert the advantage..."
