4,a6,a7a6,rnbqkbnr/1p1ppppp/p7/2p5/4P3/8/PPPPNPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"Not sure if my opponent  was planning on playing 2...a6 if I had put my knight on f3, when d4 now is  not a good move for White, or if he wanted to play a type of Najordf and got  confused to my move order. In either case I've lost playing d4 before in this  position much earlier in my chess playing career and learned my lesson."
5,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/1p1ppppp/p7/2p5/2P1P3/8/PP1PNPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,Not the popular response in my database (although this positino is not  very popular anyway) but recommened is Nbc3. However I know the lines with c4  and the knight on f3 and planned to transpose back if I could.
