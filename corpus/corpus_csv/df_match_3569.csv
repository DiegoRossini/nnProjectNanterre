8,f6,f7f6,r1bqkbnr/1ppp2pp/p1n2p2/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"This is 1st bad move.
What White should do.
One line is Knight's sacrifice, thats happen in some cases when Black play f6.
for example BxN, dxB. Nxe5!?, fxN and then Qh5+
if g6, Qxe5+ and Black loses Rook at h8 and may be more material.
if Kd7 then White can win two pawns (Qxe5) for Knight, and Blacks expose position and Unable_Castling.
That could be interesting but sometimes after exchanging Queens, Black could do fine."
