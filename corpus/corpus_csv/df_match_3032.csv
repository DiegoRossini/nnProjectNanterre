2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The bishop's game, my new beloved opening against open games for almost a year now. While there's not tons of theory to learn, it's perfectly solid and playable, though not seen in top level chess anymore. After the usual 2. Nf3, Black still can choose between a variety of openings (...Nc6, ...Nf6, ...d6) where White has to be prepared. The bishop's opening often transposes to King's Bishop's gambit (1. e4 e5 2. f4 exf4 3. Bc4), a very fun opening but one that is, directly played, too dangerous for me in tournament play. Also there is an affinity to the Vienna game (1. e4 e5 2. Nc3)."

4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 3,"The usual response called ""Berlin Defense"", developing and attacking the pawn."
5,d3,d2d3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 3,"Solid, simple. Interesting to mention here is the existence of the sharp Urusov gambit 3. d4."
6,h6,h7h6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1pp1/5n1p/4p3/2B1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 4,"?! preventing Bg5, but losing tempo for development"
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1pp1/5n1p/4p3/2B1P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 4,Continuing to develop; I prefer Nc3 over Nf3 in this position as it keeps open a possible f4 pawn thrust (in the spirit of King's Gambit and the Vienna game).
8,Bc5,f8c5,rnbqk2r/pppp1pp1/5n1p/2b1p3/2B1P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 2 5,Completing king's side development and preparing to castle.
9,Be3,c1e3,rnbqk2r/pppp1pp1/5n1p/2b1p3/2B1P3/2NPB3/PPP2PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 3 5,!? Offering a bishop exchange with the idea of opening the f-file (my favourite file ;-)) and strengthening the centre with another pawn.
10,Bxe3,c5e3,rnbqk2r/pppp1pp1/5n1p/4p3/2B1P3/2NPb3/PPP2PPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,"Interestingly enough, Black accepts the offer. I would have expected ...Bb6, himself offering an exchange again for opening the a-file."
11,fxe3,f2e3,rnbqk2r/pppp1pp1/5n1p/4p3/2B1P3/2NPP3/PPP3PP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 0 6,"I was happy with this position, though being aware that the pawn e3 is a potential weakness -- for having an open file, that's okay."
12,d6,d7d6,rnbqk2r/ppp2pp1/3p1n1p/4p3/2B1P3/2NPP3/PPP3PP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 0 7,Freeing the light-squared bishop.
13,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk2r/ppp2pp1/3p1n1p/4p3/2B1P3/2NPPN2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 7,Completes piece development
14,c6,c7c6,rnbqk2r/pp3pp1/2pp1n1p/4p3/2B1P3/2NPPN2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"I was wondering why Black, already behind in development, is wasting time with another pawn move. Not thinking further about it, I quickly..."
15,O-O,e1g1,rnbqk2r/pp3pp1/2pp1n1p/4p3/2B1P3/2NPPN2/PPP3PP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 1 8,...castled and herewith occupied the open file with the rook.
16,Qb6,d8b6,rnb1k2r/pp3pp1/1qpp1n1p/4p3/2B1P3/2NPPN2/PPP3PP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 2 9,"Damn, I overlooked this simple double attack tactics which obviously tries to win a pawn and already exploits the backwards pawn weakness! As I am far ahead in development, it isn't that bad, but still a decision has to be made: Save the pawns or sacrifice one and continue with the own plans?"
17,Qd2,d1d2,rnb1k2r/pp3pp1/1qpp1n1p/4p3/2B1P3/2NPPN2/PPPQ2PP/R4RK1 b kq - 3 9,"I decided for not caring about a lost pawn, as Black loses only more time with this and even opens me another file. It isn't healthy to go for pawn-eating with the queen in the early development stage, is an important rule in chess, why should the opponent be able to break this rule? The rooks are already connected and development is completed, it takes Black at least three more moves to achieve this! The other option would have been Qc1 which defends both pawns, but then ...Ng4 Re1 results in a cramped position."
18,Qxb2,b6b2,rnb1k2r/pp3pp1/2pp1n1p/4p3/2B1P3/2NPPN2/PqPQ2PP/R4RK1 w kq - 0 10,"A critical position, now White has to be quick in pushing his agenda to not being left with a pawn less in the end!"
19,d4,d3d4,rnb1k2r/pp3pp1/2pp1n1p/4p3/2BPP3/2N1PN2/PqPQ2PP/R4RK1 b kq - 0 10,"As all pieces have already good positions, it's time to crack up the center. Rab1 before would have also been possible, is maybe even more precise."
20,exd4,e5d4,rnb1k2r/pp3pp1/2pp1n1p/8/2BpP3/2N1PN2/PqPQ2PP/R4RK1 w kq - 0 11,"Obviously, White wants to continue with e5, driving away the knight in turn to exploit the weak f7 point."
21,exd4,e3d4,rnb1k2r/pp3pp1/2pp1n1p/8/2BPP3/2N2N2/PqPQ2PP/R4RK1 b kq - 0 11,"Obviously, White wants to continue with e5, driving away the knight in turn to exploit the weak f7 point."
22,Qb4,b2b4,rnb1k2r/pp3pp1/2pp1n1p/8/1qBPP3/2N2N2/P1PQ2PP/R4RK1 w kq - 1 12,"Attacks my bishop and pins the knight -- though the pin can't be directly exploited in this case (not even after castling), as ...Nxe4 Nxe4 results in a position where the queen is defended."
