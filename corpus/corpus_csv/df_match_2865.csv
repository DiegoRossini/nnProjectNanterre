In addition, my opponent can play g6 intending to fianchetto. There are so many different lines and transpositions possible that it's impossible for me to remember them all."

5,Bb5+,f1b5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 3,"So my first order of business, get rid of the white bishops. I am going to control the white squares with my pawns. This does lead to a rather boring game. Some years ago, MSN hosted Kasparov against the world, and in a similar position, he apologized for choosing a similar line, because he didn't want to reveal any of his real preparation for upcoming matches for the world championship; and at that time, his apology was for the 'drawish and boring' kind of game that would result. If any of you have looked at that game, that's not how that game turned out in actuality!"

9,c4,c2c4,r2qkbnr/pp1npppp/3p4/2p5/2P1P3/5N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"I deviate from the 'book' with this move. This is an attempt by me to emulate a little the Maroczy bind position after trading off the white bishops, allowing my knight on f3 to avoid annoying pins after I castle kingside, cramp black's position, and prevent him from opening up the c file easily. At this point in the game, black can respond in a couple of different ways: e6 is possible, Ngf6 is possible, as is a6 and g6. I like white's position because black cannot easily continue in typical Sicilian fashion. Which is why I chose to do this, because everyone knows the Sicilian is one of the better attempts by black to score the point."
10,g6,g7g6,r2qkbnr/pp1npp1p/3p2p1/2p5/2P1P3/5N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"And here black says: so what. I'm still going to develop my Sicilian. Appears he is looking to perhaps set up an accelerated dragon position, and in this case could try to get play down the a/b files, but since my king will not be castled over there, I don't fear it. I simply have to protect my pieces down there, and launch a kingside attack as soon as I can."

In this position it's easily defended, so that was not even in my thoughts. Black is going to castle kingside now, so I need to castle and launch an attack before he does."

But had he castled queenside, I could have immediately pushed that b pawn thanks to my a pawn move earlier. Then, it would have been interesting to see whose attack hit first... But since he castled kingside, he'll have to weather a storm for a while."

The dark squares around the black king are very weak now, and soon I'll be moving my queen and continuing with the rest of my plans. Very soon, as the white knight no longer needs a defender other than the b pawn for now and the white queen is still vulnerable to a thrust in the center."
