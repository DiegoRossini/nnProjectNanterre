However, even though the e4 and f4-pawn are cramping my style they are over extended, especially, e4! Another reason to attack e4 immediately is to break up white's centre before he has a chance to consolidate. Therefore, I would choose 12. ...Nc5-> now white has two main replies:

elyhim already posted the line, but did anybody understand the reason why ?
                                                                                                                        So....20...Ba3
                                                                                                                        Answers from White :
21. bxa3 Qxc3 (Black threats Mate) 22.Re2 Qa1+ 23.Kd2 Rxc2 24.Kxc2 Rc8+ 25.Ke2 Qc3 26.Kd2 Qc1++ and Mate. White losses this game . if white did not take on a3,black plays on every move Bxb2 !                                                                                           so...21.Rxc4 Bxb2+ 22.Kd1 Rxc4 23. Bxf6 (on other moves black would play Nxc3 Kd2 Rd8+ Ke3 Re8 with getting the Queen back and black is one piece better)
                                                                                                                         23.Bxf6 Bxc3 24.Qd6 Bxf6 25. Ke2 (on other moves it works Rd8 for black ) Rxc2 26.Kf1 Rd8 27. Qxa6 Bd4 28.Re2 Rc1+ with 3 times same position draw !"
