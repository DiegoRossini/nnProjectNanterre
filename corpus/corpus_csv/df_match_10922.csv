1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,my favourite apparently - must try d4 one day
2,Na6,b8a6,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/n7/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,strange reply? where you going with that? isolating the knight on the wing for waht purpose?
3,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/n7/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,ok another favourite of mine - if I can develop both center pawns then the bishops can both strike out with ease ...
4,c5,c7c5,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/n7/2p5/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,hmmmmmm?
5,Bxa6,f1a6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/B7/2p5/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 3,ok I'll take the knight - weakening your pawns on the a file. (two pawns in foront of each orher hamper forward progress and are no help in defending each other - a weakness I'll try to exploit later.
6,bxa6,b7a6,r1bqkbnr/p2ppppp/p7/2p5/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 4,and have the pawn that was defended by the knight
7,dxc5,d4c5,r1bqkbnr/p2ppppp/p7/2P5/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 4,and have the pawn that was defended by the knight
8,Qa5+,d8a5,r1b1kbnr/p2ppppp/p7/q1P5/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 5,"whoops, remiss of me... forgot you could do that... ok have the pawn back I'll chase your queen for awhile hopefully"
9,Nc3,b1c3,r1b1kbnr/p2ppppp/p7/q1P5/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 2 5,knight is best defender - I'll use the bishop to chase your queen
10,Qxc5,a5c5,r1b1kbnr/p2ppppp/p7/2q5/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,where you gonna go?
11,Be3,c1e3,r1b1kbnr/p2ppppp/p7/2q5/4P3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 1 6,where you gonna go?
12,Qc6,c5c6,r1b1kbnr/p2ppppp/p1q5/8/4P3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 2 7,develop further - threaten queen agian - allow for castling
13,Nf3,g1f3,r1b1kbnr/p2ppppp/p1q5/8/4P3/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 3 7,develop further - threaten queen agian - allow for castling
14,d6,d7d6,r1b1kbnr/p3pppp/p1qp4/8/4P3/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"can't rember the plan fully here, maybe starting to apply pressure to pawns on the a file. Maybe just don't want your bishop to pin my knight on f3 to the Queen... with the chance of wrecking my pawn defences on the kings side. also fully develops major pieces - I now have the choice of castling either side"
15,Qd3,d1d3,r1b1kbnr/p3pppp/p1qp4/8/4P3/2NQBN2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 1 8,"can't rember the plan fully here, maybe starting to apply pressure to pawns on the a file. Maybe just don't want your bishop to pin my knight on f3 to the Queen... with the chance of wrecking my pawn defences on the kings side. also fully develops major pieces - I now have the choice of castling either side"
16,g6,g7g6,r1b1kbnr/p3pp1p/p1qp2p1/8/4P3/2NQBN2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 9,surely creating opportunities for the bishop?
17,O-O-O,e1c1,r1b1kbnr/p3pp1p/p1qp2p1/8/4P3/2NQBN2/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b kq - 1 9,"ok queens side it is.
And if I can get rid of the Queen then knight d5 c7 and win pawn on a6"
18,f5,f7f5,r1b1kbnr/p3p2p/p1qp2p1/5p2/4P3/2NQBN2/PPP2PPP/2KR3R w kq - 0 10,"should annotate as I go along really - there was some real sneaky thinking and analysis here... but it really only boils down to a pawn advantage  attacking either h6 or h7 with the bishop.... 
With the pawn on d5 after exchange and the possibilities of knight attack on either c6 or e6."
19,Qd5,d3d5,r1b1kbnr/p3p2p/p1qp2p1/3Q1p2/4P3/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b kq - 1 10,"should annotate as I go along really - there was some real sneaky thinking and analysis here... but it really only boils down to a pawn advantage  attacking either h6 or h7 with the bishop....

20,Bd7,c8d7,r3kbnr/p2bp2p/p1qp2p1/3Q1p2/4P3/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/2KR3R w kq - 2 11,but then again you don't HAVE to take
21,Nd4,f3d4,r3kbnr/p2bp2p/p1qp2p1/3Q1p2/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b kq - 3 11,oh yes you do!
22,Qxd5,c6d5,r3kbnr/p2bp2p/p2p2p1/3q1p2/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/2KR3R w kq - 0 12,not too sure about this either surely knight takes would threaten c7 as mentioned - though easily defendable with rook-c8 ....  hmmmmm
23,exd5,e4d5,r3kbnr/p2bp2p/p2p2p1/3P1p2/3N4/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b kq - 0 12,not too sure about this either surely knight takes would threaten c7 as mentioned - though easily defendable with rook-c8 ....  hmmmmm
24,Nf6,g8f6,r3kb1r/p2bp2p/p2p1np1/3P1p2/3N4/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/2KR3R w kq - 1 13,ok you can progress that knight there doesn't look to be any percievable danger.
25,Ne6,d4e6,r3kb1r/p2bp2p/p2pNnp1/3P1p2/8/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b kq - 2 13,ok .... surely the pawn on h7 is mine
26,Bxe6,d7e6,r3kb1r/p3p2p/p2pbnp1/3P1p2/8/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/2KR3R w kq - 0 14,now this is probably very silly... retrospectively how did I get there .. don't really wanna defend this pawn - it may actually be indefensible. together with being immovable. e7 is solid. I'll probably give it up as lost.. now I really need to get get at the pawns on 'a' file
27,dxe6,d5e6,r3kb1r/p3p2p/p2pPnp1/5p2/8/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b kq - 0 14,now this is probably very silly... retrospectively how did I get there .. don't really wanna defend this pawn - it may actually be indefensible. together with being immovable. e7 is solid.
