1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I love to play d5 after d4, because I learnt this black opening defence, from FM Charles Galofre via a video on chess.com, He calls it a universal system,"
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"After Playing d5 my next move is usually c6 or gKnight to f6 or cBishop to f5 what your trying to achieve with black is a triangle on the light squares, once the c Bishop is outside the pawn chain then shut the door with pawn to e6, making your triangle complete if your allowed to do so, I believe this opening defense for black is some sort of slav or semi slav, I have adapted it even further from learning it originally, by altering it after several times being attacked on b7 or a7, got a little fed up so I bought a video on slavs and called it a6"
