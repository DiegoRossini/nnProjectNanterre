1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is my 2nd longest game here on GameKnot, just three moves shy of my longest game. This one turned out to be a well-contended slug-fest that ends in a bit of a tricky endgame. It's a team match and I'm playing black. I'm tired of the Sicilian, so I try something different. The Robatsch, or Modern defense. As anyone who reads many of my annotations knows, I have long forgotten anything I used to know about openings, so I generally fly blindly through them, charting my course primarily by way of the GameKnot DB - for better or worse. I don't know this opening at all, so I was looking forward to exploring it a bit."
