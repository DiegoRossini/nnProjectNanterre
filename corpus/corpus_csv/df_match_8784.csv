The bishop seemed well placed, fianchettoed with an attack on d4 supported by the black queen. Maybe he wanted to play to b4? As for my response, I am thinking knights on g5 and e5 are fairly imposing (although I haven't figured out how to save them both from black's simply pushing his f7 pawn to f6 and forking them)."
