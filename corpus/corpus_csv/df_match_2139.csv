1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,A very difficult (if not plainly wrong) line by black. But in this case...
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,A very difficult (if not plainly wrong) line by black. But in this case...
3,Bf4,c1f4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P1B2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,A very difficult (if not plainly wrong) line by black. But in this case...
4,f6,f7f6,rnbqkbnr/ppp1p1pp/5p2/3p4/3P1B2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,A very difficult (if not plainly wrong) line by black. But in this case...
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1p1pp/5p2/3p4/3P1B2/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"I let him proceed, and see what happens. White can do a little better with e6, opening at right the queen's way to h5+."
6,h5,h7h5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1p1p1/5p2/3p3p/3P1B2/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Interesting, trying to trap the bishop. And you know what? I'll let him!"
7,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1p1p1/5p2/3p3p/3P1B2/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,? Much better was Qd3 or Bd3 at once.
8,g5,g7g5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1p3/5p2/3p2pp/3P1B2/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Ok, it was a blitz. Sometimes you play in disadvantage just to see what happens. Most of the times you lose. But not always. Of course, ""don't try it with well rated players"" :-)"
9,Nxg5,f3g5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1p3/5p2/3p2Np/3P1B2/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"Black needs care to handle his material advantage but horrible position. A good player would play something like Qd6, unpinning the pawn, and if Bf4, Qg6 reverts the threat on white."
10,fxg5,f6g5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1p3/8/3p2pp/3P1B2/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Black needs care to handle his material advantage but horrible position. A good player would play something like Qd6, unpinning the pawn, and if Bf4, Qg6 reverts the threat on white."
11,Bxg5,f4g5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1p3/8/3p2Bp/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"Black needs care to handle his material advantage but horrible position. A good player would play something like Qd6, unpinning the pawn, and if Bf4, Qg6 reverts the threat on white."
12,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkbnr/ppp1p3/8/3p2Bp/3P2b1/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,"? Horrible move, that makes clear black didn't see the hole in g6. With Bf5, I would be in real trouble."
13,Qd3,d1d3,rn1qkbnr/ppp1p3/8/3p2Bp/3P2b1/3QP3/PPP2PPP/RN2KB1R b KQkq - 2 7,"At once. The queen will be much more powerful up there. But maybe it was a mistake. Anyway, tempoes are my priority in this kind of position. Black can't avoid the nasty check."
14,Nf6,g8f6,rn1qkb1r/ppp1p3/5n2/3p2Bp/3P2b1/3QP3/PPP2PPP/RN2KB1R w KQkq - 3 8,"So he develops. The alternative was ugly: Be6 (to aswer Bc7 if Qg6+), but this would have left black horribly cramped!"
15,Qg6+,d3g6,rn1qkb1r/ppp1p3/5nQ1/3p2Bp/3P2b1/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN2KB1R b KQkq - 4 8,"Ok, now what? What is the most attacking move I can do? Not threatening the black bishop, for sure: after Be6, I'll be standing where I am now, and black has Rg8."
16,Kd7,e8d7,rn1q1b1r/pppkp3/5nQ1/3p2Bp/3P2b1/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN2KB1R w KQ - 5 9,"Ok, now what? What is the most attacking move I can do? Not threatening the black bishop, for sure: after Be6, I'll be standing where I am now, and black has Rg8."
17,Bd3,f1d3,rn1q1b1r/pppkp3/5nQ1/3p2Bp/3P2b1/3BP3/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R b KQ - 6 9,"""? But it leaves the dsb en prise after Rg8, Qc7 (the only spot left)!"". Yes, but..."
18,Rg8,h8g8,rn1q1br1/pppkp3/5nQ1/3p2Bp/3P2b1/3BP3/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R w KQ - 7 10,"Better for black was Qe8, mainly to provide the black king of another square, and forcing white to go Bf5+, e6, QxQ (virtually forced), KxQ or NxQ and the white attack vanishes."
19,Bf5+,d3f5,rn1q1br1/pppkp3/5nQ1/3p1BBp/3P2b1/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R b KQ - 8 10,Better than BxB because it would have returned the white queen of useful squares.
20,e6,e7e6,rn1q1br1/pppk4/4pnQ1/3p1BBp/3P2b1/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R w KQ - 0 11,Better than BxB because it would have returned the white queen of useful squares.
21,Qf7+,g6f7,rn1q1br1/pppk1Q2/4pn2/3p1BBp/3P2b1/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R b KQ - 1 11,"Look at this unusual position: the white bishop is ""en prise"", by TWO pieces at the same time. Still, white has a great attack. The threat is BxNf6, threatening the black queen and making the R undefended. Can black defend with Qe7? Of course. And white has nothing to do but retire or exchange his lsb, and the game is -1 for me, with a piece less, and in a harmless position for black. But this requires a lot of ""cold blood""."
22,Kc6,d7c6,rn1q1br1/ppp2Q2/2k1pn2/3p1BBp/3P2b1/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R w KQ - 2 12,"? This can have a good idea behind: moving the king to the other side, where I am more or less absent, maybe he can pass the storm. But better players than me will find funny, I hope, to check the lines. White has two escape routes, winning: BxNf6, QxNf6, and of course he can throw in Qxe6 first. But even this wonderful Qxe6 was enough to save and probably win the game, despite the piece less, I wasn't satisfied."
23,Bxf6,g5f6,rn1q1br1/ppp2Q2/2k1pB2/3p1B1p/3P2b1/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R b KQ - 0 12,Always threatening.
24,Bxf5,g4f5,rn1q1br1/ppp2Q2/2k1pB2/3p1b1p/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R w KQ - 0 13,"?? Losing blunder. Black was overwhelmed by the complexity of the game, and overlooked the threated queen. Black could have given a look to Rg7, QxR, BxQ, BxQ, e6xB, but again white has Qxe6+ in the middle. Not now, of course. But it doesn't matter anymore. Nevertheless, the game is still interesting."
25,Bxd8,f6d8,rn1B1br1/ppp2Q2/2k1p3/3p1b1p/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R b KQ - 0 13,Developing with tempo. But...
26,Bb4+,f8b4,rn1B2r1/ppp2Q2/2k1p3/3p1b1p/1b1P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R w KQ - 1 14,Developing with tempo. But...
27,c3,c2c3,rn1B2r1/ppp2Q2/2k1p3/3p1b1p/1b1P4/2P1P3/PP3PPP/RN2K2R b KQ - 0 14,"? I take my tempo back. Of course, Nd2 worked exactly as well and probably better than this."
28,Rf8,g8f8,rn1B1r2/ppp2Q2/2k1p3/3p1b1p/1b1P4/2P1P3/PP3PPP/RN2K2R w KQ - 1 15,"Here I was the one to overlook Qxc7, with mate in few moves: Kb5 (forced), a4+, Ka6 (forced), cxBb4, and I don't see how black can avoid b5#. Anyway. I missed it."
