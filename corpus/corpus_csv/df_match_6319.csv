1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This old-fashioned opening exposes White's Queen to Black's pieces. Black tends to gain an advantage in development as a result.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,This old-fashioned opening exposes White's Queen to Black's pieces. Black tends to gain an advantage in development as a result.
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,This old-fashioned opening exposes White's Queen to Black's pieces. Black tends to gain an advantage in development as a result.
4,exd4,e5d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3pP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,The only logical move.
5,Qxd4,d1d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 0 3,White recaptures at once.
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 1 4,Developing the Knight to its natural square and gaining a tempo.
7,Qe3,d4e3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/4P3/4Q3/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 2 4,The Queen must retreat.
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/4P3/4Q3/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 3 5,Now Black can develop his King Knight as well. He has 2 pieces out and White only has 1.
9,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/2B1P3/4Q3/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 4 5,"Overly aggressive. White does need to develop, but a more modest move such as B-Q3 or N-QB3 [both of which also defend the exposed KP] would serve him better. Because of the premature Queen development, White is on the defensive."
10,Ne5,c6e5,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4n3/2B1P3/4Q3/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 5 6,"Swiderski takes advantage of White's mistake, centralizing his Knight and attacking the unprotected KB."
11,Bb3,c4b3,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4n3/4P3/1B2Q3/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 6 6,White's Bishop is forced to retreat...
12,Bb4+,f8b4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4n3/1b2P3/1B2Q3/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 7 7,...allowing Swiderski time to develop another piece with tempo. White needs to develop and break the attack. 7 N-QB3 or 7 N-Q2 is in order.
13,c3,c2c3,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4n3/1b2P3/1BP1Q3/PP3PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 0 7,"A major blunder by White. Not only does this not develop a piece, it also blocks his QN from its natural square!"
14,Bc5,b4c5,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/2b1n3/4P3/1BP1Q3/PP3PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 1 8,"Swiderski pounces, attacking the Queen again. Obviously White cannot play 8 QxB??? as 8...N-Q6 ch!!! would fork White's King and Queen. Probably the ""best"" move is 8 Q-K2, although even then White would be in trouble, massively behind in development."
15,Qg3,e3g3,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/2b1n3/4P3/1BP3Q1/PP3PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 2 8,The second blunder in a row allows Swiderski a brilliant finish.
16,Bxf2+,c5f2,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4n3/4P3/1BP3Q1/PP3bPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 0 9,"Forking King and Queen. If 9 QxB, 9...N-Q6 ch forks the royalty again. If 9 KxB, 9...NxP ch ALSO forks the white royals! White does the honorable thing and resigns. He has been magnificently outplayed!"
