1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"After an interesting skirmish in the middle game featuring some inaccuracies on both sides, this game wound down to a R+N v R ending. In researching the internet, I found that the stronger side can rarely win, but that the best move for both sides is sometimes far from obvious. So, of course, I was anxious to feed this into the GK analyzer (the only computer program I have available) to see if it could find better moves in the ending."
