2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"Let's be frank I planed on playing Benko as always, yet I was a bit drunk when I move and confused pawns"

5,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p2B1/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,I think whites best reply was cxd5. I would be bound to lose some tempo
6,c6,c7c6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p2B1/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,As a caro-kann player I decided to go for a slav defence. After Bxf6 I would get to kinda ideas that I tend to exploit in Bronstein - Larsen variation of caro-kann or just accept doubled pawn for a pair of bishops
7,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p2B1/2PP4/4P3/PP3PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"solid move, consolidating pawn chain"
8,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p1bB1/2PP4/4P3/PP3PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,Probably I should have moved my knight to e4 . Especially that white black square bishop seems to be a bad one due to placement of black pawns on white squares.

10,exf6,e7f6,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p2p2/3p1b2/2PP4/4P3/PP3PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,I decided it was good to make an e-file a semi open one due to lack of development of white king side
11,a3,a2a3,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p2p2/3p1b2/2PP4/P3P3/1P3PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,stoping Bxb1 Rxb1 and Qa5+ winning a a2 pawn. By recapturing with Queen white blocks rook on a1
12,Bd6,f8d6,rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/2pb1p2/3p1b2/2PP4/P3P3/1P3PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 1 7,"invitation to close the position and development of last piece on king side, I just couldn't find a better square for bishop for now"
13,Qa4,d1a4,rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/2pb1p2/3p1b2/Q1PP4/P3P3/1P3PPP/RN2KBNR b KQkq - 2 7,pinning c6
