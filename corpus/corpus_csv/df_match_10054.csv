6,Nh6,g8h6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n4n/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,Black surprises & develops his piece on the rim (viloating the basic rule develop your pieces towards the center); Anyway white now goes for the center p break with
7,d4,d2d4,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n4n/4p3/2BPP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,Black probably expected 5.dxe4 & so he comes down with the text but breaks another principle - Do not move piece twice unless necessary! but white simply plays
8,Ng4,h6g4,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2BPP1n1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 5,Black probably expected 5.dxe4 & so he comes down with the text but breaks another principle - Do not move piece twice unless necessary! but white simply plays
9,h3,h2h3,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2BPP1n1/5N1P/PPP2PP1/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,Driving off the N before taking the central e5-p.
10,Nf6,g4f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2BPP3/5N1P/PPP2PP1/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 6,With no good choice black has to retreat the N & in the process he counters whites central e4-p. White now has 2 good replies Nxe5 or dxe5 & he prefers the latter
11,dxe5,d4e5,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4P3/2B1P3/5N1P/PPP2PP1/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,The point now was what Black would do? will he captures whites e4-p or retreat the N to g8 & to my surprise he prefers the former
12,Nxe4,f6e4,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/4P3/2B1n3/5N1P/PPP2PP1/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,Black obviously is either punch drunk or overlooks whites coming next move
13,Qd5,d1d5,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/3QP3/2B1n3/5N1P/PPP2PP1/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 1 7,Sets Q-B battery on the diagonal a2-g8- with dual threat of either Qxe4 picking the N or Qxf7 # How will Black react?
14,Nxf2,e4f2,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/3QP3/2B5/5N1P/PPP2nP1/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 8,Probably hoping Kxf2 ; but  it seems black cracks in the heat of pressure & misses the #
15,Qxf7#,d5f7,r1bqkb1r/pppp1Qpp/2n5/4P3/2B5/5N1P/PPP2nP1/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 8,A good example on how waste of time & tempo whips the attack for the opponent !
