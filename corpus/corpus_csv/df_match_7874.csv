1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game features a rather interesting queen side attack.  I don't castle till move 25, for one I didn't need/want to and two seemed to lose to much time in my strong attack if I did.  The game starts of with the Sicilian so we'll start when white breaks the main line."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Bc4 the first break in the main line I believe Blake(2000+) annotated a game in which white played this move.

6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/3pp3/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,Blocking off f7 transforming into a Schevengin Sicilian structure.
7,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/3pp3/2p5/2BPP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,Qxd4?! best in my opinion was Nxd4 preparing an early king side attack with g4 going for something like the Keres Attack vs the Schevengin.  This just seems to waste a tempo.
8,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/3pp3/8/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,Qxd4?! best in my opinion was Nxd4 preparing an early king side attack with g4 going for something like the Keres Attack vs the Schevengin.  This just seems to waste a tempo.

10,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2npp3/8/2BQP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 1 6,White might try to move the queen to d3 trying to keep some development.

12,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk1nr/pp2bppp/2npp3/8/2B1P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 3 7,a6 is a typical move in the Sicilian defends the very vulnerable b5 and prepares b5 in time.

22,Rc8,a8c8,2r1k2r/1pqbbppp/p1nppn2/8/2B1P3/P1N1BN2/1PP1QPPP/2KR3R w k - 1 12,Doubling up on the half open file.

30,Bb5,d7b5,2q1k2r/1p2bppp/p2ppn2/1b6/2n1P3/P2QBN2/1PP2PPP/2KR3R w k - 2 16,Sets up a possible discoveries.
31,Qc3,d3c3,2q1k2r/1p2bppp/p2ppn2/1b6/2n1P3/P1Q1BN2/1PP2PPP/2KR3R b k - 3 16,Qc3? losses a pawn and gives black space.
32,Nxe4,f6e4,2q1k2r/1p2bppp/p2pp3/1b6/2n1n3/P1Q1BN2/1PP2PPP/2KR3R w k - 0 17,Nxe4! the g7 pawn might as well be green from poison...  Qxg7?? Bf6 and the queen now must be sacrificed in order to stop mate.  Bxb2+ Kb1 Nc3#.  Funny at the time I didn't see this simple mate.  Black actually has mate several mates after Qxg7?? Bf6 (Qg4???) but I knew I had forced mate after Qg4??? and that's all that matters.

37,bxa3,b2a3,2q1k2r/1p2bppp/p3p3/1b1p4/4n3/P3B3/2PN1PPP/2KRQ2R b k - 0 19,Think this is forced for if c3 Nxc3 will more than likely lead to mate.
