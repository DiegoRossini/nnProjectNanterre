1,a3,a2a3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/P7/1PPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Although primarily used for shock value and as a waiting move (sometimes used by players who prefer to play as Black), 1.a3 has other uses; It prevents the Black bishop from coming to b4 (and also discourages it from coming to c5 as White can then hit it with pawn to b4), and the move also sets the foundations for space gaining moves on the queenside with b4 and c4.  Therefore Whites next move, blocking the c-pawn, is a little inconsistant in my opinion."
2,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/8/P7/1PPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"?! Considering that playing his pawn to e4 has been ruled out for now, it is only the c-pawn that can contest control of the d5 square for White ... so probably best not to block its advance."

Admittedly Blacks dark-squared bishop is pretty passive at the moment, but this may not always be the case (particularly in a game with no blocked pawns).  It could also have turned out to be an important defensive piece for Black."

16,Bxf6,e7f6,r1bqk2r/ppp3pp/2np1b2/5pB1/8/P4N2/1PP1PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 9,The exchanges have given Black an easier game and White no longer has his lead in development.

20,O-O,e8g8,r1b2rk1/ppp3pp/2np1q2/5p2/8/P3PN2/1PP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 1 11,"But Black prefers to get his king tucked away.  The pawn could have been taken without too much trouble (e.g. 10...Qxb2 11.Bc4 (keeping the black king in the centre is vital if the pawn sac is to be worth anything) 11...Qc3  12.Nd2 Ne5 13.Bb3 c6 follwed by 14...d5 and 15...0-0 and White has no compensation), but safety first cannot be criticised!"

The knight is on a great square here, controlling some important squares (d3 and f4) so White is forced to exchange."
