1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"It's been a while since I added one of my games here, and although I know losses are more valuable to annotate than entertaining sac wins, which tend to be purely shown to show off, here I'd like to show an entertaining sac win.   Make of that what you will. :)"
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The Sicilian, as played in our three previous encounters where I had white.   We had one win each and a draw from those games."
3,c3,c2c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,The c3 variation
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,The slightly less favoured of the two main lines; 2. ... d5 seems to give black better results
5,e5,e4e5,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p1P3/8/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"So I push.   Black has to be a bit careful about ending up in a French-type position - not necessarily because of the position itself, but because it can be different to their usual games and they mayn't be aware of some of the traps"
6,Nd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/8/2pnP3/8/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,The knight comes forward
7,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/8/2pnP3/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,And I push.   The point of 2. c3 is to be able to retake in the centre with a pawn and retain the balance in the centre.
8,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/8/3nP3/3p4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,So black takes
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/8/3nP3/3p4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,And I develop.   5. ... dc 6. QxN cb 7. BxP gives white a much better version of a Danish set-up; the queen and knight are both out as well.
10,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n5/3nP3/3p4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,So black develops his knight
11,cxd4,c3d4,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n5/3nP3/3P4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"And I take now.   I don't know if the transposition 5. cd Nc6 6. Nf3 is really any different, or if black has another fifth move to play"
12,d6,d7d6,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np4/3nP3/3P4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"This or 6. ... e6 are the two most common moves here, leading to different games"
13,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np4/3nP3/2BP4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,I develop the bishop with tempo
14,Nb6,d5b6,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/1nnp4/4P3/2BP4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 8,"And black retreats; this is often not a great square for the knight, and in some games, it can be undermined by a later a4-a5 push, when maybe a7 or b7 end up as targets for a queen or bishop respectively"
15,Bb3,c4b3,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/1nnp4/4P3/3P4/1B3N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 8,"The main line is 8. Bb5 here, but this is the line I play.   It involves a pawn sac - usually temporary - for a bit of play.   8. Bb5 I think is safer, but more drawish."
16,dxe5,d6e5,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/1nn5/4p3/3P4/1B3N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,So black takes
17,d5,d4d5,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/1nn5/3Pp3/8/1B3N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 9,"And I don't take, when the queens come off and white's king is a bit open, but play this move instead."
18,Na5,c6a5,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/1n6/n2Pp3/8/1B3N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 10,Black moves his knight
19,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/1n6/n2Pp3/8/1BN2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 10,And I develop.   I'm not worried about losing the LSB as the queen will cover the same squares from b3 in the event of an exchange.
20,f6,f7f6,r1bqkb1r/pp2p1pp/1n3p2/n2Pp3/8/1BN2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 11,"Maybe slightly ahead of time - I think black usually transposes the 11th and 10th as played in this game.   This move holds the pawn, but gives black light-squared weaknesses, which a bishop or queen on b3 can try take advantage of."
