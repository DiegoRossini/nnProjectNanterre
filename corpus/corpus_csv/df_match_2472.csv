1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"A little less common -- but in my opinion, often a little stronger -- than Qxd5."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"A little less common -- but in my opinion, often a little stronger -- than Qxd5."
3,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"A little less common -- but in my opinion, often a little stronger -- than Qxd5."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"A little less common -- but in my opinion, often a little stronger -- than Qxd5."
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"White can try to hang on to the extra pawn for a while with 3. c4, but this opens lines and aims for development over material."
6,Nxd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3n4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Now, c4 grabs a good amount of space in the center, and allows white to continue with a little initiative in the opening."
7,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3n4/2PP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"Now, c4 grabs a good amount of space in the center, and allows white to continue with a little initiative in the opening."
8,Nb6,d5b6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/1n6/8/2PP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"This is fine, as is Nf6, or even Nb4."
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/1n6/8/2PP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 5,"?! I don't love this move, as it blocks the light-squared bishop and the queen in, and basically commits black to moving this knight a second time in short order. But there's an even bigger problem, that white overlooks."
10,Nb8d7,b8d7,r1bqkb1r/pppnpppp/1n6/8/2PP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 3 6,"?! I don't love this move, as it blocks the light-squared bishop and the queen in, and basically commits black to moving this knight a second time in short order. But there's an even bigger problem, that white overlooks."
11,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkb1r/pppnpppp/1n6/8/2PP4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 4 6,"? Missing the way to capitalize on black's mistake last move. c5! traps the Nb6, winning a piece. Those of you who ever have a chance to play me at blitz chess will notice that my quality of play plummets precipitously; this is one small example."
12,c5,c7c5,r1bqkb1r/pp1npppp/1n6/2p5/2PP4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,Perhaps seeing the danger before white does; this move saves the knight.
13,dxc5,d4c5,r1bqkb1r/pp1npppp/1n6/2P5/2P5/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"White still has a little edge, though."
14,Nxc5,d7c5,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/1n6/2n5/2P5/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,"Played immediately. In a non-blitz situation, I would've looked to see if moves like Be3 or Bf4 were better; in blitz I jump on the chance to move the king to a slightly worse square. Lasker's old saying, “When you see a good move, look for a better one” wasn't meant for games this fast!"
15,Qxd8+,d1d8,r1bQkb1r/pp2pppp/1n6/2n5/2P5/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 8,"Played immediately.

16,Kxd8,e8d8,r1bk1b1r/pp2pppp/1n6/2n5/2P5/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ - 0 9,Threatening to simply win the Nc5.
17,Be3,c1e3,r1bk1b1r/pp2pppp/1n6/2n5/2P5/2N1BN2/PP3PPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 1 9,Threatening to simply win the Nc5.
18,Ne6,c5e6,r1bk1b1r/pp2pppp/1n2n3/8/2P5/2N1BN2/PP3PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 2 10,"?! A little surprising. I was expecting a move like e6, defending the knight while opening a line for the Bf8. Now the e-pawn is blocked, and the bishop will take some time to resuscitate. In the meantime..."
19,O-O-O+,e1c1,r1bk1b1r/pp2pppp/1n2n3/8/2P5/2N1BN2/PP3PPP/2KR1B1R b - - 3 10,"An easily parried threat, but in faster games, it's a LOT easier to be on the offensive than on the defensive. Black's options don't look great at this point: Nd7 blocks in the other bishop, too, Bd7 loses a piece (and maybe more) to c5, and King moves have their own problems (e.g., 10. ...Kf8 11. c5 Nd7 12. Bf5, with Ne5 looming)."
20,Kc7,d8c7,r1b2b1r/ppk1pppp/1n2n3/8/2P5/2N1BN2/PP3PPP/2KR1B1R w - - 4 11,?! Also not good. There isn't a lot of safety to be found on the queenside. White has some pretty strong continuations.
21,Nb5+,c3b5,r1b2b1r/ppk1pppp/1n2n3/1N6/2P5/4BN2/PP3PPP/2KR1B1R b - - 5 11,"The best way to attack! Black has only two options, and one (11. ...Kc6 12. Ne5#) is out of the question."
22,Kb8,c7b8,rkb2b1r/pp2pppp/1n2n3/1N6/2P5/4BN2/PP3PPP/2KR1B1R w - - 6 12,"White would love to play Bf4+ as a follow-up, but currently the Ne6 guards the f4 square."
23,Ng5,f3g5,rkb2b1r/pp2pppp/1n2n3/1N4N1/2P5/4B3/PP3PPP/2KR1B1R b - - 7 12,"So why not play a diverting sacrifice? Black isn't obligated to take, of course, but a move like this sure is tempting!"
24,Nxg5,e6g5,rkb2b1r/pp2pppp/1n6/1N4n1/2P5/4B3/PP3PPP/2KR1B1R w - - 0 13,? The final mistake. Something like Nxc4 offered much more resistance. Now the house comes down.
25,Bf4+,e3f4,rkb2b1r/pp2pppp/1n6/1N4n1/2P2B2/8/PP3PPP/2KR1B1R b - - 1 13,"I've got a looooong way to go before I'm at all passable at faster games, but I have a feeling that with games like this, I'm on the right track!"
