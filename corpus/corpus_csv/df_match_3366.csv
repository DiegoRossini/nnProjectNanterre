1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

She's at it again!  Things have a habit of coming in threes, don't they?  Well, on that Saturday they certainly did.  My opponent this time was dmaestro who beat me in that 60 mover where I lost against him because I chose to take off the wrong pawn.  If I had taken the central pawn instead of the side pawn I would have clawed back half a point off him but it wasn't to be.  On move 18 he just did not know what was gonna hit him.  So how did this happen, well, here is the Gameknot Analysis version of our game: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=18563197&rnd=0.8681993657365421"
