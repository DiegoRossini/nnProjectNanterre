1,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"From a recent mini-tournament, white opens with the unconventional Van 't Kruijs opening. The opening is somewhat passive as it hinders the DSB, but has plenty of transpositional value as we could arrive in an English or Queen's pawn game, or reversed french or dutch."
