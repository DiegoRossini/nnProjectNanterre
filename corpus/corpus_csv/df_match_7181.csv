Be2 line. I noticed my opponent played against the Scandinavian with great success in the gameknot mini-tournament on the same opening http://gameknot.com/mt.pl?id=41299 . His d3 system played in the tournament (and chosen for this game) is modest but solid, and I thought it would be interesting to play against it."

The idea for black to encourage d3 is that white generally plays d4 at some point to have an open game, at which point the bishop is active again. Other moves like ..Bg4 are also possible, but the effectiveness of ..Bg4 is already lessened through white's Be2 (so all the interesting variations like h3 Bh5, g4 Bg6 are not so strong after white plays d3).
