3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"At least so far, Black is playing a modern position while White accepts the classical position and occupies the center."
4,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,Interesting.  Prepares d5 but at the cost of being unable to immediately deploy the knight to c6.
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 3,Interesting.  Prepares d5 but at the cost of being unable to immediately deploy the knight to c6.
6,c6,c7c6,rnbqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2p3p1/8/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,Interesting.  Prepares d5 but at the cost of being unable to immediately deploy the knight to c6.

11,Be3,c1e3,rn1qk1nr/pp2ppbp/2pp2p1/8/3PP1b1/2NBBN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 3 6,"This does prepare d5 except that d5 seems immediately playable.  Perhaps the ultimate aim is avoiding an isolated queen pawn, but I am not sure that an immediate d5 would create one.  There is also no reason to fear a reciprical pin should black play Nf6.  Black should develop a piece besides the e pawn for several reasons.  First, white is better developed with more central, active pieces.  Each black move that fails to create activity adds to the disparity between black and white."

The move accomplishes two things.  It provides a waiting move, and it sets the stage for a potential kingside assault.  I do not really know if I want to fully commit to the kingside thrust yet."
