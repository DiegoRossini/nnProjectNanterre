1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"Hi everyone!

Jim Friar got some revenge over me for publishing his loss against Delta the Master Blaster.  Sadly I was unable to match Delta's stellar performance but I thought this game would be worthy of annotation because it can throw up a thread of which is better.  Q or 2 rooks.  In this game the Wicked Witch of the West won hands down!  She was aided by a very rampant steed though.  Gameknot Analysis is provided here to help you follow this game.  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15882901&fb=1&rnd=0.3066320580432481.  Jim starts off the game with 1. Nf3 which is the Reti Opening which is rich in flexibility and options."
