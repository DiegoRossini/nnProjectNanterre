1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi all! I'm coming to you today with a very special game--for me anyway. This game pushed me across the 1800 mark for the first time! I think the play itself is interesting enough to be worth a look, as well. I get an advantage relatively early on, and then on move 18 I make a choice that gives the game its very unique flavor. Enjoy!"
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,l-d-j chooses the Center Counter Defense--old but good.
3,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Personally I like this line more than the classical 2...Qxd5. This is the Marshall Gambit, where White may be able to hold on to his extra pawn if he so chooses."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"Personally I like this line more than the classical 2...Qxd5. This is the Marshall Gambit, where White may be able to hold on to his extra pawn if he so chooses."
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"I stick to the main line, though. If Black takes on d5, I'll play c2-c4 and counterattack while gaining space."
6,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/3P2b1/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"Unusual! It seems that White can very solidly hold on to the d5 pawn now with 4.f3 Bf5 5.Bb5+ Nbd7 6.c4, though the White Kingside will be cramped and he may find his light-squared Bishop awkwardly placed later on."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/3P2b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,"I decide to begin development and keep my center open instead, letting Black regain his pawn. I can still follow up with c2-c4 after all."
8,Qxd5,d8d5,rn2kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3q4/3P2b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,Momentarily responding to the threat on my Knight. No sense in allowing Black to mess up my kingside pawns by trading on f3. Of course the immediate 5.c2-c4 was playable here.
9,Be2,f1e2,rn2kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3q4/3P2b1/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,Momentarily responding to the threat on my Knight. No sense in allowing Black to mess up my kingside pawns by trading on f3. Of course the immediate 5.c2-c4 was playable here.
10,Nc6,b8c6,r3kb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3q4/3P2b1/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 6,Already the position is very interesting; Black now threatens to win my pawn on d4 with ...Bxf3 Bxf3 Qxd4. **EDIT: This is actually not true; thanks to theduckquacker for catching it!
11,c4,c2c4,r3kb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3q4/2PP2b1/5N2/PP2BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,Time to kick the BQ off her comfy central perch.
12,Qf5,d5f5,r3kb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/5q2/2PP2b1/5N2/PP2BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 7,Black maintains a centralized Queen and pressure on both f3 and c2.
13,Be3,c1e3,r3kb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/5q2/2PP2b1/4BN2/PP2BPPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 2 7,O-O-O is coming and I don't want to have to worry about the defense of the d-pawn.
14,O-O-O,e8c8,2kr1b1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/5q2/2PP2b1/4BN2/PP2BPPP/RN1QK2R w KQ - 3 8,"Black makes his freeing break, also threatening to jump down to b4 with his Bishop. White needs to get his King out of the center and activate his heavy pieces."
15,Nbd2,b1d2,2kr1b1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/5q2/2PP2b1/4BN2/PP1NBPPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 4 8,"Black makes his freeing break, also threatening to jump down to b4 with his Bishop. White needs to get his King out of the center and activate his heavy pieces."

17,d5,d4d5,2kr1b1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3Ppq2/2P3b1/4BN2/PP1NBPPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 9,"But first, this natural move is pretty strong. It kicks the Knight out of c6 and exposes a threat on the a7 pawn (but of course White can't simply win the pawn, because of Black's equally-natural response...)"
18,Nb4,c6b4,2kr1b1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3Ppq2/1nP3b1/4BN2/PP1NBPPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 1 10,With the threat of ...Nc2+ thanks to the Queen.
19,Rc1,a1c1,2kr1b1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3Ppq2/1nP3b1/4BN2/PP1NBPPP/2RQK2R b K - 2 10,"10.O-O was also an option here, but I like the open file this line gets me against the Black King's position."
20,Nxa2,b4a2,2kr1b1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3Ppq2/2P3b1/4BN2/nP1NBPPP/2RQK2R w K - 0 11,"Right back where we were, but now the a-file is half-opened for the White Rook at the cost of a pawn."
21,Ra1,c1a1,2kr1b1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3Ppq2/2P3b1/4BN2/nP1NBPPP/R2QK2R b K - 1 11,"Right back where we were, but now the a-file is half-opened for the White Rook at the cost of a pawn."

25,h3,h2h3,2kr1b1r/1pp2ppp/p4n2/3Ppq2/1nP3b1/4BN1P/1P1NBPP1/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 13,"White needs to release some of the pressure on the kingside before he can pursue a queenside assault. This actually sets up a rather interesting option for Black: 13...h5?! where 14.hxg4 hxg4 gives Black a strong attack down the h-file. My opponent confided that he'd considered this line, but ultimately discarded it as White is not compelled to play hxg4 immediately."
26,Bxf3,g4f3,2kr1b1r/1pp2ppp/p4n2/3Ppq2/1nP5/4Bb1P/1P1NBPP1/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 14,"Of course 14.Bxf3 was tempting, in order to set up an attempt to play Bg4, but the text is stronger, getting the Knight into the game and unblocking White's lines. Here the computer recommends 14...Bd6 to pressure the White kingside, evaluating the position as just about even with big attacks on both sides."
27,Nxf3,d2f3,2kr1b1r/1pp2ppp/p4n2/3Ppq2/1nP5/4BN1P/1P2BPP1/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 14,"Of course 14.Bxf3 was tempting, in order to set up an attempt to play Bg4, but the text is stronger, getting the Knight into the game and unblocking White's lines.

Black intends to force White to give up his dark-squared Bishop and weaken his kingside squares further (after, for example, 15.Ra5 Nxe3 16.fxe3), but it's all moot as White has a crushing fork at his disposal now that the White Queen's scope extends to d3..."
