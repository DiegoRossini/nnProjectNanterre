1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everybody, my 13th match with Freddy, the Master Mater and it very nearly was lucky 13 for me.  Because right up until after the 40 move mark I had drawing chances against him.  I built up a seemingly watertight defense against him, but alas, he did eventually break through - I could have prevented it however and perhaps you the jury can decide just what prevented me from getting my biggest achievement of the whole of my chess career.  I play e4 and he gives me d6 which is the Pirc Defense."

Trouble is, Freddy can block the a2-g8 diagonal with his d pawn at any time and if I try to put Glenda on f3 then simply Nf6 spoils the show.  Still, it always pays to be on the lookout for attacking opportunities even when playing the Master Mater!"

I will tell you a little more about the term being ""Freddied"" - I am also a cricket fan and in the England cricket team there is a strike bowler and former England Skipper (who is partial to pedaloes!) who is called Andrew Flintoff and has a nickname Freddy.  So when an opposing batsman is clean bowled by Andrew Flintoff he is known to be ""Freddied"" - so same applies to the opponents on the receiving end of a checkmate from the Master Mater!  I have a MasterPlan though, tee hee hee!  I simply plan a forced queen trade even if it means Henry going to d1.  Because the Wicked Witch of the West has had my Henry 4 times out of 5 I would dearly lurve to see the back of her!  8. h3 is stage 1 - stop a knight incursion on g4.  Step 2, play e5 and we get a trade of d for e pawn and because Freddy's knight is en prise he either has to take on d1 or move his knight.  Either way the Wicked Witch disappears - kaboom!"
