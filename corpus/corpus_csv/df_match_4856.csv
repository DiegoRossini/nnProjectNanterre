11,Nd4,f3d4,rn1qkb1r/ppp2pp1/4pn1p/3p1b2/3N4/3PP3/PPP1BPPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 6,"But now, something changes. This is the first ""real"" move. Ok, no problem. I will retreat my bishop, and the naughty knight can go nowhere to be dangerous, while it is ready to be kicked away with c5 - or even e5, if I decide so."

The bad part is that he will be able to press hard on the diagonal - and b7 if ever my pawn chain gets open. Which is not likely just now, but wait..."

14,c5,c7c5,rn1qkb1r/pp3pp1/4pnbp/2pp4/3N4/3PPB2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,"Normal, he wants to put a question mark on my pawn chain. Now, d4 is the ""normal"" move. He can exchange the pawns, or the bishop, but nothing too dangerous. So, I tried something more interesting... at a blitz sight."

19,cxd5,c4d5,r2qkb1r/pp3pp1/4pnbp/2pP4/1n6/1N1PPB2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 10,"He went for it. A logic decision for a blitz game. Now, again, I can play Nxd5 (or exd5) etc. etc. But I went for the tactic."
20,Bxd3,g6d3,r2qkb1r/pp3pp1/4pn1p/2pP4/1n6/1N1bPB2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 11,"A lot of things are possible, here. If dxe6, the white bishop can take b7, threatening my rook, and e6 can take f7, giving check and weakening my king's position. On the other side, my bishop is threatening the rook f1, and the knight is approaching to a fork on c2. Normally, those forks are bad, because I will lose two pieces for a rook. BUT I had the feeling (I couldn't calculate it) that the knight will survive: look, after he takes the rook e1 (it will be there if he tries to save it), the queen would have taken the bishop and I will be able to play NxBf3 with check, so no danger..."

I would have played dxe6, leaving me the decision to be greedy (BxRf1) or try to save the day with fxe6. This one is bad, since white throws in Bh5+ and my king goes dangerously out in the worst possible way, no matter BxR or Nc2, winning another rook, I will probably be lost. But he behaves... good boy!"
22,exd5,e6d5,r2qkb1r/pp3pp1/5n1p/2pp4/1n6/1N1bPB2/PP3PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq - 0 12,"I still have Nc2, but I didn't want to give away the B unless necessary. This way, I prevent some bad surprise on the diagonal, ensuring a retreat point for my bishop, etc. I think I could have though about c4, solidifying the bishop and making Nc2 much more dangerous, but I was not sure about e6xf7+..."

Now, in a blitz, it is very easy to become nervous and play Nc2, but I had the feeling it would have just made me lose the knight. So,the most important thing: ""keep (or exchange) the knight""."
