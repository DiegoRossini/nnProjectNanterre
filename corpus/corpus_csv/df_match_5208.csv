1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I started normally, expecting another boring beginning."
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"His move was very different to any I had expected, so I was getting ready for a fun and intersting game!"
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"As we are usually taaught, I took the oppurtunity to take control of the center of the board."
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,He challenged me to a pawn swap but I didn't really want to let him get his queen out there so quickly. Now I had to think of a way to avoid this happening.
5,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"I ended up doing this, which proved to be very helpful for later. At that moment I was thinking that by doing that I had managed to prevent urgo from getting his knight easily to f6."
6,Bd7,c8d7,rn1qkbnr/pppb1ppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"Now urgo was trying to advance his bishop, I decided that wanted to castle  on the queen's side, so I was deciding on either advancing my knight or bishop."
7,Be3,c1e3,rn1qkbnr/pppb1ppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/4B3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 2 4,"Obviously, I chose bishop, as I didn't want his bishop pinning my knight if I were to move it to c3 and I didn't want to move my knight to d2, as that would trap my bishop."
8,Nc6,b8c6,r2qkbnr/pppb1ppp/2n1p3/3pP3/3P4/4B3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 3 5,I guess urgo was simply advancing his pieces to get himself into a good position.
9,Nf3,g1f3,r2qkbnr/pppb1ppp/2n1p3/3pP3/3P4/4BN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 4 5,I decided that I may aswell advance my knight to give me more power around the center of the board.
10,f6,f7f6,r2qkbnr/pppb2pp/2n1pp2/3pP3/3P4/4BN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"When he did that, realised he wanted me to take his pawn so that he would be able to advance his knight."
11,Bf4,e3f4,r2qkbnr/pppb2pp/2n1pp2/3pP3/3P1B2/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"To avoid taking his pawn I developed the pawn's protection by adding a bishop, which would be quite useful in the exchange."
12,g5,g7g5,r2qkbnr/pppb3p/2n1pp2/3pP1p1/3P1B2/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"When he did that, I noticed an oppurtunity to get a pawn up on him, unless he wanted to be checkmated."
13,Nxg5,f3g5,r2qkbnr/pppb3p/2n1pp2/3pP1N1/3P1B2/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"I took the pawn because I had realised that if he took my knight, I would have a three move forced checkmate."
14,fxg5,f6g5,r2qkbnr/pppb3p/2n1p3/3pP1p1/3P1B2/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,"Unfortunately, urgo didn't realise that and fell for my trap. Now the fun began!"
15,Qh5+,d1h5,r2qkbnr/pppb3p/2n1p3/3pP1pQ/3P1B2/8/PPP2PPP/RN2KB1R b KQkq - 1 8,His only option was to move his king forwards.
16,Ke7,e8e7,r2q1bnr/pppbk2p/2n1p3/3pP1pQ/3P1B2/8/PPP2PPP/RN2KB1R w KQ - 2 9,Now I was happy that I had earlier moved my pawn to e5 as his king wouldn't have been able to escape down their now.
17,Bxg5+,f4g5,r2q1bnr/pppbk2p/2n1p3/3pP1BQ/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RN2KB1R b KQ - 0 9,I continued with my plan.
18,Nf6,g8f6,r2q1b1r/pppbk2p/2n1pn2/3pP1BQ/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RN2KB1R w KQ - 1 10,"Helplessly, realising his mistake, urgo did the only move possible, preparing for the inevitable."
19,Bxf6#,g5f6,r2q1b1r/pppbk2p/2n1pB2/3pP2Q/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RN2KB1R b KQ - 0 10,"In just 9 moves I had beaten urgo, which is probably my quickest win!!"
