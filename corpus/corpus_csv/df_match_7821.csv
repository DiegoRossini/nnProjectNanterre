Nb5 may have been more forceful, as if the bishop moves away from the b8-h2 diagonal, with the exception of Bb4+, the pawn on c7 and the rook will disappear. Or 9...

Rxh1? (The question mark is not for a questionable move, it's just a question I would have asked myself). Anyway, those pawns on f2 and h2 would have become isolated, but as it is, my kingside pawns remain strong."
