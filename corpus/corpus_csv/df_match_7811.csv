1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This game features the Morra Gambit. It's not really popular at higher levels and perhaps for good reasons. It gives away a central pawn for two tempi and some open lines. White has some initiative but he has to be very creative or hope that Black will slip up and make his investment worthwhile.

11,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/8/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,Black has to be careful here since 6...Nf6 could be met with 7.e5 posing some immediate problems.

13,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkbnr/1p2pppp/p1np4/8/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 7,White stops Black's intended 8...Bg4 which could follow after the natural 8.Qe2. Now the Bishop has to stay inside the pawnchain.

This isn't a real cause of concern as I will have an open file and very good central control. Exchanging a pair of Knights also means White will have fewer attacking chances.
