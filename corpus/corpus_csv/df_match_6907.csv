7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/1bPP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 4,The book considers Bxc3+ generally not such a great idea because White fairly easily undoubles the pawns and often ends up with the Bishop pair
8,Bxc3+,b4c3,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/2b2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,The book considers Bxc3+ generally not such a great idea because White fairly easily undoubles the pawns and often ends up with the Bishop pair

10,f6,f7f6,rnbqk1nr/ppp3pp/4pp2/3p4/2PP4/2P2N2/P3PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,This move puzzled me. It seems to block of the Kingside Knight and weaken that side of board in general
11,e3,e2e3,rnbqk1nr/ppp3pp/4pp2/3p4/2PP4/2P1PN2/P4PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,I probably should have played 6. cxd5 to undouble the pawns immediately
12,Ne7,g8e7,rnbqk2r/ppp1n1pp/4pp2/3p4/2PP4/2P1PN2/P4PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,This wastes a Bishop move which could have been avoided with cxd5 earlier
13,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqk2r/ppp1n1pp/4pp2/3p4/2PP4/2PBPN2/P4PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 7,This wastes a Bishop move which could have been avoided with cxd5 earlier
14,dxc4,d5c4,rnbqk2r/ppp1n1pp/4pp2/8/2pP4/2PBPN2/P4PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,This wastes a Bishop move which could have been avoided with cxd5 earlier
15,Bxc4,d3c4,rnbqk2r/ppp1n1pp/4pp2/8/2BP4/2P1PN2/P4PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,This wastes a Bishop move which could have been avoided with cxd5 earlier

17,O-O,e1g1,rnbqk2r/pp2n1pp/2p1pp2/8/2BP4/2P1PN2/P4PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 9,"With my light squared Bishop and Queen on the board, Black's king seem awfully exposed to attack after the castle"
