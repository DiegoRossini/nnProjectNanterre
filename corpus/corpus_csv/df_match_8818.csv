Qh5?! followed by Nh6?...when simply Nc6 leave Black with an excellent game. 2...Qe7 is ok, but doesn't really do much to explain why white's second move isn't taken seriously.

Thanks  for the suggestion  I will use Nc6 in the future I like that. The reason this move cannot be taken seriously is that he brought queen out early, and he lost it. There is a reason masters are masters, and a reason why they choose not to immediately pull out the bazooka, and start blasting before a single pawn has been dropped."
