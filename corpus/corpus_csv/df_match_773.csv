1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,One of the best countering my usual attack.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,One of the best countering my usual attack.
3,Bf4,c1f4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P1B2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 2 2,One of the best countering my usual attack.
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/3P1B2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,One of the best countering my usual attack.
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/3P1B2/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"My intention is not to play c4, contrary to the normal play. But I had no need to compromise to it right now. Nd4, preparing e4 (if d5 is not payed) would have been a slightly better."
6,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/3P1B2/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,"My intention is not to play c4, contrary to the normal play. But I had no need to compromise to it right now. Nd4, preparing e4 (if d5 is not payed) would have been a slightly better."
7,c3,c2c3,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/3P1B2/2P2N2/PP2PPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"My intention is not to play c4, contrary to the normal play. But I had no need to compromise to it right now. Nd4, preparing e4 (if d5 is not payed) would have been a slightly better."
8,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppppppbp/5np1/8/3P1B2/2P2N2/PP2PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQ - 1 5,Giving me a second chance to try e4.
9,Nbd2,b1d2,rnbq1rk1/ppppppbp/5np1/8/3P1B2/2P2N2/PP1NPPPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 2 5,I go for it. Now he can stop me with d5. He can also  exchange my dsb by Ng5.
10,c5,c7c5,rnbq1rk1/pp1pppbp/5np1/2p5/3P1B2/2P2N2/PP1NPPPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 6,"A good player will do the right thing. This is a very good  move. I don't think taking the pawn will be good. I won't be able to stop e5, later."
11,e3,e2e3,rnbq1rk1/pp1pppbp/5np1/2p5/3P1B2/2P1PN2/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 6,I'm not forced to play e4. I have attack lines from here too.
12,cxd4,c5d4,rnbq1rk1/pp1pppbp/5np1/8/3p1B2/2P1PN2/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 7,"He is a move behind using the white squares, but I can. Of course, If I'd studied theory, all this must find familiar. I'm not on the GK db, and to look around is something I rarely allow myself to spend time on. I'm not a good student, I know :-)"
13,exd4,e3d4,rnbq1rk1/pp1pppbp/5np1/8/3P1B2/2P2N2/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 7,"He is a move behind using the white squares, but I can. Of course, If I'd studied theory, all this must find familiar.

14,d6,d7d6,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/3P1B2/2P2N2/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 8,Black doesn't bo for d5. Is he planning to fianchetto the lsb?
15,Qb3,d1b3,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/3P1B2/1QP2N2/PP1N1PPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 1 8,"I think the only sensible move for black is Nc6, preparing Na5 in case of Bc4-Ng5."
16,Nh5,f6h5,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p2p1/7n/3P1B2/1QP2N2/PP1N1PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 2 9,"Hard decision. Be3 seems good, but this will allow e5 and the Bg7 will be very strong."
17,Bg3,f4g3,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p2p1/7n/3P4/1QP2NB1/PP1N1PPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 3 9,"Maybe wrong. I planned to live with NxB, hxN."
18,e5,e7e5,rnbq1rk1/pp3pbp/3p2p1/4p2n/3P4/1QP2NB1/PP1N1PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 0 10,"I though that after dxe5, dxe5, Nxe5, black had Re8, and it was difficult to be sure I could save it. This was blitz."
19,Bh4,g3h4,rnbq1rk1/pp3pbp/3p2p1/4p2n/3P3B/1QP2N2/PP1N1PPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 1 10,"So I decided to come with this surprise. Black can't interpose a piece, ot it will be pinned for a move. He must move the Q."
20,Qc7,d8c7,rnb2rk1/ppq2pbp/3p2p1/4p2n/3P3B/1QP2N2/PP1N1PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 2 11,"Good, defending f7 and threatening to open too soon the c column (before I castle)."
21,d5,d4d5,rnb2rk1/ppq2pbp/3p2p1/3Pp2n/7B/1QP2N2/PP1N1PPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 0 11,"I intended to play a surprise move. I'm giving up the useful pin on the f pawn, and now he can play a pawn storm on my kingside. But this considerably losens the strenght of his dsb. The pin model is still on: if black plays e4, and I dare Nxe4, Re8 will lose me a minor piece."
22,Nd7,b8d7,r1b2rk1/ppqn1pbp/3p2p1/3Pp2n/7B/1QP2N2/PP1N1PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 1 12,"I'd say ""?"". He should have definitely played e4."
23,Be2,f1e2,r1b2rk1/ppqn1pbp/3p2p1/3Pp2n/7B/1QP2N2/PP1NBPPP/R3K2R b KQ - 2 12,"A weak move I discarded earlier because of Nf4, forcing me back to f1."
24,Nf4,h5f4,r1b2rk1/ppqn1pbp/3p2p1/3Pp3/5n1B/1QP2N2/PP1NBPPP/R3K2R w KQ - 3 13,"I have a strategy, that is to try to make mistakes appear as intentional. This sometimes lead to good sacs. But this time, I just sensed that I could find no advantage by it, and the best was to admit my mistake, and humbling defend."
25,Bf1,e2f1,r1b2rk1/ppqn1pbp/3p2p1/3Pp3/5n1B/1QP2N2/PP1N1PPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 4 13,"Ugly. And I am aware I will suffer now a strong attack against d3. I have to open a ""zen umbrella""."
26,Nc5,d7c5,r1b2rk1/ppq2pbp/3p2p1/2nPp3/5n1B/1QP2N2/PP1N1PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 5 14,? Just inviting Bf4 (Edit: Bf5).
27,Qc2,b3c2,r1b2rk1/ppq2pbp/3p2p1/2nPp3/5n1B/2P2N2/PPQN1PPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 6 14,? Just inviting Bf4 (Edit: Bf5).
