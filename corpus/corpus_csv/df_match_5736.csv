1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone, and again, welcome to gameknot, Amy!

During my break-time at work, a colleague of mine called Beverley mentioned that her daughter, Amy was learning how to play chess and had been taking part in some OTB junior tournaments.  I recommended gameknot to Beverley and she told Amy about it.  Amy logged on as snowbun and I challenged her to an unrated game to have some idea about what strength she was at.  So, she had her gameknot baptism with me.  She left a piece en prise very early on but played reasonably well after that.  Unfortunately for her I exchanged down so that she had no counterplay whatsoever and my extra piece made itself felt.  I increased my material advantage until she help-mated on move 37.  Gameknot analysis is on the following link:-http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15060312&rnd=0.6693379831140849."
