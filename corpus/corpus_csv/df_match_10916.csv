1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Hope this game turns out interesting after me giving it that title !
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The French defence , which I most commonly use against 1.e4"
3,d3,d2d3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Unusual move here. Blocks in his own white squared bishop , but has me on relatively unknown ground already as far as this opening is concerned..but continue as normal I think"
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Usual 2nd move for French defence
