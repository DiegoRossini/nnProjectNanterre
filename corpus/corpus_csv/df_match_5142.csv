1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I prefer 1.E4 from white to 1.D4
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I began playing the Sicilian only after I familiarized myself with the English as white.  Before, I had thought the lines of the Sicilian were too complex, and I favored the French Defence or the Caro Kann.  I would be interested to learn some of the systems where black plays 2.Nc6 or 2.E5 and then Nc6."
3,d3,d2d3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"I think this is not the most attractive move, closing down the f1-a6 diagonal."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"I believe this is a standard move in the Sicilian, just as 2.Nc3 is in the English."
5,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 3,The first inkling that white has in mind to castle queenside and hack black on the kingside.
6,d6,d7d6,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/2p5/4P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"I am not sure if this is still a standard Sicilian, because I am playing the lines of the English Opening in reverse."
7,Be3,c1e3,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/2p5/4P3/2NPB3/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,Maybe it would have been better to play for Bb2.
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/2p5/4P3/2NPB3/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 2 5,"I am not sure, but I think this line may be the infamous Dragon variation.  However, I am still going with lines from the English."
9,h3,h2h3,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/2p5/4P3/2NPB2P/PPP2PP1/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"I am not sure, but I think this line may be the infamous Dragon variation.  However, I am still going with lines from the English."
10,g6,g7g6,r1bqkb1r/pp2pp1p/2np1np1/2p5/4P3/2NPB2P/PPP2PP1/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"I am not sure, but I think this line may be the infamous Dragon variation.  However, I am still going with lines from the English."
11,d4,d3d4,r1bqkb1r/pp2pp1p/2np1np1/2p5/3PP3/2N1B2P/PPP2PP1/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,"An interesting move, I think.  I would be interested to know what you think white has in mind here..."
12,cxd4,c5d4,r1bqkb1r/pp2pp1p/2np1np1/8/3pP3/2N1B2P/PPP2PP1/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,"I think this exchange will maintain basic equality...Against a strong opponent, I was playing conservatively."
13,Bxd4,e3d4,r1bqkb1r/pp2pp1p/2np1np1/8/3BP3/2N4P/PPP2PP1/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 7,Do you think Nxd4 was stronger...?
14,Bg7,f8g7,r1bqk2r/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/3BP3/2N4P/PPP2PP1/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 1 8,Do you think Nxd4 was stronger...?
15,Bxf6,d4f6,r1bqk2r/pp2ppbp/2np1Bp1/8/4P3/2N4P/PPP2PP1/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 8,"I have the two bishops, and reasonable control of the center.  However, by now it seems clear that white is going to castle queenside and try to smash black up on the kingside.  I have a good defensive bishop, but I am worried white might play something like g4."
16,Bxf6,g7f6,r1bqk2r/pp2pp1p/2np1bp1/8/4P3/2N4P/PPP2PP1/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 9,"I have the two bishops, and reasonable control of the center.

17,Qd2,d1d2,r1bqk2r/pp2pp1p/2np1bp1/8/4P3/2N4P/PPPQ1PP1/R3KBNR b KQkq - 1 9,I though Qh6 would have been an unpleasant harassment.
18,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp2pp1p/2np1bp1/8/4P3/2N4P/PPPQ1PP1/R3KBNR w KQ - 2 10,It now seems likely that white will play f4 and e5.
19,Bd3,f1d3,r1bq1rk1/pp2pp1p/2np1bp1/8/4P3/2NB3P/PPPQ1PP1/R3K1NR b KQ - 3 10,It now seems likely that white will play f4 and e5.
