1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,So they decide to open with the usual King Pawn opening.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"And once again, I decide to break my usual muscle memory by responding with e5. Instead, I try to work toward a more unusual Najdorf Sicilian."
3,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"And- right there. I was trying to take the game into a direction I wasn't familiar with by at least playing a Najdorf by the main lines. Instead, my opponent beats me to it, by trying something even more bold on their end- the Grand Prix! The moment I saw f4, I knew I was in for a complicated game. As a King Pawn player, with White, I have main line experience against the Sicilian. I rarely ever attempt one myself, but this is my first time ever seeing a Grand Prix. I would never be able to pull one of these off as of now, and now I have to think of ways to defend against it?! Luckily for me though, the high rated players on Gameknot absolutely love this opening, and I was able to find plenty of helpful annotated games to give me ideas on how to defend, what to expect, and just what exciting turns this game could have unfolding into the battlefield..."
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Apparently, this move is why you don't normally see e4-f4 in the first two moves. Especially not among the masters- they normally try e4, c5, Nc3, Nc6, f4! Personally, I don't see why either line aids or impairs either color, but that's just due to lack of experience on my end. I was still at least interested in seeing where this game was going. What line will White try to lead me down for their attempt at victory?"
5,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pP4/5P2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"(?) - They take the d pawn! Now we're transposing into Scandinavian lines... and now to say I'm overly uncomfortable would be the massive understatement of the year. As White, I love playing the Scandinavian, regardless if we go into the main line or not. I never touch it as Black. But now Black must play the Scand, after trying Sicilian and meeting the Grand Prix. This game's stakes just got raised on my end."
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2pP4/5P2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"I really don't have much choice about Nf6. I have a lot of experience with the Scand, and I know all too well how easy it is to punish Black after Qxd5 (like say, with Nc3?). This game can still go anywhere, and I can only hope that White here doesn't know this line of Grand Prix too well either..."
7,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2pP4/2P2P2/8/PP1P2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,We have now made a full transition into the Scandinavian main lines.
8,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pP4/2P2P2/8/PP1P2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,So I decide to stick by them and see where White wants to go with this.
9,dxe6,d5e6,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4Pn2/2p5/2P2P2/8/PP1P2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,(?) - Except this line of the Scandinavian works better when there is NOT a c5 pawn in play.
10,Bxe6,c8e6,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/4bn2/2p5/2P2P2/8/PP1P2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"Now I've got the better development. GK database has this position set to equal or strong chances for Black at this point, in spite of being down a pawn."
11,d3,d2d3,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/4bn2/2p5/2P2P2/3P4/PP4PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,"(!?) - White decides to open up even more. I don't agree with this move. White continues to delay back rank piece development, and d3 didn't even free the DSB all that much. If my opponent isn't careful, they will allow Black to easily win the centre if this keeps going..."
12,Nc6,b8c6,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1bn2/2p5/2P2P2/3P4/PP4PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 7,So I decide to make good on my threat and develop my back rank pieces even further. Black now presents very clear threats to seize control of the board at this rate.
13,Nf3,g1f3,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1bn2/2p5/2P2P2/3P1N2/PP4PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 7,Finally! Out comes a back rank piece. But I still favor my chances.
14,Bd6,f8d6,r2qk2r/pp3ppp/2nbbn2/2p5/2P2P2/3P1N2/PP4PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 3 8,"Now I establish a fortress for Black, and enable O-O."
15,Be2,f1e2,r2qk2r/pp3ppp/2nbbn2/2p5/2P2P2/3P1N2/PP2B1PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 4 8,"The Q-side isn't developed nor safe enough for the exposed king to hide. The sooner, the better."
16,Qc7,d8c7,r3k2r/ppq2ppp/2nbbn2/2p5/2P2P2/3P1N2/PP2B1PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 5 9,"(!) - I've now enabled O-O-O while launching well aimed attacks on f4-g3-h2. If White plans O-O, then this threat has to be addressed at once."
17,Qd2,d1d2,r3k2r/ppq2ppp/2nbbn2/2p5/2P2P2/3P1N2/PP1QB1PP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 6 9,"If O-O, then Bxf4 at no material loss. If g3, then eventually Bh3 deters O-O. Probably White's best."
18,O-O,e8g8,r4rk1/ppq2ppp/2nbbn2/2p5/2P2P2/3P1N2/PP1QB1PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 7 10,So I just keep up with the patience and wait to see what will happen next.
19,O-O,e1g1,r4rk1/ppq2ppp/2nbbn2/2p5/2P2P2/3P1N2/PP1QB1PP/RNB2RK1 b - - 8 10,"The king finally hides away into the kingside. The problem is, he isn't even remotely safe yet..."
20,Nd4,c6d4,r4rk1/ppq2ppp/3bbn2/2p5/2Pn1P2/3P1N2/PP1QB1PP/RNB2RK1 w - - 9 11,"(?) - There was probably a better move, but I opted for the move that caused White the most disturbance to rub some more salt into the wounds of grief..."
