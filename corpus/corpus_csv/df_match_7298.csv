Since he was in a strong position after the opening, but I could surprise him with a tactic."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"No way, it is difficult to find someone playing the ""normal"" c4, in order to practice the Budapest. Now, I have to improvise. And the db offers the widest variety of followings... too many to study them."

I am always defeated playing with white... but as black, I am not sure how to go on, so I tried to get some movement."

Anyway: I am delaying to move the d pawn, in order to control e5 with d6. And I don't like to play the bishop on e7, it's just too passive. So, I tried something else."

I confess, at this point, that I honestly believed I will lose."
