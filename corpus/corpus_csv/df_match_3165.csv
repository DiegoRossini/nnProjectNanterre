1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Best by test, as Fischer says."
2,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Looks like a standard Pirc defense.  I usually try to open with a large center and push the d or e-pawn to rank 5 against this turtlish opening.
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"What??  This move moved me quite a bit.  Being unfamiliar with the so-called ""Balogh Defense,"" irregular as it might be, I played conservatively over the next few moves until the position could even out."
4,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1p1pp/3p4/5p2/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"What??  This move moved me quite a bit.  Being unfamiliar with the so-called ""Balogh Defense,"" irregular as it might be, I played conservatively over the next few moves until the position could even out."

6,d5,d6d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1p1pp/8/3p1p2/3PP3/5P2/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Developing the knight and defending e4.  4. exd5 seemed playable but I wanted to migrate my f3 pawn to open my kingside and stay in the center.
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1p1pp/8/3p1p2/3PP3/2N2P2/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,Developing the knight and defending e4.  4. exd5 seemed playable but I wanted to migrate my f3 pawn to open my kingside and stay in the center.

13,d5,d4d5,r1bqkb1r/ppp1p1pp/2n2n2/3P1p2/4P3/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,if 7. e5 then 7. ...Ne4 is very troublesome.  e.g. 8. Nxe4 fxe4 and my d pawn falls.  8. Bd3 or Bd2 leave me cramped while his knight laughs at me.
14,Na5,c6a5,r1bqkb1r/ppp1p1pp/5n2/n2P1p2/4P3/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,"7. ...fxe4 8. dxc6 Qxd1 9. Kxd1 exf3 10. cxb7 Bxb7 or
