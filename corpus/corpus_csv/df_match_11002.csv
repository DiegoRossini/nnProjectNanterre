1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,My standard.
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I just don't see this often, and quite honestly - I don't like it a bit. I know remy well enough to know that he probably has been using this defense a lot lately, and is just wanting to spring it on his team captain as some sort of cruel joke."
3,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,So I take what he gives me - a solid center.
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,No brainer here folks - push e5 to restrict his Ng8 and lock in his Bc8.
5,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"And it suddenly hit me that we were playing the Advance Variation of the French. I despise the French. How did this happen? Ok - the question here is to whether or not exchange the light squared bishops. That's why I hate the French. White's ""comfortable"" response of trading these bishops lets black off the hook with his ""bad"" bishop. I decide to oblige (ceding initiative and tempo) in order to prepare for a quicker than normal endgame that - if I start planning now, I can win. We'll see............."

7,Bb5+,f1b5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/1BppP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 4,"And here we are. A typical French pawn structure. In this position, I just envisioned the c file with no pawns on it. I sure would like to own the first file of the game, so I encourage their exchange."
8,Bd7,c8d7,rn1qkbnr/pp1b1ppp/4p3/1BppP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 5,"And here we are. A typical French pawn structure. In this position, I just envisioned the c file with no pawns on it. I sure would like to own the first file of the game, so I encourage their exchange."

12,cxd4,c5d4,rn2kbnr/pp1q1ppp/4p3/3pP3/3p4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 7,remy accepts:)
13,cxd4,c3d4,rn2kbnr/pp1q1ppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 7,"hmmm.......maybe we can do a similar exchange of the other bishops? If he accepts again, I'm still liking my pawn structure."
14,Bb4+,f8b4,rn2k1nr/pp1q1ppp/4p3/3pP3/1b1P4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 8,"hmmm.......maybe we can do a similar exchange of the other bishops? If he accepts again, I'm still liking my pawn structure."
15,Bd2,c1d2,rn2k1nr/pp1q1ppp/4p3/3pP3/1b1P4/8/PP1B1PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 2 8,remy accepts again:)
16,Bxd2+,b4d2,rn2k1nr/pp1q1ppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/8/PP1b1PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 0 9,remy accepts again:)
17,Qxd2,d1d2,rn2k1nr/pp1q1ppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/8/PP1Q1PPP/RN2K1NR b KQkq - 0 9,Logical development in preparation for castling.
18,Ne7,g8e7,rn2k2r/pp1qnppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/8/PP1Q1PPP/RN2K1NR w KQkq - 1 10,Logical development in preparation for castling.
19,Ne2,g1e2,rn2k2r/pp1qnppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/8/PP1QNPPP/RN2K2R b KQkq - 2 10,Likewise.
20,O-O,e8g8,rn3rk1/pp1qnppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/8/PP1QNPPP/RN2K2R w KQ - 3 11,Black finishes development.
21,O-O,e1g1,rn3rk1/pp1qnppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/8/PP1QNPPP/RN3RK1 b - - 4 11,Black finishes development.
22,Nbc6,b8c6,r4rk1/pp1qnppp/2n1p3/3pP3/3P4/8/PP1QNPPP/RN3RK1 w - - 5 12,Black finishes development.
23,Nbc3,b1c3,r4rk1/pp1qnppp/2n1p3/3pP3/3P4/2N5/PP1QNPPP/R4RK1 b - - 6 12,And white does the same.
24,a6,a7a6,r4rk1/1p1qnppp/p1n1p3/3pP3/3P4/2N5/PP1QNPPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 13,?! A little too passive for me. Probably better was a move to control the c file.
25,Na4,c3a4,r4rk1/1p1qnppp/p1n1p3/3pP3/N2P4/8/PP1QNPPP/R4RK1 b - - 1 13,Looking to fork enemy pieces.
26,Nc8,e7c8,r1n2rk1/1p1q1ppp/p1n1p3/3pP3/N2P4/8/PP1QNPPP/R4RK1 w - - 2 14,"Yeah - I know. This move protects the vulnerable b6 square, but it is made running away. This has to be punished - but how?"
27,Rac1,a1c1,r1n2rk1/1p1q1ppp/p1n1p3/3pP3/N2P4/8/PP1QNPPP/2R2RK1 b - - 3 14,"Well, let's start by jumping on that c file I've had on my mind."
28,Nxe5,c6e5,r1n2rk1/1p1q1ppp/p3p3/3pn3/N2P4/8/PP1QNPPP/2R2RK1 w - - 0 15,"?? Perhaps black saw something more deadly hitting him sooner than I expected, so he lashes out. I know my knight on a4 is hanging, but no need to panic. His knight will still be there in a minute. Let's throw the jab at his queen and get her distracted."
29,Nc5,a4c5,r1n2rk1/1p1q1ppp/p3p3/2Npn3/3P4/8/PP1QNPPP/2R2RK1 b - - 1 15,! White now starts taking back the initiative.
30,Nf3+,e5f3,r1n2rk1/1p1q1ppp/p3p3/2Np4/3P4/5n2/PP1QNPPP/2R2RK1 w - - 2 16,"?! Interesting move. The more I think about it, the more I appreciate it. So far, this game hasn't been strictly about maintaining material equality. It has been equally stubborn surges of initiative. Since his knight had already compromised its own integrity by that last ""unsound"" capture, remy decides to let him live fast and leave a good looking corpse:) This royal fork must be dealt with immediately, and the resulting position will severely hurt my pawn chain that I have so carefully nurtured. My kudos to you remy! This really was a strong move. Not content to just play Nc6 and slowly build on a  1 advantage, you send the message that you are still in control. I like that!"
