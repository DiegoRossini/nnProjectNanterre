2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Sicilian is my best defense against e4. The many losses I endured with this defense never urged me to re consider my choice.

Of course here stops my knowledge of the Sicilian, I would never allow myself to learn more : it is time to take personal action depending on opponent moves."

Enough for the many losses where all of my pieces are exchanged then unexpectedly find myself into a hard-to-figure-out inferior ending-game !
So I was considering Nd7 before I discovered that NxN leads to a double attack on White (mate on g2 and attack on c3). So I selected Nc6, of course c6 is much natural than d7."
