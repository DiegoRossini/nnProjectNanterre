1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"A solid way for white to proceed. In this opening, white is advised not to move the c pawn. This is very counterintuitive (c4 looks soooo tempting!), but in fact it just helps black in developement, with accurate play (and at club levels). White has Bb5+ as his more aggressive try, and I fear it a little. f6 would be my response."

6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3P4/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"My still-not-completely-sure-why-it-is-not-defendable favourit. Here, the answer I kind of fear most is Bb5+. If any minor piece interposes, dxe6 is a proper ""dark hole"". So c6 must be the answer, and... it's another story. I test my opponents here: if they don't play Bb5+, they either don't know the opening, or they are going for slow, routine, passive play. I will catch those... ;-)"
7,dxe6,d5e6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4Pn2/8/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"The ""automatic"" move black is just waiting for, ignoring the B check."
8,Bxe6,c8e6,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4bn2/8/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,Standard position.
9,Be2,f1e2,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4bn2/8/8/2N5/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 5,"Very passive, but not necessarily bad move. Here, black can go for the ""hard"" line Qe7, threatening Bc4 or Bg4 playing with the pin on the lsb. But white can get out of it if careful."
10,c6,c7c6,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1bn2/8/8/2N5/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,"This is a more positional approach. It 1) restricts the b5 threat, 2) opens the way for the BQ to b6 or c7 - her's optimal square. Bc5 instead allows d4 with tempo, but I think it's playable (my B will go to b4, exchange the N, and then, with Ne4 attacking c3 I'll have won some games. The key of my attack is to align Bd6 and Qc7 on white's castled K. But I can wait for the white's d pawn to be moved to play Bd6, and in the meantime I try to get the most of my tempoes. I also know that Ng5 or Bg5 will become an annoyance I have to be aware all the time. And I know I'll castle queenside and that I will launch a pawn's storm on g. This is what I'll say if I'll see this position, because I play it a lot. Of course, it must have some problem, somewhere. I just wonder how high the rate must be in order to meet it."
11,Nf3,g1f3,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1bn2/8/8/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"Normal, and I can't prevent it."
12,Nbd7,b8d7,r2qkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1bn2/8/8/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 7,"I'm not trying to stop d4. I assume it will be played. Then I'll decide where to play the dsb, not before."
13,O-O,e1g1,r2qkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1bn2/8/8/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 3 7,"Perfect. Going for castling wihtout thinking in the downsides. Ok I don't say white has any kind of disadvantage or weakness. But he is playing my game. My Qside must be attacked, or I'll buid up my dev undisturbed."
14,h6,h7h6,r2qkb1r/pp1n1pp1/2p1bn1p/8/8/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,"This is necessary. You can delay it, but if you do, white will play Ng5 and threat NxBe6, forcing me to react to it. And I have no good way to do it. If Nf5 white has a strong attack after Re1 or Bh5."
15,d4,d2d4,r2qkb1r/pp1n1pp1/2p1bn1p/8/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,"Following the plan, white finally plays his only throwable weapon. But d5 is mine until the N is still on c3."
16,Bd6,f8d6,r2qk2r/pp1n1pp1/2pbbn1p/8/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 1 9,"As planned, I grab the diagonal and I prevent white's lsb to go f4. I've also played it and I survived, but I think this is the right move to do here for black."
17,Be3,c1e3,r2qk2r/pp1n1pp1/2pbbn1p/8/3P4/2N1BN2/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 2 9,"With this move white gives up any possibility to take advantage of the e coulmn for a long time, and he leaves to me what I prevented from him with h6: Ng4. Of course, it will leave d5 exposed."
18,Qc7,d8c7,r3k2r/ppqn1pp1/2pbbn1p/8/3P4/2N1BN2/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 3 10,"Battery charged. Still inactive, but..."
19,h3,h2h3,r3k2r/ppqn1pp1/2pbbn1p/8/3P4/2N1BN1P/PPP1BPP1/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 10,"White plays the simmetric defence, without realizing that his K is behind it, and this makes a strong difference."
20,g5,g7g5,r3k2r/ppqn1p2/2pbbn1p/6p1/3P4/2N1BN1P/PPP1BPP1/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 11,"Not a great plan: g4, and I assure a g open column, while ready to castle Q side and bring another R into the battlefield. Normal was to castle Qside first. But this just screams white your intentions, and give him a tempo more to organize his game. This leaves less time to him. My K is near to be exposed, but not for some moves. I'll use these."
21,a4,a2a4,r3k2r/ppqn1p2/2pbbn1p/6p1/P2P4/2N1BN1P/1PP1BPP1/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 11,"This is anoher typical mistake. White's counterattack is too slow. White thinks he can defend the Kside, and go for a slow counterattack. He waits me to move the Nf6 elsewhere in order to play d5. Seen this way, his ""dull"" attack on a can be a treat: come and fall for it, you'll be greeted with a winner."
22,g4,g5g4,r3k2r/ppqn1p2/2pbbn1p/8/P2P2p1/2N1BN1P/1PP1BPP1/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 12,Who's right? What do you think?
23,hxg4,h3g4,r3k2r/ppqn1p2/2pbbn1p/8/P2P2P1/2N1BN2/1PP1BPP1/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 12,"Now I have to be aware that as I retake, he'll stike on the center with d5. And that he thinks that this will crush my queenside. Is he right?"
24,Nxg4,f6g4,r3k2r/ppqn1p2/2pbb2p/8/P2P2n1/2N1BN2/1PP1BPP1/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 13,"The threat is Nxd6, more than Bh2+, Kh1, and I have no way to follow with the attack in less than two moves. I have to be very careful here."
