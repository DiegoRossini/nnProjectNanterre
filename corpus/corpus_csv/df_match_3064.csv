1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Pretty unusual. It should be bad, but in a way that only great masters can exploit."

5,c3,c2c3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2pp4/8/3P1B2/2P5/PP2PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"As a rule, in my scheme, when black moves the c pawn, I have to move mine, so I can counter Qb6 with Qc2 or Qb3. Period. :-)"
6,Qc7,d8c7,rnb1kbnr/ppq1pppp/2pp4/8/3P1B2/2P5/PP2PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"Strange movement, but it is seeking for an early e5 without fearing the queen's exchange. It makes sense."
7,e4,e2e4,rnb1kbnr/ppq1pppp/2pp4/8/3PPB2/2P5/PP3PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,I overlooked Nf3 in order to contest the center. My mistake.
8,e5,e7e5,rnb1kbnr/ppq2ppp/2pp4/4p3/3PPB2/2P5/PP3PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"this way I thought that the pressure against e5 will compensate the bishop's inactivity. If black goes f6, it opens the way for a future Qh5+, once more conditions are met."

13,Nf3,g1f3,rnb1kbnr/ppq2pp1/2p4p/4p3/4P3/2P2NB1/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 7,Attacking e5 and developing.

18,a5,a7a5,r1b1kb1r/1pqn1pp1/2p2n1p/p3p3/2B1P3/2P2NB1/PP1N1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 10,"Well, the pawn's storm will be the other side."
19,Qb3,d1b3,r1b1kb1r/1pqn1pp1/2p2n1p/p3p3/2B1P3/1QP2NB1/PP1N1PPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 1 10,"I calculated that if a4 was played, Bxf7+, Kd8, Qe6, but I was unsure about Nb6, then, attacking the queen. The escape is Qxe5, so it's all ok. But I overlooked the simple..."
