1,Na3,b1a3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/N7/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 1,"Here is my first game played against Kerry Shirts using the so called Sodium Attack -- or Durkin Attack.  This is the opening move -- Knight to a3.  I've looked up this opening move on Chess.com, and most everybody hates it.  They say things that it was a stupid move.  Or it's hilarious.  However, it's not an attack so much as it is a feint. A Feint is defined as: ""a movement made in order to deceive an adversary; an attack aimed at one place or point merely as a distraction from the real place or point of attack.""  Na3 is a feint on your opponent.  It's designed to lull your opponent into a false sense of security.  My opponent moved his king pawn to e5 following my feint."
