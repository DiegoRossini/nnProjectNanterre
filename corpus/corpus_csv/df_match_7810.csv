1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,Here is an interesting miniature just completed.  It turns out to be a Closed Catalan where black fianchettos the dark-squared bishop.  Without further ado...
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 2,"My standard response to the symmetrical knight development.  Black's flexibility with his first move allows for a light-square strategy along the lines of the Catalan/QGD, a symmetrical English, Queen's Indian or Kings Indian."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,"My standard response to the symmetrical knight development.  Black's flexibility with his first move allows for a light-square strategy along the lines of the Catalan/QGD, a symmetrical English, Queen's Indian or Kings Indian."
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,Black opts for the light-squared strategy.  An ambitious counter which prepares to directly challenge White in the center with ...d5 or ...c5.
5,g3,g2g3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2P5/5NP1/PP1PPP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"I tend towards the light-squard fianchetto in these positions, however, d4 and Nc3 are just as good."
6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2P5/5NP1/PP1PPP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,The immediate strike in the center which characterizes the Catalan or Open Reti.
7,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2P5/5NP1/PP1PPPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"4. d4 is objectively stronger, however, my preparation in the lines involving 4...dc; 5. Qc2 is pretty deep and so I dont mind going into those variations."
8,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2p1p/4pnp1/3p4/2P5/5NP1/PP1PPPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"An interesting idea, but one which I believe wastes a tempo putting the bishop on the long diagonal, when it has a perfectly good diagonal on the a3-f8 line."
9,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/ppp2p1p/4pnp1/3p4/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,I decide to fix the d-pawn and develop.
10,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppp2pbp/4pnp1/3p4/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 6,Following the plan and maintaining parity in development.
11,O-O,e1g1,rnbqk2r/ppp2pbp/4pnp1/3p4/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 2 6,Setting up the standard pawn formation for the closed Catalan.
12,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/4pnp1/3p4/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 3 7,Setting up the standard pawn formation for the closed Catalan.
13,Nc3,b1c3,rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/4pnp1/3p4/2PP4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 4 7,Setting up the standard pawn formation for the closed Catalan.

15,b3,b2b3,rnbq1rk1/pp3pbp/2p1pnp1/3p4/2PP4/1PN2NP1/P3PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 8,"Here Bd2, and Re1 occurred to me, I decided to protect the pawn this way and maybe fianchetto my own dark-squared bishop."
16,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bq1rk1/pp1n1pbp/2p1pnp1/3p4/2PP4/1PN2NP1/P3PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 9,Taking up residence on the diagonal which now cannot be easily countered.  I believe that this is the major drawback of the fianchetto strategy for black.  The central dark squares are now firmly under white's control.
