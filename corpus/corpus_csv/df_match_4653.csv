1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"My 1st annotated game. More to learn how to do it and begin analyzing some games after the fact. This game is the game I broke 1450 with so it has some sentimental value to me. 

I am black and white opens with e4."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I have been trying to play the Caro-Kann to just do something different, but lately back to e5 response. Also hate dealing with the f7 square valurabilities with this response."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Nothing strange going on yet. Had tried answering kf3 with d6 for a while but back to kc6 and am indifferent to the doubled pawn issue that can arise if he moves his bishop down. Used to hate that, now do not see it as a big, insoluable problem anymore."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"Nothing strange going on yet. Had tried answering kf3 with d6 for a while but back to kc6 and am indifferent to the doubled pawn issue that can arise if he moves his bishop down. Used to hate that, now do not see it as a big, insoluable problem anymore."
5,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,Bishop slips down.
6,Qf6,d8f6,r1b1kbnr/pppp1ppp/2n2q2/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,"Now I understand this to be a not too recommended play, but I find at the level I am playing at some of these suggestions do not apply as strictly. People are not playing long lines of traditional moves and tend to play it all more by ear after a few moves. This has been working for me as an alternative to a6 and then a possible doubled pawn scenario."
7,Nc3,b1c3,r1b1kbnr/pppp1ppp/2n2q2/1B2p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 5 4,I do not like a bishop to roost with his sites on my king. Do a6.
8,a6,a7a6,r1b1kbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n2q2/1B2p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,I do not like a bishop to roost with his sites on my king. Do a6.
9,Nd5,c3d5,r1b1kbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n2q2/1B1Np3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,"Knew this could happen from previous games and did not panic. But, I am not really in a good position."
10,Qd6,f6d6,r1b1kbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1nq4/1B1Np3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 6,Basically I am not going to leave my knight unguarded. If he takes him with his bishop I want to level things out fast with my queen then be able to pull out.
11,Ba4,b5a4,r1b1kbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1nq4/3Np3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 6,But he doesn't take it!
12,Nf6,g8f6,r1b1kb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1nq1n2/3Np3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 4 7,Not sure if this was the best thing to do -as I usually tend to feel about every move I make- but I am looking at castling now. If he wants to exchange knights no biggie for now.
13,c4,c2c4,r1b1kb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1nq1n2/3Np3/B1P1P3/5N2/PP1P1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,"Ah, now I see. He is one of those guys who is not inclined to exchange so quickly. This can lead to a really cluttered board and loss of attention on my part if I am not careful. I fail to see the forest blah, blah... 

Some players just refuse to trade off and it can take a hell of a lot of games before you begin to feel a little comfortable on a jumbled board. But you do get there."
14,Nxd5,f6d5,r1b1kb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1nq4/3np3/B1P1P3/5N2/PP1P1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"I am not against exchanges at this point. I prefer to try and gain in the material area in exchanges, but sometimes you have to keep things from getting too congested. I tend to dislike clogged boards more as black and try to get out of them. It never really happened this game and things stayed tied up and blocked until the rather ""miraculous"" ending."
15,cxd5,c4d5,r1b1kb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1nq4/3Pp3/B3P3/5N2/PP1P1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,I think maybe  advancing his e4 pawn would have caused me more trouble by preventing my b7 pawn to bolt up later.  Still not very friendly on Black Dragon 5's part.
16,Nd4,c6d4,r1b1kb1r/1ppp1ppp/p2q4/3Pp3/B2nP3/5N2/PP1P1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 9,"I am a sloppy player with knights. I really have no where to escape to to now with him that I would not lose him, but..."
17,Nxd4,f3d4,r1b1kb1r/1ppp1ppp/p2q4/3Pp3/B2NP3/8/PP1P1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 9,he goes for the exchange...
18,exd4,e5d4,r1b1kb1r/1ppp1ppp/p2q4/3P4/B2pP3/8/PP1P1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 10,and I take it but now have an unguarded pawn (is there some fancy chess term for that?) on d4.
19,Qc2,d1c2,r1b1kb1r/1ppp1ppp/p2q4/3P4/B2pP3/8/PPQP1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 1 10,"Not sure if this is good or bad, but it does not look inviting."
20,b5,b7b5,r1b1kb1r/2pp1ppp/p2q4/1p1P4/B2pP3/8/PPQP1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 0 11,"Need to push his pawn around a bit. Can be unsettling to have your pieces pushed into places you don't want them to go. Not a win or lose issue, but frustration can lead to errors."
21,Bb3,a4b3,r1b1kb1r/2pp1ppp/p2q4/1p1P4/3pP3/1B6/PPQP1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 1 11,Go for the fianchetto and castle soon
22,g6,g7g6,r1b1kb1r/2pp1p1p/p2q2p1/1p1P4/3pP3/1B6/PPQP1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 0 12,Go for the fianchetto and castle soon
23,a4,a2a4,r1b1kb1r/2pp1p1p/p2q2p1/1p1P4/P2pP3/1B6/1PQP1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 0 12,"These moves always throw me off. Real aggressive though not necessarily well thought out. Obviously going for either me passing on the exchange or taking it, and then doing a rook exchange."
