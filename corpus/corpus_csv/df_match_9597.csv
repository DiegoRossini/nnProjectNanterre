44th Gameknot Tournament

This game features many different material imbalances, errors, plans, and tactics.
I started with 1.e4.  I just recently switched from the Reti, so the Classical variations are very different compared to what I am used to."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"He responded with the symmetrical 1...e5, turning down the opportunity to play the Sicilian.  This gives me some information as to what type of player he is and how he regards me."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"I continue with 2.Nf3 heading for the Ruy Lopez, as the King's Gambit is too risky.  These seem to me the only reasonable moves in this position as a move like 2.Nc3 in the Vienna, hands the initiative to black and loses the ""advantage"" of white being first to move."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,No Russian game for him.
5,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,The technical beginning of the Ruy Lopez.
6,a6,a7a6,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,"I personally play the Berlin wall, 3...Nf6 in order to push white out of their known lines, and because I think that black is actually comes out better in the queen-less endgame (I have some bias, as I beat my first expert with the Berlin)."
7,Ba4,b5a4,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,I like to test my opponents on their opening lines in correspondence since it is easy to find mistakes...  So I don't go for the simpler exchange variation (4.Bxc6).
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,"He does not take the chance to play the open, so I know I am going to have to use the ""Spanish torture"" and try and positionally squeeze black.  (That does not happen at all...)"
