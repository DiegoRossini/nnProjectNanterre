1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,My opponent had white pieces and he started with d4.
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"After d5, c4 we have queen's gambit."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"After d5, c4 we have queen's gambit."
4,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"I decided to play something less common - e5, we now have queen's gambit declined, albin counter gambit, a very aggressive reply. Frankly speaking, this gambit is pretty risky for black, if white knows the right continuation, he could neutralize all the threats and have a very good game."
5,dxe5,d4e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pP3/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,Challenge accepted! dxe5 was played.
6,d4,d5d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/2Pp4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"d4, black's d pawn advances further into white's territory, it takes away the natural developing square from white's queen knight, it can be very troublesome for white."
7,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/2Pp4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"e3 appears to be a very sensible move, challenging black's strong d pawn. However, this move is a mistake, the best move would be Nf3, putting pressure on black's d pawn."
8,Bb4+,f8b4,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/1bPp4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"Bb4+, Black now goes for the Lasker's trap line, only because white played e3 last move."
9,Bd2,c1d2,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/1bPp4/4P3/PP1B1PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 2 5,"Bd2, again, it looks sensible, blocking the check and with the intention to trade off dark square bishops."

11,fxe3,f2e3,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/1bP5/4P3/PP1B2PP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,"After some calculation, my opponent decided not to capture my bishop and barely managed to side step the Lasker's trap."
