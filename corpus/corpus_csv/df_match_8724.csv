So from here, I'm just winging it. White bumped his queen up to d2, let's make her move twice and commit herself to the center where I can pick on her a little."

White's knight threatens the fork on c7, supported by his bishop. But he also blocks his queen's pin on the black knight at c6. I wanted to play 6. e5 instead of 6. e6, but with the knight pinned, e5 wasn't available. Now it is."
