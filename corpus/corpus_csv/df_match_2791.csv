1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I normally play the Benko gambit however I've previously employed it a couple of times against this opponent and he seems to do well against my normal sort of set ups so I thought I would do well to deviate. After having someone play this very gambit against me I immediately decided I liked the look of it and knew I would have to give it a shot some time. Its called the Blumenfeld gambit.

9,dxe6,d5e6,rnbqkb1r/p2p1ppp/4Pn2/1Pp5/8/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"Of course ...dxe6 would make no sense, Now however it is true that blacks light squares have been weakened slightly, but taking advantage of that wont be easy for white. Plus black will be able to make use of the f file in the future plus with a pawn advantage in the centre and by following up with ...b5 black will end up having alot of open lines and long temr activity which promises black a good game"

13,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/3p2pp/p3pn2/1Pp5/8/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"I personally dont think this is the best way for white to really handle the position. In my opinion white would much rather get in e2-e4 and ideally that should be played in a single move, this move also does nothing to stake any hold in the centre and it blocks in whites DSB. instead moves like 7.b6 7.bxa6 come to mind one other alternative that seems quite interesting is 7.Nc3!? with the idea of ...axb5 8.a4!?"
14,Qb6,d8b6,rnb1kb1r/3p2pp/pq2pn2/1Pp5/8/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,threatening to win back the pawn which would bring back material equality in which case black would just have a positionally Superior game
15,Be2,f1e2,rnb1kb1r/3p2pp/pq2pn2/1Pp5/8/4PN2/PP2BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 8,"? seems too passive, now black wins back the pawn which just leaves black supieror positionally. white should have tried either 8.bxa6 or 8.Nc3 and another thought that never occured to me but seems intriging is 8.a4!? intending to recapture with the bishop if black were to play 8...axb5"
16,axb5,a6b5,rnb1kb1r/3p2pp/1q2pn2/1pp5/8/4PN2/PP2BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,Black is better here because I know have the a file to make use of as well which already has the rook on it which got active for free also I have a more space and a better central structure black will have more activity and mobility and white already seems like they might end up a little passive
17,O-O,e1g1,rnb1kb1r/3p2pp/1q2pn2/1pp5/8/4PN2/PP2BPPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 9,"?! usually when a knight develops via a3 or h3 its intention is to carry on to c4 or f4 or else it is maneuvering to c2 or f2, usually in order to help facilitate some sort of pawn break. In this case black controls the c4 square so the knight is simply out of play on a3 and doesn't do anything with regards to the centre. redeploying to c2 doesn't accomplish anything since since a later b4 can easily be met with c4. With that in mind this knight move doesn't make any sense, perhaps white was hoping I'd play ...b4 when the knight could make use of the c4 square, but that's hope chess and making moves with the idea being to hope your opponent will voluntarily make a weakness is a bad way to play chess"
