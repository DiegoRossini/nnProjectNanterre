1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Allow me to give some background information for those that aren't in the team and as a result don't know how these teaching games usually work. The first 2 moves were already decided before the game started since it presumably shows the strengths and weaknesses of a player rather well. However I highly doubted that this was going to end well for me. I, who usually prides himself on having a high theoretical knowledge about openings, have 0 knowledge when it comes to 1.e4 e5. and thus if peta forces a theoretical variation of something, I'd probably lose. Or if he plays some dubious line that doesn't work given that white plays exactly 3 or 4 correct moves then I already know I won't find those 3/4 moves and lose as a result. You can say in a way that he went easy on me. The last time I played 1. e4 in a serious match was about 7 years ago when I was 12. I think that says enough about my inexperience with the opening. I tried different things back then and after my first win with 1.d4 I never bothered to play anything else. It'll be an unfamiliar, but interesting experience to say the least."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Of the many openings i could have chosen for I chose the Italian opening. The reason is simple. Every other opening I know of has too much theory behind it. For example: In the Ruy Lopez there's sidelines of sidelines of sidelines. Some superGM's probably even analysed this opening all the way up to move 30. Getting caught up in such an opening when I have no knowledge about it isn't advisable. The Italian does have some tricks behind it in terms of d4 pushes and Ng5 moves, but for the most part it's supposedly pretty straightforward."

6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,"Immediately putting on the pressure. White has ideas here of Ng5, but that's where the theoretical part starts. I think that would mean we'd be playing the fried liver attack, an opening which I'm not too fond of. I didn't bother to read too much about it, but I imagine it'd be met with 4. Ng5 d5 5. exd5 Nxd5 6. Nc3 h6. or something of the sorts. An alternate solution and what I believe is the main variation is 4. Ng5 d5 5. exd5 Na5 which is just asking for trouble. That opening is so completely different from how I usually play, I didn't dare go into it. I think in some theoretical lines black could even allow Nxf7 giving up the rook since white wastes a lot of time capturing."

Usually I either develop it to d2 or g5 in a queens gambit, but since we're playing something different here... Looking back at it, I should have developed to e3, much like what Bigpeta will play in the near future."

I guess something along the lines of developing -> castling -> play d4 or f4 as breaking moves somewhere in the future."
11,h3,h2h3,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/2NP1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"Preventing the knight/light squared bishop to come to g4 and pin the knight on f3. I considered Bg5, but after 6. Bg5 h6 7. Bh4 g5 it feels a little cramped for white, black can still perfectly fine castle queen side if he wants to so he can play g5 in my opinion. Still pondering where my dark squared bishop is going to end up."

Well at most it's a slight error, not something game losing. It creates a double pawn, but I don't think it's really a troubling pawn for black. It'll make ideas of d5 a lot easier in the future to break open the position. Black will probably castle king side next to use the open file. According to Bigpeta Bb3 was the heavy favorite according to gameknot databases. I looked at these databases before opting for Bxe6, but found that while Bb3 wins 3% more games, i consider 3% not relevant enough to take Bxe6 out of consideration. The problem with Bb3 is that the threat doesn't disappear, in the end an exchange will take place as I find it pretty inevitable. I also don't have much experience with bishops on this particular square which also influenced my decision."

If i had to take a guess, maybe these type of positions are more suited to his preferences or he intended to keep the position pretty symmetrical to further test me."

Qe7 was played with the idea of maybe playing either d5 and create a diagonal for the queen to attack on. Most likely this'll be done after I castle. Castling king side doesn't really look very safe anymore so that's no longer a candidate move for the time being. Maybe it's time to fix the double pawn with the likes of d4, but black isn't obligated to take it and probably won't. It's something I should keep in mind for the future though. I don't dislike the plan of Qe2 with the same idea that I figure black is following."

O-O although interesting, since it gives the possibility of a queen side pawn storm, felt like putting my king into too much danger. A move like Nh5, targeting the g3 square, was something I was very concerned about. O-O-O is very similar, but grants more king safety at the cost of less attacking possibilities. That being said, I calculate the following sequence. 11. O-O-O d5 12.exd5 exd5 13. Rad1 Rhf8. In that variation the only big difference is that black has more space and thus more likely will be the aggressor. Something I'd rather not allow. Therefore I played d4 with which I try to gain space before black has the opportunity to do so. Black has a variety of ways to deal with this issue. I calculated 11. d4 Rhf8 12. O-O-O d5. Another possibility on move 12 is exd4, but it leaves black slightly more cramped. d5 is a response in which white has to capture rather carefully. Capturing in a wrong move order might leave him a pawn down."

23,exd5,e4d5,2kr3r/ppp1q1pp/2n1pn2/3Pp3/3P4/2N1PN1P/PPP1Q1P1/R3K2R b KQ - 0 12,"I made this move since dxe5 becomes troublesome if black plays 1/2 exact variations, which I'm sure my opponent would find. If dxe5 then follows Nxe4 Nxe4 dxe4 and the isolated e-pawns are too difficult to defend. exd might cause me to get an isolated e-pawn, but I'm pretty sure it's not that easy for black to take advantage of. I can probably find the time to castle somewhere along the way."
