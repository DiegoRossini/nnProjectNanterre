10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR w KQ - 1 6,I always find Nbd7 a difficult move to counter as my dark squared Bishop is now essentially without many good squares and taking the Knight seems wrong.

13,Ne5,f3e5,r1bq1rk1/pppnbppp/4pn2/3pN1B1/2PP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 4 7,I try an aggressive approach
14,Ne4,f6e4,r1bq1rk1/pppnbppp/4p3/3pN1B1/2PPn3/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 5 8,My opponent responds in kind.
15,Bxe7,g5e7,r1bq1rk1/pppnBppp/4p3/3pN3/2PPn3/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 8,8. Nxe4 Bxg5 9. Nxg5 Qxg5 10. Nxd7 Bxd7 is also possible and judging by the game continuation probably better
16,Qxe7,d8e7,r1b2rk1/pppnqppp/4p3/3pN3/2PPn3/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 9,This not much of a threat although and with Black's Queen having open space on my Kingside the eventual castle that I make is probably not such a good idea in any case. I might have been better served with something like 9. Nxe5 dxe5 10. c5
17,Bd3,f1d3,r1b2rk1/pppnqppp/4p3/3pN3/2PPn3/2NBP3/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 1 9,This not much of a threat although and with Black's Queen having open space on my Kingside the eventual castle that I make is probably not such a good idea in any case. I might have been better served with something like 9. Nxe5 dxe5 10. c5
18,Ndf6,d7f6,r1b2rk1/ppp1qppp/4pn2/3pN3/2PPn3/2NBP3/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 2 10,Nicely protecting the Knight in that excellent forward position
19,O-O,e1g1,r1b2rk1/ppp1qppp/4pn2/3pN3/2PPn3/2NBP3/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 3 10,I think this is a mistake with both Knights on that side of the board and the potential for the Queen to come in at a moments notice
20,Qb4,e7b4,r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3pN3/1qPPn3/2NBP3/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 4 11,Forces my Bishop back and gains a pawn. I think this is better than 11. ... Nxe4 12. b3 even though Black ends up with doubled pawns. The forward e-pawn is not bad at all
21,Nxe4,c3e4,r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3pN3/1qPPN3/3BP3/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 11,Forces my Bishop back and gains a pawn. I think this is better than 11. ... Nxe4 12. b3 even though Black ends up with doubled pawns. The forward e-pawn is not bad at all
22,dxe4,d5e4,r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/4pn2/4N3/1qPPp3/3BP3/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 12,Forces my Bishop back and gains a pawn. I think this is better than 11. ... Nxe4 12. b3 even though Black ends up with doubled pawns. The forward e-pawn is not bad at all
23,Be2,d3e2,r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/4pn2/4N3/1qPPp3/4P3/PP2BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 12,I'm hoping to clean up that forward e-pawn and open the f-file for my Rook
24,Qxb2,b4b2,r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/4pn2/4N3/2PPp3/4P3/Pq2BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 13,I'm hoping to clean up that forward e-pawn and open the f-file for my Rook
25,f3,f2f3,r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/4pn2/4N3/2PPp3/4PP2/Pq2B1PP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 13,I'm hoping to clean up that forward e-pawn and open the f-file for my Rook
26,c5,c7c5,r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/2p1N3/2PPp3/4PP2/Pq2B1PP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 14,My opponent does not oblige
27,fxe4,f3e4,r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/2p1N3/2PPP3/4P3/Pq2B1PP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 14,"I think this is also a mistake. It undoubles the pawns, allows Black's Knight into a strong square although does give me the f-file for my Rook. Better perhaps is 14. Re1 protecting my Bishop and allowing my Queen to get into the game."
28,Nxe4,f6e4,r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/4p3/2p1N3/2PPn3/4P3/Pq2B1PP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 15,Easily refuting my attack.
29,Bh5,e2h5,r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/4p3/2p1N2B/2PPn3/4P3/Pq4PP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 15,Easily refuting my attack.
30,g6,g7g6,r1b2rk1/pp3p1p/4p1p1/2p1N2B/2PPn3/4P3/Pq4PP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 16,Easily refuting my attack.
31,a4,a2a4,r1b2rk1/pp3p1p/4p1p1/2p1N2B/P1PPn3/4P3/1q4PP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 16,Retreating the Bishop is perhaps a better move but I wanted to make an active game and perhaps even get a mating attack with something like: 16. ... gxh5 17. Qxh5 Kh8 18. Nxf7+ Kg8 19. Qg4+ Ng5 20. Qxg5# although none of that is forced
32,Qd2,b2d2,r1b2rk1/pp3p1p/4p1p1/2p1N2B/P1PPn3/4P3/3q2PP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 1 17,My opponent looks to trade Queens and pick up the Bishop
33,Qf3,d1f3,r1b2rk1/pp3p1p/4p1p1/2p1N2B/P1PPn3/4PQ2/3q2PP/R4RK1 b - - 2 17,Naturally I cannot allow that to happen
34,f5,f7f5,r1b2rk1/pp5p/4p1p1/2p1Np1B/P1PPn3/4PQ2/3q2PP/R4RK1 w - - 0 18,This removes the potential attack on the f7 pawn
35,Bxg6,h5g6,r1b2rk1/pp5p/4p1B1/2p1Np2/P1PPn3/4PQ2/3q2PP/R4RK1 b - - 0 18,Now my Bishop is trapped and I have to make the most of a bad situation
36,Nf6,e4f6,r1b2rk1/pp5p/4pnB1/2p1Np2/P1PP4/4PQ2/3q2PP/R4RK1 w - - 1 19,Immediately capturing the Bishop leads to a bit of a King chase with 18. ... hxg6 19. Nxg6 Rd8 20. Qh5 b6 21. Qh8+ etc or something of the like
37,Bh5,g6h5,r1b2rk1/pp5p/4pn2/2p1Np1B/P1PP4/4PQ2/3q2PP/R4RK1 b - - 2 19,18. ... Nf6 covers the h5 square and prevents my Queen from coming in on the attack after hxg6 so I have to retreat my Bishop which leads to the loss of several pawns.
