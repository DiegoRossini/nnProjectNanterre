14,dxe5,d6e5,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/1N2p3/1n2P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"Now white is a pawn up and black doesn't seem to have any compensation for it. Note, 8. Qxd8 doesn't work as well for white, for after 8. ... Rxd8 white cannot take the pawn on e5 due to 9. ... Nxc2 . I didn't analyze it too far, but black may be in worse shape if he tries 8. ... Kxd8 because after he plays for his fork on c2, white has a similar fork on f7. I didn't expect black would play this line, which I decided that 8. Qxd8 Rxd8 would be weak for white and avoided it."

16,Qf6,d8f6,r3kbnr/ppp2ppp/5q2/1N2N3/1n2P3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 9,"??? Apparently black was unwilling to trade queens, but I don't think he had anything better. His pawn at c7 was threatened, and his queen was on guard duty protecting it. She had to stand her ground, or maybe move to c8 or e7 if she really wanted to avoid being exchanged. As played, black couldn't have chosen a worse move on the board - this one earns the full three ? treatment."
