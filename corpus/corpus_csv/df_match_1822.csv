12,a5,a7a5,rnb1k1nr/1ppp2pp/5q2/p3pp2/1b2P3/1P1P1PP1/P1PB3P/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,"Rather than swapping Bishops, black decides to just maintain the pressure and protect the Bishop.  Notice that if white decides to swap Bishops then the Black pawn structure will be a little messed up.  Black takes this chance as an acceptable risk.  If it does happen, the Black Rook opens up his file which is not a bad thing."

19,dxe4,d3e4,r1b1k1nr/1ppp2pp/2n2q2/p1b1p3/2P1P3/1P3PPB/P2B3P/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 0 10,White swaps pawns as expected.
20,d6,d7d6,r1b1k1nr/1pp3pp/2np1q2/p1b1p3/2P1P3/1P3PPB/P2B3P/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 0 11,Black opens a path so that we now have Bishop against Bishop.  Some may say this is a bad idea for black because a bishop swap will eliminate any chance for a queen side castling.
