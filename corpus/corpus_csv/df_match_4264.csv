1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Gambits can make for some exicting chess and this game is a good example of that. However, the trouble with gambits is that they are generally wrong and will lead to death. The keys to refuting a gambit lay in accepting it once but not twice. This means if your opponent offers a freebie once take it but refuse it the second freebie. Otherwise you can be caught being to greedly. The other key of refuting a gamibt is to play principled chess that follows the rules. I.E develop your pieces, control the centre and ensure your king's safety. Finally, if your opponent offers you a freebie take it and dare them to prove that going behind in material for nothing is worth it."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"?? you should only gambit a piece if you have a clear bullet proof checkmate. This is not the case here since after 4. ...Nxe4 all black has to do is ride the wave and come out with a clear material advantage. A better strategy is to complete your development and solidify your center before attacking. If you want a good alternative to this move then 4. d4 dxd4 5. Nxd4 is slightly better for white. 

What are good gambits and bad gambits? Good gambits are essentially a trade off between material balance and one other tangible advantage such as rapid development and open lines to the king, If none of these conditions exicts as it did doesn't in this case then it is bad."

10,Ng6,e5g6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5nn1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,With a material advantage of +2 pawns all black has to do is exchange pieces and go straight into a easily won endgame.
11,e5,e4e5,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5nn1/4P3/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,?? one of the main idea's behind much black's play in many opennings is to provoke white into playing an early ...e5 such as this. The reasoning is that after the dust settles white's center is over extended and can be easily attacked.
12,Ng8,f6g8,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/6n1/4P3/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,for the two pawns white has a temporary grip for central dominance and more harmonious piece play. Black can not allow white to solidify this advantage so he must attack white's center while it is still weak. Blacks next move should either be ...d6! or ...f6!?
13,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/6n1/4P3/2BP4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 7,"?? this bad for black because it gives back material with no compensation. Better is 7. ...d6 attacking the white center clearing the road for the bishop pair. Question if black plays 7. ...d6 how should white proceed? **TIP defeating a gambit often requires simple restraint. Therefore, avoid aggressive play and take a more cautious approach.**"

15,Bxd5,c4d5,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/6n1/3BP3/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,good move grabbing the free pawn
16,Ng8e7,g8e7,r1bqkb1r/ppp1nppp/6n1/3BP3/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 9,This position is actually improving for white because his center pawns are not a vulnerable to attack and bishop and knight dominate the center. This is why 7. ...d5 was such a bad idea because it completely abandons the center to white. **TIP if your opponent played aggressively in the center attack the pawns at their base.**
17,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqkb1r/ppp1nppp/6n1/3BP1B1/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 2 9,"a good idea to defend  bishop with a pin. However, the pin is easily broken with 9. ...h6 when white is forced to capture on e7. Which is not a good trade for white because bishop is worth more than the knight  when there are open lines. The alternative way to defend the bishop is to play 9. Bb3. Question if white plays 9. Bb3 how should black proceed."
18,h6,h7h6,r1bqkb1r/ppp1npp1/6np/3BP1B1/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 10,I think that ...Nxe7 is better since it deals with the problem of a wayward knight and put immediate pressure on the white bishop

20,Bxe7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/ppp1bpp1/6np/3BP3/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 11,I think that ...Nxe7 is better since it deals with the problem of a wayward knight and put immediate pressure on the white bishop
21,Qf3,d1f3,r1bqk2r/ppp1bpp1/6np/3BP3/3P4/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 1 11,"interesting idea which threatens mate on f7. As it currently stands white has two serious problems. #1 his LSB is vulnerable to attack via ...c6 and #2 white's centre is shaky since the linch pin d4 is unprotected. However, 11. ...0-0 helps black by encouraging him to do what he wanted to anyway which is to castle. These positions are very difficult to play because white has to play assertively due to the material imbalance and extremely overextended center. Therefore, white can easily run into the risk of overplaying and collapsing like a deck of cards. I would caution against facilitating your enemies plans while ingoring your weaknesses. There are several ways that you can prevent your opponent from doing what they want but one of the best ways is distractions. An example of this is that white can force black into making a long term weakness with 11. e6 Bxe6 12. Bxe6 fxe6 13. Qh5! Kf7 and the black king is is still in the centre. ***Tip: remmber the old saying, ""Good defence win championships."""
22,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/ppp1bpp1/6np/3BP3/3P4/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 2 12,defending the f7 pawn
23,O-O-O,e1c1,r1bq1rk1/ppp1bpp1/6np/3BP3/3P4/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b - - 3 12,"?? castling your king to an uncontrolled diagonal is never a good idea. However, here it is necessary because 11. Qf3 has left d4 undefended anything else is refuted with ...c6 winning the d-pawn."
24,Bb4,e7b4,r1bq1rk1/ppp2pp1/6np/3BP3/1b1P4/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/2KR3R w - - 4 13,black is right to attack the knight because white can not allow holes to appear in front of his king. the threat is Bxn.
25,Bxb7,d5b7,r1bq1rk1/pBp2pp1/6np/4P3/1b1P4/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b - - 0 13,"It looks as though b7 is a free catch but you would be wrong. The real problem for white is his weakness on the dark squares. If you look at the positions of the kings you may notice that white is actually more open. Matter of fact, he is sitting on the c1-h6 diagonal which is controled by black. Not only that 13. Bxb7 opens up another line to the king via the b file. the rule is to keep all roads to your king closed. But the question is how does white do that? The answer is 13. Ne4 which deals with the threat of Bxn and covers the g5 square from back door checks. It is difficult to resist the attack at all costs plan since it is often flashy and fun. However, the ""guns ablaze"" strategy can only work in overwelming odds situations and since chess starts out with both players being equal then ""guns blazing"" rarely works. It takes experience to understand when it is time to let go of the chances for winning and embrace a draw as an acceptable result."
26,Bxb7,c8b7,r2q1rk1/pbp2pp1/6np/4P3/1b1P4/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/2KR3R w - - 0 14,White has regained material equality but his king is feeling the draft.

29,Kb1,c1b1,r4rk1/pQp2pp1/6np/4P1q1/1b1P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/1K1R3R b - - 2 15,In order to succeed in his attack black has to achieve the following 1. open lines to the king and 2. have piece superiority in the area of the king
30,Bxc3,b4c3,r4rk1/pQp2pp1/6np/4P1q1/3P4/2b5/PPP2PPP/1K1R3R w - - 0 16,!! excellent move that acheives the first objective which is open lines to the king. Not only is the king vulnerable but so is the queen on b7. After bxf3 then Rfb8 wins the queen.
31,Qf3,b7f3,r4rk1/p1p2pp1/6np/4P1q1/3P4/2b2Q2/PPP2PPP/1K1R3R b - - 1 16,The end result of 13. Bxb7 is that white has exchanged a knight for a pawn.
