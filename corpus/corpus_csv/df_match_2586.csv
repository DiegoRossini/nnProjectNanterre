1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Nothing out of the ordinary so far - Black goes for a more hypermodern approach, perhaps looking to counter-attack; all his moves are standard with the d6 push providing a hole for the f6 knight should White advance his pawns. At these early stages White can't yet make anything of the extra space that he's been allowed to have"

10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 4 6,Preventing Bg4 or Ng4; a solid move
11,h3,h2h3,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N1BN1P/PPP2PP1/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 6,Preventing Bg4 or Ng4; a solid move
12,b6,b7b6,rnbq1rk1/p1p1ppbp/1p1p1np1/8/3PP3/2N1BN1P/PPP2PP1/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 7,Unusual; a double fianchetto isn't seen too often but there is logic in that Black doesn't see a future for his light-squared bishop on the c8-h3 diagonal. A bishop on b7 targets e4; a bishop on d7 targets nothing!
13,Bc4,f1c4,rnbq1rk1/p1p1ppbp/1p1p1np1/8/2BPP3/2N1BN1P/PPP2PP1/R2QK2R b KQ - 1 7,Innocent bishop development...or is it?
14,Bb7,c8b7,rn1q1rk1/pbp1ppbp/1p1p1np1/8/2BPP3/2N1BN1P/PPP2PP1/R2QK2R w KQ - 2 8,"?! Black had this planned but failed to realise White's plan! A better move (to prevent White's next) would have been Nfd7 from my point of view, also perhaps in preparation for either c5 or e5 to challenge White's centre."
15,e5,e4e5,rn1q1rk1/pbp1ppbp/1p1p1np1/4P3/2BP4/2N1BN1P/PPP2PP1/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 8,"White thrusts forward, forcing the black knight to move. Thanks to White's 'quiet' move back at move 6 the g4 square is out of the question leaving only two possibilities."
16,Ne8,f6e8,rn1qnrk1/pbp1ppbp/1p1p2p1/4P3/2BP4/2N1BN1P/PPP2PP1/R2QK2R w KQ - 1 9,"Looks ugly, yes, but this is the only place Black's knight can move since Nfd7 is now met..."
17,e6,e5e6,rn1qnrk1/pbp1ppbp/1p1pP1p1/8/2BP4/2N1BN1P/PPP2PP1/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 9,! with this move! Should Black take that pawn the bishop takes up a commanding square but with the threat of exf7+ it can hardly be ignored!
18,f6,f7f6,rn1qnrk1/pbp1p1bp/1p1pPpp1/8/2BP4/2N1BN1P/PPP2PP1/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 10,from Black's point of view a pawn there isn't too much better!
19,d5,d4d5,rn1qnrk1/pbp1p1bp/1p1pPpp1/3P4/2B5/2N1BN1P/PPP2PP1/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 10,Obvious - and now what can Black do? There is a severe cramp in the mobility of his pieces and if he wants anything from this game it has to be addressed!
20,c6,c7c6,rn1qnrk1/pb2p1bp/1pppPpp1/3P4/2B5/2N1BN1P/PPP2PP1/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 11,"Probably the best move for Black, attempting to undermine White's d5 support"
21,h4,h3h4,rn1qnrk1/pb2p1bp/1pppPpp1/3P4/2B4P/2N1BN2/PPP2PP1/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 11,Meanwhile - whilst Black focusses on removing the cramp in his position - White looks to attack the Black king. Once again this move proves to be significant later on though it won't have been something White had forseen
22,b5,b6b5,rn1qnrk1/pb2p1bp/2ppPpp1/1p1P4/2B4P/2N1BN2/PPP2PP1/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 12,?! Black will want to stop that pawn in its tracks (if the h-file is even half-open White will have a great big bulls-eye to target!) but first he lashes out at the bishop - though following White's reply was it the best move? To maintain the defence of d5 the bishop will go to b3 but first...
23,dxc6,d5c6,rn1qnrk1/pb2p1bp/2PpPpp1/1p6/2B4P/2N1BN2/PPP2PP1/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 12,...this little intermediate move! 12...bxc4?? will lose the rook so Black has to recapture
24,Bxc6,b7c6,rn1qnrk1/p3p1bp/2bpPpp1/1p6/2B4P/2N1BN2/PPP2PP1/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 13,It was either this or the knight recapture and either way the b5 pawn can be taken but though Nc6 makes more sense development-wise 13.Bxb5 Bxb5 14.Nxb5 Qa5+ 15.Nc3 h5 and Black has more activity queenside at least as well as the e6 pawn suddenly becoming vulnerable
25,Bb3,c4b3,rn1qnrk1/p3p1bp/2bpPpp1/1p6/7P/1BN1BN2/PPP2PP1/R2QK2R b KQ - 1 13,"White doesn't bite, preferring to hold on to e6."
26,h5,h7h5,rn1qnrk1/p3p1b1/2bpPpp1/1p5p/7P/1BN1BN2/PPP2PP1/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 14,preventing the advance of the h-pawn
27,Qd2,d1d2,rn1qnrk1/p3p1b1/2bpPpp1/1p5p/7P/1BN1BN2/PPPQ1PP1/R3K2R b KQ - 1 14,Of course White's focus is still kingside - a possible Bh6 is on the cards
28,Nc7,e8c7,rn1q1rk1/p1n1p1b1/2bpPpp1/1p5p/7P/1BN1BN2/PPPQ1PP1/R3K2R w KQ - 2 15,Developing and targeting e6 - Black doesn't have too many options but this is probably the best move he can do. Bxf3?! isn't such a good idea considering it half-opens the b-file to his king and his undefended g-pawn
29,Rh3,h1h3,rn1q1rk1/p1n1p1b1/2bpPpp1/1p5p/7P/1BN1BN1R/PPPQ1PP1/R3K3 b Q - 3 15,"Still, White plans to target it anyway with this move not usually seen at Master level"
