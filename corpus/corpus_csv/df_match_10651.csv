This game is played by someone I know from school (oogiegork) and shows that it can be dangerous game if there is a king gambit played, and this shows what can happen even if you don't take the pawn on f4!"
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Like I said, there is a king gambit."
3,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Like I said, there is a king gambit."
4,f6,f7f6,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"I personally think that you should not do this because moving a kingside pawn in a opening is dangerous, even when you can take the pawn on f4 and defend badly on the next few moves. But these players are better than me, so I cannot talk."
5,fxe5,f4e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4P3/4P3/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,Black thinks that white is offering a fair exchange.
6,fxe5,f6e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,And so he takes the pawn on e5
7,Qh5+,d1h5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4p2Q/4P3/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 1 4,"However, this has turned out that it was not a fair exchange after all! For not only he moved a kingside pawn, he also captured a piece, leaving a path where white can check black, making it unable to castle for the rest of the game and take the pawn on e5 next move (fork)."
8,Ke7,e8e7,rnbq1bnr/ppppk1pp/8/4p2Q/4P3/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1KBNR w KQ - 2 5,"And not only white took the pawn on e5, he has got the black king on the run!"
