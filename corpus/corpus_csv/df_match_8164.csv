For a white player who has never faced it, it can be very tricky to understand what is going on. Typically, white will play moves he thinks are sound when they actually deteriorate his position. Caution: This is probably an unsound opening. That is, if white plays great, black finds himself at a disadvantage. However, it is hard for white to know what to do."
