From here it is up to white to choose , but carefully as each variation is unstable with no time to stumble ...  Im not a good enough player yet to understand why there unstable but they are."

7,Bd2,c1d2,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/1b1PP3/2N5/PPPB1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 3 4,The keres gambit 4.Bd2...  Most games i play are due to 4.e5 locking in the pawns but this variation allows black to snaffle some pawns while white gets stuck in on the king side.

18,c5,c7c5,rnb1kbr1/pp3p1p/4pn2/2p5/3qpQ2/2N5/PPPB1PPP/2KR1BNR w q - 0 10,A new move i havent read about or seen before ... although blacks position seems to have a lot of holes the centre is quite active and peices can still develop to the protection of the king.
19,Nb5,c3b5,rnb1kbr1/pp3p1p/4pn2/1Np5/3qpQ2/8/PPPB1PPP/2KR1BNR b q - 1 10,c7 under some pressure and mostly the reason for moving c5.

26,Rxg5,g8g5,r1b1kb2/ppQn1p1p/4p3/2p3r1/3qp3/8/PPP2PPP/2KR1BNR w q - 0 14,Level material and White to play .... Both of us have Developed slowly and have awkward decisions to make.The two pawns look happy togeather in the centre and mostly my reason for this variation.

30,Rc5,g5c5,r1b1kb2/ppQn1p1p/4p3/2r5/P2pp3/8/1PP2PPP/2K2BNR w q - 1 16,The centre is mine .
