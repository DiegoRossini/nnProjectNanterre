1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is my rematch game with Joanne Stevens in the Mason Opening theme tournament.  In my white game, I won in a pawn-up endgame after a fairly long positional struggle in 40-something moves.  Here with black, I won a nice little miniature where the game sharpened early and white got fatally mauled in rather short order."

5,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/3P1B2/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"I wondered fleetingly if Joanne might cheekily employ the same gambit offering I essayed (3. e4!?) in our previous bout, but as she struck me as a more positionally-minded player, figured the chance was slim."
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2pp4/3P1B2/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"Standard moves.  Because the early development of the QB in this system weakens the dark squares at home somewhat, ...Qb6 remains a thematic black move to challenge them (as well in similar opening lines of the d4/c4 complex).  Usually white replies with Qb3 and an early queen-trade ensues.  Not to Nosferatu's taste.  Too vegetarian."

In my first black game in this tournament, I played 5. ...e6, the boilerplate semi-Tarrasch setup to the London recommended in many sources.  Though I eventually won that game, coaxed by errors on my opponent's part, I struggled to concoct the type of counterplay and double-edged positions I usually thrive in."

Nb3 a5 (for instance) 9. a4.  This was a conscious decision on my part, because by snatching the pawn, white would give me counterplay in the center, following a space-gaining ...e5 and increased scope of my KB along the h8-a1 diagonal."

I do give white juicy hole on d6 that I'm sure she'd love to plant a knight on, however, as the old saw goes: ""One must give up squares to gain squares.""  I knew that white would most likely strike back in the center with a corresponding e4 whether I played ...e5 or not so I had to play actively.  I was looking at some sample variations at this point and decided that even if she did get to play Nd6, I have resources and counterplay available, and it wouldn't necessarily be the death of me."

I didn't think I could take time-out to play the limp 12. ...Bd7 to prevent the weakening of my pawns, when after 13. Nc4 white is standing very well.  Again, since I'm already down material, I must continue to play actively to justify the pawn sacrifice and attempt to wrest the intiative in this position.  12. ...O-O breaks the pin, brings my KR into play, and whisks my king to safety.  Yes, safety, on white's same half-open h-file.  It seems paradoxical, but black's king is much safer here than in the center, because white doesn't have the piece coordination to exploit an attack along the h-file."
25,Bxc6,b5c6,r1bq1rk1/pp3pbp/2B3p1/2P5/3pP3/5NP1/PP1N1PP1/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 13,"?! To be honest, I didn't think this was a good practical decision by white.  At least, I personally would have been adverse to it.  I could see white's thinking; up material, continue to hack wood and simplify, splatter black's remaining queenside pawns, mop up the positional trumps and eventually win.  Of course, chess is often not this simple.  By getting rid of her other bishop, black's two bishops become that much more emphatic in a fluid, semi-open position such as this, and I do gain a nice open b-file for my QR to exert pressure upon."
26,bxc6,b7c6,r1bq1rk1/p4pbp/2p3p1/2P5/3pP3/5NP1/PP1N1PP1/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 14,"Whatever ""objective"" analysis of the position may declare, I was quite comfortable at this point, and felt I'd attained the type of position I enjoyed playing."

It seems to consolidate white's extra pawn as a strongpoint on c4, but since I wasn't taking extreme pains to recoup it, 14. Qa4 or 14. O-O must be preferred."

My bishops are very actively posted on long diagonals, exerting influence on many squares.  I wanted to play ...a5 first because the rook-pawn would be much more useful in front of the bishop than behind it, and I figured I could reasonably predict 15. a3, so I could afford the tempo expended."
