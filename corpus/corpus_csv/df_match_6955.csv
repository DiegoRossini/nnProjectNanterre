1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I'm not sure why I played 3. Bg5 so early as here but I guess sometimes I like to try out other move orders as an experiment

6,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/ppppbppp/4pn2/6B1/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,I suspect this is weaker than 3. ... Bb4+ as the pin is not particularly dangerous at this time
7,e3,e2e3,rnbqk2r/ppppbppp/4pn2/6B1/2PP4/4P3/PP3PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,A second move with the Knight forces me to be trade dark square Bishops but I've found that is usually good for White in the QGD.
8,d5,d7d5,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/4P3/PP3PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,A second move with the Knight forces me to be trade dark square Bishops but I've found that is usually good for White in the QGD.

11,Bxe7,g5e7,rnbqk2r/ppp1Bppp/4p3/3p4/2PPn3/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,Now if Black recaptures he has doubled pawns and White a good strong center
12,Qxe7,d8e7,rnb1k2r/ppp1qppp/4p3/3p4/2PPn3/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,Now if Black recaptures he has doubled pawns and White a good strong center

14,O-O,e8g8,rnb2rk1/ppp1qppp/4p3/3p4/2PPN3/4P3/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR w KQ - 1 8,My opponent gets his moves out of sequence here. I'm guessing thinking that the game is currently even rather than being down a piece.
15,Nc3,e4c3,rnb2rk1/ppp1qppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR b KQ - 2 8,Without the dark square Bishop this is an impotent threat easily refuted
16,Qb4,e7b4,rnb2rk1/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/1qPP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR w KQ - 3 9,Without the dark square Bishop this is an impotent threat easily refuted
17,Qb3,d1b3,rnb2rk1/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/1qPP4/1QN1P3/PP3PPP/R3KBNR b KQ - 4 9,Up a piece I'm not hesitant to trade Queens but Black's alternatives were not good. A retreat of the Queen leaves his b-pawn weak and pins the Bishop in place for at least a move or two.
18,Qxb3,b4b3,rnb2rk1/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/1qN1P3/PP3PPP/R3KBNR w KQ - 0 10,Up a piece I'm not hesitant to trade Queens but Black's alternatives were not good. A retreat of the Queen leaves his b-pawn weak and pins the Bishop in place for at least a move or two.
19,axb3,a2b3,rnb2rk1/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/1PN1P3/1P3PPP/R3KBNR b KQ - 0 10,Now Black allows me to get my pawn structure in order in addition to total dominance of the center and a piece to the advantage. I think 10. ... Nc6 is better
20,dxc4,d5c4,rnb2rk1/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/2pP4/1PN1P3/1P3PPP/R3KBNR w KQ - 0 11,Now Black allows me to get my pawn structure in order in addition to total dominance of the center and a piece to the advantage. I think 10. ... Nc6 is better
21,bxc4,b3c4,rnb2rk1/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/2PP4/2N1P3/1P3PPP/R3KBNR b KQ - 0 11,Black is trying to activate his pieces but he has one less and a cramped position because of my strong center
22,Nc6,b8c6,r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/8/2PP4/2N1P3/1P3PPP/R3KBNR w KQ - 1 12,Black is trying to activate his pieces but he has one less and a cramped position because of my strong center
23,Nf3,g1f3,r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/8/2PP4/2N1PN2/1P3PPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 2 12,Black is trying to activate his pieces but he has one less and a cramped position because of my strong center

25,Bd3,f1d3,r4rk1/pppb1ppp/2n1p3/8/2PP4/2NBPN2/1P3PPP/R3K2R b KQ - 4 13,Black is trying to activate his pieces but he has one less and a cramped position because of my strong center

27,O-O,e1g1,3r1rk1/pppb1ppp/2n1p3/8/2PP4/2NBPN2/1P3PPP/R4RK1 b - - 6 14,An attempt at being active.
28,Nb4,c6b4,3r1rk1/pppb1ppp/4p3/8/1nPP4/2NBPN2/1P3PPP/R4RK1 w - - 7 15,An attempt at being active.
29,Bb1,d3b1,3r1rk1/pppb1ppp/4p3/8/1nPP4/2N1PN2/1P3PPP/RB3RK1 b - - 8 15,I've been watching some of GM games and am less afraid of moves like this now. I didn't want to trade off my Bishop with something like 15. Rfd1 Nxd3 16. Rxd3. This keeps my Bishop on the potential dangerous b1-h7 diagonal but also makes the a2-g8 diagonal an option down the road.
30,Bc6,d7c6,3r1rk1/ppp2ppp/2b1p3/8/1nPP4/2N1PN2/1P3PPP/RB3RK1 w - - 9 16,Again playing actively hoping to double my pawns and weaken my Kingside structure
31,Ne5,f3e5,3r1rk1/ppp2ppp/2b1p3/4N3/1nPP4/2N1P3/1P3PPP/RB3RK1 b - - 10 16,"But, my Knight has a very nice square and now I'm attacking both the Bishop and the dangling a-pawn"
32,f6,f7f6,3r1rk1/ppp3pp/2b1pp2/4N3/1nPP4/2N1P3/1P3PPP/RB3RK1 w - - 0 17,This move is probably the worst choice as it does not deal with either of the threats. The only safe square for the Bishop is e8 and my opponent likely did not want to disconnect his rooks but this doubles his pawns and loses a pawn as well. Probably better was either 16. ... Be8 or 16. ... a6
33,Nxc6,e5c6,3r1rk1/ppp3pp/2N1pp2/8/1nPP4/2N1P3/1P3PPP/RB3RK1 b - - 0 17,Down a piece Black must maintain his pawns hoping for a storm at the end of the game to gain a draw but now the pawns are under assault
34,Nxc6,b4c6,3r1rk1/ppp3pp/2n1pp2/8/2PP4/2N1P3/1P3PPP/RB3RK1 w - - 0 18,Down a piece Black must maintain his pawns hoping for a storm at the end of the game to gain a draw but now the pawns are under assault
35,Nb5,c3b5,3r1rk1/ppp3pp/2n1pp2/1N6/2PP4/4P3/1P3PPP/RB3RK1 b - - 1 18,Down a piece Black must maintain his pawns hoping for a storm at the end of the game to gain a draw but now the pawns are under assault
36,a6,a7a6,3r1rk1/1pp3pp/p1n1pp2/1N6/2PP4/4P3/1P3PPP/RB3RK1 w - - 0 19,One gone
37,Nxc7,b5c7,3r1rk1/1pN3pp/p1n1pp2/8/2PP4/4P3/1P3PPP/RB3RK1 b - - 0 19,One gone
38,Rf7,f8f7,3r2k1/1pN2rpp/p1n1pp2/8/2PP4/4P3/1P3PPP/RB3RK1 w - - 1 20,Attempting to trap my Knight but there really are no good moves at this stage. 9. ... Rd7 20. c5 is no good. 19. ... e5 20. Ne6 forks the Rooks
39,Nxe6,c7e6,3r2k1/1p3rpp/p1n1Np2/8/2PP4/4P3/1P3PPP/RB3RK1 b - - 0 20,Another pawn
40,Re8,d8e8,4r1k1/1p3rpp/p1n1Np2/8/2PP4/4P3/1P3PPP/RB3RK1 w - - 1 21,Again Black tries to activate but this move essentially traps the Knight as it can only retreat back to the c6 square
41,Nc5,e6c5,4r1k1/1p3rpp/p1n2p2/2N5/2PP4/4P3/1P3PPP/RB3RK1 b - - 2 21,Again Black tries to activate but this move essentially traps the Knight as it can only retreat back to the c6 square
42,Nb4,c6b4,4r1k1/1p3rpp/p4p2/2N5/1nPP4/4P3/1P3PPP/RB3RK1 w - - 3 22,Again Black tries to activate but this move essentially traps the Knight as it can only retreat back to the c6 square
43,Ne4,c5e4,4r1k1/1p3rpp/p4p2/8/1nPPN3/4P3/1P3PPP/RB3RK1 b - - 4 22,Looking at more forks with 23. Nd6
