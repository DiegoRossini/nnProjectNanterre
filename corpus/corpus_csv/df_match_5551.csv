With this move, I guessed early on that my opponent likes hawkish tactics, but only found out later his preference for nervy moves."

6,exd4,e5d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,Not a bad opening so far for either side.  Each player is two moves away from castling - and can launch offensive strategies easily.

13,Qf3,d1f3,rnbqk2r/ppp2pbp/3p1np1/8/2BNP3/2P2Q2/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 4 7,This player is not shy about bringing out the big pieces early.
14,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/3p1np1/8/2BNP3/2P2Q2/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 5 8,"Good move.  The white bishop pins the knight to the black queen.  If the black queen moves off the diagonal, then only the black bishop protects the knight against two white assailants."

18,Nc6,b8c6,r1bq1rk1/pp3pbp/2np1np1/2p3B1/2B1P3/2P2Q2/PP2NPPP/RN2K2R w KQ - 2 10,Move knight forward with the intent of going to e5 and forking white's queen and bishop.

29,O-O,e1g1,r1bq2k1/pp1r2bp/3p1np1/1Np3B1/4P3/2P3QP/Pn2NPP1/R4RK1 b - - 3 15,"There is a rule that says ""Never launch a major offensive before castling.""  By this far into the game and with nothing threatening the white king, castling looks like an afterthought."

For the cost of 1 knight, white could have captured two rooks.  Or it could have gone 18. Ne6c7 Qf8 19. Nxa8 axb5 and white would have ended up exchanging a rook for a knight.  As tempting as these options were, white had other plans."
