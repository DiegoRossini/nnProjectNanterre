2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"Interesting opening. Why would the Master Mater play an opening where,even himself admits,is hard to acheive an early mate? Simple. Most players don't know this opening in-depth. I feel that I am lucky that I played it a little before! I also did not use the GK Database for this game to see how much I knew about this opening"
