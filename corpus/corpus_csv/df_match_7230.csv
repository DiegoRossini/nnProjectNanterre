9,Bxf7+,c4f7,r1bqk2r/pppp1Bpp/2n2n2/2b1p1N1/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"Thematic position, and White goes with the more popular bishop capture"
10,Kf8,e8f8,r1bq1k1r/pppp1Bpp/2n2n2/2b1p1N1/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 1 6,"I prefer this as Black, as it keeps the queen diagonal open for a discovered attack on the knight if Black chooses to move his own"
11,Bc4,f7c4,r1bq1k1r/pppp2pp/2n2n2/2b1p1N1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQ - 2 6,"one of three retreat posts for the bishop. As usual, Black needs now to deal with the threat of Nf7"
12,d5,d7d5,r1bq1k1r/ppp3pp/2n2n2/2bpp1N1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 0 7,"?! It seemed a good move at the time - it stops Nf7 and grabs a large portion of the centre. However, this 'strong' centre..."
13,exd5,e4d5,r1bq1k1r/ppp3pp/2n2n2/2bPp1N1/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQ - 0 7,"...as shown, will be weakened, as Freddy shows over the next five moves..."
14,Nxd5,f6d5,r1bq1k1r/ppp3pp/2n5/2bnp1N1/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 0 8,"...as shown, will be weakened, as Freddy shows over the next five moves..."
15,Qh5,d1h5,r1bq1k1r/ppp3pp/2n5/2bnp1NQ/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 1 8,! White takes advantage of the absence of the knight and attacks - he now threatens mate with Qf7 (Question; does this position count as 'too many pieces queenside?')
16,Qd7,d8d7,r1b2k1r/pppq2pp/2n5/2bnp1NQ/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 2 9,? 8...g6 would have been better. This move blocks in my light-square bishop
17,Qf3+,h5f3,r1b2k1r/pppq2pp/2n5/2bnp1N1/2B5/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 3 9,"White lands another check, while at the same time threatening the d5 knight"
18,Nf6,d5f6,r1b2k1r/pppq2pp/2n2n2/2b1p1N1/2B5/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 4 10,"Pretty much forced, if Black wants to avoid material loss. the alternative 9...Nf4? would have failed due to 10.g3!, which wins the knight"
19,Ne6+,g5e6,r1b2k1r/pppq2pp/2n1Nn2/2b1p3/2B5/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 5 10,"! The point of White's last move. White's knight jumps into enemy territory, using the protection of the bishop to fork the king and the unprotected bishop (though you might be able to see why Black doesn't lose material) It also further proves that Black's Qd7 was a bad move, as if the queen was not blocking the bishop; 10:Ne6+ Bxe6 11.Bxe6 Nd4 12.Qh3 and Black comes out with a more favourable position than in this game"
20,Ke7,f8e7,r1b4r/pppqk1pp/2n1Nn2/2b1p3/2B5/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 6 11,"I made this move hoping to play Rd8 later, but though I won't call it a mistake, this move is the start of what brought about my downfall in this game (of course, Kf7?? is just horrible; Nxc5+!!)"
21,Qg3,f3g3,r1b4r/pppqk1pp/2n1Nn2/2b1p3/2B5/6Q1/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 7 11,"White doesn't take the bishop straight away, instead threatening a very deadly 12.Qxg7! I thought at the time that Freddy was testing me here, seeing if I fell into the trap of trying to save my bishop instead of noticing the threat, but White's queen now also eyes the e5 pawn - I don't know whether that had been brought into consideration as well"
22,g6,g7g6,r1b4r/pppqk2p/2n1Nnp1/2b1p3/2B5/6Q1/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 0 12,pretty much the only logical reply to this threat
23,Nxc5,e6c5,r1b4r/pppqk2p/2n2np1/2N1p3/2B5/6Q1/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 0 12,"Expected, but Black wins back material immediately with..."
24,Qd4,d7d4,r1b4r/ppp1k2p/2n2np1/2N1p3/2Bq4/6Q1/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 1 13,"! I realise this move was forced anyway, but it's my best move of this game. One of White's pieces has to go!"
25,d3,d2d3,r1b4r/ppp1k2p/2n2np1/2N1p3/2Bq4/3P2Q1/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 0 13,"! A simple move, but I like it all the same - White frees his dark-square bishop with tempo, and protects the more influential of his pieces"
26,Qxc5,d4c5,r1b4r/ppp1k2p/2n2np1/2q1p3/2B5/3P2Q1/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 0 14,"And now, though Black can boast control of the d4 square, his centre isn't as strong as it was (Black would probably want his queen for uses other than centre control)"
27,Bg5,c1g5,r1b4r/ppp1k2p/2n2np1/2q1p1B1/2B5/3P2Q1/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R b KQ - 1 14,"White pins the knight to the king, while developing his bishop"
28,Nd4,c6d4,r1b4r/ppp1k2p/5np1/2q1p1B1/2Bn4/3P2Q1/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R w KQ - 2 15,"?! The move itself wasn't a mistake, but here I made the mistake of assuming that Freddy would exchange at f6. Wrong! Not only was the exchange not forced, most people prefer their bishops to the knights anyway. I had considered Rf8 before this move, and if I had played that, I would have been able to survive for much longer (in fact, based on this position I like Black's chances) The only was for White to stop the King/Knight fork would have been to move his king, which strips White of castling rights (15.Na3? b5! 16.Bb3 b4, and White is going to lose material)"
29,Nc3,b1c3,r1b4r/ppp1k2p/5np1/2q1p1B1/2Bn4/2NP2Q1/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQ - 3 15,"!? The fork is ignored completely... but White won't lose material; 15...Nxc2+ 16.Kd2 Nxa1 17.Nd5+ Kf6 18.Bxf6 Rd5 19.Ne3 [to stop 2 piece/rook exchange] and White captures the trapped knight next move. Looking at that line, I saw White as better off afterwards, and wanted to stop it from happening, so I played..."
