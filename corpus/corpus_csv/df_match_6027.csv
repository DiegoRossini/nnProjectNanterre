My excuse is that I was playing my moves very fast - my wife left me - I had to catch a train - but most of all - I wanted to 'save up' the N-f5 move.

21,Nxd5+,c3d5,rnbq1b1r/pp1nk2p/4pp2/3N3Q/3N3B/8/PPP2PPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 0 11,This is good anyway. On the objectively stronger 11.Nf5 exf5 12.Nxd5+ Kd6 13.O-O-O is crushing.
22,exd5,e6d5,rnbq1b1r/pp1nk2p/5p2/3p3Q/3N3B/8/PPP2PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 0 12,So now the kink cannot retreat backwards for the time being.
23,Nf5+,d4f5,rnbq1b1r/pp1nk2p/5p2/3p1N1Q/7B/8/PPP2PPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 1 12,So now the kink cannot retreat backwards for the time being.

26,Nc6,b8c6,r1bq1b1r/pp1n3p/2n1kp2/3p1N1Q/7B/8/PPP2PPP/2KR1B1R w - - 4 14,Now the very best move is 14.c4
27,Bc4,f1c4,r1bq1b1r/pp1n3p/2n1kp2/3p1N1Q/2B4B/8/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b - - 5 14,But this is also very strong - and more in the  'coffee-house' style.
28,dxc4,d5c4,r1bq1b1r/pp1n3p/2n1kp2/5N1Q/2p4B/8/PPP2PPP/2KR3R w - - 0 15,Now 16.Rxe5 wins the queen. The trouble is that the chances of beating the 21 move deadline will probably evaporate after 16...Nxe5 17.Rxd8 Ng6 because of a check with ...Bh6
29,Rhe1+,h1e1,r1bq1b1r/pp1n3p/2n1kp2/5N1Q/2p4B/8/PPP2PPP/2KRR3 b - - 1 15,Now 16.Rxe5 wins the queen. The trouble is that the chances of beating the 21 move deadline will probably evaporate after 16...Nxe5 17.Rxd8 Ng6 because of a check with ...Bh6

32,Qa5,d8a5,r1b2b1r/pp1n3p/4kp2/q3nN1Q/2p2P1B/8/PPP3PP/2KRR3 w - - 1 17,Now - here I had my chance - and I blew it. It's a mate in three after the obvious 18.Qe8+ Kxf5 19.Qf7+ Nf6 20.Qxf6 Kg4 21.Qg5#
33,fxe5,f4e5,r1b2b1r/pp1n3p/4kp2/q3PN1Q/2p4B/8/PPP3PP/2KRR3 b - - 0 17,Now - here I had my chance - and I blew it. It's a mate in three after the obvious 18.Qe8+ Kxf5 19.Qf7+ Nf6 20.Qxf6 Kg4 21.Qg5#
