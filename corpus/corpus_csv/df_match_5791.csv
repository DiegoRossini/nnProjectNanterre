It is uncommon but playable, and does not oblige black all the delicious counterplay with rook artillery firing on the a and b files, in tandem with a fianchettoed KB, that black usually receives in the Volga Gambit accepted (4. cb a6 5. ba Bxa6).  The idea behind 4. Qc2 is to play e4 immediately."
