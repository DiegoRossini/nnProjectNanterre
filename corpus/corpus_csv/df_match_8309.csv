1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game happened at round one of the 57th GK tournament, expert section. I entered the game with a sense of inferiority knowing the 400 points that separated our ratings.
White made a superior play that was soon concretized with the win of a pawn. By the move 25, black was ready to resign : it seemed like a time-stop is going to happen when white only needs one time-unit to push his pawn and clearly set the outcome of the game. In order not to lose the initiative Black sacrificed a rook against an active bishop. Fortunately, the consequence was out of expectation : Black only hoped to survive, when he found himself winning the game !"

As for exf5, it greatly affects black's position : threat on e7 followed by BxNb6, threat on Nxg7, threat even on d5 since the Nb6 is threatened by Bf2 and hence both Bf3 and Qd1 will find it easy to win d5.
So, instead, Bc5 annihilates the Bf2 attack, relocates Kg1, gains time that can be use for a castle, and forces white to open the f file if he wants to gain the pawn which then will be used for the Black's rook."

It seemed to me that the clock has stopped and is preparing to move in the opposite direction. To survive i needed to regain initiative : give the time clock a new push even at the expense of material balance. Thus came the idea of assassinating the bishop f3 with the rook."
