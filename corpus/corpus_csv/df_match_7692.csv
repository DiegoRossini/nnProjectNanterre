1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is a transposed move from the main line, and the moves following this are out of sequence until move 4 is complete."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"This is a transposed move from the main line, and the moves following this are out of sequence until move 4 is complete."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"I continue with a transposed move as well, for the reason that I am trying to steer the opening towards a Semi-Slav."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"The pawn, according to this openings principals is offered in sacrifice."
5,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"The pawn, according to this openings principals is offered in sacrifice."
6,c6,c7c6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Black follows the prinicipals of this opening by not playing the wasteful move 3...dxc4, which takes away central control, but instead maintains the possibility of maintaining a solid central presence after (4.cxd4 cxd4). For this reason white does not play 4.cxd4, but leaves the tension while making more productive moves."
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"This position is the main line of the Semi-Slav by way of transposition. The normal move order is (1.d4 Nf6  2.c4 e6  3.Nf3 d5  4.Nc3 c6  5.Bg5 dxc4 ...), the text move 4...e6 assures a difficult game for white while maintaining strength at d5, and activates a bishop."
8,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"This position is the main line of the Semi-Slav by way of transposition. The normal move order is (1.d4 Nf6  2.c4 e6  3.Nf3 d5  4.Nc3 c6  5.Bg5 dxc4 ...), the text move 4...e6 assures a difficult game for white while maintaining strength at d5, and activates a bishop."
9,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"I proceed with the main line, where this move is part of a strategy against the f6 knight. This reminds me of the Nimzo, but from reversed colors."
10,dxc4,d5c4,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/6B1/2pP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"This move is still within the main line, and the white c pawn has been sacrificed for the initiative."
11,e4,e2e4,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/6B1/2pPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"This move is still within the main line, and the white c pawn has been sacrificed for the initiative."
12,b5,b7b5,rnbqkb1r/p4ppp/2p1pn2/1p4B1/2pPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,This prevents white from regaining material balance.
13,a3,a2a3,rnbqkb1r/p4ppp/2p1pn2/1p4B1/2pPP3/P1N2N2/1P3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"?! Here, because I am still learning, a deviation from the main line move of 7.e5 with (7...h6  8.Bh4 g5 9.Nxg5 hxg5 10.Bxg5 Nbd7) as the main line continuation. My move was made with consideration to limiting the f8 bishop and protecting the c3 knight, but departs from the planned exchanges of the main line. The move does create a different scenario from which springs some fun game play."
14,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/p3bppp/2p1pn2/1p4B1/2pPP3/P1N2N2/1P3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,The obvious move that screams disapproval of whites prior move.
15,e5,e4e5,rnbqk2r/p3bppp/2p1pn2/1p2P1B1/2pP4/P1N2N2/1P3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,?! Probably a bit out of place due to giving d5 to the knight. My thoughts were to sieze control of g5 and to eliminate blacks black-squared bishop for greater initiative for white.
16,Nd5,f6d5,rnbqk2r/p3bppp/2p1p3/1p1nP1B1/2pP4/P1N2N2/1P3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 9,"Perhaps rushing castling, I would have considered 9...Nxc3 to remove an important contribution to whites game, or even the straight forward 9...Bxg5 bishop exchange would leave a lone knight at g5 with hopes of making it a positional liability."
17,Qd2,d1d2,rnbqk2r/p3bppp/2p1p3/1p1nP1B1/2pP4/P1N2N2/1P1Q1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 2 9,"Perhaps rushing castling, I would have considered 9...Nxc3 to remove an important contribution to whites game, or even the straight forward 9...Bxg5 bishop exchange would leave a lone knight at g5 with hopes of making it a positional liability."
18,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/p3bppp/2p1p3/1p1nP1B1/2pP4/P1N2N2/1P1Q1PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 3 10,"Perhaps rushing castling, I would have considered 9...Nxc3 to remove an important contribution to whites game, or even the straight forward 9...Bxg5 bishop exchange would leave a lone knight at g5 with hopes of making it a positional liability."
19,Ne4,c3e4,rnbq1rk1/p3bppp/2p1p3/1p1nP1B1/2pPN3/P4N2/1P1Q1PPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 4 10,"The knight will take part in kingside operations, so the exchange is avoided."
20,Bxg5,e7g5,rnbq1rk1/p4ppp/2p1p3/1p1nP1b1/2pPN3/P4N2/1P1Q1PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 0 11,The knight occupies a reasonable square where it targets h7 in anticipation of the queen.
21,Nexg5,e4g5,rnbq1rk1/p4ppp/2p1p3/1p1nP1N1/2pP4/P4N2/1P1Q1PPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 0 11,The knight occupies a reasonable square where it targets h7 in anticipation of the queen.
22,Bb7,c8b7,rn1q1rk1/pb3ppp/2p1p3/1p1nP1N1/2pP4/P4N2/1P1Q1PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 1 12,"Black follows the usual plan to develop the bishop on the a8 diagonal, even though it is not achieving anything now it can and does produce results later in the game. This is a very good diagonal for the bishop, especially if short castling is anticipated for white."
23,h4,h2h4,rn1q1rk1/pb3ppp/2p1p3/1p1nP1N1/2pP3P/P4N2/1P1Q1PP1/R3KB1R b KQ - 0 12,"I have a loosely intuited plan for attacking kingside, a favorite strategy of mine. Here the plan will involve pushing the g and h pawns. I consider possibilities for a knight sacrifice, but see nothing productive from that idea, mostly due to the hindered white squared bishop vs the c4 pawn."
24,Nd7,b8d7,r2q1rk1/pb1n1ppp/2p1p3/1p1nP1N1/2pP3P/P4N2/1P1Q1PP1/R3KB1R w KQ - 1 13,"Black correctly anticipates activity and brings in the other knight, which proves to be a good decision."
25,g4,g2g4,r2q1rk1/pb1n1ppp/2p1p3/1p1nP1N1/2pP2PP/P4N2/1P1Q1P2/R3KB1R b KQ - 0 13,"A nice move, hacking away at whites center, and opening up the bishop line to make it more effective, which lends some concern to white for the f3 knight. This move guarantees white a positionally isolated e pawn while a knight resides at f3 after (14...cxd4)"
26,c5,c6c5,r2q1rk1/pb1n1ppp/4p3/1ppnP1N1/2pP2PP/P4N2/1P1Q1P2/R3KB1R w KQ - 0 14,"A nice move, hacking away at whites center, and opening up the bishop line to make it more effective, which lends some concern to white for the f3 knight.

28,cxd4,c5d4,r2q1rk1/pb1n1ppp/4p3/1p1nP1NP/2pp2P1/P4N2/1P1Q1P2/R3KB1R w KQ - 0 15,Fully expected.
