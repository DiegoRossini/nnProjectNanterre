1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This game is a well fought game with some interesting ideas on initiative and tempo. The endgame is also quite interesting.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Black responds symmetrically
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Once I read that this 2.Nf3 is called the 'Russian game'
In any case, it is a good move as Black is almost obliged to defend the pawn (unless he plays 2...Nf6, the Petroff defence)"
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"Black defends the pawn, and develops a piece"
5,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,"White plays the Italian Game, this has a general tendency to turn into a 'open' type of game, with either one or both sets of central pawns exchanged."
6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,"The immediate development of the knight is called the 'Two Knights Game'.
It is VERY sharp and theoretical and so is not to everyones taste, it certainly does not appeal to me playing this move as Black unless you are very well prepared.
If you are well prepared, it is EXCELLENT!"
7,d4,d2d4,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2BPP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,"White immediately makes a move on the centre with a threat, and opens a line for the c1 bishop and provides some space for the Queen. 
White threatens 5. dxe5"
8,exd4,e5d4,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"Black captures the pawn, removing the threat."
9,Ng5,f3g5,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/6N1/2BpP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,White sacrifices a pawn and makes a large threat of Nxf7
10,d5,d7d5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3p2N1/2BpP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"Black threatens the Bishop on c4 and the pawn on e4.
This move is practically forced, and is a very familiar theme in the 'Two knights defense'."
11,exd5,e4d5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3P2N1/2Bp4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"White captures the pawn and threatens the knight on c6.
6. Bxd5 Nxd5
7. exd5 Qxd5  and Black is already better, as he has the two bishops, a extra pawn, developed his queen and has exchanged an attacking piece."
12,Qe7+,d8e7,r1b1kb1r/ppp1qppp/2n2n2/3P2N1/2Bp4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 7,"Black checks with the queen. This is a very interesting idea for Black. White reply of kf1 is forced.
Both sides will have development problem and king safety issues. 
White will have to somehow develop the h1 rook.
Black on the other hand will have to deal with the fact his queen blocks the dark squared bishop, as well as the fact his knight on c6 is en prise to the pawn at the moment."
13,Kf1,e1f1,r1b1kb1r/ppp1qppp/2n2n2/3P2N1/2Bp4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1K1R b kq - 2 7,"Black defends the knight, and also threatens the c4 bishop. The knight also defends the important f7 square."
14,Ne5,c6e5,r1b1kb1r/ppp1qppp/5n2/3Pn1N1/2Bp4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1K1R w kq - 3 8,"Black defends the knight, and also threatens the c4 bishop. The knight also defends the important f7 square."
15,d6,d5d6,r1b1kb1r/ppp1qppp/3P1n2/4n1N1/2Bp4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1K1R b kq - 0 8,White decides to try and increase pressure by sacrificing a pawn.
16,Qxd6,e7d6,r1b1kb1r/ppp2ppp/3q1n2/4n1N1/2Bp4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1K1R w kq - 0 9,"Black captures the pawn.
8...cxd6 would have seriously messed up Blacks pawn structure."
17,Qe2,d1e2,r1b1kb1r/ppp2ppp/3q1n2/4n1N1/2Bp4/8/PPP1QPPP/RNB2K1R b kq - 1 9,"White attacks the knight.
This is quite a tricky move by White. It pins the knight, and so stop Nxc4. It also threatens Bf4 with a simple double attack on the pinned knight. It also threatens Nf3 in some cases, so Black must play quite carefully!"
18,Qe7,d6e7,r1b1kb1r/ppp1qppp/5n2/4n1N1/2Bp4/8/PPP1QPPP/RNB2K1R w kq - 2 10,"Black defends the knight.
This is a very good move. Black recognises the danger and retreats his queen back.
It is not such a great loss of time as one would expect, as he threatens to exchange on c4."
19,Bf4,c1f4,r1b1kb1r/ppp1qppp/5n2/4n1N1/2Bp1B2/8/PPP1QPPP/RN3K1R b kq - 3 10,"White decides to develop a piece, and try and gain a time and initiative advantage.
Also possible was Bb3, this saves the two bishops but gives up a tempo."
20,Nxc4,e5c4,r1b1kb1r/ppp1qppp/5n2/6N1/2np1B2/8/PPP1QPPP/RN3K1R w kq - 0 11,Black captures the bishop.
21,Qxc4,e2c4,r1b1kb1r/ppp1qppp/5n2/6N1/2Qp1B2/8/PPP2PPP/RN3K1R b kq - 0 11,White recapures the knigt. Forced
