White needed to play 21. g3 to stay alive, although with 21...Nh3 he will have to give back the N, the K will be on a forced march, and black will be firmly in control.

EDIT:  A chessmaster friend points out this move as a mistake, missing a forced mate:  20...Ne2+  should be played immediately, followed by 21. Kh1 hxg4+ 22. Nh2 Rxh2+ 23. Kxh2 Rh8#"
