1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"A nice win from last night's league match.  I achieved better activity from the opening than I usually manage and converted it into a neat mating attack.  However, I think my opponent missed a few chances ..."

11,Be3,c1e3,rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,The English Attack
12,e5,e7e5,rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2p1n2/4p3/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,Other choices: 6...Ng4 has been quite successful on Gameknot but I rejected it last night because I couldn't calculate a sensible follow-up; 6...e6 is more flexible but doesn't show much ambition; 6...g6 transposes into a Dragon; 6...Nc6 allows White to create an isolated a pawn.   There are probably lots of other reasonable tries as well...
13,Nb3,d4b3,rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2p1n2/4p3/4P3/1NN1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 7,The usual response.
14,Be6,c8e6,rn1qkb1r/1p3ppp/p2pbn2/4p3/4P3/1NN1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 8,I usually play this quickly to cover the hole at d5.
15,Bd3,f1d3,rn1qkb1r/1p3ppp/p2pbn2/4p3/4P3/1NNBB3/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 3 8,"Doesn't look right to me as it allows the B less freedom of movement than 8. Be2.   However, it does over-protect e4, allowing the Nc3 to contemplate occupying d5 (or swinging via a4) to threaten b6.  In the past I've often suffered from White exploiting the hole at b6 with B and N."
16,Be7,f8e7,rn1qk2r/1p2bppp/p2pbn2/4p3/4P3/1NNBB3/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 4 9,"Unexpected.  I'm not sure of the point of this move, other than to over-populate the e-file.  Moving the Q off the back row allows castling either side, to keep Black guessing, and this possibly supports Bc4 but it is more usual in the English Attack to back the other B from d2."
17,Qe2,d1e2,rn1qk2r/1p2bppp/p2pbn2/4p3/4P3/1NNBB3/PPP1QPPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 5 9,"Unexpected.  I'm not sure of the point of this move, other than to over-populate the e-file.

18,Nbd7,b8d7,r2qk2r/1p1nbppp/p2pbn2/4p3/4P3/1NNBB3/PPP1QPPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 6 10,"I continue my flexible development, covering b6 and envisaging a possible future occupation of c5.  White's quiet opening moves have allowed me to develop in peace."
19,f3,f2f3,r2qk2r/1p1nbppp/p2pbn2/4p3/4P3/1NNBBP2/PPP1Q1PP/R3K2R b KQkq - 0 10,"This usually comes earlier: either before Be3 or just after, to prevent ...Ng4 from disturbing the Be3.  Now it signals a probable kingside pawn storm with g4 threatened."
20,Qc7,d8c7,r3k2r/1pqnbppp/p2pbn2/4p3/4P3/1NNBBP2/PPP1Q1PP/R3K2R w KQkq - 1 11,So I prepared the possibility of castling queenside with this normal developing move.
21,g4,g2g4,r3k2r/1pqnbppp/p2pbn2/4p3/4P1P1/1NNBBP2/PPP1Q2P/R3K2R b KQkq - 0 11,Providing a retreat square for the Nf6 if White plays g5 and also preparing a possible advance of my d-pawn.
22,Nb6,d7b6,r3k2r/1pq1bppp/pn1pbn2/4p3/4P1P1/1NNBBP2/PPP1Q2P/R3K2R w KQkq - 1 12,Providing a retreat square for the Nf6 if White plays g5 and also preparing a possible advance of my d-pawn.
23,Nd2,b3d2,r3k2r/1pq1bppp/pn1pbn2/4p3/4P1P1/2NBBP2/PPPNQ2P/R3K2R b KQkq - 2 12,Not sure about this retreat.  Presumably he wanted to prevent an advance to c4 by either my N or B but I wasn't contemplating that anyway - perhaps I should have been.
24,d5,d6d5,r3k2r/1pq1bppp/pn2bn2/3pp3/4P1P1/2NBBP2/PPPNQ2P/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 13,"A critical move.  I wanted to castle but didn't want to commit to one side or the other too early.  Kingside castling would have played into the hands of the expected pawn storm.  Queenside didn't look much safer, given the flexible central deployment of all White's minor pieces.  It goes against opening principles to move this pawn twice before I've castled but there are good concrete reasons to do so: it frees up Black's position, getting rid of the weak backward pawn, which is not currently required to defend e5, and threatens to fork the Nc3 and Be3, with a bind on White's position.  White is in no better position than Black to attack the uncastled King."
25,exd5,e4d5,r3k2r/1pq1bppp/pn2bn2/3Pp3/6P1/2NBBP2/PPPNQ2P/R3K2R b KQkq - 0 13,"By retaking with this N, I evade the threated attack from g5 and threaten to exploit the holes in White's kingside by ...Bh4+.  This is also a much better square for the N than the originally planned retreat square at d7, as it dominates the board, whence the N can either swap with one of White's minor pieces or move again to threaten mayhem on white's second rank."
26,Nfxd5,f6d5,r3k2r/1pq1bppp/pn2b3/3np3/6P1/2NBBP2/PPPNQ2P/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 14,"By retaking with this N, I evade the threated attack from g5 and threaten to exploit the holes in White's kingside by ...Bh4+.

28,Nxd5,b6d5,r3k2r/1pq1bppp/p3b3/3np3/6P1/3BBP2/PPPNQ2P/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 15,Now I'm feeling very comfortable.

30,Nxe3,d5e3,r3k2r/1pq1bppp/p3b3/4p3/6P1/P2BnP2/1PPNQ2P/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 16,"I decided that now was a good opportunity to eliminate White's powerful black-square B, allowing me to castle more safely.  At this stage, my opponent had 61 minutes left, I had 69.  By the end of the game, he had 3 and I had 40."
31,Qxe3,e2e3,r3k2r/1pq1bppp/p3b3/4p3/6P1/P2BQP2/1PPN3P/R3K2R b KQkq - 0 16,"Probably my longest think of the game as I spent a long time examining 16....Bh4+, which would have prevented White from castling but I couldn't see a good way to attack the K on e2 and, indeed, I would have been helping White to connect his rooks for a more efficient attack."
32,Bc5,e7c5,r3k2r/1pq2ppp/p3b3/2b1p3/6P1/P2BQP2/1PPN3P/R3K2R w KQkq - 1 17,"Probably my longest think of the game as I spent a long time examining 16....Bh4+, which would have prevented White from castling but I couldn't see a good way to attack the K on e2 and, indeed, I would have been helping White to connect his rooks for a more efficient attack."
