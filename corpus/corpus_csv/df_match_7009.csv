1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Another loss - sigh - I was unable to repeat my epic feat against Master Renniemay and add to my Master Draw tally.  Never mind, I have done it once and could do it again, that is my mantra.  Here I am faced with another Lopez and this time Maria puts her bishop on a4 instead of exchanging on c6."

It was too much so I waved the white flag.  Can you the jury spot the sequence of moves that will lead to such a catastrophe for black?  Anyhow, I hope this will provide a useful lesson to the Coaching Club on tactics, of which I am still trying to improve mine by doing the puzzles - it could be a while - however before I feel the benefits of it, but I do have patience in abundance and the strength to persevere - cheers and bye for now - Joanne"
