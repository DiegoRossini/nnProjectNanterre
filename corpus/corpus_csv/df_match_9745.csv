Hope you enjoy,

If the pawn exchange happens white is in a better position due to the threat on the knight and now after the knight exchange black forces whites Bishop off of the very nice position he has took up.

This is a bad move although threatening the bishop/c2 pawn hoping to gain tempi white now has a game which if not noticed by black (which by this move it has not been) is won. I can understand the idea behind it though. If black initiates the pawn exchange he is still on the back foot where as if white initiates the exchange black looks better. Perhaps Initiating the exchange would have been better or g6.
