1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game  is from my appearance at the 2007 Alabama State Championship. I played in the Reserve (U1600) section, and by some miracle broke even with a score of 3/6. The chess is not brilliant by any means, but I did have a fun time hanging out with other chess heads. Game #1 was the lengthy one of the bunch, going 57 moves and about 4 hours. It was a tiring, but satisfying start to my first state championship. My opponent is a total stranger to me. He opens with 1. d4."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,My preferred response.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 2,This guy opens just like I do with white.  I wonder if he will go for QG?
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"Ok, come on.....throw me a gambit pawn........."
5,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"hmmm......White opts to activate his LSB. Truth be told, this is not a line that I am familiar with as I generally play 3. c4 as white."
6,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2pp4/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Feeling that I had been given a little time, I choose to spread open the queenside. Nc6 and Bg4 seem to hold some promise."
7,c3,c2c3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2pp4/3P4/2P1PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,Bolstering d4.
8,c4,c5c4,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p4/2pP4/2P1PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Claiming yet more space, locking in white's LSB, and locking up the pawn structure."
9,b3,b2b3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p4/2pP4/1PP1PN2/P4PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,Attempting to unlock the pawn structure and gain more scope for his LSB.
10,b5,b7b5,rnbqkb1r/p3pppp/5n2/1p1p4/2pP4/1PP1PN2/P4PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Consistent with my pawn structure ideas, but perhaps neglecting development.  Maybe 4...Ba6?"
11,bxc4,b3c4,rnbqkb1r/p3pppp/5n2/1p1p4/2PP4/2P1PN2/P4PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,Starting some conflict while attempting to gain some range for his LSB.
12,bxc4,b5c4,rnbqkb1r/p3pppp/5n2/3p4/2pP4/2P1PN2/P4PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,Maintaining a hammer lock on the center.
13,Nbd2,b1d2,rnbqkb1r/p3pppp/5n2/3p4/2pP4/2P1PN2/P2N1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 7,"?! White really has to get something going here. While this move does develop, where can this knight go next? Is he worried about my nice e4 post? I think 7. Be2 followed by 0-0 is better here."
14,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/p3pppp/2n2n2/3p4/2pP4/2P1PN2/P2N1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 8,"Ok, ok....the whole ""freezing same colored bishops"" thing. White makes this move to develop while hindering my castling plans."
15,Ba3,c1a3,r1bqkb1r/p3pppp/2n2n2/3p4/2pP4/B1P1PN2/P2N1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 3 8,"Ok, ok....the whole ""freezing same colored bishops"" thing. White makes this move to develop while hindering my castling plans."
16,Qa5,d8a5,r1b1kb1r/p3pppp/2n2n2/q2p4/2pP4/B1P1PN2/P2N1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 4 9,Hitting the bishop and the weak c pawn.
17,Qc1,d1c1,r1b1kb1r/p3pppp/2n2n2/q2p4/2pP4/B1P1PN2/P2N1PPP/R1Q1KB1R b KQkq - 5 9,9. Nb1 also holds promise I think.
18,Rb8,a8b8,1rb1kb1r/p3pppp/2n2n2/q2p4/2pP4/B1P1PN2/P2N1PPP/R1Q1KB1R w KQk - 6 10,"While perhaps a bit behind in development, I just gotta jump on the open file."
19,Be2,f1e2,1rb1kb1r/p3pppp/2n2n2/q2p4/2pP4/B1P1PN2/P2NBPPP/R1Q1K2R b KQk - 7 10,Developing with some tactical threats. If I can draw off his Nd2 I can play Ne4 which will win a pawn.
20,Bg4,c8g4,1r2kb1r/p3pppp/2n2n2/q2p4/2pP2b1/B1P1PN2/P2NBPPP/R1Q1K2R w KQk - 8 11,Developing with some tactical threats. If I can draw off his Nd2 I can play Ne4 which will win a pawn.
21,Bc5,a3c5,1r2kb1r/p3pppp/2n2n2/q1Bp4/2pP2b1/2P1PN2/P2NBPPP/R1Q1K2R b KQk - 9 11,hmmmmmmmmmm.......................................
22,e6,e7e6,1r2kb1r/p4ppp/2n1pn2/q1Bp4/2pP2b1/2P1PN2/P2NBPPP/R1Q1K2R w KQk - 0 12,"My opponents last was intriguing. 11...Nd7 defeats it, but I figure I should go ahead and answer the question of his control of the a3-f8 diagonal. I figure that since my pieces and pawns are better placed than his, I'll simply castle by hand and continue squeezing his already cramped position."
