1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is the craziest and most open game I have ever played in GameKnot, and probably in my short chess life. (It is technically still in progress, but I am (thankfully!) only a few moves away from victory now.) It is a game where my Queen just does not know how to die, and rises from her ashes.. and not only once! So, off with the King's Pawn."

O-O might have been a better try, since he is going to lose that clergy anyway if I am right.
