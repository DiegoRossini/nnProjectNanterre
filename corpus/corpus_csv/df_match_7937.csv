1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,1.e4 produces the most dynamic game the most quickly... great for blitz player who know their lines. And greater opportunity to err more quickly if they do not know the openings well.

3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Usually I play Nc3 here with option of 3.d4 for a mainline Caro, or Nc3 for my usual 2 Knights line that Fischer played. Here in blitz I sometimes play Nf3 instead, planning to go into the 2 Knights to begin with, but giving the impression of ""not knowing I am Supposed to play 2.d4"" :)  And it stops 2...e5, for what its worth."

Tho this is not that particular Kind of Zwishenzug. Still it is forcing. And being blitz, maybe the opponents heart will go pitter-patter here if they did not see it. I try to do it Quickly, and slam the piece down loudly for such moves~! }8-D"

And then he would really need to think twice about 11...Qxb2 (if he has plans to O-O-O) 12.Nxd5~! exd5? 13.Bd4+ Discovered Check and his Q is lost. Or 12...Qxb5? Nc7+ forking the K & Q.

I had thought to have a bit of a bind then with 14.Qe5 but he has ... O-O-O~! and I have not time to play 15.Bf4 now since the Nc6 has become unpinned and thus attacks my Queen ""for real"" now. Also he could play 13. ...Qd6 threatening a Q trade, but I would retreat my Q, to come back and harass his with a Rd1.

Then again, I've always been a pretty LUCKY Player~!? At board games that is; not cards, dice, or lotteries. I used to say ""Love"" there, but I met my wife on GK~! Can't get luckier than That ( Ok, on a Chess site ... right? :)"
