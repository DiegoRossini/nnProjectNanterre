5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,?! I'm not sure I like this move. Maybe it's because I don't know a good reply to Ne5.
6,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2PP2b1/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,?! I'm not sure I like this move. Maybe it's because I don't know a good reply to Ne5.
7,Ne5,f3e5,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pN3/2PP2b1/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 3 4,The last game started with a similar set up where my bishop overextended and was attacked by an aggressive knight. Looks like I didn't learn!
8,Bf5,g4f5,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pNb2/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 4 5,f6 just seems to be asking for trouble at this point. This doesn't seem like a very clever move either though.
9,cxd5,c4d5,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3PNb2/3P4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,f6 just seems to be asking for trouble at this point. This doesn't seem like a very clever move either though.

11,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3pNb2/3P4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,f6 just seems to be asking for trouble at this point. This doesn't seem like a very clever move either though.
12,Nc6,b8c6,r2qkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/3pNb2/3P4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 7,f6 just seems to be asking for trouble at this point. This doesn't seem like a very clever move either though.
13,Nxc6,e5c6,r2qkbnr/pp2pppp/2N5/3p1b2/3P4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,c6 is looking rather weak at the moment due to the lack of a b7 pawn. Development is somewhat equal at this point but white clearly has the initiative.
14,bxc6,b7c6,r2qkbnr/p3pppp/2p5/3p1b2/3P4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,c6 is looking rather weak at the moment due to the lack of a b7 pawn. Development is somewhat equal at this point but white clearly has the initiative.

16,Bd7,f5d7,r2qkbnr/p2bpppp/2p5/3p4/Q2P4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 2 9,He is definitely not worried about the discover attack on his queen. Maybe because all that is threatened is a pawn.

18,c5,c6c5,r2qkbnr/p2bpppp/8/2pp4/Q2P1B2/2N5/PP2PPPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 10,? I'm really asking for it this game it seems. Not sure what would be a better move but this one does not seem too good. Maybe I was in trouble already.
19,Qb3,a4b3,r2qkbnr/p2bpppp/8/2pp4/3P1B2/1QN5/PP2PPPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 1 10,? I'm really asking for it this game it seems. Not sure what would be a better move but this one does not seem too good. Maybe I was in trouble already.

21,Nxd5,c3d5,r2qkbnr/p2bpppp/8/3N4/3p1B2/1Q6/PP2PPPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 11,"Okay I'm in trouble now. Maybe a solution is lurking somewhere, perhaps a shot at his king."
22,e5,e7e5,r2qkbnr/p2b1ppp/8/3Np3/3p1B2/1Q6/PP2PPPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 12,"! Denying his bishop access to d2. Even though d2 does not seem very important at the moment, it is a fundamental square for what's to come."
23,Bxe5,f4e5,r2qkbnr/p2b1ppp/8/3NB3/3p4/1Q6/PP2PPPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 12,At this point white does not have very many good replies but this seems to lose the quickest.
24,Qa5+,d8a5,r3kbnr/p2b1ppp/8/q2NB3/3p4/1Q6/PP2PPPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 1 13,At this point white does not have very many good replies but this seems to lose the quickest.

Epicuro resigned at this point and suddenly opening strategy became very important. Even though this is a blitz game it shows you can sometimes turn a game around in difficult situations and that you should not give up."
