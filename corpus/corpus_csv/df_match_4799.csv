1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"general notes:  having never played a player above 1650, the personality of this game was eye-opening.  black's foresight and expert positioning create pressure from very early on.  this leaves no margin for error and little chance that black will give white any opportunities.  my usual reactive game is not going to work.  a solid opening that leads to a good position at the beginning of the middlegame is much more critical than vs a 1600 player.  instead of being able to seek a stronger and stronger position, I spent a number of moves reacting to potential threats.  interesting initiative personality: black's moves were not so much aggressive as they were methodical.  it would have been interesting to see how black might have proceeded if I had not made a mistake at move 19.

Went with English opening for reasons I have since decided were invalid."

but note the unprotected e-pawn, ...which I very unwisely do not pay proper attention to (and which is perhaps not very significant in the current position).  [note: might have played 18. Bc1].

at any rate, I am quite focused on the d-file, and on d3 in particular.  I see that black could add a fourth attacker with Ba6, ...pinning the pawn if my R on f stays where it is.

Now I have the ability to get rid of one of these attackers, the N on e5, with a piece that is not involved in defending d3.  

I do not love the idea of this exchange but feel that removing that N may be worth the negatives that come with it.  

HOWEVER, I am so focused on the pressure on d3 (thinking the black Queen will stay on the d-file) that I do not recognize the potential fork (of two pawns by Q).  I incorrectly assume he would recapture with bishop.

So, I should have tossed the idea of BxN and found something better. 

Comments here please: too much focus on defending the square under pressure? better thought process would have been...?  other?"
