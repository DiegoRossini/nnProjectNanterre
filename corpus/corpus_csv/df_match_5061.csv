1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Instead of answering with a central pawn like e5 or d5, black plays c5 attacking the d square, preventing white to play d4 immediately. Off course playing 2.d4 is still possible but if I were white I would follow it up with a pawn sacrifice by playing c3. This ends up in: 1.e4-c5 2.d4-cxd4 3.c3. Black can now accept the sacrifice, but I never do, because white creates a lot more space on his queens side. It's not a disadvantage, but I prefer a more enclosed type of game and I'd rather not give away too much space from the start.
As for 3.Qxd4, it's just a bad move. You do not want to expose your queen too early in the game and certainly not when the other player can develop while attacking it."

The idea behind a6 is that black wants to play e5 eventually, to chase the white knight off the d4 square and gain position in the centre. However playing it right of the bat, without a6 is not a good idea. White can play:
5....-e5 6.Bb5-Nbd7 7. Nf5-a6 8.Bxd7-Qxd7. With 6....-Bb7 the outcome is the same. White has a much stronger position at this point. A lot of space first of all and pieces that develop easily. In fact white only needs to castle and develop Bc1. Whereas black still needs to make space to develop his bishops. Still it's being played and I believe it's even a variation, but I don't know the name. I wouldn't recommend it though.
By playing 5...-a6 black prevents in fact any piece from taking position at b5. Which is positive because Sicilian often ends up in a race between white and black. White attacking the kings side. Black attacking the queens side. 5...-a6 prepares that attack for black"

11,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"Number of choices for white here:
6.Be3 is usually followed by e5. This is the main line and the easiest for white since he only needs to get the queen out of the way to d2 to castle on the queens side. Off course he will first need to move the knight from d4 to a more passive square. The attack for white continues then by playing f3 followed by g4. I believe that when you don't play the Dragon Sicilian, you shouldn't be to afraid of the pawn storm by white on the kings side.
6. Bg5 or Bc4 is followed by e6. The only reason I can think of, is that both moves gain a certain control over d5. Bc4 directly, and Bg5 by pinning the knight.
You don't want that square to be weak in the first opening moves. So you play e6"

Trying to prevent b5 by playing a4 is not a good option, I'd say.
It would result in: 7.a4-Nxe4 8.Nxe4-d5 9.bxd5-Qxd5. White has now 2 knights in the centre, but no pawns and those knights can be easily chased by playing f5 somewhere down the line.

But white is going to play f4 and Qf3. So you want to have played b5 and your knight to c5 by then. 
White's idea is to push the pawn on the f-line further up the board. You want to be ahead of him with your pawn on the b-line. Playing Nc5 also keeps pressure on whites pawn on e4."

Sometimes chess does not have to be difficult. Develop your pieces into a strong position and make your opponent loose tempos by keeping the pressure on his weaker points.
If you don't see the attack immediately, position your pieces on easy defensible squares, and wait for your opponent to create the opening. Off course this is situation dependent. If you wait too long your opponent has an advantage in the end game"
