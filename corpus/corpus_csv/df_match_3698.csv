1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hey all! This begins as the uncommon Fraser Variation of the Latvian Gambit, but quickly veers into territory I've never seen before. White makes an unusual choice on move six, and together we explore the resulting variations. Enjoy!"
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,?! The key move of the Latvian Gambit. Black gives up a pawn (and generally more) in exchange for open lines and a developmental advantage.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,?! The key move of the Latvian Gambit. Black gives up a pawn (and generally more) in exchange for open lines and a developmental advantage.
4,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,?! The key move of the Latvian Gambit. Black gives up a pawn (and generally more) in exchange for open lines and a developmental advantage.
5,Nxe5,f3e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4Np2/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"?! The Fraser Variation, hoping somewhat naively for 4.Nxc6 dxc6 with great potential for Black."
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/2n5/4Np2/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,"?! The Fraser Variation, hoping somewhat naively for 4.Nxc6 dxc6 with great potential for Black."
7,Qh5+,d1h5,r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/2n5/4Np1Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 2 4,"This is the standard continuation. After 4...g6 5.Nxg6 Nf6 the line splits between 6.Qh3 and 6.Qh4, each with its own very sharp variations. I believe I have some annotated games in each of these lines."
8,g6,g7g6,r1bqkbnr/pppp3p/2n3p1/4Np1Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"?! I have never seen this before, and cannot find literature to support it. Intuitively, it seems somewhat inferior, as it seems to allow Black to recoup most of his material losses and continue his development with tempo by chasing the WQ around. The question now, as it always is in the Latvian, is whether Black can find the right moves to do so without falling into a trap."
9,Nxg6,e5g6,r1bqkbnr/pppp3p/2n3N1/5p1Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"?! I have never seen this before, and cannot find literature to support it.

The question now, as it always is in the Latvian, is whether Black can find the right moves to do so without falling into a trap."
10,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp3p/2n2nN1/5p1Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 1 6,"?! I have never seen this before, and cannot find literature to support it. Intuitively, it seems somewhat inferior, as it seems to allow Black to recoup most of his material losses and continue his development with tempo by chasing the WQ around. The question now, as it always is in the Latvian, is whether Black can find the right moves to do so without falling into a trap."
11,Qxf5,h5f5,r1bqkb1r/pppp3p/2n2nN1/5Q2/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"?! I have never seen this before, and cannot find literature to support it.

12,d5,d7d5,r1bqkb1r/ppp4p/2n2nN1/3p1Q2/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"This seems logical. Perhaps 6...d6 is a bit safer, but there's no point playing an aggressive opening and then trying to be safe about it."
13,Qg5,f5g5,r1bqkb1r/ppp4p/2n2nN1/3p2Q1/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 1 7,? The Knight cannot really be defended; this move invites Black to develop his Rook to the open g-file. More direct was perhaps 7.Qf3 or 7.Qf4.
14,Rg8,h8g8,r1bqkbr1/ppp4p/2n2nN1/3p2Q1/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQq - 2 8,"Hoping perhaps to bait Black into playing 8...Bd7, losing the d-pawn. Otherwise, this allows Qe5+, but after that I don't see any real threats at White's disposal, and he'll be even further behind in development."
15,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbr1/ppp4p/2n2nN1/1B1p2Q1/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQq - 3 8,"Hoping perhaps to bait Black into playing 8...Bd7, losing the d-pawn. Otherwise, this allows Qe5+, but after that I don't see any real threats at White's disposal, and he'll be even further behind in development."
16,Rxg6,g8g6,r1bqkb2/ppp4p/2n2nr1/1B1p2Q1/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQq - 0 9,"? Black's position is a bit ugly, but it's also rock-solid. White, on the other hand, has hardly any active pieces and has just created huge kingside holes at f3 and h3. 10.Rg1 was a better, if terribly passive, way to defend the g-pawn."
17,Qe5+,g5e5,r1bqkb2/ppp4p/2n2nr1/1B1pQ3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQq - 1 9,"? Black's position is a bit ugly, but it's also rock-solid. White, on the other hand, has hardly any active pieces and has just created huge kingside holes at f3 and h3. 10.Rg1 was a better, if terribly passive, way to defend the g-pawn."
18,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk3/ppp1b2p/2n2nr1/1B1pQ3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQq - 2 10,"? Black's position is a bit ugly, but it's also rock-solid. White, on the other hand, has hardly any active pieces and has just created huge kingside holes at f3 and h3. 10.Rg1 was a better, if terribly passive, way to defend the g-pawn."
19,g3,g2g3,r1bqk3/ppp1b2p/2n2nr1/1B1pQ3/4P3/6P1/PPPP1P1P/RNB1K2R b KQq - 0 10,"? Black's position is a bit ugly, but it's also rock-solid. White, on the other hand, has hardly any active pieces and has just created huge kingside holes at f3 and h3. 10.Rg1 was a better, if terribly passive, way to defend the g-pawn."
20,dxe4,d5e4,r1bqk3/ppp1b2p/2n2nr1/1B2Q3/4p3/6P1/PPPP1P1P/RNB1K2R w KQq - 0 11,"Taking the opportunity to destroy White's claim to the center and restrict the d-pawn, and therefore also White's QB."
21,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqk3/ppp1b2p/2n2nr1/1B2Q3/4p3/2N3P1/PPPP1P1P/R1B1K2R b KQq - 1 11,If now 12.Nxe4?? Nxe5 13.Bxd7+ Bxd7 and Black is unstoppable.
22,Qd7,d8d7,r1b1k3/pppqb2p/2n2nr1/1B2Q3/4p3/2N3P1/PPPP1P1P/R1B1K2R w KQq - 2 12,If now 12.Nxe4?? Nxe5 13.Bxd7+ Bxd7 and Black is unstoppable.
23,Bxc6,b5c6,r1b1k3/pppqb2p/2B2nr1/4Q3/4p3/2N3P1/PPPP1P1P/R1B1K2R b KQq - 0 12,"White wants to keep his centralized Queen, but trading off his other active pieces isn't helping his development any."
24,Qxc6,d7c6,r1b1k3/ppp1b2p/2q2nr1/4Q3/4p3/2N3P1/PPPP1P1P/R1B1K2R w KQq - 0 13,"Avoiding a nasty discovered attack from ...e3. Again, this should have been played on move ten to save time."
25,Rg1,h1g1,r1b1k3/ppp1b2p/2q2nr1/4Q3/4p3/2N3P1/PPPP1P1P/R1B1K1R1 b Qq - 1 13,"Avoiding a nasty discovered attack from ...e3. Again, this should have been played on move ten to save time."
26,Bg4,c8g4,r3k3/ppp1b2p/2q2nr1/4Q3/4p1b1/2N3P1/PPPP1P1P/R1B1K1R1 w Qq - 2 14,"Black's development is nearly complete, this Bishop will be nearly impossible to remove, and as a result White will now have a hard time getting his King out of the center."
27,b3,b2b3,r3k3/ppp1b2p/2q2nr1/4Q3/4p1b1/1PN3P1/P1PP1P1P/R1B1K1R1 b Qq - 0 14,"The Bishop is not sacrificed, as 15.Qxe7 Qxc3! 16. Rb1 maintains Black's advantage just fine (16.dxc3?? Rd1#)."
28,O-O-O,e8c8,2kr4/ppp1b2p/2q2nr1/4Q3/4p1b1/1PN3P1/P1PP1P1P/R1B1K1R1 w Q - 1 15,"The Bishop is not sacrificed, as 15.Qxe7 Qxc3! 16. Rb1 maintains Black's advantage just fine (16.dxc3?? Rd1#)."
29,Bb2,c1b2,2kr4/ppp1b2p/2q2nr1/4Q3/4p1b1/1PN3P1/PBPP1P1P/R3K1R1 b Q - 2 15,"? 15.Qxe7 was correct here, as the seemingly-dangerous response 15...Qxc3?? (thinking 16.dxc3 Rd1#) is actually terrible for Black, as White may respond with 16.Qxd8+ Kxd8 17.dxc3 and White will win. I missed this continuation in the game (and in this annotation until dragon_checkmate pointed it out to me); luckily for me so did White!"
30,Bf3,g4f3,2kr4/ppp1b2p/2q2nr1/4Q3/4p3/1PN2bP1/PBPP1P1P/R3K1R1 w Q - 3 16,"?? This move is fine in general, making sure the Bishop is completely unassailable and preventing the WK from ever escaping to g2, but Black offers up his DSB for no solid reason. 15...Bc5 would have been stronger, I think."
31,Qxe7,e5e7,2kr4/ppp1Q2p/2q2nr1/8/4p3/1PN2bP1/PBPP1P1P/R3K1R1 b Q - 0 16,"White does not overlook it this time. Black must make full use of his mobility to produce a winning attack before White can consolidate. With the Bishop out of the way and the WK stuck in the center, opening and abusing the e- and d-files looks like the most effective method of attack."
32,Nd5,f6d5,2kr4/ppp1Q2p/2q3r1/3n4/4p3/1PN2bP1/PBPP1P1P/R3K1R1 w Q - 1 17,Black sacrifices the h-pawn in an attempt to draw the WQ away from her defensive duties.
33,Nxd5,c3d5,2kr4/ppp1Q2p/2q3r1/3N4/4p3/1P3bP1/PBPP1P1P/R3K1R1 b Q - 0 17,"I think this move is questionable, but I don't really see any better options. Taking on h7 seems pretty risky, but the text hands Black a d-file battery on a silver platter, so..."
