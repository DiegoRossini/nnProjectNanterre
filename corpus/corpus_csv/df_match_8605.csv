1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everybody, this time it is my opponent who resigns when faced with seemingly unavoidable mate and a strong attack.  The game seems to move very slowly and quietly until I decide to mount a kingside attack late on in the game down the g file.  Queen Glenda threatens mate but I believe it can be stopped.  You the jury may have different ideas.  Anyhow.  This game starts off with a classical Ruy Lopez."
