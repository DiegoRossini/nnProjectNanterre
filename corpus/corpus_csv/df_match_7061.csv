1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This is a semi tarrash setup. Black will end up with a isolated d-pawn. The theory is that this pawn is more of a liability than a assets. Of course that all depends on who you are talking too. Some players do like the isolated pawn because if it can not be effectively blockaded it can be a one man wrecking crew.

9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/5np1/2pp4/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"a sharp sortie that invites black into murky waters. If black plays 8. ...Nxb4 then white will win the past d5 pawn. The point of 8. b4 is that black can not afford to allow white to fortify c5. I had this move played against me in a similar position but in that game White did not get much out of it.

31,e4,e3e4,r3k2B/pp5p/2n2pp1/2bn4/4P3/P4N2/5PPP/R3K2R b KQq - 0 16,the idea is to push the knight to a less ideal square and bring the bishop back into the game via Bxf6
