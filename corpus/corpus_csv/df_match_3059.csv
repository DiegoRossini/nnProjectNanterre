1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Ardin (Sonata) was trying to get his revenge against me for his defeat in the Allgaier Gambit.  Ardin plays a good solid game until something happens and he loses the exchange.  After this I spend a lot of time contemplating just how I am gonna convert this advantage into a victory.  Then, I had a lightbulb moment and unfortunately for Ardin, he was hit by a Glenda generated bolt of white lightening!  So, how does this happen, well read on."

I thought, he was absolutely right.  Then I got my lightening moment.  I realised that Glenda could now plonk herself on c6, threatening Ardin's rook.  In fact, looking even more closely, that rook cannot be saved due to a queen fork on c7 if the rook moves to b8.  I then made that move.  Ardin sees that he will be 8 points down on material two moves down the line and so, on the grounds of ruinous loss of material he decided to resign! Commiserations Ardin and good luck in your other games!  Kind regards - Joanne"
