1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

After founding my new club I ended up playing a few games with my fellow Runners (Experts), one of those was Torsten.  I acquainted him with Operation Joblock - I gave him no opportunities of ingress and even put his queenside under a bit of pressure which was enough to prompt him to hit the Offer Draw button - and to result in an equally prompt acceptance - 4 rating points gladly gained there!  So how did all this happen?  Please read the comment in the annotation."
