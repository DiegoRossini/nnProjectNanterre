Most certainly don't want to move Nxe4 as white would surely follow with Bxg7 and taking on h6 the following move giving white much better board positioning.

I honestly didn't see the Qg5 possibility until reviewing the game so I was in panic mode to move to b6 and was pleasantly pleased at the time with white not taking my c pawn.
