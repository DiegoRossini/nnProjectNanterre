1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"THE LOST GAMES SERIES: This begins my series of annotations I have been meaning to start for a while now that is inspired by a quote from Mikhail Tal that went -not verbatim- ""I never learned anything from a game I won"". Also, want to do more annotations as I have been reading a lot of them lately and see them as beneficial to my goal to improve my analysis skills, which I really have little of.

it was a quickly played game for the most part and at 54 moves this game went on much longer than I prefer to play."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Been doing the Vienna Game after watching some Youtube videos on it. Like the way it can lead into a sort of King's Gambit game and prefer the way develop as opposed to knight f3 on the second move. Not better than just prefer it is all.

4,Bc5,f8c5,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,Usually prefer black to move out one of his knights here and actually get annoyed at this move. Why?
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 3,It makes me do something other than my preferred line of pawn to E4 and then the Vienna Gambit which is a close cousin of the King's Gambit which I have played many games of and so am not too lost inside its weird little world. But here I just want to end the pressure on F2 ASAP.

I do not think it is a great move and regret I did not just move my knight to D4 for some variation even if it is a bad move in the big picture."
9,Nf3,e5f3,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/2b5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,Back to F3 and...

I know trading for equal material can be necessary in a game, but if I had a dollar for every time this has happened within about the first six moves of a game I would have, well, quite a few dollars. I think black just sees killing off the knight as beneficial to himself later in the game. I would imagine if he could at least get an extra pawn out of the trade it would be advantageous. I can only think this is the ""clear the board of pieces"" strategy, which usually leads into a long boring game. But wherever you find chess you find this move."

It often leads to a loss of the queen for black after white has castled and the rook moves to E1 (often with black not moving his queen as he is so focused on that pawn) or a queen trade, which I do not like."
