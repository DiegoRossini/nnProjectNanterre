3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"According to the GK-database, we're playing a Sicilian, Nimzovich-Rossolimo attack (without ...d6)."

6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,Heading for an attack on e4..
7,d3,d2d3,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/1Bp5/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,"The first ""test"". In previous days, I would be in major stress, and would play a minor move like 5. c3 or something. But beware, the white-squared bishop is attacked. So the only move to defend both my king and bishop would be 5. Nc3 !"
8,Qa5+,d8a5,r1b1kb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/qBp5/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 5,"The first ""test"". In previous days, I would be in major stress, and would play a minor move like 5. c3 or something.

9,Nc3,b1c3,r1b1kb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/qBp5/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 5,As said..
10,Nd4,c6d4,r1b1kb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/qBp5/3nP3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 3 6,"Ok, this is some other level then what I'm used to play. Black is taking the initiative as soon as he has the opportunity !"
11,Bc4,b5c4,r1b1kb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/q1p5/2BnP3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 4 6,"The ""only"" good move.. 7. Bd5 Nxd5 would result in a doubled pawn (8. exd5), because 8. Nxd5 is no option, since it is pinned toward my king, by his queen."
12,b5,b7b5,r1b1kb1r/p2ppppp/5n2/qpp5/2BnP3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"The ""only"" good move.. 7. Bd5 Nxd5 would result in a doubled pawn (8. exd5), because 8. Nxd5 is no option, since it is pinned toward my king, by his queen."

14,Nxb3,d4b3,r1b1kb1r/p2ppppp/5n2/qpp5/4P3/1nNP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,Sure ! Darknite13 is choosing for a pawn-storm on the queenside. And what's a better way than making a doubled pawn in your opponent's pawn-chain ?
15,cxb3,c2b3,r1b1kb1r/p2ppppp/5n2/qpp5/4P3/1PNP1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,I can't play 8. axb3 because my rook is unprotected.
16,b4,b5b4,r1b1kb1r/p2ppppp/5n2/q1p5/1p2P3/1PNP1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,"Gaining space and place.. See what weaknesses black is making in white's position, just by a queen, a knight and two pawns !"
17,Ne2,c3e2,r1b1kb1r/p2ppppp/5n2/q1p5/1p2P3/1P1P1N2/PP2NPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 9,"Probably the best option, although it's not my favourite (a place on c4 would suite the knight well !).
Na4 is too passive, and Nb1 is back to start.. But ok, from Nb1, I could play Nd2 -> Nc4 with an outpost on the desired place. But that would cost me 2 moves. Do I have that time ??"
18,Bb7,c8b7,r3kb1r/pb1ppppp/5n2/q1p5/1p2P3/1P1P1N2/PP2NPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 10,"This was the best option, I guess.. Doing a developing move (like Be3 for example) wasn't yet the time. King's safety is priority number one."
19,O-O,e1g1,r3kb1r/pb1ppppp/5n2/q1p5/1p2P3/1P1P1N2/PP2NPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 3 10,"This was the best option, I guess.. Doing a developing move (like Be3 for example) wasn't yet the time. King's safety is priority number one."
20,d5,d7d5,r3kb1r/pb2pppp/5n2/q1pp4/1p2P3/1P1P1N2/PP2NPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 11,"Black is showing he has no fear to open up my center. Note how his dark-coloured bishop isn't developed yet, so are his king and rooks."
21,exd5,e4d5,r3kb1r/pb2pppp/5n2/q1pP4/1p6/1P1P1N2/PP2NPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 11,Probably the best move to do.. 11. e5 Nd7  and I would get in trouble by defending that e-pawn.
22,Nxd5,f6d5,r3kb1r/pb2pppp/8/q1pn4/1p6/1P1P1N2/PP2NPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 12,"Some room is needed in white's position. So I'm willing to exchange some pieces, to finally have some kind of development.."
23,Nf4,e2f4,r3kb1r/pb2pppp/8/q1pn4/1p3N2/1P1P1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 12,"Some room is needed in white's position. So I'm willing to exchange some pieces, to finally have some kind of development.."

25,Nxd5,f4d5,r3kb1r/pb3ppp/4p3/q1pN4/1p6/1P1P1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 13,"Exchanging a piece and, in meanwhile, making room for my only bishop."

Re1+, where black should be forced to defend (although for only 1-2 moves, but it would give me a little more time to develop my pieces)."
27,Be3,c1e3,r3kb1r/p4ppp/4p3/q1pb4/1p6/1P1PBN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 1 14,"As said, doing some development! My pieces aren't really active, so I need to take care of that. Maybe bringing a rook and/or Queen to the c-file.."
28,Bd6,f8d6,r3k2r/p4ppp/3bp3/q1pb4/1p6/1P1PBN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 2 15,As predicted..
