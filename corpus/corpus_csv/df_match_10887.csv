We had played that line a few times, and this game I felt like trying something new."

Qb6 may be fine for black as it's difficult for me to use the fact that his queen's in the open, 7... b4 is met by 8.Nb1 where the c4 pawn is quite ugly."

This is probably unsound, but here's my justification for such a wild move.  a) look at his pawns, they're really ugly.  They're advance or isolated, and either way they're ripe for the picking.  b) I want to support my h pawn and f5 locked me out of the kingside, with this move I bring my queen over to support it's advance.  c)  His king is in the middle of the board with no pawn protection, and his pieces are undeveloped."

Nd7 is killed by 19.axb5 where he simply can't take back and I threaten to take on c6.  19... axb5 20.Rxa8 Bxa8 21.Qg8 ! where I skewer the king and knight on b8.  If the queen blocks I get the h7 rook."
