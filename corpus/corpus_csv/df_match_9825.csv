I am aware it gives the white squares bishop, but it opens the h column (while I normally try to castle queenside, but if I can, I never got in troubles even with the h column open, because it takes white a long time to build up an attack on the kingside).

The idea is that white is virtually blocked here. My white square bishop can eventually go to f7, his f3 knight cannot jump into the center, and my knight are free to develop in e7 and d7. I am on a defensive scheme, I know, but I am playing with black pieces against a 1900! :-)
Afterwards, I plan to start advancing pawns either on the king or queen side, depends on where he castles. Note that I can push in very few moves g5, a5, g4... I am not afraid to leave my king in the center or even to castle queenside!

""Not a good move, The knight belongs here because of the center.  He must put pressure on e4 and d5.  And you must clear the back rank for castling.	 """
