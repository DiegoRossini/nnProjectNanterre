1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,So he plays the English against the England captain!
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"I give him the chance to go back to more common lines with 2.d4, but he keeps it to an English."
3,g3,g2g3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2P5/6P1/PP1PPP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Against a weaker opponent I may have tried to play an Open Sicilian Reversed with e5 and d5, but I didn't fancy trying that against a stronger player."
4,e5,e7e5,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2P5/6P1/PP1PPP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,I stake a claim to some central control
5,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2P5/6P1/PP1PPPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 3,He continues logically
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2P5/6P1/PP1PPPBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 4,So I partly block his Bg2
7,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2P5/2N3P1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 3 4,He again develops logically
8,d6,d7d6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4p3/2P5/2N3P1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,"Afterwards I found out that Bb4, Bc5 and g6 were all more popular moves and scored better. However I didn't really know those lines."
9,e4,e2e4,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4p3/2P1P3/2N3P1/PP1P1PBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,This came as a bit of a surprise. He leaves himself with a hole on d4 into which my knight could jump. On the other hand if he can get in d2-d4 he has a strong centre.
10,g6,g7g6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2p1p/2np1np1/4p3/2P1P3/2N3P1/PP1P1PBP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,So I thought by putting my bishop on g7 may put him off playing d2-d4
11,Nge2,g1e2,r1bqkb1r/ppp2p1p/2np1np1/4p3/2P1P3/2N3P1/PP1PNPBP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"So he threatens d2-d4. Now in this position, black has played Bg7 71 times and Be6 two times. Now what I played I think is better than Be6 immediately, because I entice him to play f3, which partially blocks his Bg2."
12,Bg4,c8g4,r2qkb1r/ppp2p1p/2np1np1/4p3/2P1P1b1/2N3P1/PP1PNPBP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 7,So I play this.
13,f3,f2f3,r2qkb1r/ppp2p1p/2np1np1/4p3/2P1P1b1/2N2PP1/PP1PN1BP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,He blocks the pin on his knight.
14,Be6,g4e6,r2qkb1r/ppp2p1p/2npbnp1/4p3/2P1P3/2N2PP1/PP1PN1BP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 8,"and I retreat my bishop, hitting the Pc4"
15,d3,d2d3,r2qkb1r/ppp2p1p/2npbnp1/4p3/2P1P3/2NP1PP1/PP2N1BP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,"Which he protects, postponing d2-d4"
16,Bg7,f8g7,r2qk2r/ppp2pbp/2npbnp1/4p3/2P1P3/2NP1PP1/PP2N1BP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 9,So I develop
17,Be3,c1e3,r2qk2r/ppp2pbp/2npbnp1/4p3/2P1P3/2NPBPP1/PP2N1BP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 2 9,He develops
18,O-O,e8g8,r2q1rk1/ppp2pbp/2npbnp1/4p3/2P1P3/2NPBPP1/PP2N1BP/R2QK2R w KQ - 3 10,I castle
19,Qd2,d1d2,r2q1rk1/ppp2pbp/2npbnp1/4p3/2P1P3/2NPBPP1/PP1QN1BP/R3K2R b KQ - 4 10,What is he doing? Is he really planning on 0-0-0 and a king side attack. Ok lets prepare for that....
20,a6,a7a6,r2q1rk1/1pp2pbp/p1npbnp1/4p3/2P1P3/2NPBPP1/PP1QN1BP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 11,Now 0-0-0 is met by b5 and my attack gets in first.
