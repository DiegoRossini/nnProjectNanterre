10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/3bpn2/3pN3/3P1B2/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQ - 3 6,Black accepts.
11,g4,g2g4,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/3bpn2/3pN3/3P1BP1/4P3/PPP2P1P/RN1QKB1R b KQ - 0 6,"The older and sharpest plan: as a well experienced player must know, this is somewhat premature, and black can meet it. Nevertheless, it's always a good way to make your opponent think."
12,Nc6,b8c6,r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2nbpn2/3pN3/3P1BP1/4P3/PPP2P1P/RN1QKB1R w KQ - 1 7,"I want my Q out, so I have to kick the N."

As an emergency savior, I had Bg3, but I prefer not to play it (e.g. NxBg3, hxg3? Qxf2+. As long as e3 is defended and the R defends Bf1, I can even let black play it!)"
