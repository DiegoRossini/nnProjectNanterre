From here, it's easy to assess how the game will eventually progress.  As soon as both sides castle and develop all their pieces, black will pile up on the c-file while white does so on the d-file.  Because of this slight imbalance, black generally makes progress on the queen side, but white is able to retain flexibility and play on either side."
