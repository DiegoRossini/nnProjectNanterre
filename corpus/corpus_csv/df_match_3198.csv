1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi all, this is recent game I played in Jo's welcome NÂº3 mini-tournament. It is interesting mainly for the final position, I'm not able (since I have no chess engine) to tell if it was won or not, and I would like some advice."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"This was a mistake. The theory about Icelandic gambit says Nf6 first, hoping for white to move the c or d pawn. Now, it is premature."

5,dxe6,d5e6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4P3/8/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"Because of this move, that shields white about all the tactics that arise after d4 or c4 are played. It's not a disaster, but now the gambit is not all that exciting anymore."

8,Nf6,g8f6,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4bn2/8/8/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,My opponent doesn't take advantage of the free tempo to develop a piece.

10,Bd6,f8d6,rn1qk2r/ppp2ppp/3bbn2/8/8/3P3P/PPP2PP1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,"Bc4 is kind of pointless, since no serious threat can be put on f2 in a short time."
11,Nf3,g1f3,rn1qk2r/ppp2ppp/3bbn2/8/8/3P1N1P/PPP2PP1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 6,"I can play this in order to get some control of the center, open the lines for my queen, get out the b8 knight without blocking my c pawn, and since little attack can be performed on the a4-e8 white diagonal by white because of d3."
12,c5,c7c5,rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/3bbn2/2p5/8/3P1N1P/PPP2PP1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"I can play this in order to get some control of the center, open the lines for my queen, get out the b8 knight without blocking my c pawn, and since little attack can be performed on the a4-e8 white diagonal by white because of d3."
