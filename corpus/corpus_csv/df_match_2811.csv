1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"So they open with this, Nf3. An unusual opening, I don't encounter it very much around the people I play with often. I decide to respond with..."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,"...because normally if they try to deter an e pawn advancement, the d pawn is normally a much better option."
3,a4,a2a4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/P7/5N2/1PPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,"(?!) - But then here... see, when opponents usually do this move, or something similar, they're deliberately trying to look foolish most of the time. e6 is really tempting me here. A lot of beginners open with 1 a4?!, e5! 2. Ra3?? Bxa3! I really didn't expect a player on Gameknot to do this, so I was left to think for quite a bit. Not knowing where the player wanted to take me with this opening, I thought really hard about both Nc6, Nf3, or e6. I saw d4 or e3 coming if I did Nc6. e3 would at least allow me a6 to deter a possible attack on my king's diagonal, but I didn't have much to say against d4 after Nc6. Nf6 seems to be mostly a developer, as I can't do e5 yet, though I really want to. e6 right now shuts in my light bishop a little prematurely. But that's when I saw c5, and wondered about an early attack on d4 being able to work well with Nc6."
4,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/P7/5N2/1PPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"It looked like my best move, but I wasn't happy doing it. As of only the second move, I'm trying an opening I have absolutely no familiarity with. Ah, the thrill of exploration! Of course, being a person who likes to know EVERYTHING, heh, I was anything but comfortable by this point. On the brighter side, I had plans in motion, but all of it depended on what their next move would be..."
5,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/P7/4PN2/1PPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"They probably want to threaten Bb5+ to exchange back pieces, and opening O-O with tempo, while making d4 all that much more stronger. a6 will be met with d4, and Nc6 likely with Bb5. I also saw that I could slow White down from moving the bishop by advancing my c pawn, but I hated how open and underdeveloped I was at this point. On the bright side... their dark bishop also seems to have closed up significantly."
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2pp4/P7/4PN2/1PPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,"Yes... Nf6! Of course! Now my kingside isn't as grossly underdeveloped, and Bg5, if it will even be a threat at this point, won't be happening anytime soon. d4 can be met with e6, opening the DSB, and I have more options against Bb5+. Now I'm left asking- if I were White in this game, how would I respond?"
7,Ne5,f3e5,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2ppN3/P7/4P3/1PPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,"I considered Ne5, purely because it was an open spot for the knight. But I had to wonder if this was best for White. Yes, the square is open, but it seems to be asking for much. Qh5 is already deterred, and the only good square for the LSB is b5. Plus, that knight looks like a sitting duck. It pretty much only seems to be there to threaten both the d and f squares on the 7th rank."
8,Qd6,d8d6,rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/3q1n2/2ppN3/P7/4P3/1PPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 3 5,"It's either I attack with Qd6, or I defend with a6. If they want to do Nxf7, they're going to do it either way. And at least this way, the queen is developed, instead of being closed in if I have to send either knight or the bishop toward d7. And, the bishop check didn't scare me too much here."
9,Bb5+,f1b5,rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/3q1n2/1BppN3/P7/4P3/1PPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 4 5,"-but they do it anyway! Probably just so they can castle and slow me down a little, but this could mean they lose a powerful knight. Of course, if they don't want to finish the trade now, I'm perfectly fine with that."
10,Nbd7,b8d7,r1b1kb1r/pp1npppp/3q1n2/1BppN3/P7/4P3/1PPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 5 6,"It's either this or Bd7. Not Nfd7 as it is more developed. I want them to trade, or move the knight."
11,d4,d2d4,r1b1kb1r/pp1npppp/3q1n2/1BppN3/P2P4/4P3/1PP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"(!) - But they're more interested in increasing the gambit. I'm not overly worried at the moment, but I'm really wishing for a bit more experience with this opening. How can I break this attack?"
12,e6,e7e6,r1b1kb1r/pp1n1ppp/3qpn2/1BppN3/P2P4/4P3/1PP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"In the end, I decided that the queen-bishop team was slightly more favorable than a bishop chase. Was there a stronger move to be made here?"
13,Nc3,b1c3,r1b1kb1r/pp1n1ppp/3qpn2/1BppN3/P2P4/2N1P3/1PP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,(?!) - Why are they developing? Or are they actually just trying to contest d5? (Or prevent Ne4? But why even bother?)
14,Be7,f8e7,r1b1k2r/pp1nbppp/3qpn2/1BppN3/P2P4/2N1P3/1PP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 8,"I tried. I couldn't find a problem with Nc3, and (e4, dxc5, Nxd7, Bxd7+, etc) all look like preventable moves at this point. If this is my chance to break the pins and castle, I'll gladly take it now. At least that will undermine the pressure on my e file (after his O-O) and the pin on the d knight."
15,Qf3,d1f3,r1b1k2r/pp1nbppp/3qpn2/1BppN3/P2P4/2N1PQ2/1PP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 3 8,"Looks like White wants d5 after all. I can kinda see what they want out of the queen here. She's in a square where damage can be done on both the d5 and f7 pawns if I'm not careful about them. On the other hand, cxd4 is starting to look really good now, and I wonder what White plans to do if Black follows through with freeing the knight."
16,O-O,e8g8,r1b2rk1/pp1nbppp/3qpn2/1BppN3/P2P4/2N1PQ2/1PP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 4 9,"(!) - At last, a position I'm comfortable with! Now my king is snug in the corner, with lots of options. All my pins are gone, the pressure on the e file is off, and now it is White who cannot castle yet. If O-O, then I could start a battle for the centre that I will win. White must first address the threat of me doing that before they can hide their king away just yet..."
17,dxc5,d4c5,r1b2rk1/pp1nbppp/3qpn2/1BPpN3/P7/2N1PQ2/1PP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 0 9,(??) - That's surprising. Do they really not see it? That was a straight up blunder for White.
18,Qxe5,d6e5,r1b2rk1/pp1nbppp/4pn2/1BPpq3/P7/2N1PQ2/1PP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 0 10,"The d pawn was the piece that caused me so much grief in this game BECAUSE it protected the knight that wouldn't allow me an active e pawn right from the start. It gets worse, too. Now the center is under heavy attack, and I have strong threats against both the e and c pawns. Above all other moves, White should not have done dxc5. (Well, there are worse blunders to make, right? :P)"
19,Qh3,f3h3,r1b2rk1/pp1nbppp/4pn2/1BPpq3/P7/2N1P2Q/1PP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 1 10,"Now they are just losing a full knight for nothing. Even if they retreat the bishop to d3, the knight is guarding the critical h square. The attack is easily guarded against; the WQ is mostly just helping the kingside pawns for the time being."
20,d4,d5d4,r1b2rk1/pp1nbppp/4pn2/1BP1q3/P2p4/2N1P2Q/1PP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 0 11,"Black is now fully exploiting the poor pinned e pawn. It doesn't matter if White decides to trade away the LSB; they are still forced to move the knight away (most likely to e2) and lose the pawn. And again- unless White is suicidal, the king cannot escape to g1 yet. Thus concludes the opening."
