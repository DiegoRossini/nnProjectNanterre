1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"As always, my standard."
2,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Oh no......another Dutch player. As I really hate playing against the Dutch, I decide to try to get black out of his book as quickly as possible. Once I play 2.c4 to gain space and clear a square for my Nb1, I have every intention of avoiding main lines."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Interesting. I usually run across Dutch players who follow the Leningrad Variation (1.d4 f5 2. c4 Nf6 3.g3 g6 4.Bg2 Bg7). 2...e6 is one of variants of another main line (whose name escapes me) which is 1.d4 f5 2.c4 Nf6 3.g3 e6 4.Bg2 (with altered move order). Black is obviously fluent in this opening, so I made the decision to attempt to throw him off starting on my 4th move. My intent is to develop my queen's knight and get my dark squared bishop to g5 in an attempt to start a pre-emptive attack. The problem with that idea is that I plan on totally disregarding the concept of getting my light squared bishop on it's natural long diagonal. My personal preference is that IF I'm going to fianchetto a bishop, it is going to be aiming AT the enemy king, not away from it. That is the main reason for my distaste of playing against the Dutch. I'm sure I'll pay for admitting that:)"

5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/4p3/5p2/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,Black sticks with his plan by developing and preparing to castle.
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp2pp/4pn2/5p2/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,Black sticks with his plan by developing and preparing to castle.
7,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/pppp2pp/4pn2/5pB1/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 3 4,"?! Probably not the most sound move, but as I said my intent was to get out of what was surely my opponent's preferred line."
8,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk2r/pppp2pp/4pn2/5pB1/1bPP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 4 5,"I would give black the slight edge here. He has developed nicely and is prepared to castle. His pin of my knight and kingside space make up for the ""weakness"" of what I assume will be his castled position."
9,Qc2,d1c2,rnbqk2r/pppp2pp/4pn2/5pB1/1bPP4/2N5/PPQ1PPPP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 5 5,An interesting idea. This move was made for three reasons - 1) my fear of having doubled pawns on the c file after Bb4xNc3 2) to have the ability to castle long (and QUICK if needed) and 3) my queen is now aimed at the side black will probably castle on and will be the anchor of my queenside expansion.
10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pppp2pp/4pn2/5pB1/1bPP4/2N5/PPQ1PPPP/R3KBNR w KQ - 6 6,Black has now secured his king and is ready for typical Dutch style development on the queenside.
11,a3,a2a3,rnbq1rk1/pppp2pp/4pn2/5pB1/1bPP4/P1N5/1PQ1PPPP/R3KBNR b KQ - 0 6,"?! Another somewhat dubious move. As the threat against his bishop must be dealt with, black must decide between three different options A) trade his bishop for my knight B) retreat the bishop to a5 (which is horrible because of 7.b4 Bb6 8.c5) or C) retreat the bishop back to e7 to interpose the pin."
12,Be7,b4e7,rnbq1rk1/ppppb1pp/4pn2/5pB1/2PP4/P1N5/1PQ1PPPP/R3KBNR w KQ - 1 7,"Black chooses wisely. However, white now gains a little time to get developed."
13,e3,e2e3,rnbq1rk1/ppppb1pp/4pn2/5pB1/2PP4/P1N1P3/1PQ2PPP/R3KBNR b KQ - 0 7,"At the time I considered this play to be a little slow. Upon analysis though, black now has the real threat of playing a very strong c5!"
14,d6,d7d6,rnbq1rk1/ppp1b1pp/3ppn2/5pB1/2PP4/P1N1P3/1PQ2PPP/R3KBNR w KQ - 0 8,"At the time I considered this play to be a little slow. Upon analysis though, black now has the real threat of playing a very strong c5!"
15,Be2,f1e2,rnbq1rk1/ppp1b1pp/3ppn2/5pB1/2PP4/P1N1P3/1PQ1BPPP/R3K1NR b KQ - 1 8,? A very slow play on my part. My Ng1 is now a potential problem.
16,e5,e6e5,rnbq1rk1/ppp1b1pp/3p1n2/4ppB1/2PP4/P1N1P3/1PQ1BPPP/R3K1NR w KQ - 0 9,! Black takes advantage of my passive play and takes the first swing of the match.
17,Bxf6,g5f6,rnbq1rk1/ppp1b1pp/3p1B2/4pp2/2PP4/P1N1P3/1PQ1BPPP/R3K1NR b KQ - 0 9,"The way I saw it, since my hopes of controlling the light squares was my only real chance of having ANY play, I decided to remove his knight since it controlled both d5 and e4."
18,Bxf6,e7f6,rnbq1rk1/ppp3pp/3p1b2/4pp2/2PP4/P1N1P3/1PQ1BPPP/R3K1NR w KQ - 0 10,Trying to close up the position while restricting black's Nb8.
19,d5,d4d5,rnbq1rk1/ppp3pp/3p1b2/3Ppp2/2P5/P1N1P3/1PQ1BPPP/R3K1NR b KQ - 0 10,Trying to close up the position while restricting black's Nb8.
20,Bd7,c8d7,rn1q1rk1/pppb2pp/3p1b2/3Ppp2/2P5/P1N1P3/1PQ1BPPP/R3K1NR w KQ - 1 11,?! Black makes a slow play of his own. I expected Nd7.
21,e4,e3e4,rn1q1rk1/pppb2pp/3p1b2/3Ppp2/2P1P3/P1N5/1PQ1BPPP/R3K1NR b KQ - 0 11,Hoping he takes so I can retake with 12.Nxe4 (threatening his Bf6)
22,fxe4,f5e4,rn1q1rk1/pppb2pp/3p1b2/3Pp3/2P1p3/P1N5/1PQ1BPPP/R3K1NR w KQ - 0 12,"! Oops, I didn't anticipate this. This pin on my queen must be dealt with."
23,Nxe4,c3e4,rn1q1rk1/pppb2pp/3p1b2/3Pp3/2P1N3/P7/1PQ1BPPP/R3K1NR b KQ - 0 12,"! Oops, I didn't anticipate this. This pin on my queen must be dealt with."
24,Bf5,d7f5,rn1q1rk1/ppp3pp/3p1b2/3Ppb2/2P1N3/P7/1PQ1BPPP/R3K1NR w KQ - 1 13,"! Oops, I didn't anticipate this. This pin on my queen must be dealt with."
25,Bd3,e2d3,rn1q1rk1/ppp3pp/3p1b2/3Ppb2/2P1N3/P2B4/1PQ2PPP/R3K1NR b KQ - 2 13,"! No problem. My light squared bishop gets a chance to make up for his earlier slow play by getting to where he should have been in the first place, and interposes the pin."
26,g6,g7g6,rn1q1rk1/ppp4p/3p1bp1/3Ppb2/2P1N3/P2B4/1PQ2PPP/R3K1NR w KQ - 0 14,"? I'm not quite sure what was intended by this move. Black has weakened his kingside further, for reasons unknown to me."
