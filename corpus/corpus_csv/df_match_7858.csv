1,g3,g2g3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/6P1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Has this ever happened to you?  You are a pawn up and about to exchange into an endgame.  You think you are winning but wham - your opponent really hits you with a whammy and it could be a double or a triple one.  Either way, it ends in a loss for you and worse your opponent's rating is south of you!  Well, could the ground please swallow me up here?  Anyhow, my opponent kicks off with 1. g3 and this transposes into the Benko Gambit."

Then that horrible horsie on d8 will go to f7 with check.  Henry must go to g8 and voila a discovery will lead to Fou Lenoir's demise for starties.  I therefore wave the white flag.  Sorry for the sour grapes but I do wish the ground would swallow me up here as I was well and truly caught napping.  Anyhow, Steve, take a bow.  If you play like this in other games then I see no reason why you should not have at least a 1700+ rating!  In the meantime I must get my brain into gear or I will lose all I worked for.  Anyhow, hope you have enjoyed your weekend - bye for now - Joanne"
