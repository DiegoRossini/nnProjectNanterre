7,b4,b2b4,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/1P6/5NP1/P1PPPPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,?? However I decide to mix things up straight away. I wanted to get us out of any positions my more experienced opponent might be familiar with however this drops a pawn to ...Nd5!
8,d5,d7d5,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3p4/1P6/5NP1/P1PPPPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,however my opponent is not paying close attention to the position and chucks out this move after thinking for about two seconds.

13,a3,a2a3,rnb1k2r/pp2ppbp/1qp2np1/3p4/1P6/P4NP1/1BPPPPBP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 0 7,I was thinking of playing Be5 here to see if black would consider a repetition however I couldn't find an answer to ...Qd8 where ...Nbd7 will be annoying.
14,a5,a7a5,rnb1k2r/1p2ppbp/1qp2np1/p2p4/1P6/P4NP1/1BPPPPBP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 0 8,I was thinking of playing Be5 here to see if black would consider a repetition however I couldn't find an answer to ...Qd8 where ...Nbd7 will be annoying.

18,O-O,e8g8,rnb2rk1/1pq1ppbp/2p2np1/p2p4/1P1B4/P2P1NP1/2P1PPBP/RN1Q1RK1 w - - 1 10,black prepares for his indicated e5 advance however I think black should have looked to develop his LSB before playing this.
