Paul Blum, that weird guy with a 629 rating that I played a few weeks ago, makes mistakes taking him out of accepted openings on the 2nd or 3rd move in every game he plays.  Your intuitive grasp of good opening moves is impressive.

Incidentally, this is the Slav Variation (the precise one that he erroneously thought that he was playing against me).

The slav is solid and fine for black and your instincts about how to develop your pieces in this opening are good - though once I start pressuring you had a hard time finding the optimal responses."

Taking my b pawn with your rook should have been a strong candidate for your move.   Every time its your move, you should see if you can take one of my pieces without my having recourse.  The b2 pawn is unguarded so you could have captured it.  however, I would have then played Bb3, and your rook is stuck on the 2nd rank.  It probably won't get captured, but it will be cramped.  So I don't really know if the capture was a good idea or not.  Maybe, maybe not.  Point is, these are the things you should have been thinking about."
