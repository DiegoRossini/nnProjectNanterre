1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"I used to play nf3 with (2)b3 to good effect many years ago in the wirral league, so thought i would give it a go against Charleshiggie"
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,so the fight for the centre begins...
3,b3,b2b3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/1P3N2/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,bet he wasn't expecting this? ..on with the plan
4,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/6b1/1P3N2/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 3,this move was never played against me in all my many years in the league playing this system! however running this game via the chess engines and the top level computers play this very move!!
5,Bb2,c1b2,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/6b1/1P3N2/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 2 3,naturally i want to own e5 even by blocking in my own dark bishop
6,Nd7,b8d7,r2qkbnr/pppnpppp/8/3p4/6b1/1P3N2/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 3 4,again the choice of the silicone...so my opponents 2 and 3rd move are very popular with computers ...
7,d4,d2d4,r2qkbnr/pppnpppp/8/3p4/3P2b1/1P3N2/PBP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,holding e5
