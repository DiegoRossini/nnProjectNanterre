7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/2Pp4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,Defend the advanced pawn. Game will revolve around protecting and advancing the d pawn.
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/4P3/2Pp4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,Defend the advanced pawn. Game will revolve around protecting and advancing the d pawn.
9,g3,g2g3,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/4P3/2Pp4/5NP1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,This I think is a mistake. Better was e3. Forcing an exchange dxe3 and Bxe3. That would neutralize the tension in the center and black has little compensation for the pawn sacrifice.
10,Be6,c8e6,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n1b3/4P3/2Pp4/5NP1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,Attack the c pawn. Protecting it is not easy. Only the Queen or b pawn can protect it. Neither option is very good.
11,Qb3,d1b3,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n1b3/4P3/2Pp4/1Q3NP1/PP2PP1P/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 2 6,This was not the best move. Among the 2 options b2-b3 was better. Queen gets squeezed in the corner limiting its ability to participate in the game.
12,Bb4+,f8b4,r2qk1nr/ppp2ppp/2n1b3/4P3/1bPp4/1Q3NP1/PP2PP1P/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 3 7,Basic idea is to prevent Qxb7. Do not want to move b67-b6 because the b pawn is defending the knight on c6. Another advantage is that it is attacking the king reducing Queen side pieces that can counter the pawn on d5. Yet another advantage is it helps the development on the King side. Goal is to castle quickly and the preference was to castle on the King side.
13,Bd2,c1d2,r2qk1nr/ppp2ppp/2n1b3/4P3/1bPp4/1Q3NP1/PP1BPP1P/RN2KB1R b KQkq - 4 7,"Recently in the candidates matches this move was often played to try and create an open file for the rook. So instead of BxB which would force black to defend the b pawn after the exchange, best to let the Q be blocked and hence a5."
14,a5,a7a5,r2qk1nr/1pp2ppp/2n1b3/p3P3/1bPp4/1Q3NP1/PP1BPP1P/RN2KB1R w KQkq - 0 8,"I think this was one of the better moves in the game. If 8. BxB, respond with NxB shutting out the queen further and forcing the queen to defend the c2 square from the Knight. I was worried a bit with a2-a3 but then responding with a5 is strong forcing the Queen away to either d1 or d3. Then the N can safely retreat to c6 to defend the d pawn without any worries of protecting the b pawn from the Queen."
15,Bg2,f1g2,r2qk1nr/1pp2ppp/2n1b3/p3P3/1bPp4/1Q3NP1/PP1BPPBP/RN2K2R b KQkq - 1 8,White is preparing to castle on the King side.

17,O-O,e1g1,r2qk2r/1pp1nppp/2n1b3/p3P3/1bPp4/1Q3NP1/PP1BPPBP/RN3RK1 b kq - 3 9,Not a very good move in my opinion setting the Night up to be discover attacked by the Queen. However protecting the Bishop on e6 is important and it allows the Bishop to move to f5. An excellent square for the Bishop. Because it blocks off a large number of squares along the b1 to h7 diagonal.
18,O-O,e8g8,r2q1rk1/1pp1nppp/2n1b3/p3P3/1bPp4/1Q3NP1/PP1BPPBP/RN3RK1 w - - 4 10,Not a very good move in my opinion setting the Night up to be discover attacked by the Queen.

23,Qa2,b3a2,r2q1rk1/1pp1nppp/2n5/4PbN1/pbPp4/P5P1/QP1BPPBP/RN3RK1 b - - 1 12,Again a big mistake by White here. The queen is now out of the game. Better was Q to d1 or Q f3.
24,Bxd2,b4d2,r2q1rk1/1pp1nppp/2n5/4PbN1/p1Pp4/P5P1/QP1bPPBP/RN3RK1 w - - 0 13,b7 pawn no longer attacked. Safe to move the block out.
25,Nxd2,b1d2,r2q1rk1/1pp1nppp/2n5/4PbN1/p1Pp4/P5P1/QP1NPPBP/R4RK1 b - - 0 13,This is a good move.  Attacking the pawn on e5 as well as a discovered attack on N on g5. Expecting f4 to defend both pieces. But then f4 would have double duty which could be exploited. However I missed a better move here which would be N to b4 which traps the Queen. I do not know why I missed that because I kept thinking that the white Queen has no square to go to since B is cutting off the b1 escape route. If I had not rushed I would have surely found it. I got excited about the discovered attack on the N on g5.  Clearly Nb4 was the best move here.
26,Ng6,e7g6,r2q1rk1/1pp2ppp/2n3n1/4PbN1/p1Pp4/P5P1/QP1NPPBP/R4RK1 w - - 1 14,This is a good move.  Attacking the pawn on e5 as well as a discovered attack on N on g5.

28,bxc6,b7c6,r2q1rk1/2p2ppp/2p3n1/4PbN1/p1Pp4/P5P1/QP1NPP1P/R4RK1 w - - 0 15,Aah. the expected move is made. The double duty on f4 to be exploited.
