1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,2........ f6?! (This is the Damiano's Defence) - I call it Dodgy Damiano's!  It's dodgy because it opens up the Fool's Mate Diagonal (h5-e8) and blocks in the king knight.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,2........ f6?! (This is the Damiano's Defence) - I call it Dodgy Damiano's!  It's dodgy because it opens up the Fool's Mate Diagonal (h5-e8) and blocks in the king knight.

5,Nxe5,f3e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,3. Nxe5 - I decide to play Damiano's Gambit.  It is quite sound because if fe?? then I will play 4. Qh5  which will lead to mate or ruinous loss of material for black.  Just play out the database and you will see!!
6,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pppp3p/5pp1/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,3. ......... g6?  An unusual way to decline the gambit.  It just loses a pawn.  Best is 3. ......... Qe7 which is the Macgregor-Chigorin Variation which regains the pawn but leads to retarded development.
7,Nf3,e5f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp3p/5pp1/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,5. Nc3 - develops a piece and defends the threatened e pawn.
