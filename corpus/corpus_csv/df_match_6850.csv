I have three options here. 6...Nxe4, 7. fxe4, dxe4 leaves me behind slightly in material, but with a passed pawn. However, at this stage of the game, a passed pawn isn't worth too much. 6...exd4 7.Qxd4 is bad, I have an isolated d pawn I can't support. If I take dxe4, then after 8.Qxd8, Kxd8, I've lost the right to castle and have a bad king position. If I play 6..dxe4, then it gets interesting. If 7. fxe4, Nxe4, then I'm up a pawn and have a knight trained on f2 and after playing Qf6 or Qh4, I have a mating threat. On the other hand, if he plays 7.dxe5..."

However, this move puts him in check and lets me retake on e5. Plus, if he plays b4 instead of Bd2, I can play Bb4+, and axb would be met with QxR."

Plus, it also threatens exf3+ which is huge trouble for white. At best, he loses his queen, (10. Qe2, fxe2) or a rook while I promote (10. Be2, fxg2, and then fxh1 with a promotion cannot be avoided.), while at worst he can get mated. (10.Kf2, Bc5, 11. Kf3, Bg4#, or 11.Bd3, Qd3, 12. Kg3, Bd6, 13. Kh4, g5#)"

If white doesn't take precautions, I can get a double attack of Qxg2 (which makes Qxh1 unavoidable), and exd2. However, both are foiled by Qe2, as it pins the e pawn to my king whilst defending the g pawn. So, I need additional preparation first."

If he tries playing 17.Kf1, then after 17...Qc4 18.Ne2, Qxe2+, 19.Kg1, he's trapped in the corner yet another piece down. (And not 18.Kf2 because of Ne4#.
