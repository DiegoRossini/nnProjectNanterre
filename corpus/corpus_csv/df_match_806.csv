1,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This is a training game with me and a new player to my over-the-board club! We live in neighbouring villages! I am annotating it to help him learn!
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"e3 is not a bad opening move. It makes it hard for black to attack f2, and prepares to develop the Bf1."
3,b3,b2b3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/1P2P3/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,This is not a bad follow-up either.
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/8/1P2P3/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,I take the centre.
5,Bb2,c1b2,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/8/1P2P3/PBPP1PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,He continues to develop - this is the logical follow-up to his previous move.
6,Bd6,f8d6,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3b4/3pp3/8/1P2P3/PBPP1PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,I protect the e5 pawn.
7,c4,c2c4,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3b4/3pp3/2P5/1P2P3/PB1P1PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"This is a good move, chipping away on the black centre."
8,c6,c7c6,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/2pb4/3pp3/2P5/1P2P3/PB1P1PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,So I protect d5.
9,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/2pb4/3Pp3/8/1P2P3/PB1P1PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"Taking isn't bad, but I think it improves black's position more than white, as now Nb8 can go to c6."
10,cxd5,c6d5,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/3b4/3pp3/8/1P2P3/PB1P1PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,I take back.
11,Qe2,d1e2,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/3b4/3pp3/8/1P2P3/PB1PQPPP/RN2KBNR b KQkq - 1 6,This is a truly dreadful move. It blocks the diagonal for the bishop. White shouldn't be thinking of developing the queen so early. Instead 6. Nc3 and Bb4+ have been played before.
12,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk1nr/pp3ppp/2nb4/3pp3/8/1P2P3/PB1PQPPP/RN2KBNR w KQkq - 2 7,"I play the knight out - partly because it is good development, but also because he was threatening to come to b5 with check."
13,Qb5,e2b5,r1bqk1nr/pp3ppp/2nb4/1Q1pp3/8/1P2P3/PB1P1PPP/RN2KBNR b KQkq - 3 7,"He goes to b5 anyway. Although the computer doesn't give it as a mistake, I think it is. He really needs to develop his knights and Bf1."
14,Nge7,g8e7,r1bqk2r/pp2nppp/2nb4/1Q1pp3/8/1P2P3/PB1P1PPP/RN2KBNR w KQkq - 4 8,So I protect d5.
15,a3,a2a3,r1bqk2r/pp2nppp/2nb4/1Q1pp3/8/PP2P3/1B1P1PPP/RN2KBNR b KQkq - 0 8,"Again not given as a mistake by the computer, but I think it is - he needs to develop his knights and Bf1."
16,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp2nppp/2nb4/1Q1pp3/8/PP2P3/1B1P1PPP/RN2KBNR w KQ - 1 9,I get my king to safety.
17,h4,h2h4,r1bq1rk1/pp2nppp/2nb4/1Q1pp3/7P/PP2P3/1B1P1PP1/RN2KBNR b KQ - 0 9,"This is not given as a mistake by the computer, but I think it is. He really needs to develop his knights and Bf1"
18,Qc7,d8c7,r1b2rk1/ppq1nppp/2nb4/1Q1pp3/7P/PP2P3/1B1P1PP1/RN2KBNR w KQ - 1 10,I want to move Bc8 without losing b7.
19,b4,b3b4,r1b2rk1/ppq1nppp/2nb4/1Q1pp3/1P5P/P3P3/1B1P1PP1/RN2KBNR b KQ - 0 10,Yet another wasted move in my view!
20,Bd7,c8d7,r4rk1/ppqbnppp/2nb4/1Q1pp3/1P5P/P3P3/1B1P1PP1/RN2KBNR w KQ - 1 11,"Now I am threatening to move my Nc6, opening up the diagonal for my Bd7 and so attacking his queen."
