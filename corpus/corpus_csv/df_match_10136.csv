1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"We are all taught how to exploit basic tactical conditions that allow us to deliver the knock-out shot in our games.  And we always see these positions from the winner's point of view.  The question I want to pose in this game annotation is the reverse  scenario:  How is it that the losing player - the player who receives the knock-out - allows the conditions for such a tactical shot to arise?  On move 32 Black delivers the tactical shot that, for all intents and purposes, ends the game.  But what were the oversights by the losing player (me) that allowed it?  That is, what is the anatomy of a tactical oversight?"
