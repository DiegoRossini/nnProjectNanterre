1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

I was so relieved to be playing another game with Coach Ion after he was involved in the Christchurch Earthquake.  This game is part of a MT to commemorate players caught up in the Japanese Earthquake.  Back to our game, however, it seems the same old story.  Jo gets a reasonable game until late into the middlegame against the Experts and Masters and then passivitis sets in.  Coach Ion inflicted that ailment on me all right.  To see how, just play this through and look at the Gameknot Analysis link which is as follows:-http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15586699&rnd=0.7010855109933332"
