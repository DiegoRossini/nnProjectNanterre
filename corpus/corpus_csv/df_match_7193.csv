I expected Bh3, and tried to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the bishop being on g2. The main advantage is the overprotection of the d5 pawn, the prevention of black tactical finesses involving ..Nfe4 and a discovered attack with the bishop on g7, as well as the possibility of moving to e4 at some point to press against black's g6 pawn. The main disadvantage is the bishop being blocked for most of the game by the d5 pawn, the inability to support the move g4,  and the inability to later contest the h3-c8 light-square diagonal when black switches his bishop via c8 to the f5 square (very typical in this line, as white usually places his queen on c2)."
