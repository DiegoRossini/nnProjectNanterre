3,d5,d4d5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2pP4/8/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Well done if you got 2. d5! 1.....c5 is an inferior way of playing the Benoni Defence. 1. d4 Nf3 2. c4 c5 is better as, compared to the game continuation, White has made a non-developing pawn move(2. c4). White has the c4 square for a Knight or Bishop and is also able to play Bb5+ at some stage. 2. d5 is the most aggressive way of playing for White, so nothing for anything else."
