This is Black's most common reply.  Black normally focuses on the queenside, while White concentrates on the kingside."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,I relied heavily on the GameDB for most of the games.  This is the Main line and my most common move in the tournament.
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,This establishes the pawn structure typically associated with the French Defense.  Black usually pushes the c-pawn at some point to attack the base of White's pawn chain.

The normal move, according to the GameDB, is f4 (which I played in other games in the tournament).  This is the 3rd most common, with a winning percentage for players above 1900.  I didn't check the 1500  stats, but perhaps I should have since it shows a slightly higher win percentage for black."

I believe I played this to help open by bishop and queen.  Either way, this is where I have to stop relying on the database to help and start thinking things through a lot more carefully."

It's much better to have a piece attack or defend a focal point rather than occupy it.  I can't move it, since that gives the black bishop too much control, including preventing castling (thanks to my 7. f4 play).

Looking at it again, perhaps 9. Nc2 followed by 10. Be3 would have worked.  Comments are welcome.  :)"

Stop and examine this position for a moment.  Black is clearly in charge of the game.  All his minor pieces save his c8 bishop are in play, he's castled, and he has a solid pawn structure.  Conversely, I've only moved my knights, can't castle, and my pawns are in disarray.  None of my moves have been *wrong*, but I haven't developed with a solid plan and have an uncertain future at best."
