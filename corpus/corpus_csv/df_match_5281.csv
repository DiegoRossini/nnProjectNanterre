9,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,I played this to test white and see what kind of mood he was in. If he follows up with g4 then I know he wants to fight.

12,d6,d7d6,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2nppn2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,putting the bishop on e3 instead of G5 is becoming very fashionable lately. It is easy to understand why because on g5 the bishop get harassed and white has not really gotten any serious advantage from it. Plus the bishop on e3 is actually more flexible than on g5. From here it eyes the d4 square and can assist with queenside attacking stratagies.

16,Bd7,c8d7,r2qk2r/pp1bbppp/2nppn2/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 4 9,an exicting idea but a bit too aggressive. The forced move for black Qb8 is actually not to bad because the queen is well position on the b8-h2 diagonal and can support pawn thrusts from safety. The disadvantage of Qb8 is that the A rook is going to be hard to develop.

11. f4 a6 12. Nd4 h6 13. Qd2 and black has 13. ...Nxd4= 13. ...b5 13. ...Qc7 as options
