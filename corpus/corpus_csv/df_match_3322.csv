In the long term, my pawn structure would give nice possibilities for black to attack me, but with this move, I was so much ahead in development and black position was so bad that I didn't care a bit. Black must not lose any tempo to gain some advantage of this position, thing that is almost impossible now that the queen is on the middle of the field."
