Let me quote from Wikipedia ""The Fried Liver Attack, also called the Fegatello Attack (named for an Italian idiom meaning ""dead as a piece of liver""), is a chess opening. This colourfully named opening is a variation of the Two Knights Defence in which White sacrifices a knight for a superficially impressive attack on the enemy king. The Fried Liver has been known for many centuries, the first known game score being from a game played in Rome in 1610.[1]. The Fried Liver Attack is classified in the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings (ECO) with the code C57.

After usual opening moves of the Two Knights (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6), White goes on the offensive, the game continuing 4.Ng5 d5 5.exd5 Nxd5. This latter move gives White a strong attack and is often considered to be a mistake. (Black usually plays 5...Na5 instead; other moves are 5...Nd4 and 5...b5.) White can now get a small advantage with 6.d4 (the Lolli Attack).
However, The Fried Liver Attack involves a far more speculative knight sacrifice on f7, with the defining moves 6.Nxf7 Kxf7""
The above mentioned Lolli Attack often leads into a delayed version of this gambit - (Quoting from ""Openings for the Club Player by Tim Harding and Leonard Barden"" 6.... Bb4  (taking away the square c3 from the white knight) 7. c3 Be7 8.Nxf7 Kxf7, 9. Qf3  Ke6 10. Qe4 Bf8 and quotes the game Barden-Weaver Adams, which white won. Compare this with this game."
