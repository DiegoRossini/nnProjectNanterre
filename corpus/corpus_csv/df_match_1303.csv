1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is the second of two games I won against tedd123. Though this game took a few more moves than the last one (32 moves this game vs 24 the previous), there was a lot of neat moves in this game that I felt worth of sharing as it worked out really well with lots of new strategy ideas. Feel free to comment and critique."

He has several options, Nb4 is attacking the White Queen, he can also potentially move to c2 forking the King and Rook, his bishop is still threating Kf3 and his knight on the rim can easily jump back in and move to g3 for example and threaten the Rook."

My main motive was to draw the King out, keep him from castling on the King side in the near future but also capture Nb4. Black can take the bishop or move his King. If he does capture the bishop, I can easily put him back in check and capture the Knight and be in a good position possibly attack his knight on G4 by moving white pawn to e5"
