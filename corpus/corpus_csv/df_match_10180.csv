1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,The most flexible reply to white's initial move. With this move black invites white to repent from his evil ways and transpose to a d4 Indian opening. Many white players may comply if black presents them with enough evidence that the Indian opening black has in mind is neither the Gruenfeld or the Benoni/Benko.

The Botvinnik system is intended to face a King's Indian setup where black instead plays 6...e5, and white can obtain very good results with it.

On a first impression it seems that white has been smoking something he shouldn't have. He has locked up his g2 bishop behind his own pawns, has developed his King's knight to a less forceful position than f3, and now, on top of that, he has made a horrible hole in d4 for his opponent to exploit. But there's method to this madness. The idea of the Botvinnik setup is that, in exchange for all this, the center is now completely locked. Since black cannot hit back in the center with this setup, white intends to begin simultaneous offensives in the two flanks.  His plan is that he will be able to get to the black king and/or penetrate the queenside before black can take advantage of white's weaknesses. Against unprepared opposition, this plan very often gives excellent results. My opponent, however, was not in this category..."

Alternatively white can begin the offensive in the Queenside with 11. Rb1 Nd4 12. b4 cxb4 13. Rxb4; instead 11. Kh1 anticipates that white will be playing f4 very soon.
