4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,3.Nc3 seemed the adequate defense to prevent d5.
5,g3,g2g3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/3P2P1/PPP2P1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,3.Nc3 seemed the adequate defense to prevent d5.
6,d5,d7d5,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/2pp4/4P3/3P2P1/PPP2P1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Strong pawn in d4. But 4...dxe5 seemed more interesting. Yes, the fianchetto now is open, but it takes too many times for white to develop to safety."

10,e5,e7e5,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n5/2p1p3/3pP3/3P2P1/PPP1NPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"Closing the center. Very strong for black, that has plenty of room to develop."
11,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n5/2p1p3/3pP3/3P2P1/PPP1NPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 6,"Seems to be following regular development rules, but I think black has to have in mind f5 and hence, maybe 6...Bd6: 7...Ne7 with the possibility of f6 seemed more interesting. Not sure of this quick analysis though."
12,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/2p1p3/3pP3/3P2P1/PPP1NPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 7,"Seems to be following regular development rules, but I think black has to have in mind f5 and hence, maybe 6...Bd6: 7...Ne7 with the possibility of f6 seemed more interesting. Not sure of this quick analysis though."

Black doesn´t want to lose the pawn in d4, so I was just trying to set a defense for the incoming attack on the queenside. Maybe an unnecessary and risky movement, since white needs and wants to focus on the Kingside, the only area where it can develop some trouble for black."
14,Be6,c8e6,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1bn2/2p1p3/2PpP3/3P2P1/PP2NPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 8,"A just movement. No need to look for a quick castling yet, I think."
15,h3,h2h3,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1bn2/2p1p3/2PpP3/3P2PP/PP2NPB1/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,Avoiding Ng4 and also setting the prelude for the ultimate advance on the BK (after castling)
16,Be7,f8e7,r2qk2r/pp2bppp/2n1bn2/2p1p3/2PpP3/3P2PP/PP2NPB1/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 9,"White has a poor development on his left flank and it will take time for those Nb1 and Bc1 to do something else that stay and watch, but on the other hand, the rest of the pieces are ready to collaborate for the assault on the BK side."

The pawn advance on the castling now seems too strong and dangerous. And yet, white doesn´t seem to have enough firepower to support the assault."

But maybe in WQ can move to h6 and from there hold black pieces while advancing pawn in h and supported by the rook, the victory seems feasible."

Instead , I want that N released and joining the attack. It may be a waste of time, but couldn´t find out how else to proceed now (not enough time for the plan of Qh6, pawn in ha advance supported by rook mentioned before)"

Now that I see it, maybe Qg3 was more effective, for the plan would be then Kf2 and then Rh1. In case of black trying h5, I was thinking about Ng3 and then sac in h5 to enter then with the queen."
