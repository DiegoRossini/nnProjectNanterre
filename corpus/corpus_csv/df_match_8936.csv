1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!  I played a game with a Master which I lost which involved a 2 piece endgame and with me having the remote queenside pawn majority and my opponent a strong central pawn majority.  I would have thought that in my experience with opponents with remote pawn majorities and losing that my queenside pawn majority should have won through.  I did manage to promote my b pawn but alas, Glenda did not stay on the field for very long.  After her departure I was just 3 pawns down without any further play so I decided to call it a day then.  Master Freddy responds to e4 with Nf6 (the Alekhine's Defense).  Alexander Alekhine was a very strong grandmaster with a rating of about 3000.  That defense, although it does encourage pawns to attack the horse does have a sting in the sense that the pawns can overreach themselves by advancing too far."

I decide to resign because I realised just after I crowned my pawn that black did not have to play BxQ allowing NxN leaving me with a piece against his 3 passers.  He could always play Nc4  getting his knight out of the line of fire and then picking Glenda off next move.  I now decide to wave the white flag and concede one rating point pegging back my rating to 1759.  At least I was involved in an endgame with a player rated more than 2000, in fact in this instance, a Master where I started with even material.  Pity I could not maintain it.  Cheers.  Joanne."
