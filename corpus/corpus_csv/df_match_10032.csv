29,a5,a4a5,3rk2r/1p1qb1pp/p1p2pn1/P1p1p3/2P1P3/1PNP1Q1P/5PP1/R1BR2K1 b k - 0 15,That is why I should have gone a5. Twanky beat me to it. opening room for his knight to advance to a4
30,O-O,e8g8,3r1rk1/1p1qb1pp/p1p2pn1/P1p1p3/2P1P3/1PNP1Q1P/5PP1/R1BR2K1 w - - 1 16,I thought castling was not a bad idea as his white bishop had gone and the white diagonal was blocked up with pawns. I also had thoughts of advancing my f pawn too.
31,Ba3,c1a3,3r1rk1/1p1qb1pp/p1p2pn1/P1p1p3/2P1P3/BPNP1Q1P/5PP1/R2R2K1 b - - 2 16,white spots a weak spot in my defence.  The pawn on c5.  Moving that bishop does enable me to think about moving my knight to f4 attacking d3.  For a few moves now I have been a little concerned about the position of my queen.
