1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"4...not so crazy about the trade...the Caro-K is kind of passive-y, but a little imbalance is to black's advantage.  Retreating the bishop and allowing the trade on g6 is not bad...Fischer always said the doubled pawn formation was almost impossible to attack...sometimes the open h file comes in handy.

7...Why trade the good black-squared B for White's bad one?...also the trade hands W a tempo...how will black ever get counterplay...he is already behind in development and opening the game will help W, not black.

8. I might have played N x d2...looking at c5 which is where B's break and counterplay will come...clamping down on the Q-side will reduce B to a waiting game

11. W has space, and no weaknesses, and better development...this is already a struggle for B

12. the g4 push  creates an ugly hole on f4 for W, if B could sink a knight  in there, then he can stop W's K-side attacking possibilities. B will have to be careful to guard the h file, maybe playing g5, K up, then bringing the R and Q back to oppose W's buildup there."
