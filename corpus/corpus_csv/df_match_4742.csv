1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,e4. A standard choice for me which I tend to do better with thn d4.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Black opts for the Sicilian. A solid choice against e4 which statistically has the best results for wins and draws.

14,b5,b7b5,rnb1kb1r/2q1pppp/p2p1n2/1p6/3NP3/1BN5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,This Queen side pawn push starts an early attack for white while freeing up the b7 square for the light square bishop.

I was a bit concerned about the Queenside pawns so will probably castle king side.

25,O-O,e1g1,rn2kb1r/1q3ppp/p2p4/4p3/1p1NP3/4BQ2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b kq - 1 13,I made this move some time after my previous move and forgot about the knight being attacked on d4. A mistake I often make in correspondence chess. Fingers crossed he misses it.
26,Nc6,b8c6,r3kb1r/1q3ppp/p1np4/4p3/1p1NP3/4BQ2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w kq - 2 14,Phew. Developing the knight and attacking my knight I decide to trade off.
27,Nxc6,d4c6,r3kb1r/1q3ppp/p1Np4/4p3/1p2P3/4BQ2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b kq - 0 14,Trading knights. At this point in the game the material is even.

30,Qa4,c6a4,r3kb1r/5ppp/p2p4/4p3/qp2P3/4BQ2/PPP2PPP/2R2RK1 w kq - 2 16,Hmmm. Dilemma. Black attacks my a pawn and I as much as I looked I could not see any way to stop going a pawn down.
