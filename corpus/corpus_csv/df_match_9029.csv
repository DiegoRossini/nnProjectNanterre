7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3P4/5p2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,This move is to prevent Qh4  i think.Because after another move(for example Nc3) 4...Qh4  5.g3 fxg3 6.hxg3 Qxh3 so he stays one pawn back cannot capture with h pawn.Or he would play Ke2 and would not be able to castle anymore.probably there are other possibilities that i missed.if you help me with your comments i will be very thankful.
