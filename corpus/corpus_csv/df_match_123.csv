1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"What is this?? It's the Old Benoni Defence, though I didn't know that at the time."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"What is this?? It's the Old Benoni Defence, though I didn't know that at the time."
3,d5,d4d5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2pP4/8/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Taking the pawn looks suspect, though it seems playable if the number of responses in the database is anything to go by."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2pP4/8/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"I've been playing 1.d4 followed by 2.c4 in all games with White recently, and though Black's surprise on his second move made me divert, now I can go back to the game plan."
5,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2pP4/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"I've been playing 1.d4 followed by 2.c4 in all games with White recently, and though Black's surprise on his second move made me divert, now I can go back to the game plan."
6,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppp1p/5np1/2pP4/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Black's going to have a very cramped defence, which is fine by me."
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppp1p/5np1/2pP4/2P5/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,"I've found out what the opening is by now, and am expecting e6 at some point. But my opponent is ""winging it"" (and doing it well) so who knows?"
8,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/pp1pppbp/5np1/2pP4/2P5/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 5,"I've found out what the opening is by now, and am expecting e6 at some point. But my opponent is ""winging it"" (and doing it well) so who knows?"
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk2r/pp1pppbp/5np1/2pP4/2P5/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 5,I carry on developing...
10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp1pppbp/5np1/2pP4/2P5/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 4 6,Black leaves e6 for the time being.
11,e4,e2e4,rnbq1rk1/pp1pppbp/5np1/2pP4/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQ - 0 6,"Getting a solid central pawn formation already. There's a definite risk to the Benoni, I read, and given the opening is where I usually gain ground against my opponent, I'm confident."
12,d6,d7d6,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2pP4/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 0 7,"Releasing the light-squared Bishop, a piece which, apparently, struggles to find its place in this opening. Its options are certainly limited."
13,h3,h2h3,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2pP4/2P1P3/2N2N1P/PP3PP1/R1BQKB1R b KQ - 0 7,I limit them some more!
14,e6,e7e6,rnbq1rk1/pp3pbp/3ppnp1/2pP4/2P1P3/2N2N1P/PP3PP1/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 0 8,Finally Black contests my spearhead in the centre.
15,Be2,f1e2,rnbq1rk1/pp3pbp/3ppnp1/2pP4/2P1P3/2N2N1P/PP2BPP1/R1BQK2R b KQ - 1 8,I can see where this is going and decide I'll have both Bishops pointing at Black's K-side.
16,exd5,e6d5,rnbq1rk1/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pp4/2P1P3/2N2N1P/PP2BPP1/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 9,"I have all those diagonals free! Actually, I find later, taking with the c-pawn is more modern and probably better."
17,exd5,e4d5,rnbq1rk1/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/2P5/2N2N1P/PP2BPP1/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 9,"I have all those diagonals free! Actually, I find later, taking with the c-pawn is more modern and probably better."
18,Re8,f8e8,rnbqr1k1/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/2P5/2N2N1P/PP2BPP1/R1BQK2R w KQ - 1 10,Black pins my Bishop.
19,O-O,e1g1,rnbqr1k1/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/2P5/2N2N1P/PP2BPP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 2 10,But not for long.
20,Ne4,f6e4,rnbqr1k1/pp3pbp/3p2p1/2pP4/2P1n3/2N2N1P/PP2BPP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 3 11,"I think this is a bit of a premature sortie. But it does open that long diagonal for the Bishop on g7, which is doubtless the idea."
21,Nxe4,c3e4,rnbqr1k1/pp3pbp/3p2p1/2pP4/2P1N3/5N1P/PP2BPP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 11,"I'm rather playing into Black's plan, but his Q-side isn't yet developed and I have lots of space."
22,Rxe4,e8e4,rnbq2k1/pp3pbp/3p2p1/2pP4/2P1r3/5N1P/PP2BPP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 12,"Black has achieved his aim, and that b-pawn is under a little pressure . But he's still way behind."
23,Bd3,e2d3,rnbq2k1/pp3pbp/3p2p1/2pP4/2P1r3/3B1N1P/PP3PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 12,"Black has achieved his aim, and that b-pawn is under a little pressure . But he's still way behind."

25,Rb1,a1b1,rnbqr1k1/pp3pbp/3p2p1/2pP4/2P5/3B1N1P/PP3PP1/1RBQ1RK1 b - - 3 13,"I want to get my Bishop out, so decide to cover the b-pawn. It's perhaps a bit of a wasted tempo, since I'll want to move the Rook again at some point, and in fact could probably have played the Bishop out (13.Bg5?) anyway."
26,Nd7,b8d7,r1bqr1k1/pp1n1pbp/3p2p1/2pP4/2P5/3B1N1P/PP3PP1/1RBQ1RK1 w - - 4 14,"I think Black's Knight is heading to f6, to make up for the other's absence."
