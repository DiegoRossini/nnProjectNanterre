This move costed the game to Black, if Black played c5 and c4 direct he could escape his bishop, not only his bishop would be free but also he would get queen side pawn majorty and possilbly win the game. So looking to this positon White's 12. Bxb6 was not good decision, but as you see it is not easy to calculate/predict so further, specially when simple pawn move can cost the game. So lesson is ""When you move analyse it as further as you can otherwise you can simply lose even by a simple innocent pawn move."""
