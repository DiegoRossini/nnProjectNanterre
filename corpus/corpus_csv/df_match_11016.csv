1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,1. e4 establishes foothold in the center of the board and opens diagonals for both the kingside bishop and queen.  Strong first move.

3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Strong 2nd move, developing a minor piece to it's most centralized square and threatening the undefended black e pawn.  Developing a kingside piece also speeds castling."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"Petroff's defence, sometimes called the Russian defense, maintains symmetry.  The e pawns are usually cleared leading to an open game where black tries to maintain a central knight on e4."
5,Nxe5,f3e5,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"? (Bad move)

Even though this seems to maintain symmetry, white either gains material or a positional advantage with 4. Qe2 (ie 4...Nf6?? 5. Nd6  winning black's queen, or 4...d5 5. d3 Qe7 6. dxe4 Qxe5 7. exd5 winning a pawn).

The main line is d6, forcing the white knight to retreat."

This was a pointless and allows black to create a pawn chain with tempo."

Trading bishop and knight for white's rook and pawn.  Materially, it's an even trade, but since black is trading away his developed pieces, I feel the trade is better for white (assuming white takes advantage of the situation).  If black can get his other minor pieces developed and take control of the open e file with his rooks, he may get a winning attack considering white's exposed king."
