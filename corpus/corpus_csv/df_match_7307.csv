1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This game was a random challenge from a significantly higher ranked player. Coming at what I hoped would be the end of my 130+ point slide down the ratings it has helped to boost my confidence. Duke1968 kindly agreed to annotate the game
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Playing as black against a significantly higher ranked player the odds are already stacked up against me. I decided that sitting back and defending would mean I would just lose faster.
3,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"In this game I suspected that the pawn would be too good to refuse. My challenge therefore was to make as much of the position as I could and draw comfort from that, after all for me, anything less than complete obliteration would be nearly as good as a win"
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,This seemed the obvious option to me as it developed my bishop. Using either knight would simply block up my lsb
5,Bb5+,f1b5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/1B1P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 3,This seemed the obvious option to me as it developed my bishop. Using either knight would simply block up my lsb
6,Bd7,c8d7,rn1qkb1r/pppbpppp/5n2/1B1P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 3 4,This seemed the obvious option to me as it developed my bishop. Using either knight would simply block up my lsb
7,Bc4,b5c4,rn1qkb1r/pppbpppp/5n2/3P4/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 4 4,"This seems a good option for white, bXd7 for example allows something like Nbd7 which develops the knight with tempo"
8,c6,c7c6,rn1qkb1r/pp1bpppp/2p2n2/3P4/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,This move suprised me a little I would have expected something like Nf3 which would give white good control over the centre as well as preparing for castling
9,dxc6,d5c6,rn1qkb1r/pp1bpppp/2P2n2/8/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,This move suprised me a little I would have expected something like Nf3 which would give white good control over the centre as well as preparing for castling
10,Nxc6,b8c6,r2qkb1r/pp1bpppp/2n2n2/8/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,Develops the knight with tempo. It was here I realised that I perhaps had a very slight edge in development and should try to take advantage of that if I could
11,d4,d2d4,r2qkb1r/pp1bpppp/2n2n2/8/2BP4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 6,"White seemed unlikely to take the pawn as dxe5, Nxe5 and white is forced to move his lsb again"
12,e5,e7e5,r2qkb1r/pp1b1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2BP4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 7,"White seemed unlikely to take the pawn as dxe5, Nxe5 and white is forced to move his lsb again"
13,Ne2,g1e2,r2qkb1r/pp1b1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2BP4/8/PPP1NPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,"This is the first move that takes us out of the gameknot database. At this point I think black has a slight edge in development, though white is ready now to castle. I wanted to try to pressure white and was looking at b5 but first I needed to get my knight out of the way"
14,Nxd4,c6d4,r2qkb1r/pp1b1ppp/5n2/4p3/2Bn4/8/PPP1NPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"I suspect this move is considered out of order as exd4 might be more normal. I'm not entirely sure why that is though I suspect I may find out why very soon.

My thinking was that despite being a pawn down any exchange of pieces would not be all bad."
15,Nxd4,e2d4,r2qkb1r/pp1b1ppp/5n2/4p3/2BN4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,As far as I can see this is whites only practical option. As otherwise b5 will cause problems for white.
16,exd4,e5d4,r2qkb1r/pp1b1ppp/5n2/8/2Bp4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,The thought of that queen lining up on the d file with a white rook scared me. It was about this time I decided to try to exchange queens
17,Qxd4,d1d4,r2qkb1r/pp1b1ppp/5n2/8/2BQ4/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 9,The thought of that queen lining up on the d file with a white rook scared me. It was about this time I decided to try to exchange queens
18,b5,b7b5,r2qkb1r/p2b1ppp/5n2/1p6/2BQ4/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 10,But first lets try to shift that pesky bishop
19,Qe5+,d4e5,r2qkb1r/p2b1ppp/5n2/1p2Q3/2B5/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 1 10,This move again suprised me as it seemed white was happy to exchange queens
20,Qe7,d8e7,r3kb1r/p2bqppp/5n2/1p2Q3/2B5/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 2 11,Now the differences in development looked significant to me but how can I take advantage of it? I have the initiative as white must move his lsb
21,Qxe7+,e5e7,r3kb1r/p2bQppp/5n2/1p6/2B5/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 11,Now the differences in development looked significant to me but how can I take advantage of it? I have the initiative as white must move his lsb
22,Bxe7,f8e7,r3k2r/p2bbppp/5n2/1p6/2B5/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 12,Now the differences in development looked significant to me but how can I take advantage of it? I have the initiative as white must move his lsb
23,Bb3,c4b3,r3k2r/p2bbppp/5n2/1p6/8/1B6/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 1 12,Maintains the pressure on the white lsb with the threat of a4. I was expecting a3 in response. Later on the game the forward position of this pawn proved important
24,a5,a7a5,r3k2r/3bbppp/5n2/pp6/8/1B6/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 13,Maintains the pressure on the white lsb with the threat of a4. I was expecting a3 in response. Later on the game the forward position of this pawn proved important
25,a4,a2a4,r3k2r/3bbppp/5n2/pp6/P7/1B6/1PP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 13,Again this move suprised me and it took me some time to decide what to do.
26,b4,b5b4,r3k2r/3bbppp/5n2/p7/Pp6/1B6/1PP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 14,I wanted to restrict whites ability to develop as much as I could and possibly even stop him from being able to castle though I knew it was unlikely i would achieve that. I considered Bb4 though in the end I wasnt' comfortable with that. b4 had a similar effect in that white couldn't develop the knight to c3 and it would take a while to get his rook active
27,O-O,e1g1,r3k2r/3bbppp/5n2/p7/Pp6/1B6/1PP2PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 1 14,"I decided to go for the safe option here, the biggest problem with the move being that my f pawn is pinned. It's going to be hard to move the white lsb so I may need to move my king at some point"
28,O-O,e8g8,r4rk1/3bbppp/5n2/p7/Pp6/1B6/1PP2PPP/RNB2RK1 w - - 2 15,"I decided to go for the safe option here, the biggest problem with the move being that my f pawn is pinned. It's going to be hard to move the white lsb so I may need to move my king at some point"
29,Bf4,c1f4,r4rk1/3bbppp/5n2/p7/Pp3B2/1B6/1PP2PPP/RN3RK1 b - - 3 15,Pins the f pawn. Looking at it now I think perhaps Ne4 would be stronger
30,Bc5,e7c5,r4rk1/3b1ppp/5n2/p1b5/Pp3B2/1B6/1PP2PPP/RN3RK1 w - - 4 16,Pins the f pawn. Looking at it now I think perhaps Ne4 would be stronger
