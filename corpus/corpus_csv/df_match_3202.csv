14,Qd6,d8d6,rnb1k1nr/ppp2ppp/3q4/8/2BP4/4P3/P4PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 1 8,Threatens Qb4+ but loses a pawn. Black should have considered 7...Nf6
15,Qb3,d1b3,rnb1k1nr/ppp2ppp/3q4/8/2BP4/1Q2P3/P4PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 2 8,"Hitting b7 and f7. On a second look I suppose Black can play 8... Nh6, but either way, he's disadvantaged himself with 7... Qd6."

This move technically does as well, but still allows the Knight check on e5. 14...f6 also has the benefit of threatening to trap the White Queen with 15...Nd7.

If there are lessons here, I would say: remember the importance of development (ending a game with rooks on their original squares is one thing, but Black never even moved a knight), avoid cheap tricks that don't improve your position (such as Black's 7...Qd6), and always have a good reason when exchanging (Black's 5th and 6th moves were more helpful for White than Black)."
