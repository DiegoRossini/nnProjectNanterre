1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,in this game I play the Scheveningen variation of the Sicilian with 5...a6 in order to aviod the dreaded Keres Attack after 5...e6 6.g4!. The game shows a typical black counter attack on the queenside which white completely underestimates.

14,b5,b7b5,rnbqkb1r/5ppp/p2ppn2/1p6/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,completely preventing whites light square bishop from getting on the agressive a2-g8 diagonal

An imediate 14.f4 is better, preventing the Nd7-e5-c4 idea but weakening the e4 pawn but as the rook has moved from h1 the e pawn is atleast not pinned and so could advance if the pressure became unbearable."
