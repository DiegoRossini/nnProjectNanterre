1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I have been starting with the standard Reti opening line for my matches to try and build off a solid base. The opening concedes the center almost immediately however it helps me develop my pieces in a smooth manner.

3,g3,g2g3,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/3P4/6P1/PPP1PP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,The computer analysis stated I should have played Nc6 here instead. That would have kept with the standard Reti however I wanted to try something different.

In retrospect, that probably would have been the better move. It would have connected the pawn chain on K side and provided a barrier between my opponent moving Qh5+. That would have completely changed the scope of the match. It was definitely an oversight on my part. So far I would say that my ability to recognize diagonal threats is weak."

The computer analysis recommended my moving Ncb4 instead. I couldnt tell you why that would be more beneficial looking at the board.
