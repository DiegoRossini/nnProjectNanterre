1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Another loss in my Masters MT.  I have two games that I need to either win or draw to avoid the dreaded Nul Point.  This was my longest and best game (so far) against Dave Rundle.  I got absolutely trounced in my first two games against him so I am glad to have taken him some distance.  I set out here the Gameknot Analysis version of the game so that you can follow the action:- http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15904877&fb=1&rnd=0.005913757023437383.  Anyhow, he starts off with 1.d4 and I decided to reply with the Dutch Defense."
