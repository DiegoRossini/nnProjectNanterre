1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

I could not resist annotating this game which was a Team Match between the Master Mater and Master Bastalex.  As you can see, what will come is an awesome display - a successful mating attack against somebody near his own rating!

I hope we will all learn something from it.  Master Bastalex kicks off with 1. c4 which is the English Opening.  c4 hits out at the central square d5."

Kh1 - yup, those pawn trades/sac made a fine groove for Freddy's queen to just get on in there - that is something I must be on the lookout for when I next play him!  White has only two legal moves, Kh1 or Rf2.  As it is not desirable to put your pieces into a pin then Kh1 is the logical choice here."
