1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Here is a just finished ladder game in the Fischer-Sozin variation of the Sicilian Najdorf.  I have only recently started playing 2...d6 in the Sicilian and as a result, my opponent takes me out of book by move 9."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I won't be annotating every move as I will assume most of you are familiar with the opening moves, however, we do reach the variation by a move order transposition."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,More typical is 3. d4 or 3. Bb5+

6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 4,"Attacking the e-pawn and inviting the advance 4. e5, when 4...de; 5. Nxe5 e6 causes Black no problems."
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/2p5/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 4,Still postponing the advance of the d-pawn.
8,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3ppn2/2p5/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,Here I opt to keep my Queen's knight flexible and commit to the Scheveningen setup rather than the ...e5 systems after the White knight lands on d4.
9,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3ppn2/2p5/2BPP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,After this move we transpose into the main lines of the Fischer-Sozin.
10,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3ppn2/8/2BpP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"According to my opening book, White has tried no less than 9 different moves here.  7. Bb3, 7. Be3 and 7. Bg5 are the more standard continuations."

14,b5,b7b5,rnbqkb1r/5ppp/p2ppn2/1p6/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,"Swatting the bishop and clearing a path for the light-squared bishop to come to b7.  This will weaken the e6-square and as we will see in a few moves, White can often sacrifice on this square."
15,Bb3,c4b3,rnbqkb1r/5ppp/p2ppn2/1p6/3NP3/1BN5/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 8,The only strategically consistent move.

29,Ne2,c3e2,rn3qk1/1b2b1pp/p2p1n2/8/Pp2P3/4BP2/1PP1N1PP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 15,"15. Na2 a5; 16. c3 was another way to play actively for white.  Here the knight can come to f4, where it once again eyes d5."
