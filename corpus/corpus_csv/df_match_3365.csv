Getting in this pawn advance is one of blacks key ideas in this opening, usually it's purpose involves getting a knight to the d3 which isn't the case here since white has still not moved the e pawn. However this advance often has dynamic purposes and sometimes aims to free the c5 square for the pieces. I couldn't help but feeling this was too soon, but every line I looked at seemed promising, so I just played it. The purpose is to get the queen to c5 which hits f2 and by initiating contact between the pawns I'm sure to induce a weakness, also I'm now hitting d5"
