1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The Giuoco Piano is my current major subject of chess study.  I have been playing on FICS recently and in games so far I have noticed that most players diverge (if White) after 4. ... Nf6 or (if Black) after 5. d4.  The resulting games vary wildly.

Here, I play Black.  My opponent, after the initial moves, elects to exchange off as quickly as possible.  My goal in the game is to use this to my own advantage by dictating the timings and concentrating towards the center."
