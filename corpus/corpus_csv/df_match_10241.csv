12,c5,c7c5,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/3p4/2p5/2BQP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 7,I kind of like this position. I have a checkmate threat and he can't play 7.. Be6 to harass my queen.
13,Qd5,d4d5,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/3p4/2pQ4/2B1P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 1 7,I kind of like this position. I have a checkmate threat and he can't play 7.. Be6 to harass my queen.
14,Qe7,d8e7,r1b1kbnr/pp2qppp/3p4/2pQ4/2B1P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 2 8,"Once again, he can't use his light-coloured bishop to get rid of the threat because of 9. Qxb7"
15,Bb5+,c4b5,r1b1kbnr/pp2qppp/3p4/1BpQ4/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 3 8,"Once again, he can't use his light-coloured bishop to get rid of the threat because of 9. Qxb7"
16,Kd8,e8d8,r1bk1bnr/pp2qppp/3p4/1BpQ4/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 4 9,"I'm pretty satisfied with the opening. He gave up castling and I can dream of attacking his king with all of my pieces (of course, most of them are still undeveloped). Fritz likes this position ( 1.5 evaluation), but at the moment I hadn't any real plan in my head."
17,Nc3,b1c3,r1bk1bnr/pp2qppp/3p4/1BpQ4/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 5 9,"Between castling and developing a piece, I chose the latter. It also protects my e-pawn."
18,a6,a7a6,r1bk1bnr/1p2qppp/p2p4/1BpQ4/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 0 10,I think it's a standard tactic to harass the opponent's pieces.
19,Bd3,b5d3,r1bk1bnr/1p2qppp/p2p4/2pQ4/4P3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 1 10,10. Bc4 was another option
20,Be6,c8e6,r2k1bnr/1p2qppp/p2pb3/2pQ4/4P3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 2 11,"Perhaps the best move. Now, Qxb7 isn't possible anymore and I have to run to h5"
21,Qh5,d5h5,r2k1bnr/1p2qppp/p2pb3/2p4Q/4P3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 3 11,"At this point, I wasn't happy with my position, because my queen was on the run. Black, on the other hand, kept developing pieces with tempo."
22,Nf6,g8f6,r2k1b1r/1p2qppp/p2pbn2/2p4Q/4P3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 4 12,"At this point, I wasn't happy with my position, because my queen was on the run. Black, on the other hand, kept developing pieces with tempo."

26,Kc7,d8c7,r4b1r/1pk1qpp1/p2pbn1p/2p5/4P3/2NB4/PPP1QPPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 2 14,"Looks a bit strange to me, but Fritz really likes this move."
27,Bf4,c1f4,r4b1r/1pk1qpp1/p2pbn1p/2p5/4PB2/2NB4/PPP1QPPP/R4RK1 b - - 3 14,Time to develop the other bishop.
28,Re8,a8e8,4rb1r/1pk1qpp1/p2pbn1p/2p5/4PB2/2NB4/PPP1QPPP/R4RK1 w - - 4 15,"This was the turning point for me. I decided to sacrifice a piece, although my plan didn't run very far (bishop for two pawns, then bring the knight to b5, then we'll see; I'm not exactly Kasparov).
I don't usually sacrifice pieces like that and I wasn't hoping for much, but I thought it would certainly spice up the game."
29,Bxa6,d3a6,4rb1r/1pk1qpp1/B2pbn1p/2p5/4PB2/2N5/PPP1QPPP/R4RK1 b - - 0 15,"Fritz is not very impressed by my move and, I suspect, neither is my opponent."
30,bxa6,b7a6,4rb1r/2k1qpp1/p2pbn1p/2p5/4PB2/2N5/PPP1QPPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 16,"So far, so good. I have a passed pawn :)
And some attacking prospects."

32,Qd7,e7d7,4rb1r/2kq1pp1/Q2pbn1p/2p5/4PB2/2N5/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - - 1 17,"According to Fritz, this is quite a mistake, its evaluation jumping from  1.1 to  8 (unless my computer is crazy). It seems that the best move would've been 16..Kb8"
33,Nb5+,c3b5,4rb1r/2kq1pp1/Q2pbn1p/1Np5/4PB2/8/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - - 2 17,"In this case, the most obvious move is also the best one. Fritz says that by this point, black is toasted."
34,Kd8,c7d8,3krb1r/3q1pp1/Q2pbn1p/1Np5/4PB2/8/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - - 3 18,"The alternative was 17..Kb8, in which case Black is also lost, but it's not obvious to me how (I'm not sure I would've found the right moves after 18. Nxd6). However, 17..Kd8 suits me because I realized that Qb6  seals the game."
35,Qb6+,a6b6,3krb1r/3q1pp1/1Q1pbn1p/1Np5/4PB2/8/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - - 4 18,"His options are 18..Ke7 leading to checkmate in 2 or 18..Kc8, where he loses the queen."
