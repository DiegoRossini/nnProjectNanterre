6,Bd7,c8d7,rn1qkbnr/pppb1ppp/3p4/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 4,Again worthless move instead of developing some pieces..

14,c5,c6c5,rn1qk1nr/pp1bbppp/3p4/2p5/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,c5? He's still back in development and he played c5! So I had an easy plan in my mind. The plan is simple...i'd let him took the knight and i'll win the game...Of course he should have prevented that but as i said before he's a low rating player so he might took the chance and risk it...

17,Qxf7#,f3f7,rn1qk1nr/pp1bbQpp/3p4/8/2BpP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 0 9,So simple...He forgot to see at his back and at his king's defence...Hope you like it.. Bye and Dag...Haha
