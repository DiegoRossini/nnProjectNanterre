This is the 4th game I've annotated this evening, and I played black in all of them. Sometimes it seems like I play black 80% of the time, though my statistics don't corroborate that."

As much as I have played the Spanish game, I don't recall anyone playing 3. ... g6 against me. However, the GK DB gives it good marks, so I thought I'd give it a whirl. Take your pick, it's either called the Smyslov Defense, Fianchetto Defense, or Barnes Defense. Evidently it can give white the advantage and doesn't get played much at the highest level. Oh well, I'm far from the highest level, so like Robert Frost, I choose the defense less traveled."
