13,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/3p1n2/2pP4/4P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 7,"thought of developing my bishop by attacking, not a threat at all. but this opens a weakness. my pawn at b7 is undefended now."

22,Ne8,f6e8,rn1qnrk1/1p1bbppp/p2p4/2pPP3/8/2N2N1P/PP2BPP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 12,so retreated my knight to safety.
23,Re1,f1e1,rn1qnrk1/1p1bbppp/p2p4/2pPP3/8/2N2N1P/PP2BPP1/R1BQR1K1 b - - 2 12,rook conquers the half open file.
24,dxe5,d6e5,rn1qnrk1/1p1bbppp/p7/2pPp3/8/2N2N1P/PP2BPP1/R1BQR1K1 w - - 0 13,now i could capture his pawn.
25,Nxe5,f3e5,rn1qnrk1/1p1bbppp/p7/2pPN3/8/2N4P/PP2BPP1/R1BQR1K1 b - - 0 13,i moved the knight to d6 to block the movement of pawn.

27,Qc2,d1c2,rn1q1rk1/1p1bbppp/p2n4/2pPN3/8/2N4P/PPQ1BPP1/R1B1R1K1 b - - 2 14,"a good move. his queen moved to a better position aiming at castle pawn. i.e pawn at h7. see, he could make a battery by moving LSB to d3."
28,Qc8,d8c8,rnq2rk1/1p1bbppp/p2n4/2pPN3/8/2N4P/PPQ1BPP1/R1B1R1K1 w - - 3 15,i made a battery before him. but computer analysis says it was not my best move. computer suggests LSB to f5 threatening his queen.
29,Bf3,e2f3,rnq2rk1/1p1bbppp/p2n4/2pPN3/8/2N2B1P/PPQ2PP1/R1B1R1K1 b - - 4 15,he makes support to most advanced pawn at d5. very good tactics. prevention is better than cure. defend an non threatened piece beforehand.
30,Bf6,e7f6,rnq2rk1/1p1b1ppp/p2n1b2/2pPN3/8/2N2B1P/PPQ2PP1/R1B1R1K1 w - - 5 16,he is exhanging my bishop with his knight. i have 2 option. capture his knight by my queen or with my knight at b8. which is better?
31,Nxd7,e5d7,rnq2rk1/1p1N1ppp/p2n1b2/2pP4/8/2N2B1P/PPQ2PP1/R1B1R1K1 b - - 0 16,he is exhanging my bishop with his knight. i have 2 option. capture his knight by my queen or with my knight at b8. which is better?
32,Qxd7,c8d7,rn3rk1/1p1q1ppp/p2n1b2/2pP4/8/2N2B1P/PPQ2PP1/R1B1R1K1 w - - 0 17,i chose to capture it with queen. a bad move. i should have captured it with knight at b8. so i could develop my undeveloped knight. just see the my opponent pawn at d5 is too strong threat for me. that is why all GMs say conquer the centre. i never experienced such strong threat in my previous games. so i learned how just one pawn made to suffer occupying the centre.
33,Bd2,c1d2,rn3rk1/1p1q1ppp/p2n1b2/2pP4/8/2N2B1P/PPQB1PP1/R3R1K1 b - - 1 17,he developed his DSB
34,b5,b7b5,rn3rk1/3q1ppp/p2n1b2/1ppP4/8/2N2B1P/PPQB1PP1/R3R1K1 w - - 0 18,i started queen side attack. but this opened a potential discovered attack. when a pawn is moved what opportunity it gives to th opponent. my rook at a8 is at potential discovered attack by his LSB at f3. so when he moves his central pawn it becomes a discovered attack. i didnt notice this at all. i failed my game just because of 2 factors. 1. his strong pawn at centre. 2 a potential discovered attack by moving his pawn when he could.
35,Ne4,c3e4,rn3rk1/3q1ppp/p2n1b2/1ppP4/4N3/5B1P/PPQB1PP1/R3R1K1 b - - 1 18,"knights were exchanged also, a battery is formed.  i have to defend it."
36,Nxe4,d6e4,rn3rk1/3q1ppp/p4b2/1ppP4/4n3/5B1P/PPQB1PP1/R3R1K1 w - - 0 19,"knights were exchanged also, a battery is formed.  i have to defend it."
37,Bxe4,f3e4,rn3rk1/3q1ppp/p4b2/1ppP4/4B3/7P/PPQB1PP1/R3R1K1 b - - 0 19,"knights were exchanged also, a battery is formed.  i have to defend it."
