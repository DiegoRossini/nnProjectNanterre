11,Nh4,f3h4,r2qkbnr/pp1np1pp/2p2p2/3pPb2/3P3N/8/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,! Usually it's not wise to put the knight on the edge.  Usually it's not wise to move the same piece twice in the opening.  But here white either wins the bishop pair or black has to play the ugly ...Be6.  (Be4 is met with e6 Nb6. Bh5+ where white is winning after f3)
