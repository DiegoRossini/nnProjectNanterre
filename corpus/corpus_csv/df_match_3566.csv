We should not play on the kingside because it is also blocked off, with no real target. On the queenside, black has weak pawn on c5. Therefore, we should attack there, at the pawn. With the queen, we don't know what it should do. Perhaps after the other pieces move, it can go onto f2-at least it will be flexible right now. Our c3 knight goes to a4, and Ba3. The c4 advance needs to be made impossible by playing the move of b3 and c4, to fix the weaknesses. The f3 knights will later go to d2, to prevent ...d4. Our rooks can wait.

Although true :(, this doesn't help you in a real game. In a real game, you need to treat your (human) opponent's plan as inferior to yours. The masters always strive to go with their ideas at all costs. When one player accepts that the opponent is equal or better than him in terms of ideas, he usually cannot win. Even if unsound, a master always goes with his plan in a straightforward manner. Planning and attack are really the same-The masters I communicate with refer to them as the same in a casual manner. If you cannot attack, you cannot make a plan really. In that case, you just need to improve pieces, and create a weakness. Against weaker players, and even colleagues, the masters always care about their own ideas above all."
