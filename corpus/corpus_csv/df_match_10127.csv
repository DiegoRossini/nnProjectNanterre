1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,1. d4 is not my regular opening for white; most of the time I'm playing the London System.
2,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Wow ! A whole new world opened for me ! Dutch ! It was the first time I've played against that opening-line.. Let's see what it brings..

4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppppp1pp/5n2/5p2/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"With this knight-move, white controls all centre-fields.."

7,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/pppp2pp/4pn2/5pB1/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,Black's preparing to castle..

9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk2r/ppppb1pp/4pn2/5pB1/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 3 5,Normal developing.. One more move and white is also ready to castle on kingside.

12,Ne4,f6e4,rnbq1rk1/ppppb1pp/4p3/5pB1/2PPn3/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 1 7,"A nice attacking move from black ! 6. ... h6 would create openings in her king's defence, where white could take advantage of.."
13,Bxe7,g5e7,rnbq1rk1/ppppB1pp/4p3/5p2/2PPn3/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 7,"Black is forced to take my bishop.. On the next move, I will capture her knight, wich, after taking back, will create a double-pawn."
14,Qxe7,d8e7,rnb2rk1/ppppq1pp/4p3/5p2/2PPn3/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 8,"Attacking that lonely e-pawn.. 9. Ne5 would result in 9. ... d6, so it would cost me another move to get my knight to a safer place.."

18,d5,d7d5,rnb2rk1/ppp1q1pp/4p3/3p4/2PPp3/4P3/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 10,"Protecting the e-pawn.. Actually, I think black hopes on 10. cxd5 exd5; wich will re-arrange black's centre-pawns.."
19,c5,c4c5,rnb2rk1/ppp1q1pp/4p3/2Pp4/3Pp3/4P3/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 10,"11. dxe5 would mess up my pawn-structure, while awaiting 11. ? exd4 12. exd4 e3 would bring me in troubles.. Let's develop my bishop to e2, (only field available, since 11. Bb5 would straighten black's pawn-diagonal) to prepare the castling.."

21,Be2,f1e2,rnb2rk1/ppp1q1pp/8/2Ppp3/3Pp3/4P3/PP1NBPPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 1 11,I don't really understand why black played this move; since there is no threat from white's bishop..

24,Be6,c8e6,rn3rk1/1pp1q1pp/p3b3/2Ppp3/3Pp3/4P3/PP1NBPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 2 13,Maybe 12. ... Bd6 would've been better ? So black could have the chance to play 13. ... Bb5 ?
25,f3,f2f3,rn3rk1/1pp1q1pp/p3b3/2Ppp3/3Pp3/4PP2/PP1NB1PP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 13,I thought opening the f-line would be great; since my two rooks and queen where on the same rank (a nice open line could become desastreus for black; once white took control of it !).
26,Bf5,e6f5,rn3rk1/1pp1q1pp/p7/2Pppb2/3Pp3/4PP2/PP1NB1PP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 1 14,"Opening a nice line for my rook. Black now can take my pawn with his pawn, wich will double his structure up, once again. Not so good, so it's best to wait for white's actions.."
