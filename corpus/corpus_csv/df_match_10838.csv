1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was my opening game in a minitournament consisting of teammates from Waskally Wabbits and Morose Mooses. I decided to annotate all my games from the competition, as this would also help me to focus more on my games and hopefully cut out most blunders. I can't promise scintillating play, as I'm not that kind of a player. :) 

My opponent, Blackbaron, is my most frequent opponent on Gameknot, and I played against him in my very first minitournament in this site. We usually have very exciting games with a lot of exchanges early on, so let's see how this one goes. 

He starts with 1.e4. My personal favourite, pawn moves to the centre, and frees two pieces, the light squared bishop and the queen. My usual defence against 1.e4 is the French Defence."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"1.... c5. The Sicilian, my current preferred opening against 1. e4. I had a pretty good run with the French, and will return to it soon. Tried the Pirc for a while, with horrible results. Record with the French : 50%, Record with the Pirc : 35%.  Have recently ordered the book Play the French by John Watson (just arrived today, in fact. Takes 12 days for Amazon.com to deliver to Bangladesh, for anyone who might be interested) :) . Will switch back to the French after I study the book for a while."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Normal development, moves the Knight to its best square, and follows the rule : Knights before Bishops, as we know what the best squares are for the knights, whereas it is better to wait a bit before developing the bishop."
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"This move frees my light squared bishop. I plan to play the Sicilian Dragon, so while my king side bishop looks horribly locked in, I 'm not too worried.  I plan to fianchetto the bishop. The fianchettoed bishop failed miserably for me in the Pirc Defence, let's see how the Dragon suits my style."
5,b3,b2b3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/1P3N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"Unorthodox move, no idea if this move is in the book, will have to check later after the game what the best response is. For now, will have to follow my instincts. Perhaps he is planning to fianchetto his own bishop, to prevent me from playing g6 for the Dragon formation."
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/2p5/4P3/1P3N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,"Normal development, Knight to its best square. If he fianchettoes his bishop to counter my Dragon, I'll still continue with my plan, I fancy the early exchange which wins his bishop for my knight."
7,e5,e4e5,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/2p1P3/8/1P3N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"4. e5. Typically aggressive play by the Baron, but has he overlooked something? I can play 4.... dxe5, which wins a pawn, because if 5. Nxe5?, I can play 5..... Qd4! which forks the knight and rook. Let's wait and see though."
8,dxe5,d6e5,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2p1p3/8/1P3N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,Awaiting his response...
9,Nxe5,f3e5,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2p1N3/8/1P6/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,He has overlooked it!
10,Qd4,d8d4,rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2p1N3/3q4/1P6/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,"How will he defend this? Give away the rook, as a sort of poisoned rook, if there is such a thing, and attempt to trap my queen? For example, 6. Nc4  Qxa1, 7. Bb2  Qxa2, 8. Nc3 Qa6 and so on. Or even 7. Nc3 which looks better. Let's wait and see. Of course, trapping my queen is one thing, capturing it with no further loss of material is something else entirely :)"
11,Nxf7,e5f7,rnb1kb1r/pp2pNpp/5n2/2p5/3q4/1P6/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"Actually, I was expecting this, Kxf7 looks safe, and worth the extra piece."
12,Kxf7,e8f7,rnb2b1r/pp2pkpp/5n2/2p5/3q4/1P6/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQ - 0 7,"Possible responses from the Baron? Bc4 looks plausible. Note the placement of my knight, by choosing to develop it early to it's best square, it prevents my opponent's queen from playing threatening queen moves such as Qa5 or Qg4. The Knight defends beautifully from there."
13,Bc4+,f1c4,rnb2b1r/pp2pkpp/5n2/2p5/2Bq4/1P6/P1PP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQ - 1 7,"As predicted. Too late for me to react to this now, as it's way past midnight, and I have to get up early for work tomorrow. To be continued."
14,e6,e7e6,rnb2b1r/pp3kpp/4pn2/2p5/2Bq4/1P6/P1PP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 0 8,"Protecting the King with the e pawn. White could castle and bring his rook into play on the half open file, but my pawn is backed by the bishop, and I could bring a piece or two out myself by then. I wanted to avoid a move like Ke1 because it would leave my king too exposed"
15,Nc3,b1c3,rnb2b1r/pp3kpp/4pn2/2p5/2Bq4/1PN5/P1PP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 1 8,"Protects the rook, and develops a piece."
16,Bd6,f8d6,rnb4r/pp3kpp/3bpn2/2p5/2Bq4/1PN5/P1PP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 2 9,"Reasons for this move : Develops a piece; the game is very open, and the player with better development should have the advantage. Also, it takes me a step closer to 'castling by hand' and takes my King to safety.
I would have loved to have been able to play Ng4, but there's a time and a place for everything.
Possible threats now : Nb5 I can deal with, Qf3 gives me time to bring out my h1 rook, Qe2 could have been a worry, but my bishop at c1 is nicely placed to deal with that."
17,Qf3,d1f3,rnb4r/pp3kpp/3bpn2/2p5/2Bq4/1PN2Q2/P1PP1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 3 9,"9. Qf3. Let's see, pins the knight, and prevents my light squared bishop from moving, with an eye on my b7 pawn. That's always a thing to remember when your opponent plays a queen move, it can threaten multiple pieces or squares simultaneously, and it's easy to miss out sometimes. The knight is well protected for the moment, and I could play Nbd2 if necessary, developing my Qside knight in the process. I could try Qe5 , to ease the pressure a bit, and see how my opponent reacts. He would most likely block the check with his bishop, giving me time to bring out my rook and continue with my original plan of castling by hand."
18,Qe5+,d4e5,rnb4r/pp3kpp/3bpn2/2p1q3/2B5/1PN2Q2/P1PP1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 4 10,"10. Be2, as expected. My queen move also prevents White from castling, as O-O would be followed by Qxh2 . Time to bring my rook into play, but where? One of the two half open files (f and d), or Re8?"
19,Be2,c4e2,rnb4r/pp3kpp/3bpn2/2p1q3/8/1PN2Q2/P1PPBPPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 5 10,"10. Be2, as expected. My queen move also prevents White from castling, as O-O would be followed by Qxh2 . Time to bring my rook into play, but where? One of the two half open files (f and d), or Re8?"
20,Rf8,h8f8,rnb2r2/pp3kpp/3bpn2/2p1q3/8/1PN2Q2/P1PPBPPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 6 11,"I choose Rf8, as it allows Nd5 (after I take my King to safety), which threatens White's Knight currently protecting the queenside rook, while simultaneously attacking Whiteâ€™s Queen with my rook."
21,Bb2,c1b2,rnb2r2/pp3kpp/3bpn2/2p1q3/8/1PN2Q2/PBPPBPPP/R3K2R b KQ - 7 11,"I need to watch out for any discovered attacks on my queen now. But how soon do I need to respond to this threat? Do I have time to tuck away my King? What's the worst the Knight can do? And most importantly, the Bishop itself is unprotected, so a discovered attack may not be on the cards just yet. Another motive could be that my opponent plans to castle queenside, and use a pawn storm to tear up whatever protection I have left for my King. I don't like this at all."
