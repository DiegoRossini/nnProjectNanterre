1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,My usual.
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,My usual.
3,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"! Interesting. A move I am not prepared to (finally!). Now the Icelandic is not possible anymore: if e6, dxe6, Bxe6 would be a fatal mistake due to Bxb7. Here, the wisest move is clearly Nxd5, and then to stand some unconfortable position of the N. This was not the game I'd want to go in."

6,e5,e7e5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3Pp3/8/6P1/PPPP1P1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6 0 4,"The idea is (dxe6ep) fxe6 and I would have had a strange position with a e4 to threat, after which retake with the Q the d5 pawn. Probably bad, but an interesting game to go."
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3Pp3/8/2N3P1/PPPP1P1P/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,"My opponent didn't fall for this. Was he able to smell my idea? Moreover: was my idea a good one? (dxe6ep, fxe6, keeping b7 guarded by the lsb). I'm not sure at all. But I can think: ""if my better ranged opponents is playing this, it must be provoking my inmediate move, dxf6ep, so this must be good for him, even if I can't see clearly why. So I better don't go for it, and I play a (hopefully) ""safe"" move, that ""can't be bad"" kind. (This is just a guess, and it is NOT a mock or like. It's just the way I would have thought in his position. :-)"
8,Bc5,f8c5,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/2bPp3/8/2N3P1/PPPP1P1P/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 5,"So I played this move. Note: I didn't want to just take the pawn (I could have still) because I had a ""feeling"" that this would have been ""to fall in the game he wants"", so I decided for this move. I just want to surprise him. Instead of going after the pawn, just developing. I can imagine that e4 would have been the stronger move: black can defend it: against Bg2, Bf5, Qe2, Qe7, it is a tense balance - but I just decided for this one. Can it be just bad?"
9,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/2bPp3/8/2N3P1/PPPP1PBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 3 5,"Ok, I see. I can't move my lsb or d6, threatening b7. Can I live with that? I have to demonstrate it because Bc5 is nothing but a mistake. I gave up the chance to play e4, it must be for a good reason. I just have to find it! :-)"
10,Qe7,d8e7,rnb1k2r/ppp1qppp/5n2/2bPp3/8/2N3P1/PPPP1PBP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 4 6,"Threatening again e4, and this time his K is behing. I think that is the best move. I can move the Nd7, with the idea of Nb6, in order to balance the pressure. But I have to live with lsb and Ra1 trapped for a good while."
11,d3,d2d3,rnb1k2r/ppp1qppp/5n2/2bPp3/8/2NP2P1/PPP2PBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 6,"Defending e4 and opening the way for the dsb (sigh!). And, more over, I gave up my pressure on d5."
12,c6,c7c6,rnb1k2r/pp2qppp/2p2n2/2bPp3/8/2NP2P1/PPP2PBP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 7,"I know, I know, it's a mistake. BUT if he takes the pawn, Nxc6 and my N is out, to start with, and that can't be bad. I didn't solved the b7 problems, but for the moment he can only do BxNc6, and it would be for my benefit. But my pieces are still blocked in."
13,Bg5,c1g5,rnb1k2r/pp2qppp/2p2n2/2bPp1B1/8/2NP2P1/PPP2PBP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 1 7,"He didn't ""fall"" for it, I would think for the same reason as before: ""if he allows it, it must be good for him, so I'll go elsewhere"". This move pins my N. I can kick it with h6, and this leaves him BxN as only reasonable move (to retreat was just a loss of time). Do I want it? Welllll maybe I can exploit somehow the semiopen g column to attack his fianchetto - assuming he castles this way). Qxf6 was the safer move, threatening f2 in return. I regret now I didn't play it."
14,Bf5,c8f5,rn2k2r/pp2qppp/2p2n2/2bPpbB1/8/2NP2P1/PPP2PBP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 2 8,"Ok, now I am leaving the Nb8 as guardian of c6: if dxc6, Nxc6, and black has nothing more than BxN+, bxB - and it would have solved all the power white has with a mere pair of isolated pawns... not fantastic, but affordable."
15,Qf3,d1f3,rn2k2r/pp2qppp/2p2n2/2bPpbB1/8/2NP1QP1/PPP2PBP/R3K1NR b KQkq - 3 8,"Oh, my, this opponent wants to complicate things. The pressure on the white diagonal does NOT increase since the Q is to fall if dxc6, Nc6, QxN+, bxQ, Bxc6+, winning the Ra8. It's hard to see enough compensation. So I have to worry ONLY about the Bf5. I can try the unelegant Bg4 (or before), but this is entering an exchanging melee I was not sure I could have emerged sane. Not certainly on a blitz!"
16,Bg6,f5g6,rn2k2r/pp2qppp/2p2nb1/2bPp1B1/8/2NP1QP1/PPP2PBP/R3K1NR w KQkq - 4 9,"Not g6, because it is unwise to deprive the N from his natural defence, that shouldn't be the Q. In other words: I would have left holes to the Wdsb, as h6... horrible. This was the move."
17,Bxf6,g5f6,rn2k2r/pp2qppp/2p2Bb1/2bPp3/8/2NP1QP1/PPP2PBP/R3K1NR b KQkq - 0 9,"Now he neutralizes me in a similar way as I wanted to avoid before. I didn't welcom exchanges, and I am not sure I could have got more than a sad draw after Q's exchange, so..."
18,gxf6,g7f6,rn2k2r/pp2qp1p/2p2pb1/2bPp3/8/2NP1QP1/PPP2PBP/R3K1NR w KQkq - 0 10,"Surprising him, and instead to push for e4 - leaving it latent - i reinforce my own pawns and I open a g column to attack via h5-h4..."
19,Nge2,g1e2,rn2k2r/pp2qp1p/2p2pb1/2bPp3/8/2NP1QP1/PPP1NPBP/R3K2R b KQkq - 1 10,"White is confortable: he can castle either side safely, I can't. But I can live without castling. For some more moves. And I kind of try to ""get something"" from the position, not leaving him time to feel safe. Which it is."
20,e4,e5e4,rn2k2r/pp2qp1p/2p2pb1/2bP4/4p3/2NP1QP1/PPP1NPBP/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 11,"May Caissa assist me. This was ""Hope Chess"", as I intend it: I can't fully calculate all the consecuences of this move - specially NOW and not when I should have played it. It is a sac, for sure. And I have a N LESS than before to support it... so why am I playing it now? Just bad. Nc5 had to be defended after Nxe4, so I would have lost a tempo. Otherwise, BxN and I lost my B pair for nothing. And as long as Ne2 stays where it is, and I don't castle, there is no pin threat on the e column."
21,dxe4,d3e4,rn2k2r/pp2qp1p/2p2pb1/2bP4/4P3/2N2QP1/PPP1NPBP/R3K2R b KQkq - 0 11,"This was a mistake, since it made his e3 pawn a weakness. But it DOES NOT prevent my N to be played, still (Nd7, dxc6, Ne5, threatening the Q, Q moves, Nxc6 and it same as before: white just has BxN and it is bad. My b7 pawn would be my Life assurance while I play. b4 is impossible, and I can now press Bb4, threatening Bxe4. But he would have castled, and my pressure would fade. He has now Nf4, too. A whole other word."
22,Qe5,e7e5,rn2k2r/pp3p1p/2p2pb1/2bPq3/4P3/2N2QP1/PPP1NPBP/R3K2R w KQkq - 1 12,"Inviting Na4, Bd6. Now that d4 is covered by the Q. white's best: o-o-o, adding pressure on the column. IMO!"
23,O-O,e1g1,rn2k2r/pp3p1p/2p2pb1/2bPq3/4P3/2N2QP1/PPP1NPBP/R4RK1 b kq - 2 12,"If the suboptimal had been played I ""must"" take advantage of it. I have to live without the Bb4 plan, now useless. So I have to try the only attack I have left:"
