I considered Bishop to g5 however I was concerned the bishop might end up becoming trapped by a pawn push, and I don't want to use the safety net around my King just yet just to defend a bishop.  But....I was mistaken, the bishop would have had an easy exit on the h4 diagonal....I failed to spot ths at the time."
