1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"One the always dangerous past pawn - which I had two of in this game
The power a pawn sac can give your other pieces by opening lines for bishops - in this game my opponent did not take the pawn and allowed my to get the past pawns but I still got to open the lines!!  Thanks to my friend WINECAPE who showed me this in one of his other games I will be using that trick more often!!! 

This was a rematch, I was one pawn up in the 1st game when I grabbed another pawn and my opponent split my queen and King with a bishop and accordingly I resigned the game. Greed - still one of the 7 deadly sins!!

I wanted to show the power a pawns in this game in two ways."
