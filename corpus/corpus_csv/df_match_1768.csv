1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This was an unrated training game. Non the less it was very hard fought. In the opening early middlegame white has a small plus than by the late middlegame black had turned it around and had the advantage. In the transition from middlegame into the endgame white regained the advantage and went on to convert for the full point.
