1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"this game has some personal notes here and there; white is a player I battled on 3+10 blitz... I unexpectedly won a couple of games, so he trashed me back, which spurred him to challenge me to an unrated fight outside of blitz; so I complied, being rogue 1200 and all... for good measure: this full blood Sicilian fight is classified as ECO A40, unusual replies to 1. d4... Thanks a lot to Bert from Bay of Plenty, NZ... ;)"
