1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I've been exploring some Gambit's lately and playing them in blitz games here and on ICC, not sure about the advisability of playing them during a longer time constraint as that gives the opponent enough time to respond with the best move, catch up in development, and hold advantage until the endgame. This game was played on Gameknot."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,I think that my opponent was not extremely familiar with the Budapest as he spent a lot of time in almost all subsequent moves.

6,Ng4,f6g4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/2P3n1/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"3... Ne4 is also an interesting move. With Ng4 black intends to regain the pawn, but Ne4 intends fierce battle."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/2P3n1/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,A clear threat on f2. 5. e3 is pretty much forced and the black bishop has a harder time getting developed. In addition to speeding his development with the gambit black also inhibits White's development.
