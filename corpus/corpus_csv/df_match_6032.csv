1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

It has been quite a while since I have annotated a game, although I have been away on holiday for the best part of August and it has taken me a little while to get back into the swing of things.  However, I am pleased to report a good win with the white pieces in the Master Mater's Annotation's Project Part 3.  I will now give you the Gameknot Analysis link to enable you to follow this game more easily.  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=14263663&rnd=0.8295382966212421.  I will then begin my commentary on Move 8."

The other alternatives are Kd6 (not good because it does expose the BK on the open d column) and Ke1 which could allow repetition.  Black must be careful after white whips off the black knight because my steed on g5 threatens to deliver a Royal Fork on e6.
