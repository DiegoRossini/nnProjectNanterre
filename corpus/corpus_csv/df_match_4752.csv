1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

..... in this game I managed to stay alert and patient and I tried something on the kingside late on in the endgame and it worked!  Yup, I have conceded a couple of low draws lately in my rated games because there seemed to be no way whatsoever of forcing a victory (and one of those low draws was against Delta the Master Blaster who I knew not to mess with!).  Class B and C players are certainly capable of nasty things against me, so I know when to hold out the olive branch.  However, in this case I got lucky.  Here is how it goes (it starts off with a Scandinavian/Centre Counter Defense with 1. e4 d5) and here is the gameknot analysis.http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=16301005&rnd=0.1441176371074478"
