1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I wanted to play a classical opening, something computers are excellent at dealing with."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,We begin with a Russian Opening. Excalibur seems to love countering e4 with this.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,We begin with a Russian Opening. Excalibur seems to love countering e4 with this.

5,Nxe5,f3e5,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"My response is the most logical, the e-pawns are exchanged, and both sides have playable positions."
6,d6,d7d6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Here we see how Black decides to entrench the knight on e4, a key feature of the classical Russian."
7,Nf3,e5f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"Here we see how Black decides to entrench the knight on e4, a key feature of the classical Russian."

9,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/3Pn3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"Here we see how Black decides to entrench the knight on e4, a key feature of the classical Russian."
10,d5,d6d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3Pn3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Here we see how Black decides to entrench the knight on e4, a key feature of the classical Russian."
11,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3Pn3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"This line already offers the potential to follow the path of the game Browne-Bisguier (US Champ. 1974) whereby Browne played the aesthetic and amazing 14.Bh6!... In response the line stemming from 6...Be7. If you haven't seen this game, please research it - it's an amazing demonstration of chess skill."
12,Bd6,f8d6,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/3b4/3p4/3Pn3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 7,"Black pursues the most common line, and shoots at my kingside. The bishop also compromises f4, and controls several queenside sqaures. 6...Be7 would follow the Browne-Bisguier line."
13,O-O,e1g1,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/3b4/3p4/3Pn3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 3 7,"Although the best line, you can't help but feel a little uncomfortable with a bishop and an active knight crawling nereby the kingside."
14,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/3b4/3p4/3Pn3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 4 8,"Black replies in kind. However, it should be noted that as Black's dark-squared bishop attacks h2, My light-squared bishop attacks h7 in an 'x-ray' attack through the knight."
15,c4,c2c4,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/3b4/3p4/2PPn3/3B1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 0 8,"My prediction is a swap-off on c4 (in the future when Black either solidifies or saves the e4-knight) due to Excalibur's - and indeed several computers - tendency to create isolated pawns. Nonetheless, this move undermines Black's knight's defender."
16,Be6,c8e6,rn1q1rk1/ppp2ppp/3bb3/3p4/2PPn3/3B1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 1 9,"Black deviates from the main line, as computers do. More common and preferred here is the Marshall trap - ( 8...Bg4 9. cxd5 f5 10. Re1 Bxh2+) which is seen as hugely powerful for Black, but still advantageous in some positional aspects for White."
17,Re1,f1e1,rn1q1rk1/ppp2ppp/3bb3/3p4/2PPn3/3B1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQR1K1 b - - 2 9,Continuing to pressure Black's naturally advanced yet fragile Russian centre.
18,Bb4,d6b4,rn1q1rk1/ppp2ppp/4b3/3p4/1bPPn3/3B1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQR1K1 w - - 3 10,"Black starts the fun. Playing 10. Re2... would compromise position, and one variation leads to the loss of the d-pawn (10. Nbd2 Bxd2 11. Bxd2 Nxd2 12. Nxd2 dxc4 13. [B/N]xc4 Qxd4 -/+) leaving Black with a material bonus. In my opinion, this move lays out a dwonfall for Black positionally. 9...f5 looked more tantalising, and the e4-knight would have held under it."
19,cxd5,c4d5,rn1q1rk1/ppp2ppp/4b3/3P4/1b1Pn3/3B1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQR1K1 b - - 0 10,"I choose on complicating matters, and attacking two minor pieces in exchange for a rook appears positive given my central minor-piece positioning."
20,Nxf2,e4f2,rn1q1rk1/ppp2ppp/4b3/3P4/1b1P4/3B1N2/PP3nPP/RNBQR1K1 w - - 0 11,"Recapturing with the king is superior than 12. Qxe1... which would cause the queen to be displaced soon enough by a Black rook on e8. Also, recapturing with the f3-knight would essentially 'undevelop' the piece, and open up the king drastically."
21,Kxf2,g1f2,rn1q1rk1/ppp2ppp/4b3/3P4/1b1P4/3B1N2/PP3KPP/RNBQR3 b - - 0 11,"Recapturing with the king is superior than 12. Qxe1... which would cause the queen to be displaced soon enough by a Black rook on e8. Also, recapturing with the f3-knight would essentially 'undevelop' the piece, and open up the king drastically."
22,Bxe1+,b4e1,rn1q1rk1/ppp2ppp/4b3/3P4/3P4/3B1N2/PP3KPP/RNBQb3 w - - 0 12,"Recapturing with the king is superior than 12. Qxe1... which would cause the queen to be displaced soon enough by a Black rook on e8. Also, recapturing with the f3-knight would essentially 'undevelop' the piece, and open up the king drastically."
23,Kxe1,f2e1,rn1q1rk1/ppp2ppp/4b3/3P4/3P4/3B1N2/PP4PP/RNBQK3 b - - 0 12,"Recapturing with the king is superior than 12.

24,Bxd5,e6d5,rn1q1rk1/ppp2ppp/8/3b4/3P4/3B1N2/PP4PP/RNBQK3 w - - 0 13,"At the end of the exchange, I have given a rook and a pawn for a knight and a bishop. This exchange is usually beneficial, since two minor pieces should in theory control more squares than a rook, and are also more manoeuvreable. 
    Secondly, Black threatens material gain with 13...Bxf3 followed by 14...Qxd4. However, an exchange on f3 would leave me with several far-reaching pieces in the centre of the board, attacking at both the kingside and queenside."
25,Be3,c1e3,rn1q1rk1/ppp2ppp/8/3b4/3P4/3BBN2/PP4PP/RN1QK3 b - - 1 13,"Development of the bishop not only defends the vulnerable d4-pawn, but also continues to aim at the kingside."
26,Re8,f8e8,rn1qr1k1/ppp2ppp/8/3b4/3P4/3BBN2/PP4PP/RN1QK3 w - - 2 14,"A wise move on Black's part. Since Black has no viable central pawns to advance, he makes the most of the open d+e files and attacks down them. The rook move renders the e3-bishop useless. Whilst I attack from the centre, Black fires upon me from afar."
27,Kf2,e1f2,rn1qr1k1/ppp2ppp/8/3b4/3P4/3BBN2/PP3KPP/RN1Q4 b - - 3 14,"Oddly enough, I would count this as a development move. My king can't waste time to escape behing the g + h pawns, so I make the most of him. He holds the centre together."
28,Bxf3,d5f3,rn1qr1k1/ppp2ppp/8/8/3P4/3BBb2/PP3KPP/RN1Q4 w - - 0 15,"Black completes my vision of three long-ranged pieces, with potential across the board. The centre is under my command, with the exception of the d5-sqaure which is attacked by both queens. Potential targets are b7, f7 and h7, all potentially realised by my three pieces."
29,Qxf3,d1f3,rn1qr1k1/ppp2ppp/8/8/3P4/3BBQ2/PP3KPP/RN6 b - - 0 15,"Black completes my vision of three long-ranged pieces, with potential across the board.

30,Qh4+,d8h4,rn2r1k1/ppp2ppp/8/8/3P3q/3BBQ2/PP3KPP/RN6 w - - 1 16,"Black scrambles for position, and develops his queen to an active post."
