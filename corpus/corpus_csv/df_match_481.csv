8,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQ - 1 5,He continues with the Main Line.
9,Bd3,f1d3,rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2NBP3/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQ - 2 5,Preparing to bring my Ng1 to e2.
10,c5,c7c5,rnbq1rk1/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/1bPP4/2NBP3/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQ - 0 6,He strikes at my centre.
11,Nge2,g1e2,rnbq1rk1/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/1bPP4/2NBP3/PP2NPPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 1 6,I continue with my plan.
12,d5,d7d5,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/1bPP4/2NBP3/PP2NPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 7,"He makes another central advance. This is similar to another recent game I played, against the lovely penelope80, but in that game she played d5 earlier, so I didn't have to worry about black doubling my c pawns with BxNc3 as I could always undouble the pawns by exchanging on d5, and so I was able to develop my Ng1 to the more active square of f3. For this reason, I think the move order played by Mike Williams is better.

13,a3,a2a3,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/1bPP4/P1NBP3/1P2NPPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 7,So I hit his bishop.
14,Bxc3+,b4c3,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/2PP4/P1bBP3/1P2NPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 8,He takes with check. I thought long and hard about which piece to recapture with here. Eventually I played......
15,Nxc3,e2c3,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/2PP4/P1NBP3/1P3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 8,This seemed better as to not have doubled pawns. In fact I found out later that taking back with the b pawn is more popular. I may well try that if I reach this position again.
16,Nc6,b8c6,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2pp4/2PP4/P1NBP3/1P3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 1 9,"He is now threatening exchanges ending up with him winning a pawn on d4. This seems to me to be a strong developing move, but in fact in the opening databases I have, black has played 8....cxd4 here."

20,Qa5,d8a5,r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/q1P5/2B5/P1N1P3/1P3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 1 11,I did now consider an exchange sacrifice. 11. b4 Nxb4 12. axb4 Qxa1 13. Qc2 and I am threatening to trap his queen with 0-0 and Bb2. Unfortunately he has 13.....Nd5! with advantage to black. So instead I played a more obvious move....

25,Ba2,c4a2,r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/2q1n3/8/P1N1P3/BP2QPPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 3 13,"Bishop drops back. Although white is now confined to the back three ranks, white can now develop with tempo, attacking the black queen, and black's advanced knight can also be driven back with gain of time, if necessary. I think white has a small edge."
