Actually I like to play against it since I can move my Bishop to c4 (Steinitz variation) while the Black's darksquared bishop is locked."

7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 4,"I decided on 4 Nc3 which is still quite common as far as I know. Obviously d3 would allow white to bring his second Bishop in.
(The game DB statistics says Nc3 is the most common, however d3 seems to be more successful. Another option listed there is d4 which looks really interesting to me :))"
8,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/2B1P1b1/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 4 5,This move seems to be rather uncommon in the db. I'm not sure why. :) Perhaps Be7 is preferred because it strengthens the safety of the King.
9,d3,d2d3,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/2B1P1b1/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"My opponent had no threats against me, so I choose not to castle and instead allow the Bishop to develop."
10,Bxf3,g4f3,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/2B1P3/2NP1b2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"I think trading the Bishop for the knight was possible but I think it weakens Black's position. Now black is obviously behind in development, gave me the freedom to think about castling on the queen's side and thereby to strengthen an attack on his king's side."
11,Qxf3,d1f3,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/2B1P3/2NP1Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 0 6,"I think trading the Bishop for the knight was possible but I think it weakens Black's position.

13,g4,g2g4,rn1qkb1r/ppp2pp1/3p1n1p/4p3/2B1P1P1/2NP1Q2/PPP2P1P/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 0 7,This move was just damn tempting to me. The knight can't move so let's try to attack it. (Note that this attack was only made possible because black traded his bishop for my knight.)
14,Qe7,d8e7,rn2kb1r/ppp1qpp1/3p1n1p/4p3/2B1P1P1/2NP1Q2/PPP2P1P/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 1 8,Black sees the problem and strengthens f7. Now his Bishop is totally locked up and I thought that perhaps he wants to castle on the queen's side.
