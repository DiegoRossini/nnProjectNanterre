1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Both compete for center control.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Both compete for center control.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"I was torn between Nf6, Nc6, d6, and d5. d5 seemed good; I would equalize if he took either pawn. Nc6 seemed to defensive -- not my playing style, though I have played it many times. d6 is perhaps the most passive at all, and blocks my Bishop. Nf6, however, seemed like it would be fun (it was a blitz game anyway :P) and aggressive...nice!"

9,Nxe5,f3e5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3nN3/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"But instead of forcing his Knight away, I play Be6, because I did not like the possibility of a fork on the f7 square."

18,O-O-O,e8c8,2kr3r/ppp2ppp/2nbbq2/3n4/2B5/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 w - - 3 10,"Look at the development: white is castled, has a Knight out, and is up a pawn. Black has all of his minor pieces out, his King is castled, but he is down a pawn. As we all know, especially in blitz games, a superior lead in development often bests a slight material advantage. Now, white will scramble to catch up."
