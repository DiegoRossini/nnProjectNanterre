1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"On Black's 15th move he creates a strange ""force field"" around his king which serves as a more powerful protecting wall than any standard castle could provide.  It is almost an invisible electric fence around his exposed, stuck-in-the-center king.  I annotated this game to get some thoughts from other players regarding this bizarre chess phenomenon."
