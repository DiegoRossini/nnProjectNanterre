1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

My Class C opponent, Manhattan (Janis) gave me a right run for my money in this game.  He seemed to have much the better of things in the middlegame and I fell into a combo which dropped me the exchange.  However, I did manage to salvage two pawns for the exchange and after a queen trade, I found myself with a decisive central pawn push which reduced my opponent's rook to extreme passivity.  One pawn did manage to reach Glendadom.  Although the WK could remove Glenda from the board, he would have to lose his rook in the first place, leaving me a piece and a pawn (a passer at that) to the good.  My opponent waved the white flag.  Gameknot Analysis is provided here:- http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15749719&rnd=0.12065503177682513"
