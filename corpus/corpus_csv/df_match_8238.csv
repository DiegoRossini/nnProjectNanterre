1,d3,d2d3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/3P4/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is another game between 2 friends that I said I would annotate. Any comments would be most gratefully received.

Personally I am not keen on this opening as it means whites light squared bishop (lsb) is going to take at least two moves to get out - e.g. g3...Bg2, I am however no expert on openings."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/3P4/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"An agressive start by black

This already takes us out of the Gameknot database"

5,Na3,b1a3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/3p4/N2P1N2/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"Generally this is not a good move as it restricts the mobility of the knight, an alternative for white would be Nb-d2 but that would then mean both the white bishops were obstructed, for me the better options would be g3 - looking for Bg2, or e4"
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/8/3p4/N2P1N2/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,preparing e5
7,c3,c2c3,r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/8/3p4/N1PP1N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,opens a line to a4 for the queen which would pin c6
8,e5,e7e5,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/4p3/3p4/N1PP1N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"This gives black space to move, it opens a line for his dsb and his queen"
9,Nc4,a3c4,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/4p3/2Np4/2PP1N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"This is a tough one as it puts a poorly placed piece into a much better position, however white's efforts should be spent on developing his bishops. This move also breaks the unwritten rule about never moving a piece twice before you have completed development"
10,Bd6,f8d6,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2nb4/4p3/2Np4/2PP1N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,"Blacks bishop feels slightly awkward to me now i.e. its scope feels limited, I would have been tempted by e4 which might give something like 
6.	dxe4	dxc3
7.	Qxd8+	Nxd8
8.	bxc3	
which would give white some significant problems with his pawn structure with the compensation that he could grab some half open files"
11,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2nb4/4p1B1/2Np4/2PP1N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 3 6,"This is a weak threat, although it develops the bishop with tempo it allows black to develop as he may have wished to anyway"
12,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2nb1n2/4p1B1/2Np4/2PP1N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 4 7,"This is a very early (and perhaps premature) queen move, it means black can gain tempo by attacking the queen. White should be looking to develop his f1 bishop"
13,Qa4,d1a4,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2nb1n2/4p1B1/Q1Np4/2PP1N2/PP2PPPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 5 7,"This is a very early (and perhaps premature) queen move, it means black can gain tempo by attacking the queen. White should be looking to develop his f1 bishop"
14,h6,h7h6,r1bqk2r/ppp2pp1/2nb1n1p/4p1B1/Q1Np4/2PP1N2/PP2PPPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 8,"This seems a wasted move by black, it weakens his king side pawn structure where he should be looking to castle, the white dsb is less threatening than the queen. Another possibility is a6 looking for the fork with b5 and threatening a pawn attack on the queenside"
15,Bd2,g5d2,r1bqk2r/ppp2pp1/2nb1n1p/4p3/Q1Np4/2PP1N2/PP1BPPPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 1 8,Perhaps better would be h4 maintaining pressure on the knight. If black attacked with g5 castling on the king side would be risky at best
16,Bd7,c8d7,r2qk2r/pppb1pp1/2nb1n1p/4p3/Q1Np4/2PP1N2/PP1BPPPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 2 9,Breaks the pin.
17,e3,e2e3,r2qk2r/pppb1pp1/2nb1n1p/4p3/Q1Np4/2PPPN2/PP1B1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 9,"I don't really understand this move, white knows that black is unlikely to take it. If whites next move is exd4 the e rank will be opened exposing his king"
18,Nb4,c6b4,r2qk2r/pppb1pp1/3b1n1p/4p3/QnNp4/2PPPN2/PP1B1PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 1 10,"Revealed attack on the white queen, this is a mistake from black as he loses material"

20,cxd6,c7d6,r2qk2r/pp1b1pp1/3p1n1p/4p3/Qn1p4/2PPPN2/PP1B1PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 11,This is a poor move from black though it does undouble his pawns

24,Bc6,d7c6,r2qk2r/pp3pp1/2bp1n1p/4p3/1Q6/2PPBN2/PP3PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 1 13,defends the b pawn and the d pawn from the white queen
25,Be2,f1e2,r2qk2r/pp3pp1/2bp1n1p/4p3/1Q6/2PPBN2/PP2BPPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 2 13,White has nearly completed his development and should look to castle soon
26,Nd5,f6d5,r2qk2r/pp3pp1/2bp3p/3np3/1Q6/2PPBN2/PP2BPPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 3 14,Threatening the g pawn
27,Qg4,b4g4,r2qk2r/pp3pp1/2bp3p/3np3/6Q1/2PPBN2/PP2BPPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 4 14,Threatening the g pawn
