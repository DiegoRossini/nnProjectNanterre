1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I am white and fungi is black. This game I tried something new. I use reverse psychology on fungi to try make it seem like did know what doing by making bad moves but it was all part of my plan. This was a hard game but some how I was able to pull off a win. This was one of the hardest games I ever played. King pawn  opeaning.
