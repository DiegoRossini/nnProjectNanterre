2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Standard responce. most players will revert to basic opening principals when facing an unfamiliar opening. this move is follows those principals pretty well.
3,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/5P2/4P3/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Whites plan is to control the central dark squares with both pawns and his fianchettoed dark square bishop
4,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/5P2/4P3/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"the position is now a reversed dutch setup. this must be good for white as this is totally playable as black, white just needs to find a useful move for the extra tempo."
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/5P2/4PN2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"leaving the bishop inside the pawn chain. slightly passive but by no means bad, the light squared bishop can often find useful employment on the queenside."
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/2pp4/5P2/4PN2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,"leaving the bishop inside the pawn chain. slightly passive but by no means bad, the light squared bishop can often find useful employment on the queenside."

9,Bb2,c1b2,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2pp4/5P2/1P2PN2/PBPP2PP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,as the position is quite closed white can afford to reposition this knight this early in the game
10,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2pp4/5P2/1P2PN2/PBPP2PP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,as the position is quite closed white can afford to reposition this knight this early in the game

18,a6,a7a6,r2q1rk1/1p1bbppp/p1n1pn2/2pp4/5P2/1P1BPNN1/PBPP2PP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 10,white has declared his intentions to play on the kingside so black starts expanding on the queenside
19,O-O,e1g1,r2q1rk1/1p1bbppp/p1n1pn2/2pp4/5P2/1P1BPNN1/PBPP2PP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 10,white moves his king out of the centre and puts a rook on the f-file which is likely to become at least half open during the course of the game.
20,b5,b7b5,r2q1rk1/3bbppp/p1n1pn2/1ppp4/5P2/1P1BPNN1/PBPP2PP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 11,?! white attacks the black queenside pawns along with the black centre
21,c4,c2c4,r2q1rk1/3bbppp/p1n1pn2/1ppp4/2P2P2/1P1BPNN1/PB1P2PP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 11,?! white attacks the black queenside pawns along with the black centre
22,Nb4,c6b4,r2q1rk1/3bbppp/p3pn2/1ppp4/1nP2P2/1P1BPNN1/PB1P2PP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 1 12,this way black will have the bishop pair to compensate for his weak c pawn when he opens the game up with exchanges on c4
23,Qb1,d1b1,r2q1rk1/3bbppp/p3pn2/1ppp4/1nP2P2/1P1BPNN1/PB1P2PP/RQ3RK1 b - - 2 12,"? should have moved the bishop, i missed the nice little tactic white has after exchanging the bishop"
24,Nxd3,b4d3,r2q1rk1/3bbppp/p3pn2/1ppp4/2P2P2/1P1nPNN1/PB1P2PP/RQ3RK1 w - - 0 13,? threatening to exchange queens when the position opens up which will give black the d file for one of his rooks which will then point at whites weak d-pawn. however black could bag a pawn here by 13...dxc4 14.bxc4 bxc4 when Qxc4 runs into Bb5 although black might have trouble holding on to it in the long run black will definatly get a better position after white tries to win the pawn back
25,Qxd3,b1d3,r2q1rk1/3bbppp/p3pn2/1ppp4/2P2P2/1P1QPNN1/PB1P2PP/R4RK1 b - - 0 13,? threatening to exchange queens when the position opens up which will give black the d file for one of his rooks which will then point at whites weak d-pawn. however black could bag a pawn here by 13...dxc4 14.bxc4 bxc4 when Qxc4 runs into Bb5 although black might have trouble holding on to it in the long run black will definatly get a better position after white tries to win the pawn back
26,Bc6,d7c6,r2q1rk1/4bppp/p1b1pn2/1ppp4/2P2P2/1P1QPNN1/PB1P2PP/R4RK1 w - - 1 14,? threatening to exchange queens when the position opens up which will give black the d file for one of his rooks which will then point at whites weak d-pawn. however black could bag a pawn here by 13...dxc4 14.bxc4 bxc4 when Qxc4 runs into Bb5 although black might have trouble holding on to it in the long run black will definatly get a better position after white tries to win the pawn back
27,Ne5,f3e5,r2q1rk1/4bppp/p1b1pn2/1pppN3/2P2P2/1P1QP1N1/PB1P2PP/R4RK1 b - - 2 14,"simple way to counter the threat, forcing the bishop to retreat and preventing any future skewering of the queen and rook with Bb5"
28,Be8,c6e8,r2qbrk1/4bppp/p3pn2/1pppN3/2P2P2/1P1QP1N1/PB1P2PP/R4RK1 w - - 3 15,"? i think Qe2 was required here, black has a definate plus after dxc4"
29,Rac1,a1c1,r2qbrk1/4bppp/p3pn2/1pppN3/2P2P2/1P1QP1N1/PB1P2PP/2R2RK1 b - - 4 15,"? i think Qe2 was required here, black has a definate plus after dxc4"

31,Rc2,c1c2,r3brk1/4bppp/p3pn2/qpppN3/2P2P2/1P1QP1N1/PBRP2PP/5RK1 b - - 6 16,now that dxc4 is no threat i decide im going to double rooks on the c file and then open the centre in a way favourable to myself as it seems inevitable that the game will soon become quite open
32,Rd8,a8d8,3rbrk1/4bppp/p3pn2/qpppN3/2P2P2/1P1QP1N1/PBRP2PP/5RK1 w - - 7 17,renewing the threat of dxc4
33,Bc3,b2c3,3rbrk1/4bppp/p3pn2/qpppN3/2P2P2/1PBQP1N1/P1RP2PP/5RK1 b - - 8 17,"?! prehaps not the most productive move, it just gives black the chance to reposition his queen"
34,b4,b5b4,3rbrk1/4bppp/p3pn2/q1ppN3/1pP2P2/1PBQP1N1/P1RP2PP/5RK1 w - - 0 18,?! blocking up the position surely favours white even though black has a space advantage it is difficult to exploit in a closed position.
