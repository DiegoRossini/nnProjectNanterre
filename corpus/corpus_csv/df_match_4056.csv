2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I play my usual
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,He follows the main line

5,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"He opts for the main line, the open variation"
6,cxd4,c5d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,I take
7,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,He takes back
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,I hit the e pawn
9,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,He defends
10,d6,d7d6,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,I prevent him exchanging on c6 followed by e5
11,Be2,f1e2,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"This in line with my 38th annotated game. At that point I commented ""I was quite relieved to see this move, as it is less aggresive than Bc4 or Bg5. The other moves are more popular and score better on the Gameknot World Database."""
12,e5,e7e5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2np1n2/4p3/3NP3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"As I said ""The Boleslavsky variation, Black puts up with a weak pawn on d6 and a weak square on d5, but in return has central control."""
13,Nb3,d4b3,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2np1n2/4p3/4P3/1NN5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,"""This was considered the best square to retreat the knight to, although recently Nf3 is becoming more popular - and scoring well."""
14,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2np1n2/4p3/4P3/1NN5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 8,"In the other game, I played Be6 first, but I don't think it makes much difference black plays the moves in."
15,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2np1n2/4p3/4P3/1NN5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 3 8,He castles
16,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2np1n2/4p3/4P3/1NN5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 4 9,I castle
17,Be3,c1e3,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2np1n2/4p3/4P3/1NN1B3/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 5 9,"Jim admitted afterwards he was a bit behind with opening theory. I personally think that stronger is f4 as in the previously mentioned game. Black then usually exchanges on f4 (otherwise he may be crushed on the kingside if f4-f5 is allowed). Although black has a weak, isolated pawn on d6, black can play a knight to e5, maybe his bishop to f6. Chances are balanced. Be6 is in fact more common according to the opening databases."
18,Be6,c8e6,r2q1rk1/pp2bppp/2npbn2/4p3/4P3/1NN1B3/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 6 10,"This seemed to me to be logical development, but I see in the opening databases that a5 is more usually played, and scores better."
19,Qe1,d1e1,r2q1rk1/pp2bppp/2npbn2/4p3/4P3/1NN1B3/PPP1BPPP/R3QRK1 b - - 7 10,"Presumably he is dreaming of f3 or f4 and moving the queen to the kingside, and maybe playing Rd1. I decide to attack c2. I found out afterwards that of the 170 games in the Gameknot world database, only one game with Qe1, Gumula, Daniel (2153) vs. Smagacz, Dariusz (2222), which continued with a5 11. Rd1 Nb4 12. Rd2 Qc7 13. Qd1 a4 14. Nc1 a3 15. Nb5 Qc6 16. bxa3 Nxa2 17. Nxa2 Bxa2 18. Nxd6 Be6 19. Bb5 Qc7 20. Bg5 Bxd6 21. Bxf6 Bxa3 22. Bh4 Bb4 23. Rd3 Ra5 24. Bd7 Bc4 25. Rg3 Bxf1 26. Rxg7+  1-0. I think my move is an improvement, what do you think dear reader?"
20,Nb4,c6b4,r2q1rk1/pp2bppp/3pbn2/4p3/1n2P3/1NN1B3/PPP1BPPP/R3QRK1 w - - 8 11,So what does he do about this?
