I could have maintained the symmetry for another move, however I felt it best to be the first one to strike since I can easily castle at a moments notice I'm unlikely to run into any trouble by having an uncastled king.

The first suspect move, There are a number of different ways for white to organise their pieces right now as well as a number of different plans to adopt. I'm not going to give y opinion on which is best since there are many plausible options, however I do feel that in most cases the rook will end up being misplaced here since this move doesn't really help achieve anything, basically I think its a waste of time, as white should keep the rooks options open until its clear where it does belong. obviously this is not a big deal though I just think there were more accurate moves available"

You will find my knight make this journey in a decent amount of my games, especially in English positions I find that from c7 (normally I arrive via f6-e8-c7) I have the advantage of keeping my bishops diagonal clear, I also keep an eye on b5 which may help facilitate a b pawn advance and the big one is also that it give me a route to e6 which can be a great square in these positions since often having both knights with their sites on d4 is beneficial especially in cases where whites already committed the e pawn to advancing two squares"

Now one possible plan is to try to control d4 which would fix whites d pawn in place, one way to do this is to get my e6 knight out of the way then follow up with ...e5, I still need to be careful about whites ideas though, if white successfully breaks at my c pawn with b4 then fixing d3 will be a little harder.
