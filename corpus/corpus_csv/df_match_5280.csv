1,c3,c2c3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/2P5/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The Saragossa can be quite dangerous as a transposition opening. For instance it is plausible that after d5 or d5 White could play c4 and transpose to a symmetrical English or Benoni respectively with colours reversed. Similarly after e5 a Sicilian is reached, this is why I like to play Nf6 and retain flexibility"
