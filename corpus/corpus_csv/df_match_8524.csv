1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is a random game I picked to annotate: the title ""Randomly Picked..."" describes how I came to annotate it, not the moves that were played :-). Anyway, White opens with queen pawn, my favourite..."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,The overwhelmingly preferred move in this position: the Queen's Gambit. White intends to draw Black's central pawn onto the wing and grab a lion's share of the centre.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,The overwhelmingly preferred move in this position: the Queen's Gambit. White intends to draw Black's central pawn onto the wing and grab a lion's share of the centre.
4,dxc4,d5c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2pP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Black accepts. ""A good idea if you like counterattacking, but if White plays accurately he will keep the advantage for a long time"" (GM Yasser Seirawan)."
5,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2pPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,My preferred move: immediately seizing the centre. 3.Nf3 is quieter and more flexible. 3.e4 also puts immediate pressure on Black's c4-pawn.
6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/2pPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Much stronger is 3...e5, immediately counterattacking in the centre. Winning the e-pawn 4.dxe5 is a weak move as after 4...Qxd1+ 5.Kxd1 Nc6 Black has the advantage. 3...e6 is more passive, and also allows to develop a bishop and recapture the pawn."
7,Bxc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/2BPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 4,"So, Black recaptures the pawn, and doesn't need to waste a move to do it."
8,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2p5/2BPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,Black's plan in many QGA positions: to counterattack and restore equilibrium with ...c5. Although this is generally played when White goes for the quieter 3.e3.
9,d5,d4d5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2pP4/2B1P3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,"White pushes a well-defended pawn into Black's territory. I usually play this as 4.d5 after 3.e4 e5, to attempt to hold my central gains."
10,exd5,e6d5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/8/2pp4/2B1P3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,"White's bishop has a dominant central position, and is slightly ahead on development."
11,Bxd5,c4d5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/8/2pB4/4P3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 6,"White's bishop has a dominant central position, and is slightly ahead on development."
12,Qd7,d8d7,rnb1kbnr/pp1q1ppp/8/2pB4/4P3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 7,"A weak move...I think... - I can see no reason for Black to spend a tempo on a small queen move, and block his bishop. This allows White to claim a greater lead in development."
13,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1kbnr/pp1q1ppp/8/2pB4/4P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 2 7,"Holds onto White's central gains, and claims a clear lead in development."
14,Nf6,g8f6,rnb1kb1r/pp1q1ppp/5n2/2pB4/4P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 3 8,"Seems natural: keeping pressure on White's dominant central position, and developing a piece. Perhaps he should have played 6...Nf6."
15,Nf3,g1f3,rnb1kb1r/pp1q1ppp/5n2/2pB4/4P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 4 8,Removing the annoyingly powerful bishop.
16,Nxd5,f6d5,rnb1kb1r/pp1q1ppp/8/2pn4/4P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,Removing the annoyingly powerful bishop.
17,Nxd5,c3d5,rnb1kb1r/pp1q1ppp/8/2pN4/4P3/5N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 9,"9.exd5 and White has an extremely weak d-pawn: isolated AND extended. This move keeps White's pawns together and puts a powerful knight in the centre - an outpost, as no Black pawns can attack it. Am I overrating the power of a minor piece in the open centre?"
18,Bd6,f8d6,rnb1k2r/pp1q1ppp/3b4/2pN4/4P3/5N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 10,Develops a piece.

Granted, Black's bishops are very powerful on their diagonals, but Black's kingside is cracked open, and since White retains his queen he will hold an advantage if he goes for a kingside attack. Black's minor pieces are also far from the kingside's defence. However, of course, if Black mobilises his defensive pieces quickly he will stand a good change of weathering the onslaught."

A strong move, gaining a tempo (unless Black wishes to lose even more material, in which case White can exchange off pieces and enter a won endgame) and forcing Black's king to stay exactly where he is: the f7-square cannot in the near future be used as an escape square, due to Black's doubled pawns. Black's king becomes a sitting target."
