1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"As before, the grades shown are converted from our ECF OTB grades.  This was quite a hairy game for me but ultimately very satisfying.  Unfortunately our team lost, again outgraded on most, if not all, boards.  White started with his d-pawn, which immediately had me planning my favourite King's Indian Defence, though given my recent trouble in a thematic mini-tournament here on Gameknot, I may have to change my habit."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"All standard stuff to here, though White often retains the option of an early f4 with 5. Be2 or goes for the Saemisch with 5.f3"

11,Bg5,c1g5,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/6B1/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 3 6,"?! but this was a surprise.  It struck me as premature.  Bg5 is frequently played to provoke Black into playing ...h6 so that after the B retreats to e3 and the Q lines up behind it, the pawn becomes a target for White's attack.  But I worked out that without a preparatory 6. h3, to prevent ...Ng4, White could be prevented from pursuing this line of attack, so I immediately prodded the B away with ..."
12,h6,h7h6,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppb1/3p1npp/6B1/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 7,!? The soundness of this move depends on the overall soundness of Black's idea.
13,Be3,g5e3,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppb1/3p1npp/8/2PPP3/2N1BN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 1 7,"!?  As in the early stages of an attempted English Attack against the Najdorf, this early second move with the knight, which defies opening principles, is justified, I think, by practical, tactical considerations.  I think that the way I was thinking owes a lot to playing here against Freddy (id=easy19)"
14,Ng4,f6g4,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppb1/3p2pp/8/2PPP1n1/2N1BN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 2 8,"!?  As in the early stages of an attempted English Attack against the Najdorf, this early second move with the knight, which defies opening principles, is justified, I think, by practical, tactical considerations.  I think that the way I was thinking owes a lot to playing here against Freddy (id=easy19)"
15,Bd2,e3d2,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppb1/3p2pp/8/2PPP1n1/2N2N2/PP1B1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 3 8,"! A standard advance in the King's Indian, even more powerful than usual because of the unimpeded support of the fianchettoed bishop and the Ng4."
16,e5,e7e5,rnbq1rk1/ppp2pb1/3p2pp/4p3/2PPP1n1/2N2N2/PP1B1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 9,"! A standard advance in the King's Indian, even more powerful than usual because of the unimpeded support of the fianchettoed bishop and the Ng4."
17,d5,d4d5,rnbq1rk1/ppp2pb1/3p2pp/3Pp3/2P1P1n1/2N2N2/PP1B1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 9,"?!  Played without any apparent thought by White, who thought much longer over most of his other moves.  It is oftne a knee-jerk reaction to Black's pawn advance but White often does better to delay closing the centre.  Instead he could have pushed at my Ng4 with 9. h3, causing the N to retreat and preventing Black's next."
18,f5,f7f5,rnbq1rk1/ppp3b1/3p2pp/3Ppp2/2P1P1n1/2N2N2/PP1B1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 10,"!  Normally, Black has to use several tempi, often manoeuvring his N to sub-optimal squares like e8, h7 or d7 (where it gets in the way of his other pieces) to get this move in.  Now I get it in nice and early and have the luxury of considering how to prosecute my attack quickly, before White has even castled."
19,h3,h2h3,rnbq1rk1/ppp3b1/3p2pp/3Ppp2/2P1P1n1/2N2N1P/PP1B1PP1/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 10,Too late.  The N is happy to retreat behind the pawn now.
20,Nf6,g4f6,rnbq1rk1/ppp3b1/3p1npp/3Ppp2/2P1P3/2N2N1P/PP1B1PP1/R2QKB1R w KQ - 1 11,"!?  An interesting choice which puts a question to Black: how to take back?  I don't think it is White's strongest move here though, which is probably either 11. Qc2 or 11. Bd3."
21,exf5,e4f5,rnbq1rk1/ppp3b1/3p1npp/3PpP2/2P5/2N2N1P/PP1B1PP1/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 11,"!?  An interesting choice which puts a question to Black: how to take back?  I don't think it is White's strongest move here though, which is probably either 11. Qc2 or 11. Bd3."
22,gxf5,g6f5,rnbq1rk1/ppp3b1/3p1n1p/3Ppp2/2P5/2N2N1P/PP1B1PP1/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 12,"!?  Books on the King's Indian have statements like ""Always take back with the pawn"" but of course there are exceptions based on concrete considerations of tactics.  Unable to find a strong justification for breaking the ""rule"" (ie some tactical triumph after playing 11...Bxf5), I went along with it.  The advantage of this is that the pawn retains a strong hold on e4 and Black has the options of advancing either pawn when it suits.  As usual, the QB stays at home as long as possible, ready to leap into action when the board clears a bit.  The disadvantage of this recapture is that it leaves the king feeling somewhat draughty.  You have to be brave to play th King's Indian!"
23,Be2,f1e2,rnbq1rk1/ppp3b1/3p1n1p/3Ppp2/2P5/2N2N1P/PP1BBPP1/R2QK2R b KQ - 1 12,"White develops his Bishop as if he is planning to castle kingside.  With Black's pawns poised on e5 and f5, he daren't post the B on d3 because of the fork on e4."
24,a5,a7a5,rnbq1rk1/1pp3b1/3p1n1p/p2Ppp2/2P5/2N2N1P/PP1BBPP1/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 13,"!?  Another thematic King's Indian move, played to discourage White expansion on the Queenside.  It's disadvantage is that the pawn can become loose when Black completes his Queenside development and that it leaves a nice square at b5 for White's Nc3 to occupy and harass Black's c7 and d6 pawns.  I planned at this stage to follow this up with ...Na6 and ...Nc4"
25,Qc2,d1c2,rnbq1rk1/1pp3b1/3p1n1p/p2Ppp2/2P5/2N2N1P/PPQBBPP1/R3K2R b KQ - 1 13,"but now I thought it would be useful to create an open file on which to attack this queen, so I played ..."
26,c6,c7c6,rnbq1rk1/1p4b1/2pp1n1p/p2Ppp2/2P5/2N2N1P/PPQBBPP1/R3K2R w KQ - 0 14,"?!  This, and its follow-up make Black's position very loose, which gave me a lot of heartache for most of the rest of the game.  I think it was unwise to change plans in mid-course."
27,dxc6,d5c6,rnbq1rk1/1p4b1/2Pp1n1p/p3pp2/2P5/2N2N1P/PPQBBPP1/R3K2R b KQ - 0 14,"?! Finally I decided where to put this N, having spent several minutes on several moves pondering its future deployment.  It looks a strong square for the N but my pawn structure is poor.  The pawn on d6 becomes very vulnerable and gets no support for a future advance to d5."
28,Nxc6,b8c6,r1bq1rk1/1p4b1/2np1n1p/p3pp2/2P5/2N2N1P/PPQBBPP1/R3K2R w KQ - 0 15,"?! Finally I decided where to put this N, having spent several minutes on several moves pondering its future deployment.  It looks a strong square for the N but my pawn structure is poor.  The pawn on d6 becomes very vulnerable and gets no support for a future advance to d5."
29,O-O-O,e1c1,r1bq1rk1/1p4b1/2np1n1p/p3pp2/2P5/2N2N1P/PPQBBPP1/2KR3R b - - 1 15,!?  An interesting choice with Black's lines already opening for the attack and Black's fianchettoed bishop aimed at the king's position.  The advantage is that it leaves White free to develop a kingside attack if he can.
30,Be6,c8e6,r2q1rk1/1p4b1/2npbn1p/p3pp2/2P5/2N2N1P/PPQBBPP1/2KR3R w - - 2 16,Taking aim at White's c4 pawn and through it at the a2 pawn.  Also blocking White's Queen's potential attack along the diagonal to my King.  The main purpose was to make way for a rook to come to c8 though.
31,Be3,d2e3,r2q1rk1/1p4b1/2npbn1p/p3pp2/2P5/2N1BN1P/PPQ1BPP1/2KR3R b - - 3 16,"! White opens up the file to attack the weak pawn on d6, tying Black's Queen to its defence"
32,Qe7,d8e7,r4rk1/1p2q1b1/2npbn1p/p3pp2/2P5/2N1BN1P/PPQ1BPP1/2KR3R w - - 4 17,Preparing to reinforce the defence of the pawn on d6 with a rook on d8.  I remember thinking long about which square to post the Queen on but I can't remember why I deemed c7 unsuitable... Sorry!  Getting the Q off the d-file also frees the Nc6 from defending the e-pawn (the d6 pawn gave no protection while pinned against the Q).
