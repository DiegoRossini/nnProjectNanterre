1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The is based on a real game I played with white. Aside from that, virtually all the details have been changed for the story.
The game is notable for how long it is. What is the longest game you have ever played dear reader?"
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"Where do you go for your holidays? I love going to Warmington-on-Sea chess tournaments. We play a move a day. 9am start. We have two hours each on our chess clocks, for 48 moves each. If it is not finished, we get 2 more hours each, adjourn for lunch and then play to a finish after lunch. I was amused to find myself drawn against a certain Span-ki-Moon. I was even more surprised when I met my opponent. She stood about 5’ 7” tall with jet black hair all the way down her back, with big brown eyes and skin so golden it seemed like a tan. When she smiled she had the most perfect teeth and lips I ever seen. She was dressed in the tightest blue jeans you could picture and a tee shirt that was skin tight. She was lovely!"
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"""Are you related to Ban Ki-moon I asked?"" half joking. ""No, he's from South Korea and I am from Thailand"" she replied. ""Bangkok?"" I asked her. ""No, I'm not kind of girl"" she smiled in reply. We exchanged a hand shake. Her hands were small and dainty and beautifully manicured. They felt soft and inviting. We held hands for just a moment longer than normal. It went through my mind how nice it would be to walk with her, holding that hand. I was a bit entranced by her, as we rattled the first few moves."
4,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Aha! Entering the Benoni-Benko complex of openings.
5,d5,d4d5,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2pP4/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,It was slightly off-putting playing her. The strong smell of her sweet perfume. This beautifully manicured hands reaching over the board.....
6,d6,d7d6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/2pP4/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,This move is probably necessary to prevent white from playing d6
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/2pP4/2P5/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,Nc3 prepares e4
8,e5,e7e5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3p1n2/2pPp3/2P5/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq e6 0 5,"And I call this the Czech Benoni, also sometimes known as the Hromadka Benoni. The Czech Benoni is much more solid than the Modern Benoni, but it is also more passive. Likely to lead to a long, slow, manoeuvring game. Perfect!"
9,e4,e2e4,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3p1n2/2pPp3/2P1P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,It is possible for black to also develop the bishop to g7.
10,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/3p1n2/2pPp3/2P1P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,It is possible for black to also develop the bishop to g7.

12,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qk2r/pp2bppp/3p1n2/2pPp3/2P1P1b1/2N3P1/PP3P1P/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 7,She looked at me with a little glee in her eye as she played this move. Surely she didn't think I would overlook an attack on my queen? I quickly played f3.
13,f3,f2f3,rn1qk2r/pp2bppp/3p1n2/2pPp3/2P1P1b1/2N2PP1/PP5P/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 7,And then I realised. My white squared bishop now would have very little scope. She clearly had brains as well as beauty!
14,Bd7,g4d7,rn1qk2r/pp1bbppp/3p1n2/2pPp3/2P1P3/2N2PP1/PP5P/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 8,And then I realised. My white squared bishop now would have very little scope. She clearly had brains as well as beauty!

16,Na6,b8a6,r2qk2r/pp1bbppp/n2p1n2/2pPp3/2P1P3/1QN2PP1/PP5P/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 3 9,"mmm there almost seems to be an offer of a draw here. If I take on b7 she has Nb4. 10. Kd1 Rb8 11. Qxa7 Ra8 12. Qb7 Rb8 and a sort of perpetual check on my queen. Now do I want to end this game with this stunning beauty opposite me? Not blinking likely! Let's see, a3 renews the threat of queen takes b7"
17,a3,a2a3,r2qk2r/pp1bbppp/n2p1n2/2pPp3/2P1P3/PQN2PP1/1P5P/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 0 9,So now she prevents the capture on b7
18,Rb8,a8b8,1r1qk2r/pp1bbppp/n2p1n2/2pPp3/2P1P3/PQN2PP1/1P5P/R1B1KBNR w KQk - 1 10,"So I decide to exchange my white squared bishop, which didn't have much scope anyway"

28,Na8,c7a8,nr3rk1/1p1qbppp/p2p1n2/P1pPp3/2P1P3/1QN2PP1/1P1B3P/R3K1NR w KQ - 1 15,It is almost as if she could read my mind! Black prepares to stop the white knight from going Nc3-a4-b6.

30,Qc8,d7c8,nrq2rk1/1p2bppp/p2p1n2/P1pPp3/N1P1P3/1Q3PP1/1P1B3P/R3K1NR w KQ - 3 16,So time to sort something out about my king....
