1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Had to annotate this one though my skills for annotation aren't the best my other annotation was more for humor than value but this was an interesting game in a mini tournament.  I recovered and won after blundering a great opportunity early on to get the queen.
I welcome all comments."
