1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Me and my opponent, Mattcarr, play each other regularly both on Gameknot and with a proper board and pieces. Due to Mattcarr's greater experience playing, the games usually go his way (such as, out of the 10 games we have played on Gameknot, he was won 8 of those), but recently, due to my own abilities improving and some teaching/training that he gave me, some of those games have become harder for him to win and 2 have gone my way. On the morning of December 25th, we decided upon a Christmas Game. This is the result of that game, and how I approached the game, which includes many swap offs, and a little fierce battle for center control near the end."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Here, I saw this layout and believed myself to be heading towards a Scotch opening. Though I like the Scotch personally when I'm playing as White, as Black I do not, as I believe it can give White an advantage having their Queen on D5. So I chose to counter, and take my Queen onto D5 instead by offering White the D file pawn."

4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"The use of the knight of course forces my Queen to retreat or be lost. At this stage of the game, I was not willing to lose my Queen for a Knight, so I of course chose to retreat, allowing White to control the center squares from afar."

8,Qd6,d5d6,rnb1kbnr/ppp2ppp/3q4/4p3/8/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,"Here I believe White to be offering his pawn for a later Queen exchange (exd4, 6. Qxd4 Qxd4, 7. Nxd4), but something I've learnt from my regular games with Mattcarr is that he won't offer a pawn without expecting to gain a greater reward a few moves in. So I chose not to take the bait, playing Nc6 instead to defend the e5 pawn and pose a faint attack on the d4 pawn."

10,Nc6,b8c6,r1b1kbnr/ppp2ppp/2nq4/4p3/3P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,"Here the first of only four checks in the game (including mate), a point piece swap off. My normal retaliation to this attack by Mattcarr is to take back with a pawn, which results in me having doubled up pawns. Today I had the Queen available to ensure the pawns didn't become doubled up unless absolutely necessary, which I did."

15,Nxe5,f3e5,r1b1kbnr/1pp2ppp/p1q5/4N3/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,"I don't understand this move. The Knight now poses a threat to the Black Queen, but the Queen has an obvious escape route to take the pawn back on G2, as well as further attacking Whites back ranks."
16,Qxg2,c6g2,r1b1kbnr/1pp2ppp/p7/4N3/3P4/2N5/PPP2PqP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,"Black's attack of White's back ranks is stopped with offering Queen Ultimatum. Again, a common theme in the games between myself and Mattcarr is the offering of Queens early in the game. Here, I would rather like to keep my Queen in an attacking mode, however, any square my Queen goes on will result in its loss. G file is covered by White's Queen, black squared bishop and the Knight on e5. Taking the Rook results in a Queen loss for Black, as does taking either of the two pawns. Moving to h3 would only prolong the maneuver, as White is clearly happy to do a Queen exchange. So with retreat out of the option, I chose to take White's offer of Queen swap."

I chose the Knight above the Bishops because the Knight could be kept safer on the 6th rank. It gave me a chance to see Whites next move and allow me to plan from there."

Luckily, my earlier choice of retreating the white squared Bishop to the H file provided defence to the f7 pawn. This helped as otherwise both my Rooks could be forked by Nxf7. Thankfully, I was able to attack the Knight without worry of this happening, or safe in the knowledge that if White did try it, I gained a free Knight out of it."
