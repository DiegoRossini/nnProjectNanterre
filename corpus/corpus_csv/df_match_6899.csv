1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

This is the third game in the sacrifices theme.  This is a team game.  I got paired up against an opponent nearly 40 points north of my rating.  All seemed lost in the middlegame when I blundered a pawn due to a tactical oversight.  I think this is the only the second time on gameknot I have blundered a pawn to a higher rated opponent and lived to tell the tale, the other was my first ever Master Draw.  So how did all this happen, well read on."
