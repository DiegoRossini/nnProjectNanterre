2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"My opponent meets me with a symmetrical move, which I believe is the best option for players experienced with the English.  It can develop in several very different ways from here, depending on how White chooses to go.  I like to do something fairly unusual when faced with this, the common responses being Nf3 which often is followed up by developing the d-pawn or Nc3 which signifies that White is happy with the symmetry for now and will continue his development."

According to the Gameknot database, Black wins 49% to White's 30% making it statistically a good response.  I had several considerations here, several different plans that I could work through.  Firstly, I considered Rb1, with the intention of a quick b4 to take initiative on the Queenside.  Of course, the Rook could just as easily stay where it is, moving a3 first before b4 and then Rb1 giving the same position (probably expect Black to go 6...a6?).  Another consideration was 6.e3 followed by 7.Nge2 and then either 8.d3 or 8.d4 depending on how Black has been responding.  Obviously I could go for 6.e4, which weakens the d4 square but makes it difficult for Black on the Kingside."

Gameknot's database considers this to be a poor move, Black wins 62% to White's 28%.  I agree with this, if an uninformed player goes for 6.d3 here he'll probably find himself in trouble, but someone familiar with English Opening has many options for attacking Black's position."

I'm happy with the position here, although the Gameknot database is still greatly in favour of Black I think White has a slight advantage, a more flexible position and similar control over the centre."

However, I think this is a poor move since after 16.Nb5 Bxd5 17.Bxd5+ Kh8 things start to look bad for Black.  I think a move that was to be considered is 15...Bf5 16.Qb3 Rf7 17.Qc2 Be6 18.Be4 a4 which I think looks slightly better."
