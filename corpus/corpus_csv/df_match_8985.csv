I hadn't intended for this to happen as I really wanted that white bishop controlling the diagonal on his king-side from d3 eventually. However, given my position, I was now prepared to trade the bishop for the knight and get him a doubled-pawn structure on the queen-side."
14,Bxf3,g4f3,r2qkb1r/ppp2pp1/2np1n1p/1B2p3/4P3/1PN2b2/P1PP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,"Looked like he wanted to castle. Nd4 seemed dangerous, but not yet (and even after O-O-O). I was going to fiancetto, shore up my positions with my rook before withdrawing the bishop to a safer location (or exchange for the knight if forced to do so)."

My plan was to get the queen to safety while defending the c pawn, eventually freeing pieces for an attack through Nd5. At this point, the overall plan was to force as many piece exchanges as possible without jeopardizing the queen."
