1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi Everyone!

Had another grim lesson on tactics by The Great One, GM Cyrano.  He allowed me to execute a pawn fork in the middlegame and then proceeded to show me why he allowed it.  You can follow the game by using Gameknot Analysis as follows: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17961012&fb=1&rnd=0.4897350889336611."
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"1. ...... c6 - in response to Afro's e4 I decided to experiment with the Caro-Kann Defense.  This move is characterised by c6 invented by Horatio Caro.  The idea of this is so that I can play a later d5, leaving e5 as an option and not hemming in Fou Leblanc (my light square bishop)."
