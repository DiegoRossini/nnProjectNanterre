2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"according to the database, this is the ""blackmar gambit"""

4,dxe4,d5e4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/3Pp3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,I see no reason not to take the pawn so....
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/3Pp3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,main line from the database is C6 ...  but i think i can keep the pawn so why not try....  defending the pawn while developing kingside knight

7,f3,f2f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/8/3Pp3/2N2P2/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"i'm behind a fair amount on development and white has a  lot more active pieces than me ,  but i'm up a pawn"

10,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/8/3P2b1/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,i debated playing Bxf3 but i didn't want to develop his queen for him
11,h3,h2h3,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/8/3P2b1/2N2N1P/PPP3P1/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,i debated playing Bxf3 but i didn't want to develop his queen for him
12,Bh5,g4h5,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/7b/3P4/2N2N1P/PPP3P1/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,i debated playing Bxf3 but i didn't want to develop his queen for him
13,Be3,c1e3,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/7b/3P4/2N1BN1P/PPP3P1/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 2 7,g4 is the main continuation and would have forced me to play bg6... we're outside the games DB now (as only one GK game 1500 opponents has reached this position)
14,e6,e7e6,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/7b/3P4/2N1BN1P/PPP3P1/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,here white has a commanding lead in development but is still down a pawn
15,Bd3,f1d3,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/7b/3P4/2NBBN1P/PPP3P1/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 8,here white has a commanding lead in development but is still down a pawn
16,Nc6,b8c6,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/7b/3P4/2NBBN1P/PPP3P1/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 9,i'm not quite sure where he is going with this... shouldn't he unpin his queen or something?
17,Ne4,c3e4,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/7b/3PN3/3BBN1P/PPP3P1/R2QK2R b KQkq - 3 9,i'm not quite sure where he is going with this... shouldn't he unpin his queen or something?
18,Bxf3,h5f3,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/8/3PN3/3BBb1P/PPP3P1/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 10,i eliminate one of the defenders of the d4 pawn
19,Qxf3,d1f3,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/8/3PN3/3BBQ1P/PPP3P1/R3K2R b KQkq - 0 10,as i was hoping he took my piece with his queen not with his pawn as i intend to open the D file and my queen is in position on it
20,Nxe4,f6e4,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/8/3Pn3/3BBQ1P/PPP3P1/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 11,i am hoping to castle kingside so i don't want to trade knights on f6 after moving my queen because this would double pawns... this to me is more important than immediatly taking the D pawn because i'm a pawn up and behind on development
21,Bxe4,d3e4,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/8/3PB3/4BQ1P/PPP3P1/R3K2R b KQkq - 0 11,a mistake.? ... Qxe4 guards the pawn but this move attacks the knight and the pawn on B7 behind it....
22,Nxd4,c6d4,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/3nB3/4BQ1P/PPP3P1/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 12,Forced as any other move either loses the queen and / or fails to capture the knight
23,Bxd4,e3d4,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/3BB3/5Q1P/PPP3P1/R3K2R b KQkq - 0 12,Forced as any other move either loses the queen and / or fails to capture the knight
24,Qxd4,d8d4,r3kb1r/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/3qB3/5Q1P/PPP3P1/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 13,i think that Bc6 would have been a strong move... or mabye Bxb7
25,Rd1,a1d1,r3kb1r/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/3qB3/5Q1P/PPP3P1/3RK2R b Kkq - 1 13,i think that Bc6 would have been a strong move... or mabye Bxb7
26,Qxb2,d4b2,r3kb1r/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/4B3/5Q1P/PqP3P1/3RK2R w Kkq - 0 14,my only real option here seemed to be to take the pawn
27,Bxb7,e4b7,r3kb1r/pBp2ppp/4p3/8/8/5Q1P/PqP3P1/3RK2R b Kkq - 0 14,(had he played Bxb7 the move before he could have played Qc6 )
28,Rd8,a8d8,3rkb1r/pBp2ppp/4p3/8/8/5Q1P/PqP3P1/3RK2R w Kk - 1 15,now i sacrifice the ability to castle in order to take a rook off the board and move my king to a square where it can't be attacked by his bishop
29,Rxd8+,d1d8,3Rkb1r/pBp2ppp/4p3/8/8/5Q1P/PqP3P1/4K2R b Kk - 0 15,"Qc6! seems better, possibly even winning in some continuations, and at least enough to force a 3 repitition draw with the threat of the loss of the rook... 15.Qc6 Ke7.... 16QC5  Kf6 (because Ke8 loses to Bc6!) 17 QF2 Ke7 18 Qc5 Kf6"
30,Kxd8,e8d8,3k1b1r/pBp2ppp/4p3/8/8/5Q1P/PqP3P1/4K2R w K - 0 16,i decided to get the bishop out of the way of my rook and don't waste time due to the check on his king
31,O-O,e1g1,3k1b1r/pBp2ppp/4p3/8/8/5Q1P/PqP3P1/5RK1 b - - 1 16,i decided to get the bishop out of the way of my rook and don't waste time due to the check on his king
32,Bc5+,f8c5,3k3r/pBp2ppp/4p3/2b5/8/5Q1P/PqP3P1/5RK1 w - - 2 17,i decided to get the bishop out of the way of my rook and don't waste time due to the check on his king
