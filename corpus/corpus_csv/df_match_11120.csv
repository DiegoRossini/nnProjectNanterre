1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,A good solid move from White...releasing the f1 Bishop and the Queen whilst establishing a strong centre.
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,French Defence
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,most common move vs the French Defence.
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Theory furthermore.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,Winawer Variation...a very common line for White.
6,dxe4,d5e4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/3Pp3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,a rather dubious approach from Rory(Black)
7,Nxe4,c3e4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/3PN3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"a player of the White pieces is very happy here as from his point of view he has a good,strong lead in development."
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/8/3PN3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,I wouldn't agree with this line...perhaps Nd7-Rubinstein Variation is more logical
9,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/8/3PN3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,A good logical move on white's part
10,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/8/3PN3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 3 6,this position looks quite solid for both players and Black has solidified his position but the c6 Knight belongs on d7 in this position as it covers Nxf6 whereby Black's d7 Knight is allowed into the game and white has to exchange a good solid central Knight which just gives Black a free tempi.
11,Bd3,f1d3,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/8/3PN3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 4 6,"Black cannot take the pawn on d4(... Nxd4 7.Nxd4 Qxd4?? 8.Bb5 !!) this discovered attack as you can see wins a Queen and makes it 1-0 on the spot.
A pawn such as the pawn on d4 in this position is called ""A Poisoned Pawn"" for obvious reasons."
12,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/2n1pn2/8/3PN3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 5 7,A good solid move from Black;developing his pieces logically.
13,c3,c2c3,r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/2n1pn2/8/3PN3/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,supporting the central d4 pawn whilst opening lines for the Queen.
14,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/ppp1bppp/2n1pn2/8/3PN3/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 1 8,0-0 obviously!!
15,O-O,e1g1,r1bq1rk1/ppp1bppp/2n1pn2/8/3PN3/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 2 8,...
16,b6,b7b6,r1bq1rk1/p1p1bppp/1pn1pn2/8/3PN3/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 9,Black is preparing to Fianchetto on the Queenside-which can become very effective as the Bishop is striking out at the centre from afar.
17,Qe2,d1e2,r1bq1rk1/p1p1bppp/1pn1pn2/8/3PN3/2PB1N2/PP2QPPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 1 9,"Qd2 allows the Rook to have more space. Therefore, White is aiming to develop the Bishop in order to connect his rooks- a very useful and effective technique."
18,Bb7,c8b7,r2q1rk1/pbp1bppp/1pn1pn2/8/3PN3/2PB1N2/PP2QPPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 2 10,Bb7! Fianchetto-ing the Bishop is very good in this position as it strikes out at the centre from afar...as you can see the Bishop has a good scope and it is threatening many squares.
19,Bg5,c1g5,r2q1rk1/pbp1bppp/1pn1pn2/6B1/3PN3/2PB1N2/PP2QPPP/R4RK1 b - - 3 10,"A strong,logical move; connecting the Rooks whilst developing into a good position."
20,h6,h7h6,r2q1rk1/pbp1bpp1/1pn1pn1p/6B1/3PN3/2PB1N2/PP2QPPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 11,Trying to deflect the Bishop but h6 is a bit passive as it creates organic weaknesses in Black's King-Side making Black vulnerable at a later stage.
