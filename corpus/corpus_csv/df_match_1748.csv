The queen can now take mine, AND leave me in check, leaving me with no initiative whatsoever. I don't see any tricks, swindles, exchanges, or checks that could POSSIBLY give me back what I lost. And the player is above 1900, which means it is highly unlikely for him to blunder at all. So I decide to call the game as a lost cause and resign. Would you have resigned in this case? Or have continued due to a possible way to turn the tide? Thank you for watching a PRIME example of what NOT to do in the middle game."
