On top of that I have moved a pawn that does absolutely nothing to free White's pieces.  What's the story?  In common with other gambits, the King's Gambit gives away nothing for free.  What White gets - or hopes to get - in return is time, and more control of the centre than Black can obtain."

4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"Declining the gambit in probably the most 'principled' manner.  The classic King's Gambit Declined goes 2...Bc5, which, in developing the bishop, interdicts the dark squares in White's field.  A real nuisance, that, as 3.fxe5?? in response involves White in a whole heap of trouble after 3...Qh5ch!  Objectively best is simply to take the pawn.  To set against the given up pawn, White will need quite substantive advantages in time and activity.  The 19th century American Master, Pollock, I think it was, used to decline the King's Gambit with the knight move."
5,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 3,"Transposing into a Vienna Gambit set-up.  Probably not the best (3.Nf3 seems preferable, as putting more pressure on Black) but quite playable, all the same."
6,a6,a7a6,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/4p3/4PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"[?]  Black clearly wants nothing whatever to do with the White f-pawn.  That's fair enough, but this pawn move does very little to progress Black.  It frees no pieces, nor develops any, nor does it add to Black's claim on the centre.  It does stop a White minor piece from landing on b5, but that is a very minor consideration that doesn't inconvenience White at all.  There are better things for White to do!"
7,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/4p3/4PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"Another piece deployed, and adding to White's claim on the centre.  I'm still unconcerned whether or not Black takes the f-pawn.  After 4...exf4?! 5.d4 would suit me very well."
8,d6,d7d6,r1bqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1np4/4p3/4PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"[!] Now this pawn move is OK - probably Black's best available move in fact.  It consolidates the grip Black has on her share of the centre, and frees the light-square bishop (LSB).  True, it shuts in the other bishop, but it will be happy enough, defensively placed on e7."
9,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1np4/4p3/2B1PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,"Developing, and striking at the f7-square.  White wants to step up the pressure on Black's game.  When White castles, the King's rook will at ance be ready to attack down the f-file."
10,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1np1n2/4p3/2B1PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 6,"[!?] In keeping with development.  However, I would probably have found ...Bg4 more inconvenient.  Even so, you will notice I made no effort to prevent such a move.  I could then immediately, or a little later, have hit the bishop by h2-h3, and asked the bishop whether it wanted to exchange itself for the knight, or go elsewhere..."
11,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1np1n2/4p3/2B1PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 3 6,"[!?] Totally unexpected, this is one of those moves that can really disrupt one's programme.  The upsides for Black is that it's a forcing move: where is the c4-bishop to go?  It loses no time, therefore, and does go some way to Black's development by offering her LSB a choice of directions to go. It also has some - a little - impact on the centre. There are downsides, though.  It is Black's fourth pawn move, and the LSB doesn't really need the extra mobility.  The light squares in Black's Q-side might prove interesting for White, and Black really ought to be looking at mobilising her bishops.  This is not a bad move, but it had the psychological effect of encouraging an ill-advised follow-up by Black."

14,b4,b5b4,r1bqkb1r/2p2ppp/p1np1n2/4p3/1p2PP2/1BN2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,"[?] Now, short range, easily parried threats like are often criticised as being a waste of time.  But in fact they can be - and ought be - a means to an end.  Forcing as they are, they can help with seizing the initiative, or be the means by which one makes progress.  However, this Q-side expansion is rather premature, and ought to have waited upon the bishops being brought into the board.  Moves like 7...Bg4 or ...Be7 were much to be preferred.  Also good would have been 7...Na4 (!?), even though it moved a knight already moved, to the edge of the board, as it would pretty much have forced White to permit the exchange of his best piece."
15,Nd5,c3d5,r1bqkb1r/2p2ppp/p1np1n2/3Np3/1p2PP2/1B3N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 8,"If one is forced to move a piece twice in the opening, let it be (if possible) to a more active square.  Black dare not exchange knights, because 8...Nxd5 9.Bxd5 10.Bd7 (say) ...Ng5 and White just about has a winning game already, with threats against f7 and the pin on the c6-knight.  Nor does 8...Nxe4 look healthy after 9.d4, and threats to open up the centre files for White's heavy pieces.   As it happens, 8.Ng5!? would gave been quite playable here.  After 8.Ng5 bxc3 (8....Bg4 is worth a look for Black) 9.Nxf7 cxd2 10.Qxd2 Qd7  11.Nxh8 White would have a big edge."

Development of her unmoved pieces has become a matter of extreme urgency, as will shortly be shown. Much better would have been 8...Be7, which is at least solid.  Even a move like 8...Bg4 (?) has now become too dangerous for Black: 8...Bg4 9.Nxf6ch Qxf6? [So parlous has the situation become that ...gxf6 is actually safer, here] 10.Bd5 Bd7 11.fxe4 dxe4  12.d4 with enormous pressure in the centre (12...exd4? 13.Ng5)."

The plan here was to open up the f-file for the rook, and thereby bring a crossfire from the bishop and rook onto f7.  In fact White has overlooked a much stronger move: 9.Ng5!  The line is fairly complicated, so I'll just give a sample: 9.Ng5 Be6  10.Nxe6 fxe6 11.Ba4 ... (Also winning is 11.Nxf6ch) 11...exd5 12.Bxc6ch Ke7  13.exd5! ... (much stronger than grabbing the rook, on account of all the lines being opened up!) 13...Ra6 14.fxe5 dxe5 15.Qe2 ..."

Thrown onto the defensive, Black has to play accurately to survive.  White is spoilt for choice, with several plausible ways to proceed.  He doesn't always pick the best!"

Qd6  12.Nxc6 Qxc6 13.Bxf7ch Kd8  14.d4 ... with a powerful attack against the King stuck in the centre of the board.  The sapient reader will have observed that White is in no all fired hurry (now) to complete his own development.  The reason is simple.  Right now White has ample resources to mount an attack sufficient to gain a decisive advantage.  To spend time completing White's development now, would enable Black to push hers along as well, and an opportunity might well be lost.  Principles and guidelines are all very well, but always they must be applied according to what is actually happening on the board."

Black had but one other square available for the Queen, but that would have invited this horror: 12...Qe7  13.Rxf7! Qd8  14.Qh5! g6  15.Qd5 Ra6  16.Rg7!! ... To stop the mate Black would at least have had to give up her queen."
