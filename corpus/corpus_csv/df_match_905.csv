1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is a fun game, where we both queen a pawn, and end up with 4 queens on the board. It is also a bit of a mystery. I lose, but the post-game computer analysis (PMCA) doesn't highlight any mistakes by me. So where did a go wrong? Read through with me dear reader, and see if you can help me find out where I went wrong!"
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,So it starts conventionally.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,I continue with the most popular move.
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"This is very sound, indicating perhaps a Nimzo-Indian Defence or a Queen's Indian Defence."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,I elect for a Nimzo-Indian.
6,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"Which she obliges with, rather than transpose back to the Queens Gambit declined with d7-d5."
7,e3,e2e3,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,This is the main line.
8,b6,b7b6,rnbqk2r/p1pp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/1bPP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"This is the more modern move, previously 0-0 was usually played here."
9,Nge2,g1e2,rnbqk2r/p1pp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/1bPP4/2N1P3/PP2NPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"So one knight supports the other. I stop her doubling my pawns. This is the Fischer variation, named after the only American World Chess Champion."
10,c5,c7c5,rnbqk2r/p2p1ppp/1p2pn2/2p5/1bPP4/2N1P3/PP2NPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,She hits my centre.
11,a3,a2a3,rnbqk2r/p2p1ppp/1p2pn2/2p5/1bPP4/P1N1P3/1P2NPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"This is the obvious follow up to Nge2, now that she can't double my pawns."
12,Ba5,b4a5,rnbqk2r/p2p1ppp/1p2pn2/b1p5/2PP4/P1N1P3/1P2NPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,So the Bishop retreats.
13,g3,g2g3,rnbqk2r/p2p1ppp/1p2pn2/b1p5/2PP4/P1N1P1P1/1P2NP1P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"As my bishop can't go to e2 or d3, I plan to develop it on g2."
14,Bb7,c8b7,rn1qk2r/pb1p1ppp/1p2pn2/b1p5/2PP4/P1N1P1P1/1P2NP1P/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,But this stops my plan!
15,d5,d4d5,rn1qk2r/pb1p1ppp/1p2pn2/b1pP4/2P5/P1N1P1P1/1P2NP1P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,"This is virtually the only move. If she now takes on d5 I don't take back immediately, as she can just take on d5 as my Nc3 is not really protecting d5 as it is pinned against my king. Instead I would have played Bg2 first, before taking back on d5."
16,b5,b6b5,rn1qk2r/pb1p1ppp/4pn2/bppP4/2P5/P1N1P1P1/1P2NP1P/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 9,"So she doesn't take, but further undermines my centre."
17,Bg2,f1g2,rn1qk2r/pb1p1ppp/4pn2/bppP4/2P5/P1N1P1P1/1P2NPBP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 9,I need to develop and protect d5.
18,bxc4,b5c4,rn1qk2r/pb1p1ppp/4pn2/b1pP4/2p5/P1N1P1P1/1P2NPBP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 10,"And now my talented young opponent is a pawn up, but it is debatable whether or not she can hang on to it."
19,O-O,e1g1,rn1qk2r/pb1p1ppp/4pn2/b1pP4/2p5/P1N1P1P1/1P2NPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 10,So I just castle.
20,O-O,e8g8,rn1q1rk1/pb1p1ppp/4pn2/b1pP4/2p5/P1N1P1P1/1P2NPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 2 11,And so does she.
