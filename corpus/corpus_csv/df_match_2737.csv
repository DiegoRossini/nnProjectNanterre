I can retreat my queen to d2, I can place my other rook on the same file and put some use to it, and I can trade rooks in order to simplify since I'm ahead in material. I like retreating my queen to d2 or placing the other rook on the same file the best. Trading rooks here might seem to favor the side that's ahead on material, but I think that giving him that open file might be a bad idea."

I defend my rook, while at the same time opening the possibility for my e2 bishop to check his king and put him in a precarious position. What I failed to notice is that I cannot actually check his king since his queen would take my bishop, and that I've just given the pawn back due to a tactic. But if he took the pawn back, I'd be able to get my bishop where I had planned."
