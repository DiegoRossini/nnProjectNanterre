1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,The rematch between fatcat2 and phishbone6984. I am after revenge after really messing up in my first game against phishbone.
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The French Defence, a solid opening for Black. Black's position appears cramped and slow in many positions resulting from the French Defence, but it is tremendously hard to assault."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"The main line. If White can place two temporarily unchallenged pawns in the centre, why not do so?"
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"The vast majority of French Defence games end up here. Occasionally White might play 2.Nf3, but I think that this is a weak option."
5,Nd2,b1d2,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"The Tarrasch Variation of the French Defence. The Winawer Variation 3.Nc3 Bb4 leads to the knight being pinned: the Tarrasch avoids this after 3.Nd2 Bb4 4.c3. Other possible variations from this point include the slow, blunt and often drawn Exchange Variation 3.exd5 exd5, and the Advance Variation 3.e5, possibly slightly premature but played very commonly."
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3PP3/8/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"The most usual move. Very similar to the Advance Variation, but played with tempo as Black's knight has to move."
7,e5,e4e5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3pP3/3P4/8/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"The most usual move. Very similar to the Advance Variation, but played with tempo as Black's knight has to move."
8,Nfd7,f6d7,rnbqkb1r/pppn1ppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/8/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,A typical French Defence move for assaulting White's powerful extended pawn centre.
9,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqkb1r/pppn1ppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/3B4/PPPN1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 2 5,A typical French Defence move for assaulting White's powerful extended pawn centre.
10,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/3B4/PPPN1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,A typical French Defence move for assaulting White's powerful extended pawn centre.
11,c3,c2c3,rnbqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/2PB4/PP1N1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 6,"The most common response. White is not going to allow his d-pawn to go, as the e-pawn will probably follow it."
12,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2n1p3/2ppP3/3P4/2PB4/PP1N1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 1 7,"Another move common in such lines of the French Defence, restraining White's queenside pawns."
13,Ngf3,g1f3,r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2n1p3/2ppP3/3P4/2PB1N2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 7,"Another move common in such lines of the French Defence, restraining White's queenside pawns."
14,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/pp1nbppp/2n1p3/2ppP3/3P4/2PB1N2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 3 8,"Another move common in such lines of the French Defence, restraining White's queenside pawns."
