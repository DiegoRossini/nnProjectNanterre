Using the correct method of calculation, we can find the best moves in most tactical sequences and avoid blundering in those sharp lines. The full method of calculation is very difficult to point out, so here are the essential tips for a good calculation."

Most of the time, when the pieces are not clashing, we can simply make moves with only a basic safety check. We should also use our positional understanding to bring down the amount of calculation we need to do."
