15,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk2r/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/8/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 8,It's quite for the moment.

18,Re8,f8e8,rnbqr1k1/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/8/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 6 10,"Still following the main line, developping quietly."
19,Nd2,f3d2,rnbqr1k1/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/8/2N3P1/PP1NPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 7 10,Surely to prepare e4 and to bring the knight on c4 to menace d6. So white prepares a central attack.
20,a6,a7a6,rnbqr1k1/1p3pbp/p2p1np1/2pP4/8/2N3P1/PP1NPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 11,To prevent 11. Nb5 and prepare 11. ... b5 preventing 12. Kc4

24,Ne5,d7e5,r1bqr1k1/1p3pbp/p2p1np1/2pPn3/P7/2N3PP/1P1NPPB1/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 13,Black lances the attack at the center. The plan is to take control of it.
25,f4,f2f4,r1bqr1k1/1p3pbp/p2p1np1/2pPn3/P4P2/2N3PP/1P1NP1B1/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 13,Forcing the knight to withdraw but opening the kingside a bit more.
26,Ned7,e5d7,r1bqr1k1/1p1n1pbp/p2p1np1/2pP4/P4P2/2N3PP/1P1NP1B1/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 14,Black  has to withdraw but the plan is now to attack the g and h pawns.
27,e4,e2e4,r1bqr1k1/1p1n1pbp/p2p1np1/2pP4/P3PP2/2N3PP/1P1N2B1/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 14,Whjte's on attack at the center as well.
28,b6,b7b6,r1bqr1k1/3n1pbp/pp1p1np1/2pP4/P3PP2/2N3PP/1P1N2B1/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 15,I do not remember why I did this move which is of very little interest. Probably to enable Bb7 which has not much interest either.
29,Nc4,d2c4,r1bqr1k1/3n1pbp/pp1p1np1/2pP4/P1N1PP2/2N3PP/1P4B1/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 15,To protect the d pawn without moving the d knight.
30,Qc7,d8c7,r1b1r1k1/2qn1pbp/pp1p1np1/2pP4/P1N1PP2/2N3PP/1P4B1/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 2 16,To protect the d pawn without moving the d knight.
31,Re1,f1e1,r1b1r1k1/2qn1pbp/pp1p1np1/2pP4/P1N1PP2/2N3PP/1P4B1/R1BQR1K1 b - - 3 16,Whit still prepares his attack at the center

Of course the knight would be quycky fired but f6 seemed to me a proper place for the brave lancelot.
