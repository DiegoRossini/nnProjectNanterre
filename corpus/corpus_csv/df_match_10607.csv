1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"This was a team match. When we started I was actually higher ranked than slebecnyer. By the time we finished the game, slebecnyer had won 23 in a row (including an earlier game against me while playing black). He had reached a ranking of 1923 and it was clear I was over matched. 
I don't play much against this opening so he caught me by surprise right off the bat. I proceeded with caution. I am black...."

However, I needed to open a lane for my light Bishop, at the same time I am threating with e4, opening my dark bishop lane as well. At that point I'd have a lot of artillery pointed in the direction of his King."

Similarly, I have struggled to defend against this sacrifice as well. So now, I look much more aggressively to prevent the Bishop sacrifice by my opponents. Either way it is a both strong and an exciting move, and most of times dramatically changes the course of the match. It sure did this time."

In addition, my Queen is getting ready to get into the action, and his King looks pretty blocked off by the pieces on his f-file."

He is actually attacking. I thought that might have not been the best move, cause I was willing to sacrifice bunch of pawns to position my strong pieces in front of his King. I am sure not concerned with his attack of b5."

However, it's still not perfectly clear where this rook will fit, due to his 3rd row pieces. I still don't care that my b5 pawn is there for taking. I am actually using it as a bait."
