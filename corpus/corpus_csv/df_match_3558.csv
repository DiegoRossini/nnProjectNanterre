1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"Greetings! This is my first annotated game, simply because my adversary had a high rating, so beating him became my record. Actually, as I noticed, he's not a genuine 1700 rating range type of player, because he got it by winning over others players having the 1200-1600 rating range. Anyway...He started the development with the king side knight."
