1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"hey hey all who like following the annotated section.  i wanted to post this one because its a nice show of aggression vs higher rated opponents that can be really effective,"
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,this game was a 5m blitz so there was alot less time to think. it was also a test to see if i can remember my lines and not using the analyse function.   i guess a test to see if im actually learning lol
3,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,and so i stick with what im comfortable with the bishops opening
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 3,"hmm not nf6 so i will decide to not aim for a d4 with a reply like nc3, and play d3  to get f4 in."
5,d3,d2d3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 3,alright there is the nf6 but its ok experience serves i do not need to fear the d5 anymore
6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 4,alright there is the nf6 but its ok experience serves i do not need to fear the d5 anymore
7,f4,f2f4,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1PP2/3P4/PPP3PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 4,and so i can get it my f4
8,d5,d7d5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3pp3/2B1PP2/3P4/PPP3PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,here comes the d5 usually id panic and be like damnit i got to start dancing my bishop. but now i stay calm and play properly
9,Bb5,c4b5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/1B1pp3/4PP2/3P4/PPP3PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 5,"so i pin the knight to possibly invite a6 then play Ba4 to invite b5 and weaken the queen side pawn structure incase he wanted to queen side castle or i may also decide to double pawn him if the board looks good for it, also this seems more time efficient than going straight to b3."
10,d4,d5d4,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/1B2p3/3pPP2/3P4/PPP3PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,he decides to do an advance
11,fxe5,f4e5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/1B2P3/3pP3/3P4/PPP3PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 6,"i reply with pawn take to undermine his middle and now there is an opening for my DSB plus he cannot recapture this pawn and there is no current threat to my LSB,"
12,Nd7,f6d7,r1bqkb1r/pppn1ppp/2n5/1B2P3/3pP3/3P4/PPP3PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 7,retreats centrally to attack the e5 pawn
13,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkb1r/pppn1ppp/2n5/1B2P3/3pP3/3P1N2/PPP3PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 7,"so i decide to develop and temporarily protect that pawn, he will be able to atleast take something down with him now when he dies. so pawn up! lets keep this up"
14,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk2r/pppn1ppp/2n5/1Bb1P3/3pP3/3P1N2/PPP3PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 3 8,i found this reply to be really passive. protecting an isolated pawn. who can only be reconnected to a line with a pawn whos now behind 2 minor pieces. thought it was also pretty much putting his DSB to sleep for a few turns as  i had no intention of nxd4 yet id rather keep a high pawn even if he is doubled
15,Bxc6,b5c6,r1bqk2r/pppn1ppp/2B5/2b1P3/3pP3/3P1N2/PPP3PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,and so after that passive bishop move i decide to double pawn him start picking up a pace
16,bxc6,b7c6,r1bqk2r/p1pn1ppp/2p5/2b1P3/3pP3/3P1N2/PPP3PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,immediate castle.
17,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk2r/p1pn1ppp/2p5/2b1P3/3pP3/3P1N2/PPP3PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 9,immediate castle.

19,Bg5,c1g5,r1b1k2r/p1pnqppp/2p5/2b1P1B1/3pP3/3P1N2/PPP3PP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 3 10,and so i decide to attack the queen. and ill get a pawn for that pawn. as i had atleast planned he would take 1 more material with his death
20,f6,f7f6,r1b1k2r/p1pnq1pp/2p2p2/2b1P1B1/3pP3/3P1N2/PPP3PP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 0 11,natural reply.
21,exf6,e5f6,r1b1k2r/p1pnq1pp/2p2P2/2b3B1/3pP3/3P1N2/PPP3PP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 0 11,"he recaptures now he has an isolated pawn and some double pawns and im eyeing a hanging pawn because he moved his queen,  this blitz is going well for someone whos almost 200 elo above me  i think i didnt once play as he planned i would."
22,gxf6,g7f6,r1b1k2r/p1pnq2p/2p2p2/2b3B1/3pP3/3P1N2/PPP3PP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 0 12,"he recaptures now he has an isolated pawn and some double pawns and im eyeing a hanging pawn because he moved his queen,  this blitz is going well for someone whos almost 200 elo above me  i think i didnt once play as he planned i would."
