1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Here is a recent Petroff from a symmetrical king pawn mini-tournament.  It has solid positional advice for aspiring players, along with a sacrificial ending for those of you who are looking for a show.
     The lesson here is to always have a plan.  Here, Black drifts aimlessly, letting White accumulate small advantages and cash them in at my leisure.  This culminates in a mating attack on the Black king and a forced mate in 5."
