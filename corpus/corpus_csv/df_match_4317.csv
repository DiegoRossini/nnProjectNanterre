White we getting a nice open a file and white will shut down the b file. Looks strong and aggresive on blacks queensite. Cause of the pawn on f4 white is also able to build up a nice attack on the kingside.

Downside is that black doesnt have to react on it. and the center is a bit blocked now. the e5 square looks attractive for white now. Im wondering what white will play."

I would put my bets on the white pieces here"
