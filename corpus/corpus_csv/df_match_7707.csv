1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Another victory, taking my rating into the 1830s.  This was a very hard fought, tense battle.  My new buddy Elia played a very hard game.  Indeed, he had a rating in the 1700s but unfortunately he suffered some timeouts as a result of a bad internet connection.  But I digress, he was in the game until the very last move where he left his rook en prise to Fou Lenoir who gratefully read him the last rites!  Anyhow, on with the show.  Elia gives me the French Defense which is e6 in response to e4.  The purpose of this is to prepare d5 and challenge the centre."
