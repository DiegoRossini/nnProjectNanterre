1,g4,g2g4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/6P1/8/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

I think it would be a nice idea to explore the Grob Opening where white starts out with 1. g4.  It was a very enterprising idea of Jerry to try against Class A 1900 oppo.  It certainly got me out of the Gameknot DB pretty early on.  It can be quite a tricky opening as my 3 games will demonstrate.  This is the first of these three games."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/6P1/8/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"1. .... d5 - opens up a line for Fou Leblanc onto that pawn on g4.  It looks a little vulnerable.  Easy19, aka the Master Mater, is not afraid to play the Grob.  He has tried it against me and won.  I must make sure that I do not fall to a calamity here.  In this game, Henry has a 19 rating point bounty on his head!"

5,c4,c2c4,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2P3b1/8/PP1PPPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 3,"3. c4! - good move here, if I now play 3. ..... dxc4?? then my pawn on b7 and my rook on a8 will receive the last rites from Jerry's bishop on g2."
6,Nf6,g8f6,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/2P3b1/8/PP1PPPBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 4,3. .... Nf6 - develops a piece and defends my d pawn.  It is twice defended but the second defender is Glenda.  I would prefer to delegate that task to either another pawn or a minor piece if at all possible.

8,Bc8,g4c8,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/2P5/1Q6/PP1PPPBP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 3 5,"5. Nc3 - and we have further pile on to that poor little pawn on d5.  So, now I exchange it."

Nxc6 - after having to reverse Fou Leblanc's development and to merely move pawns, I finally recapture a pawn by developing a piece.  Now I have just got to develop my bishops and I will feel a little happier with my pos."

25,Na4,c3a4,r1b1k2r/1p1q1ppp/p1nbpn2/8/N1Q5/3P4/P3PPBP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 3 13,13. Na4 - but that white knight finds another square to harass my pieces.  This is b6 threatening a fork on Glenda and my rook on a8.

Nxd4 - although there is no mate in the offing, Jerry decides to wave the white flag as he is now 11 points down on material.  It is an interesting opening and now will come the first of two correspondence games which are not from Gameknot but from the THEM series that Freddy the Master Mater also plays in.  My opponent is chessmaniac (Guy Shelmerdine).  We started that THEM tournament via e-mail but then, after Guy joined Gameknot we agreed to play out the rest of the game on Gameknot.  I won with white and conceded a Low Draw with the black pieces.  Watch this space my friends ......"
