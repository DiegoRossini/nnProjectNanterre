1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"As White, I've always preferred the closed and semi-closed openings. Closed openings start with 1. d4 d5. Semi-closed ones start with 1.d4 and black responds with some move other than 1. ... d5. The Open Game is 1.e4 e5, a Semi-Open Game (such as this one we played) is 1.e4 where black makes moves other than 1...e5. Flank openings 1.c4, 1.Nf3, 1.f4 can easily transpose into closed or semi-closed (or sometimes open or semi-open).
***********************************************************************
So I like closed and semi-closed. You on the other hand are playing for the Open Game or Semi-Open Game. Which one depends on my response.
***********************************************************************

None of these categories are better or worse for Black or White. They are more only a matter of preference."
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"So when my opponent has White and plays 1.e4, I prefer the Semi-Open game. I play the French Defense (1...e6), the Pirc Defense (pronounced ""peerts"" not ""perk"" 1...d6) or Alekhine's Defense (1...Nf6).

***********************************************************************

You should study one opening at a time for at least a year and get really good at it. Then move on to study another opening. Currently, for this 12 month period (starting early July), I am studying through the French so I only respond to 1.e4 with 1...e6.

***********************************************************************

Key Principle: Study one opening at a time for at least a year, until you know it in and out. This does not mean you don't continue to learn other openings, but that your primary focus is on only one."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"So Chase, one reason I like the openings I mentioned (the French Defense, the Pirc Defense and Alekhine's Defense) is that in each one, Black willingly allows White to establish an imposing pawn center, with intention of attacking and destroying that center! So it's an intense debate between the 2 sides, a debate won not with words, but in tactical chess moves.

***********************************************************************

White says, ""My solid pawn center will restrict your pieces, giving me a superior position!"" Black says, ""Your pawns are weak! I'll use my pawns to destroy your weak pawn center! I will undermine those overly advanced pawns, and trade them off and gain a free open position!"" 

***********************************************************************

If White succeeds in keeping this ""strong"" pawn center, he will definitely have the better game. Yet, if black accomplishes his goal of undermining and / or trading off White's pawns, in my opinion, he will probably gain equality and if White is not careful, Black can gain a strong advantage.

***********************************************************************

On the other hand, in the French Defense, Black willingly accepts a restricted LSB and possibly a restricted King-side. The French is fairly popular though, so obviously many people agree with me that the tactical battle which ensues makes these ""minor inconveniences"" worthwhile."
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"With this move I begin to contend for the center and oppose your pawns. There are several primary responses frequently played: The main line is 3.Nc3. Black can continue with the following variations:

Rubinstein Variation 3...dxe4;
Winawer Variation 3...Bb4;
Classical Variation 3...Nf6;

***********************************************************************
If White chooses not to play 3.Nc3 he can instead play the Exchange Variation: 3.exd5 exd5; the Advance Variation 3.e5; the Tarrasch Variation 3.Nd2.

The Advance Variation is the most aggressive, blocking in Black's LSB. Black then starts an assault on the pawns via c5 and possibly (after more preparation), f6."
5,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3P4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"So you chose to play the Exchange Variation: 3.exd5. Although it is sound, it lacks the intense battle or complications of some of the other variations mentioned above. Exchanging pawns on d5 removes the tension that is frequently part of this defense. Therefore, it is usually avoided by most advanced players. For this same reason though, it's probably the best line for beginners playing White against the French Defense. Until a player learns how to make in depth calculations, complications should be avoided.

An interesting note, after the pawns are exchanged, the pawn structure and overall position looks nothing like the French Defense, although it still is the French!"
6,exd5,e6d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,3...Qxd5(?) would give White unwarranted initiative with moves like 4.Nc3 or 4.c4. It would also leave Black without a pawn presence in the center. Thus 3...exd5.
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"Good move developing towards the center. The knights are usually best on c3 & f3 or for Black, c6 & f6. It's also good usually to bring the knights out before the bishops, as you are doing."

10,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 4 6,"So, the reason the knights should be out first is that you usually don't know where the bishops should be placed. If your position is such that you know where they should go, and you have a specific reason for bringing them out, then bring them out. In this case, I wanted to prevent you from pinning my king-knight with Bg5."

***********************************************************************

So, you had one piece defending the d4 pawn (White Move 8). I pinned that piece,(Black Move 8) so you add extra defense to the pawn (White Move 9). So I redirect my attack to the Bishop which defends the pawn (Black Move 9). 

***********************************************************************

Now you have a pawn defending the bishop and a knight defending, but the knight is pinned, so not really. So you play 10.h3(?). I need to do something with the bishop, since you attack him. So I use him to remove the defending knight. After your queen captures, your only defense to the bishop is the pawn, while I have my bishop and knight attacking him. So I exchange on the e5 square, winning a pawn."
