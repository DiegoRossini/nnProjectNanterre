1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,My usual move. I avoid e4 because of the Sicilian theory
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,Indian defense. This is overwhelmingly the most popular defense to d4 I see now.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 2,Avoiding the main lines after 2. c4. I heard that my opponent plays the Gruenfeld (2.c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5) but I did not bother with it because I knew that he would know much more theory than me.
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,Still playing the fianchetto setup popular in the King's Indian Defense
5,Bf4,c1f4,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/3P1B2/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"London System. I like this against 1...Nf6 because it is flexible, avoids theory, and restricts Black's fianchettoed DSB"
6,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/3P1B2/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,"The Bishop is best at e2 against this setup. d3 would be the normal place for the bishop, controlling e4 but it's biting against the pawn on g6. The eventual plan is to get the Bishop on the h1-a8 diagonal"
7,e3,e2e3,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/3P1B2/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"The Bishop is best at e2 against this setup. d3 would be the normal place for the bishop, controlling e4 but it's biting against the pawn on g6. The eventual plan is to get the Bishop on the h1-a8 diagonal"
8,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppppppbp/5np1/8/3P1B2/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQ - 1 5,"The Bishop is best at e2 against this setup. d3 would be the normal place for the bishop, controlling e4 but it's biting against the pawn on g6. The eventual plan is to get the Bishop on the h1-a8 diagonal"
9,Be2,f1e2,rnbq1rk1/ppppppbp/5np1/8/3P1B2/4PN2/PPP1BPPP/RN1QK2R b KQ - 2 5,"The Bishop is best at e2 against this setup. d3 would be the normal place for the bishop, controlling e4 but it's biting against the pawn on g6. The eventual plan is to get the Bishop on the h1-a8 diagonal"
10,d6,d7d6,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3P1B2/4PN2/PPP1BPPP/RN1QK2R w KQ - 0 6,"Now if ...Nh5, White can retreat his Bishop back to h2 to keep the Bishop pair"
11,h3,h2h3,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3P1B2/4PN1P/PPP1BPP1/RN1QK2R b KQ - 0 6,"Now if ...Nh5, White can retreat his Bishop back to h2 to keep the Bishop pair"
12,c5,c7c5,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2p5/3P1B2/4PN1P/PPP1BPP1/RN1QK2R w KQ - 0 7,Attacking that pawn on d4 to gain space for his DSB
13,c3,c2c3,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2p5/3P1B2/2P1PN1P/PP2BPP1/RN1QK2R b KQ - 0 7,White does not want the long diagonal to be open so he will make sure his pawn on d4 is supported after an eventual capture on d4
14,Qb6,d8b6,rnb2rk1/pp2ppbp/1q1p1np1/2p5/3P1B2/2P1PN1P/PP2BPP1/RN1QK2R w KQ - 1 8,Not fearing Qxb3 axb3 where White's a1 rook has a half open a-file
15,Qb3,d1b3,rnb2rk1/pp2ppbp/1q1p1np1/2p5/3P1B2/1QP1PN1P/PP2BPP1/RN2K2R b KQ - 2 8,Not fearing Qxb3 axb3 where White's a1 rook has a half open a-file
16,Qc7,b6c7,rnb2rk1/ppq1ppbp/3p1np1/2p5/3P1B2/1QP1PN1P/PP2BPP1/RN2K2R w KQ - 3 9,I would argue it is better to trade Queens though because now Black has wasted time and allowed White to gain a tempo after putting his Queen on b3.
17,O-O,e1g1,rnb2rk1/ppq1ppbp/3p1np1/2p5/3P1B2/1QP1PN1P/PP2BPP1/RN3RK1 b - - 4 9,Black made this move mainly to avoid any possible captures on c5 due to the pin on the Queen. This also leaves the possibility to fianchetto his other Bishop to contest White's Bishop on the other long diagonal
18,b6,b7b6,rnb2rk1/p1q1ppbp/1p1p1np1/2p5/3P1B2/1QP1PN1P/PP2BPP1/RN3RK1 w - - 0 10,Black made this move mainly to avoid any possible captures on c5 due to the pin on the Queen. This also leaves the possibility to fianchetto his other Bishop to contest White's Bishop on the other long diagonal
19,Nbd2,b1d2,rnb2rk1/p1q1ppbp/1p1p1np1/2p5/3P1B2/1QP1PN1P/PP1NBPP1/R4RK1 b - - 1 10,"A purely prophylactic move. Black can now possibly play a pawn break to e5, hitting the Bishop. This move anticipates that and avoids any possible e4 moves made possible by attacking the Bishop after pushing the e-pawn to e5."
20,Nc6,b8c6,r1b2rk1/p1q1ppbp/1pnp1np1/2p5/3P1B2/1QP1PN1P/PP1NBPP1/R4RK1 w - - 2 11,"A purely prophylactic move. Black can now possibly play a pawn break to e5, hitting the Bishop.

21,Bh2,f4h2,r1b2rk1/p1q1ppbp/1pnp1np1/2p5/3P4/1QP1PN1P/PP1NBPPB/R4RK1 b - - 3 11,"A purely prophylactic move. Black can now possibly play a pawn break to e5, hitting the Bishop.

22,h6,h7h6,r1b2rk1/p1q1ppb1/1pnp1npp/2p5/3P4/1QP1PN1P/PP1NBPPB/R4RK1 w - - 0 12,Not quite sure of the purpose behind this move actually. White has no intentions of putting any piece on g5
23,Rfc1,f1c1,r1b2rk1/p1q1ppb1/1pnp1npp/2p5/3P4/1QP1PN1P/PP1NBPPB/R1R3K1 b - - 1 12,Moving pieces over to the Queen side. White's plan is to attack Black's pawn base with a4 and then a5.
24,Bf5,c8f5,r4rk1/p1q1ppb1/1pnp1npp/2p2b2/3P4/1QP1PN1P/PP1NBPPB/R1R3K1 w - - 2 13,?! Really a waste of times. I made this move because I didn't want my Queen to be moved back to it's original square after 13.a4 Na5 14. Qd1 but White has a move like 14. Qa2 and it is possible to move b4 and hit the knight with a tempo
25,Nh4,f3h4,r4rk1/p1q1ppb1/1pnp1npp/2p2b2/3P3N/1QP1P2P/PP1NBPPB/R1R3K1 b - - 3 13,?! Really a waste of times.

26,Be6,f5e6,r4rk1/p1q1ppb1/1pnpbnpp/2p5/3P3N/1QP1P2P/PP1NBPPB/R1R3K1 w - - 4 14,Attacking the Queen and redirecting the Bishop to arguably a better square
27,Qc2,b3c2,r4rk1/p1q1ppb1/1pnpbnpp/2p5/3P3N/2P1P2P/PPQNBPPB/R1R3K1 b - - 5 14,Another questionable move. I wanted to threaten the fork with d5 but Black can avoid it if he plays correctly. It is probably better for White to continue with the plan of breaking down the Queenside with a4-a5. This opens the position for Black's benefit.
28,Rac8,a8c8,2r2rk1/p1q1ppb1/1pnpbnpp/2p5/3P3N/2P1P2P/PPQNBPPB/R1R3K1 w - - 6 15,Another questionable move. I wanted to threaten the fork with d5 but Black can avoid it if he plays correctly. It is probably better for White to continue with the plan of breaking down the Queenside with a4-a5. This opens the position for Black's benefit.
29,e4,e3e4,2r2rk1/p1q1ppb1/1pnpbnpp/2p5/3PP2N/2P4P/PPQNBPPB/R1R3K1 b - - 0 15,Another questionable move. I wanted to threaten the fork with d5 but Black can avoid it if he plays correctly.

30,cxd4,c5d4,2r2rk1/p1q1ppb1/1pnpbnpp/8/3pP2N/2P4P/PPQNBPPB/R1R3K1 w - - 0 16,Pretty much forced. Trying to avoid the fork by moving the Bishop with 15... Bd7 16. d5 Na5 looks very cramped for Black.
31,cxd4,c3d4,2r2rk1/p1q1ppb1/1pnpbnpp/8/3PP2N/7P/PPQNBPPB/R1R3K1 b - - 0 16,"Now Black opens up discoveries upon moving his c6 knight and, in turn, threatens the pawn on d4. White has to move his Queen while protecting his pawn"
32,Qb8,c7b8,1qr2rk1/p3ppb1/1pnpbnpp/8/3PP2N/7P/PPQNBPPB/R1R3K1 w - - 1 17,"Now Black opens up discoveries upon moving his c6 knight and, in turn, threatens the pawn on d4. White has to move his Queen while protecting his pawn"
