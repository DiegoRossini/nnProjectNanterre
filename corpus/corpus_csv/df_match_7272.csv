1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I had just turned 16, and was starting to become aware of the joys of the fairer sex. I was also obsessed with chess. One night, I went to sleep after studying some games in Bobby Fischer’s “60 Memorable Games.”
I woke up to find myself lying in soft grass. Looking up I saw that I was in a square field. Beside me was a bench, with, what seemed to me at the time, an old man crying. I noticed the long robe, and the mitre on his head, and his long staff. “he must be a bishop” I said to myself. I sat down beside him and asked me what was the matter. As he removed his hands from his face, I noticed for the first time that he was black, and I saw the purple shirt he was wearing, with a dog collar above it, as confirmation that he was indeed a bishop.
“It’s starting again. The kings and queens are collecting armies together. There is going to be another war. Beware young man, beware.”
Just then a black horse slowly trotted up beside us. A tall, dark lady was riding side-saddle on it. She was wearing a long flowing cloak and a small crown on her head. I realised she must be a queen. She slipped off the horse and clicked her fingers in front of the bishop with the single word “sleep”. The bishop immediately seemed to fall into a deep sleep. “What’s up with him” I thought to myself, for at that time, I had no knowledge of the art of hypnotism.
She turned to face me. She had big dark eyes, skin as back as coal, big lips. She was tall, she absolutely towered above me. She was more beautiful than any lady I had ever seen before. She sort of scared and excited me all at once.
“What have we here? Is it a boy who will fight for me?”
“I’m not going to fight for you. I don’t want to die. I am white, if I fought for anyone it would be for the white queen.”
“But black can become white and white can become black. Haven’t you heard of Michael Jackson?”
“Yes but I don’t want to end up like him.”
“Good point and you will not.”
She sat down beside me, so I only had to look up slightly to look at her face.
“And you are in your pyjamas; boys in their pyjamas should be asleep.”
Looking down I noticed I was still wearing pyjamas.
“Look into my eyes boy.”
I looked up into her lovely eyes and there was something magnetic about them. I started staring in those lovely big brown eyes looking directly into mine. The tone of her voice changed, it was gentler, sweeter, and more seductive.
“Yes I can see in your eyes that you have been sleeping, and that you want to go back to sleep. Let me help you boy. Just look into my eyes and trust in me. Trust in me completely.”
I didn’t trust her one inch, but somehow I couldn’t turn my gaze away, I wanted to keep looking into those eyes.
“That’s right boy keep looking into my eyes and listening to my voice, my sweet soothing voice.”
“Sleep boy and dream of me. I am your queen. You love me boy. You love my big brown eyes. Keep thinking of my eyes. You love the smell of my perfume. You love my voice. You love my touch. You are"

“Be ready boy, we are about to start.”
In the distance I saw a soldier advance towards me.
“Pawn to Queen Four” bellowed a voice behind and to left of me.
“Oh darling you are so old-fashioned.” I heard my queen behind me. “He means Pawn to d5. That’s you boy, off you go, forward two squares.”
She pushed me in the back and thrust me forward two squares. I came face to face with the opposition soldier."

“But I have!”
Looking forward and to the right I saw another opposition soldier.
“Look out, use your shield,” shouted my queen from behind me.
In the nick of time I raised my shield and parried the blow from his sword."

“Can I suggest the Slav defence dear?”
“Yes pawn to queen bishop’s three.”
“He means pawn c6.”
Behind me and to my right I heard a soldier advance one square.
“Don’t worry sir; I am here to protect you.” 
I was rather relieved to hear those words!"
