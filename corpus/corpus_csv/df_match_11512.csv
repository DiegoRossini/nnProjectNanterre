1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game begins with WT attaining the larger center and a space advantage from the opening, plus an open e-file. Although BL does not neglect development nor lag significantly in it, Kingside attack with be initiated after he permits some weakening in that sector. From that point WT will strive to open lines there and to bring all his pieces into the hunt as well. Then despite good resistance presented, comes to use the weakened white squares there; to occupy a hole upon g6; and finally bring home a point by sacrificing upon h6.

In the former setup there would still be an option of striking at h6/g6/h7 ... or playing on the Q-side with b4 and the Be3 or Bf4. 
I felt a wait appropriate here since I do not have a enough development, nor lead in it, to initiate a successful attack now; but do have a significant space advantage that will not go away. Often such factors favor taking time to buildup,
with emphasis upon proper piece placement rather than rapidity. That is what I plan to do, unless he 'gives me something'."

[a good analytical exercise here ... ]
If the Q recapture were not available, it would pay to look at the Rook alternative and review the attacking ideas therein, which focus most importantly upon the idea of eliminating the Nf6 , removing defense of the h7 mating square. 
In such lines, WT should realize that important concepts to analyze involve seeing the move Bg5, both with or without Bxh6 preceding it, as well as just Bxh6. 
By Bg5 WT could eliminate the Nf6 defender, even if backed-up by Nce8.  And once the B is moved from c1 it would allow the final WT attacker, the Ra1, to enter the fray if needed. Thus in such position the attacker might even consider moves such as Bg5/Bh6 simply as a clearance sac, even if it had no other purpose, so as to involve that Rook in the matter. 
To students of tactics, ""Take three points"", as they say :)
if you looked at the 2 B moves and saw all three reasons for considering them. 1)Clearance (2)re-attack of Nf6 by Bg5,  & (3)line opening by Bh6 ... important general concepts of attack.  }8-)"

Last move I mentioned part of the reason to look at a move like Bxh6 being line opening. This may cause one to ask ""What? I thought that refers to opening My Own lines to attack upon."" Answer:Yes, it usually does. However, consider it a more advanced concept then, that it can also include opening Opponent's Lines!
... in the field of attack. Why might you Want to do that>? Well, largely because in such position as it is advantageous, you Gain scope upon the opponents line opened, if you can take control of it. 
For instance here, (disregard any other tactics or consequences, this is just to make a case in point example, not explain this position, especially) if gxh6 were played, note how that if WT could capture that pawn, or if the B is not taken, and if in either case WT could gain control of that H-File ... he is no longer striking there at only h6 where the pawn was. With a R or Q there now, he would also be striking clear thru the File to h7 and h8 as well.! In fact if that Ng6 were then to stay there, a Q could mate by Qh8, or if the Nf6 were to move, then a Q on the h-file could mate by Qh7. Thus by opening an Opponents Line, WT would have made the BL position possess greater exposure and more lines of entry into it as well. Do you see my point then? 
[One opening where this is more commonly illustrated would be in the h-file attack of the Yugoslav, Dragon Sicilian. There are situations where BL will avoid responding to h5xg6 there by h7xg6 for just the reason I've illustrated above, and instead go f7xg6. Especially if he has played his B back to Bh8, since then it might be subject to capture or sac capture there, rather than helping guard h8 as if it were still a Bg7 there. ]"
