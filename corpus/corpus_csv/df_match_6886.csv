3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Sicilian (B32), Flohr variation"

7,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"Black transposes into the Taimanov line, but most probably his main reason for this move is to free his bishop for an attack. On gameknot the line is still called Sicilian (B32), Flohr variation."
8,e6,e7e6,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Black transposes into the Taimanov line, but most probably his main reason for this move is to free his bishop for an attack. On gameknot the line is still called Sicilian (B32), Flohr variation."
9,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/1B6/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,"White doesn't know that line, so he makes an automatic move thinking that he seriously pins the knight. The Taimanov line continues with 5. Nxc6."
10,Qb6,d8b6,r1b1kbnr/pp1p1ppp/1qn1p3/1B6/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 6,"Black believes in his queen's power, and loves to mobilize her early."
11,O-O,e1g1,r1b1kbnr/pp1p1ppp/1qn1p3/1B6/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 3 6,"Here white completely neglects the position, and makes another automatic move without consideration to the threats. The knight on d4 is extremely weak, and does more harm than good in this position. The bishop on b5 would probably serve better if he exchanged at c6."
12,g6,g7g6,r1b1kbnr/pp1p1p1p/1qn1p1p1/1B6/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,"Black opts for an unjustified fianchetto, and gives back time to  white."
13,Nc3,b1c3,r1b1kbnr/pp1p1p1p/1qn1p1p1/1B6/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 7,"White keeps neglecting the essence of the position, and hopes that this will protect his bishop or he simply wants to develop another piece. Now his knight on d4 is hopelessly hanged."
14,Bc5,f8c5,r1b1k1nr/pp1p1p1p/1qn1p1p1/1Bb5/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 8,"Fortunately black is equally in haste, so he rushes away and misses the free capture of White's knight."
15,Be3,c1e3,r1b1k1nr/pp1p1p1p/1qn1p1p1/1Bb5/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 3 8,"White misses the given and time-winning fork on a4, and invites to battle for the dominance of d4."
16,Bxd4,c5d4,r1b1k1nr/pp1p1p1p/1qn1p1p1/1B6/3bP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 9,"Confusing move, and that's probably the scope here. White wants to break Black's psychological dominance, and make him stop and wonder."
