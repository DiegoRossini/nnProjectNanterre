1,d3,d2d3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/3P4/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I actually meant to play d4, but my mouse was screwing up... probably because there was a mouse trap on the d4 square."
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/8/3P4/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"No matter because now i can transpose into the blootstein attack, first used by legendary grand maestro Swang Dudeetsen."
3,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Staking claim in the center, a very key component to successfully executing the blootstein attack."
4,a6,a7a6,rnbqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p3p3/8/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"b5 was blocked from my bishop for the time being, so this move was unnecessary."
5,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p3p3/8/4PP2/3P4/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,I will continue to play the blootstein.
6,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p1p1p3/8/4PP2/3P4/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,takes away a good spot for his horsey.
7,g3,g2g3,rnbqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p1p1p3/8/4PP2/3P2P1/PPP4P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,Hmmm... i actually meant to play g4... there must of been another mouse trap there.
8,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/1p3ppp/p1p1p3/3p4/4PP2/3P2P1/PPP4P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,hmmm... attacking my pawns.
9,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/1p3ppp/p1p1p3/3pP3/5P2/3P2P1/PPP4P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,developing his Knight.

11,g4,g3g4,rnbqkb1r/1p2nppp/p1p1p3/3pP3/5PP1/3P4/PPP4P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,Now i can play the move i originally intended at g4. The blootstein formation is coming together... it will be a great assault.
12,Ng8,e7g8,rnbqkbnr/1p3ppp/p1p1p3/3pP3/5PP1/3P4/PPP4P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 7,Just moving back to its starting square... i don't know.
13,d4,d3d4,rnbqkbnr/1p3ppp/p1p1p3/3pP3/3P1PP1/8/PPP4P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 7,"It is quite clear that my blootstein attack has caught him off guard. If you are not well versed in the ways of swang dudeets, most of his techniques look a little strange."
14,Qh4+,d8h4,rnb1kbnr/1p3ppp/p1p1p3/3pP3/3P1PPq/8/PPP4P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 8,"I anticipated this, a perfect time to start my attack."
15,Kd2,e1d2,rnb1kbnr/1p3ppp/p1p1p3/3pP3/3P1PPq/8/PPPK3P/RNBQ1BNR b kq - 2 8,Just moving back to the starting square again...

17,Kc3,d2c3,rnbqkbnr/1p3ppp/p1p1p3/3pP3/3P1PP1/2K5/PPP4P/RNBQ1BNR b kq - 4 9,"Now the idea of the blootstein attack is to use your king to take the opponents pieces. That is why all my pieces are not developed, the king really is your strongest piece in this attack."
18,Qa5+,d8a5,rnb1kbnr/1p3ppp/p1p1p3/q2pP3/3P1PP1/2K5/PPP4P/RNBQ1BNR w kq - 5 10,Hmm...it would appear that he has seen the potential of the blootstein attack and would like to deviate away from that. A solid choice.
19,Kd3,c3d3,rnb1kbnr/1p3ppp/p1p1p3/q2pP3/3P1PP1/3K4/PPP4P/RNBQ1BNR b kq - 6 10,Retreating once more.

22,Qa5+,d8a5,rnb1kbnr/1p3ppp/p1p1p3/q2pP3/3P1PP1/2K5/PPP4P/RNBQ1BNR w kq - 9 12,He still wants none of it.
23,Kd3,c3d3,rnb1kbnr/1p3ppp/p1p1p3/q2pP3/3P1PP1/3K4/PPP4P/RNBQ1BNR b kq - 10 12,not retreating this time but this allows me to develop my bishop and chase his queen.
24,c5,c6c5,rnb1kbnr/1p3ppp/p3p3/q1ppP3/3P1PP1/3K4/PPP4P/RNBQ1BNR w kq - 0 13,not retreating this time but this allows me to develop my bishop and chase his queen.
