2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Here we begin with the Two Knights Defense. The focal point in this position is weak f7 square that is being defended only once by the Black's king.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Here we begin with the Two Knights Defense. The focal point in this position is weak f7 square that is being defended only once by the Black's king.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,Here we begin with the Two Knights Defense. The focal point in this position is weak f7 square that is being defended only once by the Black's king.
5,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,Here we begin with the Two Knights Defense. The focal point in this position is weak f7 square that is being defended only once by the Black's king.
6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,Here we begin with the Two Knights Defense. The focal point in this position is weak f7 square that is being defended only once by the Black's king.
7,Ng5,f3g5,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p1N1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 5 4,"The first phase of the assault is initiated by White with 4. Ng5... White is poised to hone in on that f7 square -- twice attacked, once defended.  So white ceases the moment to begin his attack on the king side."
8,d5,d7d5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3pp1N1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,So black defends in the center by cutting off the white bishops pathway to the f7 square.
9,exd5,e4d5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3Pp1N1/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"White forks Blacks queen and rook and provokes Black to recapture. By moving his king, Black forfeits his ability to castle so as to extinguish White's onslaught, or at least have it contained.  In the opening play, it is generally not a good idea to move the same piece twice.. thus white looses a tempo and exchanges knight for pawn and is now down in material."
10,Nxd5,f6d5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/3np1N1/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"White forks Blacks queen and rook and provokes Black to recapture. By moving his king, Black forfeits his ability to castle so as to extinguish White's onslaught, or at least have it contained.  In the opening play, it is generally not a good idea to move the same piece twice.. thus white looses a tempo and exchanges knight for pawn and is now down in material."
11,Nxf7,g5f7,r1bqkb1r/ppp2Npp/2n5/3np3/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"White forks Blacks queen and rook and provokes Black to recapture.

In the opening play, it is generally not a good idea to move the same piece twice.. thus white looses a tempo and exchanges knight for pawn and is now down in material."
12,Kxf7,e8f7,r1bq1b1r/ppp2kpp/2n5/3np3/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 0 7,White continues with his attack with 7. Qf3+ ...
13,Qf3+,d1f3,r1bq1b1r/ppp2kpp/2n5/3np3/2B5/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 1 7,White continues with his attack with 7. Qf3+ ...
14,Ke6,f7e6,r1bq1b1r/ppp3pp/2n1k3/3np3/2B5/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 2 8,"...which forces Black's king closer into the center and becomes an important defender of his knight on d5. Here we have the Fagatello attack, Leonhart variation."
15,Nc3,b1c3,r1bq1b1r/ppp3pp/2n1k3/3np3/2B5/2N2Q2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 3 8,"Here white mounts the pressure on Black's knight on d5, which is pinned on that square because of  white's bishop on c4.  Black is feeling alittle overwhelmed by the forced defense of his pieces."
16,Nd4,c6d4,r1bq1b1r/ppp3pp/4k3/3np3/2Bn4/2N2Q2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 4 9,"What you'll see more often is 8...Nb4, a more defensive move than what Black plays: 8....Nd4, attacking the queen on f3 and the pawn on c2. By not reinforcing his other knight on d5, it becomes a sore square that White can immediatly cease with any three of his attacking peices.  Black's position is getting weaker with every forceful move he makes.  White is simply allowing Black to turn his own forward momentum against himself."
17,Bxd5+,c4d5,r1bq1b1r/ppp3pp/4k3/3Bp3/3n4/2N2Q2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 0 9,White takes with 9. Bxd5+.Black only has one piece developed on the board compared with White's three pieces actively in the game.  White's pawn structure is still solid and unscathed.  Black has a very weak e5 square that White can manipulate. There's just not enough hiding places for Black's king; he's abit stuck in the middle of the board being drawn further into White's territory.
18,Kd6,e6d6,r1bq1b1r/ppp3pp/3k4/3Bp3/3n4/2N2Q2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 1 10,Black doesn't have too many places to go without getting mated right away.  He is holding onto this position by fighting tooth and nail against White's attacks.
19,Qf7,f3f7,r1bq1b1r/ppp2Qpp/3k4/3Bp3/3n4/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 2 10,Here White threatens 11. Ne4 mate which leaves Black in a pickle.  How is Black's king going to defend himself against White's mate in one?
20,Be6,c8e6,r2q1b1r/ppp2Qpp/3kb3/3Bp3/3n4/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 3 11,"10....Be6 Here Black wants to trade bishops; his bad one for White's strong bishop.   White wants to build up pressure in the center and Black wants relieve built up pressure and open up the center so more of his pieces can actively play.






























































































































































































































































































A better move would've been  10....Qe7, forcing the Queens off the board with:
11.Ne4+ Kd7 12.Kd1 Qxf7 13.Bxf7 Kd8.

21,Bxe6,d5e6,r2q1b1r/ppp2Qpp/3kB3/4p3/3n4/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 0 11,Now both light squared bishops are off the board.  Black must somehow regain his equalibrium and put an end to this downward spiral.
22,Nxe6,d4e6,r2q1b1r/ppp2Qpp/3kn3/4p3/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 0 12,Now both light squared bishops are off the board.  Black must somehow regain his equalibrium and put an end to this downward spiral.
23,Ne4+,c3e4,r2q1b1r/ppp2Qpp/3kn3/4p3/4N3/8/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 1 12,"Now the walls are coming down for Black; his position is crumbling.  After this check with 12. Ne4+, Black's king is forced to come closer into White's territory."
24,Kd5,d6d5,r2q1b1r/ppp2Qpp/4n3/3kp3/4N3/8/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 2 13,"With 12....Kd5, Black's king seems to be on his last leg. His king has moved all over the board which lost quite a bit of tempo.  Soon as the queens come off the board, the tables turn on White when Black's king goes on to become a powerful attacking piece."
25,c4+,c2c4,r2q1b1r/ppp2Qpp/4n3/3kp3/2P1N3/8/PP1P1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 0 13,"White has no time to make a weak passive move.  He cannot let up on Black's king. White must  keep the attack going without taking time to stop and smell the roses. Black's king is steadily being pushed further away from his comfort zone.  White, a bit up in material, can afford to sacrifice his knight on e4. Leading to 13...Kxe4 14.Qxe6 Kd3 15.O-O Qd6"
26,Kxe4,d5e4,r2q1b1r/ppp2Qpp/4n3/4p3/2P1k3/8/PP1P1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 0 14,"Let's keep the attack going by limiting the mobility of Black's queen and subsequently the rest of his force. What can black do shy of resigning? A lack of certainty could be instant devastation, the beginning of chaos and total lack of control.  Uncertainty is a form of fear which we must overcome."
27,Qxe6,f7e6,r2q1b1r/ppp3pp/4Q3/4p3/2P1k3/8/PP1P1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 0 14,White's queen squares off with Black's king. White's queen controls the d5 and f5 squares preventing Black's king from retreating back into his own territory. Black's not going to last long after this. He can't hold this position together.
28,Qd4,d8d4,r4b1r/ppp3pp/4Q3/4p3/2Pqk3/8/PP1P1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 1 15,So now Black has walked himself into the corner with a mate in 3.  He still is an inch away from being checkmated.  15.Qg4+ Kd3 16.Qe2+ Kc2 17.d3# and mate.
29,Qg4+,e6g4,r4b1r/ppp3pp/8/4p3/2Pqk1Q1/8/PP1P1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 2 15,"Black is passed the point of no return and his king is doomed.  White is only helping Black by tightening his noose... unfortunatly it will back fire like the many times before and then before you know it, he's tightening the noose around his own neck.  15...Kd3 16.Qe2+ Kc2 17.d3# and checkmate."
