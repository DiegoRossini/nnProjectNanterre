(My humble comment: This move is the cause of rapid deterioration of White's advantage. 16.Nf3 as Taimanov notes is the correct move to maintain White's advantage. Here the psychology of Taimanov is revealed! He was in an aggressive mood and relied on attack and ignored the requirements of the position. Have we all also fallen prey to such emotions in our games? Sure we did. It is part of the learning in this game. Chess logic overrides emotions and player strengths.

I do not stint on one more diagram as it not only reflects both the culmination and turning-point of this game, but the match as a whole.  Fischer himself later recognized it: ""It was the turning point of the match.  Taimanov missed a win by 20. Qh3.""  It additionally serves as a reference point to all the subsequent and unpredictable dramatic peripeteias [ed. philosophical self-questioning, Aristotle] which befell me.

I remember that at that moment I felt a veritable ecstasy from the struggle - I estimated the position as rather advantageous.  I trusted in success, pleased at my good luck employing my opening preparation, and in the idea of rapid development of the initiative -and the maneuver 20. Qh3, for example.  Was it was possible to anticipate that all this would turn to ashes?!

Disappointment began from the moment when I, cheerfully having estimated the position, began to concretely calculate variations.  It was obvious that after 20.Qh3 Black in view of the threat 21. Rxh6+ has only two defenses - 20...Nf6 and 20...Rf6.  I began to examine them in the happy belief that any attempt to cover the gaping approaches to the Black King would be impossible.

The move 20...Nf6 really did not shake my optimism.  Variations found without any special work are: 20.Qh3 Nf6 21.Bc3 f4 ( other continuations are worse. For example, 21...Bd7 22.Ne6 Bxe6 23.Rxe6; or 21...Ng4 22.Rg6! Rf6 23.Qh5) 22.Qh4 Bb7 ( 22...Qe8 23.Bf3!) 23.Rd1 Qe7 24.Re6 Qc5+ 25.Kh1 are obviously developments to White's benefit.

But I couldn’t find any decisive continuation on 20...Rf6 in any continuation.  First it seemed to me that good is 21.Qh5, but in testing it I didn’t like 21...Bd7! 22.Rxf6 Qxf6 23.Nf7+ Kh7 24.Nxh6 Bxh6 25.Bxh6 Qg6!.  The idea of 21.Nf7+ Rxf7 22.Bxh6 was entertained, but I found a refutation at once in 22...Bf6.  At last I found the best plan: 21.Bc4! when really, in view of 21...Rxc6 22.Nf7+, the White rook is impregnable.  Now 22.Rxf6 is simply threatened, and both replies 21...Bd7 22.Bxd5 and 21...Bb7 22.Rxf6 Qxf6 23.Rxf5 are poor.

It would seem that the required decision has held up to scrutiny, but is complicated by the response 21… f4.  To everything that I have here examined, alas, there was an objection:

On 22.Qh5 possible was 22...Bb7 23.Bxd5 (or 23.Rxf6 Qxf6) 23...Qxd5;
On 22.Qh4 - Bb7 23.Ne6 Qd7;
On 22.Qd3 - 22...hxg5 23.Rxf6 Bxf6;
And finally on 22.Qf3!? - Bb7! 23.Rxf6 (23.Ne6 Qd7! 24.Bxd5 Rxe6!) 23...Nxf6! 24.Nf7+ Kh7 25.Qxb7 (25.Bd3+ Kg8!) 25...Qxd2 26.Qxa8 Qd4+ 27.Kh1 Qxc4.

In all variations Fischer emerges in the clear.

It was amazing!  All my understanding of chess, all my experience and flair convinced me this position should be won, but concrete ways to victory did not appear.  Disappointed in 20. Qh3!, I began to evaluate other ideas - 20. Rd1, 20. Bc4, but"
