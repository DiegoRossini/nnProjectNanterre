1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"the Reti, maybe.
an opening with ot much anbition, in my opinion."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,"well, white has changed the opening to some kind of queen's pawn."

4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 3,"strange...
in that way white plays with the same piece twice (instead of developing other pieces) with no specific plan to jestify his move.
it's better to play solid like 3. c4 or 3. g3 or something like that."
