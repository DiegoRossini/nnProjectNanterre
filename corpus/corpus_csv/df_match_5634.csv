I like correspondence chess because it's different from normal chess in that you are allowed to use literature and compare your game with other games from other players. So, a completely unknown opening isn't that frightening in correspondence chess. I find this kind of play very instructive, although I wouldn't like to miss either (normal or correspondence chess). So I read up on this famous Sicilian Defense and looked at games in the database to make for a good opening."

10,a6,a7a6,rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"At this point, Black has several nice alternatives, all of which lead to very different and interesting games. Namely, there are 5... a6 (Najdorf variation), 5... g6 (Dragon variation), 5... Nc6 (classical variation) and 5... e6 (the Scheveningen). From what I saw and read, it seems to me that 5... a6 is best. It prepares b7-b5 and takes away the b5 square for White's bishop and knights. This is probably also what I would have played if I had been Black."
11,Be3,c1e3,rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"Here the book knows several variations:

The aggressive 6. Bg5 is the old main line, but it seems like it leads to good chances for Black if Black defends carefully. It can in particular lead to the poisoned pawn variation after 6... e6 7. f4 Qb6 which is extremely complex and which I did not wish to face (of course I wouldn't have to play 7. f4). Now I think, maybe this attack is a bit premature, but Black will still have to react to it, so maybe it's not that bad either. I guess, I'll probably try this move next time I'm in this situation.

The Fischer-Sozin variation 6. Bc4 is not good because Black can block the diagonal with 6... e6 and then the Bc4 is of no use and threatened by b7-b5, so White would play 7. Bb3 (as otherwise Black can play b7-b5 then b5-b4 then Nxe4), and already this looks much more comfortable for Black. Black could develop Nbd7 Nc5 if he's aggressive or yet Be7 Bd7 Nc6 to build up a solid defense, so 6. Bc4 just doesn't seem advisable.

The quiet 6. Be2 is just too passive for my taste.

So I decided to go for the English attack 6. Be3. I think it's a good place for the bishop to be (e.g. b6 is not such a good-looking place for the black queen anymore) and it prepares for queenside castling."

Ng4, but I think this is a good move as it gains space in the center, the black e-pawn develops with a tempo and it puts the knight Nd4 in an uncomfortable position. Again, probably what I would have played."

Nf3 blocks the f-pawn which will be important to build an attack on the kingside. 7. Ne2 blocks the white-fielded bishop and the queen's d1-h5 diagonal. Finally, 7. Nf5 !? looks very dangerous..."
14,Be6,c8e6,rn1qkb1r/1p3ppp/p2pbn2/4p3/4P3/1NN1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 8,"At this point the book suggests 8. f3, but it just seems to me that White's attack on the kingside is much slower and more difficult to coordinate than Black's attack on the queenside after this move, e.g. 8. (f3) Be7 9. Qd2 O-O 10. O-O-O Nbd7 11. g4 b5 12. g5 b4 and so forth. See this excellent annotated game from byakuugan3 for more on this development:

I did not want to play this line, so I decided to level the playing field a little with the apparently rarely seen 8. f4. I did not find much on it in the literature, but I did not find a refutation either. In my opinion 8... exf4 is the best answer as Black won't want my pawn on f5. Then after 9. Bxf4 White has an isolated e-pawn and Black has an isolated d-pawn, and the chances look more or less equal to me. It's also nice to have the f-file opened so I can maybe play Rf1 later."

16,Ng4,f6g4,rn1qkb1r/1p3ppp/p2pb3/4p3/4PPn1/1NN1B3/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 9,"Admittedly, 8... Ng4 is a tempting-looking move and this is exactly what 8. f3 would have prevented. However when taking a closer look, the only thing that this lone knight threatens is my bishp on e3. Of course I could protect him with moves like e.g. 9. Qd2 or 9. Qe2, but I did not want to give Black the (probably good) option to exchange his knight for my bishop, as I thought I would probably still need it to build my attack on the kingside. So I just retreated the bishop to Bd2, and now the black knight is in a bad place.

The only (slight) drawback to this move is that my queen does not control d5 anymore. When playing against a Sicilian, I guess you usually don't want your opponent to be able to boost his queen's pawn to d5, but here d5 is still sufficiently protected with my knight on c3 and my pawn on e4, since Black's knight is not on f6 anymore to control d5."

I think that Black should instead finally play 9... exf4, even though after (9. ... exf4) 10. Bxf4 the situation is essentially the same as it would have been if Black had played exf4 one move sooner, except that now his knight is in a less good position.

But 9... Nf6 leaves me with the option of playing 10. f5, an opportunity which I shall not refuse."

Maybe he plans on later playing b7-b5 followed by Bb7? But the bishop could achieve essentially the same threat from c6 without the need to play b7-b5 first...

If Black chooses to move the queen, he has to be careful:
If 19... Qc6? (threatening to take the white queen if the knight on d5 moves) leads of course to 20. Nxe7+ Kh8 21. Nxc6 and wins.
