1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Here is Part 2.  I am taking part in a mini-tournament called Memoralis.  I find myself under the cosh in the middlegame but somehow my opponent does not make the best moves and I end up bailing out into a 2 knight v R + 2 pawn ending.  Looks favourable to the side with the rook and 2 pawns, but somehow my horsies won the day.  As a rare experiment (very rare in a rated game) I try the Caro-Kann Defense.  That is 1. e4 c6."
