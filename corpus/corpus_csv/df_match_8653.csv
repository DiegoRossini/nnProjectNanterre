3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"Unusual. Usually, White plays d4 to occupy and, temporarily, control the centre. This move is perfectly playable and will probably transpose into a Winawer Variation (2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4)."
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"According to plan. Black almost always plays this move to challenge White's central gains, otherwise he risks being forced into passivity and cramp. An interesting option, it is worth mentioning, is 2...c5?!, which I value only as a move which confuses my opponent :-)."
