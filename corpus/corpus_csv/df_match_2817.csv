1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game was from the 4th round of the 78th Gameknot tournament, and myself and my opponent were the favourites for  winning the round. Our other game was a draw and so this result in effect decided the round. This game started quietly but  quickly got very complicated. I more or less fall into the complications, which were hard to calculate and required accurate moves from both sides. And as always, some luck always helps :-)"

So I went for my own tactics. I didn't see how I could survive Ng6 but I could play Qe4! Nxf8 Qxc4 and white's knight cannotr escape. Not seeing Qe4, I played a very dubious tactical shot"

He attacks my knight, protects his c4 bishop and still threatens Ng6+ winning the exchange. I can't defend against all of these threats. Funny how a slight innacuracy can be the turning point on the game."
