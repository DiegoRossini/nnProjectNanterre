2,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,The Robatsch or the Pirc Defense.
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,The most played move here is 2.d4 as it is more flexible.
4,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/8/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,Switching back to the main line.  The most aggressive 4th move here for White is f4 which leads to double-edged play.

6,d6,d7d6,rnbqk1nr/ppp1ppbp/3p2p1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Maintaining flexibility.
7,h3,h2h3,rnbqk1nr/ppp1ppbp/3p2p1/8/3PP3/2N4P/PPP2PP1/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"Not a strong move.  The only positive side to this move is protection of d4 as I can't play Bg4 to attack the knight on f3. Yet I wasn't going to play Bg4 anyways as my target will be e4 after I play ...a6, b5, Bb7, Nf6, and possibly b4 all attacking e4."
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N4P/PPP2PP1/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"Taking advantage of White's passive play, I don't need to worry about the e5 push, and I can continue attacking the e4 pawn."
9,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/6B1/3PP3/2N4P/PPP2PP1/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 2 5,The bishop belongs on e3.  White cannot afford to trade the dark squared bishop for the knight because then my bishop would become very powerful.
10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/6B1/3PP3/2N4P/PPP2PP1/R2QKBNR w KQ - 3 6,The natural move.

12,c6,c7c6,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2pp1np1/3P2B1/4P3/2N4P/PPP2PP1/R2QKBNR w KQ - 0 7,"Attacking the center.  In line with hypermodern theory, I can't allow White to protect his center or else he will continue to gain space and suffocate me."
13,Bxf6,g5f6,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2pp1Bp1/3P4/4P3/2N4P/PPP2PP1/R2QKBNR b KQ - 0 7,? See note to move 5.
14,exf6,e7f6,rnbq1rk1/pp3pbp/2pp1pp1/3P4/4P3/2N4P/PPP2PP1/R2QKBNR w KQ - 0 8,Opening the e-file to attack the e4 pawn.  White is lost here.
15,Nf3,g1f3,rnbq1rk1/pp3pbp/2pp1pp1/3P4/4P3/2N2N1P/PPP2PP1/R2QKB1R b KQ - 1 8,The e4 pawn is doomed.  White's king is stuck in the center.
16,Re8,f8e8,rnbqr1k1/pp3pbp/2pp1pp1/3P4/4P3/2N2N1P/PPP2PP1/R2QKB1R w KQ - 2 9,The e4 pawn is doomed.  White's king is stuck in the center.
