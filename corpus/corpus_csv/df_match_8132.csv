1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"My first finished game in a full month. I've been slowing the pace down a bit, feeling a bit overloaded with all the games and working on my novels. This game began on Feb 09, 2009 and ended on Jun 12 2009, more than 4 months for 31 moves, but despite my deliberate slowing down, we played the last dozen moves in the last month. Side note: my opponent and I were similarly rated 4 months ago, but since then my rating rose a few hundred points and my opponent deliberately resigned scores of games, dropping almost 1200 rating points below his 6 month peak. Cleaning house, he called it. He did not resign this game because it was a team match - he played out all his team matches."

Bg4 has been tried only 3 times out of 65 games in the DB, is the weakest response with the lowest rating of players who chose it and the highest win percentage for white. Feeling like I'm moving down a strong opening, I opt for 2nd best here, playing 8. d3 instead of the slightly more recommended 8. Re1. Either way, the white pawn at e4 needs some defense now that white's knight on f6 is pinned. I prefer defending pawns with other pawns, not with rooks - though in this case white's rook on f1 has nothing better to do, so I can see why either is fine, but I stick with my preference."

Re1 and has a better win percentage for white. As long as my opponent is following the DB, I'm happy to do the same. I know my opening knowledge is very weak, way too weak to play OTB at my current almost-expert rating. I assume if he's following the DB he's playing good moves, and if I try to wing it, I'm likely to die horribly in the opening - I'd rather learn from the experts, play their moves, and get into a viable middlegame where both players are competing skill vs. skill. Opening knowledge will gradually sink in. I hope. As for me, I go this route not only because the DB recommends it, but because it attacks. I'm like ""Old Blood N Guts"" Patton, always attacking. Defense is for pansies (not panzers - don't confuse the two)."
