3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,White initiates the Sicilian Smith-Mora Gambit
4,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3pP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"I capture (Sicilian (B21), Andreaschek gambit)"
5,Qxd4,d1d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 0 3,And white has had enough of proper openings
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"This move attacks the queen, forcing white to retreat and gains me a tempo (clearly no one ever told white that it is not a good idea to win a pawn with your queen)"
7,Qd1,d4d1,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 2 4,"White decides to active his bishop, I don't suppose there is anything wrong with this more, personally I would have played Nf4"

11,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 6,White seems to have the same sort of idea in mind.  I'm thinking if I where him I might consider a late game ruy-lopez sort of thing (is this a good idea?)
12,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk2r/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/4P3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 7,"I am fairly fond of this formation, Ng4 from here seems to catch people off guard, however now that I'm playing in the 1300's this may no longer work so well."
