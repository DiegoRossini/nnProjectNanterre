2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"This is even stranger, but still comprehensible."
3,Bb2,c1b2,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/8/1P6/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"A ""naive"" attack."

6,Qb6,d8b6,rnb1kb1r/pp1ppppp/1qp2n2/8/8/1P1P4/PBP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"A ""naive"" attack."

8,Ng4,f6g4,rnb1kb1r/pp1ppppp/1qp5/8/5Pn1/1P1P4/PBP1P1PP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"Curiosely, I was planning just this."
9,Nh3,g1h3,rnb1kb1r/pp1ppppp/1qp5/8/5Pn1/1P1P3N/PBP1P1PP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,I have to be careful. d5 makes me retreat the knight.
10,Ne3,g4e3,rnb1kb1r/pp1ppppp/1qp5/8/5P2/1P1Pn2N/PBP1P1PP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 3 6,I have to be careful. d5 makes me retreat the knight.

12,Qc5,b6c5,rnb1kb1r/pp1ppppp/2p5/2q5/5P2/1P1Pn2N/PBPQP1PP/RN2KB1R w KQkq - 5 7,"Threating f7, which leads to..."
13,Na3,b1a3,rnb1kb1r/pp1ppppp/2p5/2q5/5P2/NP1Pn2N/PBPQP1PP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 6 7,"So: black is undeveloped, with a flying queen. But white has two knights on the worst place."
14,Nd5,e3d5,rnb1kb1r/pp1ppppp/2p5/2qn4/5P2/NP1P3N/PBPQP1PP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 7 8,"Time to be responsible. f4 was not a bad square, but from this one I keep an eye on f5. Of course it blocks my own central advance pawn."
15,d4,d3d4,rnb1kb1r/pp1ppppp/2p5/2qn4/3P1P2/NP5N/PBPQP1PP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 8,"This is ok, because it blocks his own bishop (you'll see it useless for a lot of moves, until I blunder and it wins the game)."

17,e4,e2e4,rnb1kb1r/pp1ppppp/2p5/3n4/1q1PPP2/NP5N/PBPQ2PP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 9,No way:
18,Qxd2+,b4d2,rnb1kb1r/pp1ppppp/2p5/3n4/3PPP2/NP5N/PBPq2PP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 10,"So white has an impressive center, etc. Ok."
19,Kxd2,e1d2,rnb1kb1r/pp1ppppp/2p5/3n4/3PPP2/NP5N/PBPK2PP/R4B1R b kq - 0 10,"So white has an impressive center, etc. Ok."
20,Nb6,d5b6,rnb1kb1r/pp1ppppp/1np5/8/3PPP2/NP5N/PBPK2PP/R4B1R w kq - 1 11,Nc3 only granted him a tempo after e4. And Ne5+ is not interesting.
21,Bd3,f1d3,rnb1kb1r/pp1ppppp/1np5/8/3PPP2/NP1B3N/PBPK2PP/R6R b kq - 2 11,"This is ok, because now the white's dsb is really useless. But I don't want to be ""squeezed"" after e3. On the other side, BxNa6 doubles his pawns, but provides him with a semiopen column."
22,d5,d7d5,rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/1np5/3p4/3PPP2/NP1B3N/PBPK2PP/R6R w kq - 0 12,"This is ok, because now the white's dsb is really useless. But I don't want to be ""squeezed"" after e3. On the other side, BxNa6 doubles his pawns, but provides him with a semiopen column."
23,e5,e4e5,rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/1np5/3pP3/3P1P2/NP1B3N/PBPK2PP/R6R b kq - 0 12,"This is ok, because now the white's dsb is really useless. But I don't want to be ""squeezed"" after e3. On the other side, BxNa6 doubles his pawns, but provides him with a semiopen column."
24,Bg4,c8g4,rn2kb1r/pp2pppp/1np5/3pP3/3P1Pb1/NP1B3N/PBPK2PP/R6R w kq - 1 13,Maybe it was ok BxN anyway.
25,Nf2,h3f2,rn2kb1r/pp2pppp/1np5/3pP3/3P1Pb1/NP1B4/PBPK1NPP/R6R b kq - 2 13,"This was the plan. I lose the ""good bishop"", ok, but I have the semiopen column. Anyway, this ""good"" bishop had few places to go, since white can play f4 at any time."
26,h5,h7h5,rn2kb1r/pp2ppp1/1np5/3pP2p/3P1Pb1/NP1B4/PBPK1NPP/R6R w kq - 0 14,"This was the plan. I lose the ""good bishop"", ok, but I have the semiopen column. Anyway, this ""good"" bishop had few places to go, since white can play f4 at any time."
27,c4,c2c4,rn2kb1r/pp2ppp1/1np5/3pP2p/2PP1Pb1/NP1B4/PB1K1NPP/R6R b kq - 0 14,Wow! white is pawnstorming...
28,e6,e7e6,rn2kb1r/pp3pp1/1np1p3/3pP2p/2PP1Pb1/NP1B4/PB1K1NPP/R6R w kq - 0 15,"But I am catching up with developement, and I am ""closing"" the game."
29,c5,c4c5,rn2kb1r/pp3pp1/1np1p3/2PpP2p/3P1Pb1/NP1B4/PB1K1NPP/R6R b kq - 0 15,...he closes it more and more!
