1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"I'm playing White here. I like Nf3 because it's very safe and waits to see what Black wants to do. My knight should be good on f3 no matter how Black continues. This game was played with only 10 minutes per player, so it is not perfect, and there were many blunders by both sides. Black gave me a total win at one point, but I almost allowed him to draw because I made a lot of hasty moves"

8,e5,e7e5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3pp3/8/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 5,"My position looks somewhat passive, but I am very solid, so if Black overextends, then he could be left with weaknesses."

11,dxe4,d3e4,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3p4/4P3/5NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 6,"Now Black's pawn is weak from overextension, and I can pile attackers onto it"
