3,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,"Just what I had expected, the old queen bishop mate.  Kind of an insult but i'm still cautious."
4,Bc5,f8c5,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 3,I wanted to start the pressure on his weak pawn.

10,Ng4,f6g4,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/3p4/2b1p3/2B1PPn1/2NP4/PPP3PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 1 6,Here I was going to attack his queens bishop if he takes my bishop then I take with my knight and attack his queen. pretty strait forward.

13,Kd2,e1d2,rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/3p4/2b1p3/2B1PPnq/2NP3N/PPPK2PP/R1BQ3R b kq - 4 7,"No give, so this is my favorite part of the game.  I knew that if I could get his feisty knight out of the way then I have mate shortly.  So i thought that i'd offer my knight for free because i'm only a ""1220"" player"
14,Nf2,g4f2,rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/3p4/2b1p3/2B1PP1q/2NP3N/PPPK1nPP/R1BQ3R w kq - 5 8,I had to wait two days to see if he takes or not......

16,Qxf4+,h4f4,rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/3p4/2b1p3/2B1Pq2/2NP4/PPPK1NPP/R1BQ3R w kq - 0 9,"POW!  he resigned at this point.  I hate it when i get a resignation when mate is only a move away.  what a bitch but, whatever.  e2 or e1 only legal move fatal when my black beauty takes his Knight.    Upon resignation Decebals said that i played strong for my rating, I think that he didnt play strong enough for his.  Only in this game, he killed me on the next one.  Either way, I think that the moral of the story is, if your opponent underestimates you, make sure that he regrets it.  I received 19.4 points with this win."
