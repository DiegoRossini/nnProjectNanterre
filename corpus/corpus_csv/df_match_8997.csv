1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Deciding to ""start off slowly"" my first game against the Computers was against a battered old handheld chess device, called ""Star Chess"", which is still going strong after 28 years. I had decided to play ALL the chess computers/programs I could find, and I could certainly find this one, albeit at the back of an old cupboard covered in dust. Let's see how our veteran handheld chess computer fares. Will it prove a worthy representative of the Computers?"
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"Star Chess plays the line which could go into many main line Queen Pawn openings, such as the Nimzo-Indian, the Gruenfeld or the King's Indian, or even transposing back into Classical Queen's Gambit Declined."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,I choose the most common move in this situation.
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"This could go into either King's Indian Defence or Gruenfeld Defence. Anyway, White's main line third move is the same for both."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,Ah! Star Chess has opted for the King's Indian Defence! I am inexperienced with the lines of the King's Indian but I know how to play it in principle...
6,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,Ah! Star Chess has opted for the King's Indian Defence! I am inexperienced with the lines of the King's Indian but I know how to play it in principle...
7,e4,e2e4,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"I choose the Four Pawns Attack (I wonder how it got that name...). My c- d- e- and f-pawns have amazing control over the centre, backed up by the knight on c3. I hope to develop more pieces quickly to keep hold on my excellent pawn structure."
8,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQ - 1 5,"I choose the Four Pawns Attack (I wonder how it got that name...).

10,Nc6,b8c6,r1bq1rk1/ppppppbp/2n2np1/8/2PPPP2/2N5/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR w KQ - 1 6,"Developing pieces can wait. As usual, I am anxious to push central pawns unchallenged into my opponent's territory."

12,Nb4,c6b4,r1bq1rk1/ppppppbp/5np1/3P4/1nP1PP2/2N5/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR w KQ - 1 7,"I am controlling more and more space, while Black is being pushed back and strangled out of space. Look at that immensely powerful pawn centre! Plus, I have excellent scope for shoving Black's queenside knight around."
13,e5,e4e5,r1bq1rk1/ppppppbp/5np1/3PP3/1nP2P2/2N5/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR b KQ - 0 7,"I am controlling more and more space, while Black is being pushed back and strangled out of space. Look at that immensely powerful pawn centre! Plus, I have excellent scope for shoving Black's queenside knight around."
14,Nh5,f6h5,r1bq1rk1/ppppppbp/6p1/3PP2n/1nP2P2/2N5/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR w KQ - 1 8,A blunder by Star Chess...I think. His kingside knight is now trapped.

16,d6,d7d6,r1bq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p2p1/3PP2n/1nP2PP1/2N5/PP5P/R1BQKBNR w KQ - 0 9,"Well, my brilliant pawn formation wasn't going to last forever. But I have already fulfilled the goal of getting a positional advantage - to convert it into a material advantage."
17,gxh5,g4h5,r1bq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p2p1/3PP2P/1nP2P2/2N5/PP5P/R1BQKBNR b KQ - 0 9,The best way I could see of defending my isolated f-pawn from my opponent's e-pawn and his rampaging rook on the half-open f-file. But I have some consolation for my now fragmented pawn structure. My opponent's e-pawns are doubled AND isolated. Maybe they can be picked off in the future...

Not an ideal occurrence, having to lose castling rights AND bring my king forward into the danger, but it would have been pointless castling on the exposed kingside anyway and I could only have castled on my queenside when the annoying enemy knight and enemy light-squared bishop had been beaten off."
