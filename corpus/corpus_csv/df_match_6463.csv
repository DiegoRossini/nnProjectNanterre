1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

It is the same old story - with quite a few of my expert games and even some of my master games I manage to get to 30 odd moves and am doing alright and then bang, summat goes wrong and I lose.  This is a classic example.  Before this game, which is a Sicilian, Antagonistknight my opponent warned me that going on the defensive against the Master Mater was not a good idea but what does Jo do, she gives Antagonistknight a classic example of defensive play right on a plate!  As before, here is the Gameknot Analysis link to this game:- http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=13852792&rnd=0.8263391849920074 -I may refer to it in my commentary, now on with the game."
