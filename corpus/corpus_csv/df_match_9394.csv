1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I've seen a couple annotated Dragons lately. Here's one I played recently. I think this game is quite interesting in terms of positional compensation and piece activity against material.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"A little thoughts about the Dragon; Some people seem to think that it's not sound against best play unlike some other openings, but I think it's perfectly playable at all levels of chess. I agree that White's plan is easier to adopt than blacks, but it makes no difference of the objective assesment of the opening.

I do think that the opening is rather one-sided, and I'm going to take some other openings against 1.e4 on my repertoire aswell. I've had bad score against the Scheveningen, so maybe I should experiment that line."

The pin on the f7-pawn might turn useful if white plays h4-h5xg6, because black would like to answer fxg6 keeping the h-file closed and to clear escape route for the king. It also defends the queenside lightsquares and prevents the move d5. However, the minus side of this bishop move is linked with loss of time. It is forced to move to b3 and many times equally forced to trade itself to a knight landing on c4. Thus some players prefer 9.0-0-0 d5 but it it mostly matter of taste."

I played this move at the first time in this game, mostly because I've had more problems breaking this formation as white than those where black allows the move h5. It's a little suspicious to play at the side of board where your opponent is stronger though...

I remember that I once read John Nunn writing something like that there are two ways to play the Dragon (or was it about all positions with opposite-side castling...) , the safe and the attacking way. The other is to use minimum amount of preventive moves on the side you are defending and use every possible tempo to attack on the other side - and this is the safe way! The other way is to completely ingore the opposite attack and trust that you are the one qho checkmates faster. 

It seems that black is now playing the ""safe"" way."

Sergei Karjakin once wrote on his blog something like: It's easy to win with the Dragon. Just move your rook to c5, sacrifice it to anything that comes to the fifth rank, pick up pawn(s) and win the endgame. Sometimes things may be that simple..."
