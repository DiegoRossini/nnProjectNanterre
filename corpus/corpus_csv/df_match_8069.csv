Not that any of this DB analysis means too much, but it still is somewhat valid. These are games from experts, masters, GMs, IMs, and even world champions in this DB, but nobody less than Expert. So they probably know what they're doing, and probably know what works, and the outcomes of 1 2/3 million games builds a strong case of which lines tend to lead to what outcomes. Of note, despite preparing for b5 to defend c4, bleck declines to try to save the pawn. Doing so usually leads to superior white development."
