1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

It's ding-a-ling, time for Round 2 in my Welcome MT Part 1 against Terence (Elyhim).  Terence k'oed me in less than 20 moves, aaargh and double aaargh!  So, how did this happen?  Well, here is a clue?  Old Matey just lurves those back ranks and corridors, and to the detriment of Henry, he found a nice little corridor here!  Now, I started off with 1. e4 and Terence responds with g6 which is the Robatsch Defense.  Just like the Pirc and the Sicilian Dragon, that black dark square bishop can prove an almighty handful."

This is certainly a good bit of imitation now, that pawn push down the h file.  So to prevent my knight becoming a horseburger for that little fellow on h4 I am gonna have to move said knight to f1.  This will certainly delay castling for at least one move.  In retrospect, maybe it would not have been a bad thing ..... hmm."

Terence said that I should have given up the exchange by playing Rf2.  Funnily enough, the Gameknot Analysis suggested that I would have had a perfectly viable game if I had done this.  Sadly at the time I did not see it that way, played Kh1 and missed the mate, aaaargh, this is the stuff of knightmares - mummy please put on that light!!"
