Analysing your games and seeing where you make mistakes is a crucial aspect of chess improvement, so I am going to be having a look at all the games I'm playing at longplay time limits this season. I hope you enjoy them, and I would welcome all suggestions, criticisms etc, as my negligible chess abilities will no doubt have missed something. Thank-you all for taking the time to have a look!
N.B. I apologise for all the anglicised bits (including spelling, dates etc) - not that it really matters."

Black on the other hand must seek to keep the position closed, which will favour his knights, and try to combine the mobile kingside pawns, the potential attacking formation of swinging the rook across (f6 - g6/h6) combined with the ls bishop could put white in trouble."

After the game, the move 10....c5 was suggested. dxc5 is horrible (tripled isolated pawns), but I believed it to be too committal - the knight is not going to develop on c6, and c5 (for white) won't be a possibility. It was best, I thought, to keep the pawn chain flexible."
