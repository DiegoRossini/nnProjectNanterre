6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,"This move promises an interesting game. Black counterattacks White's e-pawn but blocks the queen's defence of g5, meaning that after 4. Ng5 Black has to give at least a pawn to stop the attack on f7."
7,Ng5,f3g5,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p1N1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 5 4,"And this is the Traxler, the starting point for this mini-tournament. Black ignores f7 completely and eyes up the pawn on f2. There are several ways the game can go from here, but most of them are pretty wild. Instead, 4... d5 is usual, blocking the attack on f7; after 5. exd5 Black has several options including my own favourite 5... b5."
8,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p1N1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 6 5,"And this is the Traxler, the starting point for this mini-tournament.

Instead, 4... d5 is usual, blocking the attack on f7; after 5. exd5 Black has several options including my own favourite 5... b5."
9,Bxf7+,c4f7,r1bqk2r/pppp1Bpp/2n2n2/2b1p1N1/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"So far I've played this move over Nxf7 as I think it's what I'd be more likely to play if I face this opening ""in real life"", and I wanted to practise it and explore some variations. After 5. Nxf7, Black can play 5... Bxf2+ 6. Kxf2 Nxe4+ with a bizarre position. The game move instead grabs a pawn and forces Black to move the king, preventing future castling."
10,Ke7,e8e7,r1bq3r/ppppkBpp/2n2n2/2b1p1N1/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 1 6,"This seems to be preferred over Kf8, perhaps because f8 is a good square for the rook. However, even though the king is in no immediate danger on e7, Black must be wary of the skewer Bg5+ should the f6 knight stray away from home."
11,Bd5,f7d5,r1bq3r/ppppk1pp/2n2n2/2bBp1N1/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQ - 2 6,"6. Bd5! according to Wikipedia, but I've tried out both Bd5 and Bc4 to see how the game progresses from there."
12,Rf8,h8f8,r1bq1r2/ppppk1pp/2n2n2/2bBp1N1/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 3 7,"In my first game in this mini-tournament, 6... Nxd5? was played, but after that move Black simply does not have enough compensation for the pawn and his exposed king. Freddy played 6... d6. The rook move lines up the pawn on f2, threatening 7... Bxf2+ 8. Kxf2 Nxe4++."

Nxe5 regaining the pawn and leaving Black with far the worse pawn structure. Black could instead swap B+N for R+P on move 12 but this is rarely a good idea.

Nxd8 being able to take the d4 pawn does not offset the fact that the material difference of rook for bishop becomes more significant with queens are off. Having taken with the f-pawn, moving the queen is no longer a possibility (due to Nxg4) so really this is the only other defence."
