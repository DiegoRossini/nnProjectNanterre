16,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2n2n2/2pp4/8/1QNP1NP1/PP2PPBP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 1 9,I'm not too sure about this move. my queen wasn't doing a whole lot and this move only mislaces the knight who will now use a further tempo to get back into the game. I presumed at the time though that maybve this is so black can develop his LSB.
17,O-O,e1g1,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2n2n2/2pp4/8/1QNP1NP1/PP2PPBP/R1B2RK1 b - - 2 9,I'm not too sure about this move. my queen wasn't doing a whole lot and this move only mislaces the knight who will now use a further tempo to get back into the game.

19,Qc2,b3c2,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/5n2/n1pp4/8/2NP1NP1/PPQ1PPBP/R1B2RK1 b - - 4 10,It was hard for me to decide which square was better for my queen this one or d1. I went with this because it clears the backrank and eyes down the b1-h7 diagonal. In light of what happened I wonder if the queen would have been better suited on d1.
20,Be6,c8e6,r2q1rk1/pp2bppp/4bn2/n1pp4/8/2NP1NP1/PPQ1PPBP/R1B2RK1 w - - 5 11,Giving better scope for my bishop.
21,Bf4,c1f4,r2q1rk1/pp2bppp/4bn2/n1pp4/5B2/2NP1NP1/PPQ1PPBP/R4RK1 b - - 6 11,Giving better scope for my bishop.
22,Nh5,f6h5,r2q1rk1/pp2bppp/4b3/n1pp3n/5B2/2NP1NP1/PPQ1PPBP/R4RK1 w - - 7 12,"I had wondered if black might try this. It didn't concern me too much. Knights on the rim are dim, well black has both his knights on the edge."
23,Bd2,f4d2,r2q1rk1/pp2bppp/4b3/n1pp3n/8/2NP1NP1/PPQBPPBP/R4RK1 b - - 8 12,Keeping the rooks connected As well as targetting the knight on a5.

26,Rc8,a8c8,2rq1rk1/pp2bppp/2n1b3/2pp3n/8/2NP1NP1/PPQBPPBP/R2R2K1 w - - 11 14,"Good move. Placing a rook on the same file as the opponents queen is rarely a bad idea, this is emphasised by what happens in a few moves time."
27,a3,a2a3,2rq1rk1/pp2bppp/2n1b3/2pp3n/8/P1NP1NP1/1PQBPPBP/R2R2K1 b - - 0 14,"? creates a whopping big whole on b3 I even realised this during the game but played this to keep the knight out of b4, bad desision as the knight coming to b4 was no threat and the knight still had d4 anyway."

I had realised that blacks best play would be in getting the knihgt to d4 however I had not realised he could play it straight away. Now White cannot take the knight because after cxd4 white will lose the knight on account of the pin to the queen.
31,dxe4,d3e4,2rq1rk1/pp2b1pp/2n1b3/2pp3n/4P3/P1N2NP1/1PQB1PBP/R2R2K1 b - - 0 16,!
