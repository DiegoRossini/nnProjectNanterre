1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

It has been quite a while since I have annotated any games.  I have increased my games workload quite a bit and quite a few of those have been against Masters and Experts and some Class C Players who are giving me some tough games at the moment.  I did manage to win both my games over Lallit (who is ezyaz) - he played better with the black pieces than with the white.  Just like my other Class D buddy, The Dentist aka Tofuman, Lallit's optimum rating has once been in the 1400s so he can be a Dark Horse at times as my Class B Buddy NN found out.  Buddy NN now plays the Master Mater's favourite response to 1. e4 which is Nf6 which is the Alekhine's Defense."
