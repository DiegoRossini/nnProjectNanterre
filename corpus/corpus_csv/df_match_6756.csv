1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This great classic game was played in Paris in 1858 after Morphy traveled to play a match against Harrwitz which he won ( +5 -2 =1) after Harrwitz retired. Later he defeated Anderssen (+5 -1 =1) winning the last five games in a row! Regular type annotations are Kasparov's while parenthetical annotations are the author's humble contributions :)
