1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,The first game in a series where I play to see if I can combat computers such as these.
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I chose the Queen's gambit becuase computers tend to play classical positions very strongly. I wanted to test myself, so this seemed a logical choice."

5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"A classical opening has been played - with chances for both sides. An evaluation suggests how Black's knights are hemmed in, but he compensates for this by having central influence, and pressure on e4 which is amplified by the tying-down of my c3-knight. On the other hand, I have more active pieces than Black."

17,Bf4,g5f4,r1bq1rk1/pp1n1pp1/2p1pn1p/2Pp4/1b1P1B2/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 1 9,"The back-step might appear disadvantageous, but the d6-square has now become -  not just a square - but a valuable outpost. Another bonus by the step-back is the increased pressure on e5."

32,f5,f6f5,r1b3k1/pp3rp1/2pBp2p/q1P2p2/3Pp3/2P1P3/P1Q2PPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 17,"An evaluation shows how Black's dark-squared bishop isn't on the board, meaning the b8-h2 diagonal is under my control. This includes the d6 and e5-squares - meaning that Black has trouble manoeuvering effectively. Also, the fact that Black has now instituted two pawns on the c8-h3 diagonal means that Black's dark-squared bishop is useless. Even if Black could free the a6-square for the stricken bishop, It only aims at a pawn chain consisting of four pawns.
 In terms of movement, Black could have played 16...b6, but would result in (17.cxb6 axb6 18.Bb4 [else Qxe4] 18...Qf5 19.f3 exf3 20.Qxf5 exf5 +/-) leaving doubled pawns for Black."
