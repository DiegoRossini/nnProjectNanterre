11,Nce2,c3e2,rnbqk2r/p1p1nppp/1p2p3/3pP3/1b1P4/8/PPPBNPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 1 6,The idea is to avoid exchange of light squared bishops and transfer the knight to the kingside for attack on black's king. Also by forcing black to exchanges dark squared bishops white gains more control than black on the dark squares because his queen is on a more active dark square than black's queen.
