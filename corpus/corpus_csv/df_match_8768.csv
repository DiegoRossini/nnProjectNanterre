1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Blitz with e4!  I definitely cannot make good positional judgments in a quick game compared to, say, correspondence."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Darn, a Sicilian, he probably is booked up decently well in his line, and I don't want to have to fumble around with what little knowledge I have, so I avoid all that with..."
3,c3,c2c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"The Alapin variation.  I know, I'm definitely a wuss for not adventuring into Open Sicilian lines."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,I suspect he doesn't know what he's playing.  2... Nf6 and 2... d5 are better.
5,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/3PP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,A nice center for white already.
6,cxd4,c5d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3pP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,A nice center for white already.

8,e6,e7e6,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/8/3PP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"I suspect 4... d5 is stronger here, playing the position similarly to the Nimzovich Defense"
9,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/8/3PP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"Probably why he chose to develop with 5... Bb4 , so he could get the Knight to e7 and quickly castle.  It's a fairly decent plan, but he does run into a hitch."
10,Bb4+,f8b4,r1bqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/8/1b1PP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,"Probably why he chose to develop with 5... Bb4 , so he could get the Knight to e7 and quickly castle.  It's a fairly decent plan, but he does run into a hitch."

14,d5,d7d5,r1bqk2r/pp2nppp/2n1p3/3p4/1b1PP3/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,Trying to grab a stake in the center.
15,e5,e4e5,r1bqk2r/pp2nppp/2n1p3/3pP3/1b1P4/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,Which I just push past; I'm very comfortable with this type of setup.
16,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp2nppp/2n1p3/3pP3/1b1P4/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 1 9,"??

My opponent is clearly playing too quickly, and I go into a relatively deep think here (about 20-30 seconds) assessing the position for my tactical shot."

19,Ng5+,f3g5,r1bq1r2/pp2nppk/2n1p3/3pP1N1/1b1P4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 1 10,"The natural continuation, of course."
20,Kg6,h7g6,r1bq1r2/pp2npp1/2n1p1k1/3pP1N1/1b1P4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 2 11,"Generally thought of as better than the alternative Kg8.

[10... Kg8  11. Qh5 Re8  12. Qh7  Kf8  13. Qh8  Ng8  14. Nh7  Ke7  15. Bg5  Nf6  16. Qxg7 Kd7  17. Nxf6  Kc7  18. Nxe8 ]  and black is down the exchange and two pawns."

23,bxc3,b2c3,r1bq1r2/pp2npp1/2n1p1k1/3pP1N1/3P3P/2P5/P4PP1/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 12,Same situation.
