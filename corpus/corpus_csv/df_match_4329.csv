9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"Here white had a lot of choice of variation, f3 (Saemich), Be2 (Petrosian). Looklike he's going for the main line."
10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 2 6,"?! Well not the most frequent move. Be2 is probably the best continuation, but it's still fine."
11,Bd3,f1d3,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 3 6,"?! Well not the most frequent move. Be2 is probably the best continuation, but it's still fine."
12,e5,e7e5,rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/3p1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 7,"?! Well I've played it pretty fast and not thought that the Bd3 move would have so much an impact. Generally, the 6.e5 move is quite usual when playing the KID, because if white exchange the pawns, then you can exchange queens and get a pretty descent game with black. But now, that the bishop blocks the d line, I think a move like Nbd7 would have been really better."
13,dxe5,d4e5,rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/3p1np1/4P3/2P1P3/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 7,! Well done. It doesn't look to have an immediate way to get back that pawn. The bishop and the knight protect the e pawn.
14,dxe5,d6e5,rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/5np1/4p3/2P1P3/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 8,! Well done. It doesn't look to have an immediate way to get back that pawn. The bishop and the knight protect the e pawn.

24,Ne5,c6e5,r2qr1k1/ppp2pbp/5np1/4n1B1/2P1P3/2NB1Q2/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w - - 1 13,! White must now lose a piece.
25,Qg3,f3g3,r2qr1k1/ppp2pbp/5np1/4n1B1/2P1P3/2NB2Q1/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b - - 2 13,?! Qxd3 would have been much better.

30,Nxg3,h5g3,r2Br1k1/ppp2pbp/6p1/8/2P1P3/2Nn2n1/PP3PPP/R2R2K1 w - - 0 16,"Now there's a lot of possible variations. But like have said Tal before, ""the opponent can only take one at once!"". I think whatever white do, black can keep his advantage. If 16.Rxd3 Bxc3(if Rxg3 then Be5) 17.bxc3 Nxe2+ 18.Kf1 Nf4! This way my knight threat his rook while my rooks threat his bishop."
31,Bxc7,d8c7,r3r1k1/ppB2pbp/6p1/8/2P1P3/2Nn2n1/PP3PPP/R2R2K1 b - - 0 16,? Chose to moving out. 16.Rxd3 Bxc3 17.bxc3 was the only way to equalize.
32,Nxb2,d3b2,r3r1k1/ppB2pbp/6p1/8/2P1P3/2N3n1/Pn3PPP/R2R2K1 w - - 0 17,"! Now I keep the advantage more easily! if hxg3 then Nxd1 then the bishop can get the knight or the rook. If Rc1 then Bxc3, Rxc3, Ne2+, Kf1, Nxc3. Finally, white resigns. I think there's a lot of things to study with this game."
