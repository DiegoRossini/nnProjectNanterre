1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,this can go several ways...possibly English opening
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,now it appears to transpose into a nimzo-indian
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,now it appears to transpose into a nimzo-indian
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Nc3 and then Bb4 would be a nimzo-indian round-about, but this game doesn't take that direction. Being a transposed d-pawn opening though, it is a good idea to get the c pawn to c4 and the knight out behind it asap."
5,a3,a2a3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/P7/1P2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"this is a very unusual move, per the chessgames.com database 20,699 upper-ranked players played Nc3 here, whereas only 45 played a3 (with a 28.9 % white score and a 49.9 black win score). It now turns into a Queen Pawn game (E00) or a Queen's Indian (E12)."
6,a6,a7a6,rnbqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p3pn2/8/2PP4/P7/1P2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"NO more book moves, these guys are on their own."
7,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p3pn2/8/2PP4/P3P3/1P3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"this looks like too many pawn moves with no development.  If Nc3 was in place, then the pawn could have gone to d4 right off..."
8,c6,c7c6,rnbqkb1r/1p1p1ppp/p1p1pn2/8/2PP4/P3P3/1P3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"another pawn move, presumably preparing d5, but it wasn't needed (and now blocks the knight."
9,b4,b2b4,rnbqkb1r/1p1p1ppp/p1p1pn2/8/1PPP4/P3P3/5PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,total forgoing of development to get space. The problem is that if the pieces aren't out there the opponents pieces can invade behind the pawn wall.
10,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1p1pn2/3p4/1PPP4/P3P3/5PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,here comes the d5 'break move' but it doesn't really break anything. Both sides are dangerously underdeveloped and and black at least can castle in 2 moves...
11,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1p1pn2/3p4/1PPP4/P3PN2/5PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,scrambling to prepare for castling. Prevents e5 which WOULD be a break move for black (albeit a dangerous one).
12,b6,b7b6,rnbqkb1r/5ppp/ppp1pn2/3p4/1PPP4/P3PN2/5PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,I read on digg.com today that checkers had been solved this week.... maybe these guys were inspired by this computer feat....
13,c5,c4c5,rnbqkb1r/5ppp/ppp1pn2/2Pp4/1P1P4/P3PN2/5PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"Why not the other knight....develop a piece and then exchanging knights would have doubled black's pawns. The only thing saving White so fare is that black isn't developing either. White may have planned to kick the knight with f3, but there are now dangerous threats with Qh5."
14,Ne4,f6e4,rnbqkb1r/5ppp/ppp1p3/2Pp4/1P1Pn3/P3PN2/5PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,"Why not the other knight....develop a piece and then exchanging knights would have doubled black's pawns. The only thing saving White so fare is that black isn't developing either. White may have planned to kick the knight with f3, but there are now dangerous threats with Qh5."
15,Nfd2,f3d2,rnbqkb1r/5ppp/ppp1p3/2Pp4/1P1Pn3/P3P3/3N1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 8,"Why not the other knight....develop a piece and then exchanging knights would have doubled black's pawns. The only thing saving White so fare is that black isn't developing either. White may have planned to kick the knight with f3, but there are now dangerous threats with Qh5."
16,bxc5,b6c5,rnbqkb1r/5ppp/p1p1p3/2pp4/1P1Pn3/P3P3/3N1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 9,"black opens a file, but it will take a while to use it."
17,bxc5,b4c5,rnbqkb1r/5ppp/p1p1p3/2Pp4/3Pn3/P3P3/3N1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 9,"black opens a file, but it will take a while to use it."
18,Qf6,d8f6,rnb1kb1r/5ppp/p1p1pq2/2Pp4/3Pn3/P3P3/3N1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 10,"Immediate checkmate threat, plus threatens bishop sacrifice on c5 with pressure on the unprotected a-rook."
19,Nxe4,d2e4,rnb1kb1r/5ppp/p1p1pq2/2Pp4/3PN3/P3P3/5PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 10,White quickly douses the flames.
20,dxe4,d5e4,rnb1kb1r/5ppp/p1p1pq2/2P5/3Pp3/P3P3/5PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 11,"threatens a discovery on the queen and somewhat protects the rook. White is still not too bad, both players have one iece developed and black has both doubled and 2 isolated pawns. White has one problem pawn, but the bishop is weaker than black's queen."
21,Bb2,c1b2,rnb1kb1r/5ppp/p1p1pq2/2P5/3Pp3/P3P3/1B3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 11,"threatens a discovery on the queen and somewhat protects the rook.

23,Bc4,f1c4,rnb1kb1r/5ppp/p1p1p3/2P2q2/2BPp3/P3P3/1B3PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 3 12,White prepares to castle.
24,g6,g7g6,rnb1kb1r/5p1p/p1p1p1p1/2P2q2/2BPp3/P3P3/1B3PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 13,Black takes his time in castling in order to get a better bishop.
25,O-O,e1g1,rnb1kb1r/5p1p/p1p1p1p1/2P2q2/2BPp3/P3P3/1B3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 1 13,rooks still aren't connected. What is white attacking here...it does prevent the black knight from coming out but the queen is dangerously off-side. The precep of attacking on the side where the pawns are pointing does not apply here as the center is not locked and it was never the 2 central pawns that were locked (just the c and d pawns).
26,Bg7,f8g7,rnb1k2r/5pbp/p1p1p1p1/2P2q2/2BPp3/P3P3/1B3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 2 14,rooks still aren't connected.
