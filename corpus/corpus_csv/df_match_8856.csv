1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game introduces me to the English Defense, a response that Kosten seems to imply is underrated (esp considering it's only used in 1 out of 80 English openings!) and chessgames.com bears him out with black winning as often as white for games in their database."
2,b6,b7b6,rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/1p6/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The idea here is to fianchetto the QB the same as in a Queen's Indian Defense, this of course would tend to counter the KB fianchetto of White's."
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/1p6/8/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"Unusual second move out of Kosten's book, not the usual 2. g3."
4,Bb7,c8b7,rn1qkbnr/pbpppppp/1p6/8/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,Develops the QB.
5,e4,e2e4,rn1qkbnr/pbpppppp/1p6/8/2P1P3/2N5/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"This was the idea behind the second move, to establish the KP at e4, this allows for the KB to develop without incident as well as reinforcing control of d5."
6,e5,e7e5,rn1qkbnr/pbpp1ppp/1p6/4p3/2P1P3/2N5/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,A reply not covered in Chapter 16 of Kosten's book.  His favored line for Black uses a 'hedgehog setup' with 3...c5.  Possibly this is a 'tit for tat' response to my 3. e4.
7,Nge2,g1e2,rn1qkbnr/pbpp1ppp/1p6/4p3/2P1P3/2N5/PP1PNPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"Develops the KN earlier than the text does, now if Black plays 4...Bb4 then 5. a3 refutes."
8,Be7,f8e7,rn1qk1nr/pbppbppp/1p6/4p3/2P1P3/2N5/PP1PNPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,Prepares to castle K-side.
9,g3,g2g3,rn1qk1nr/pbppbppp/1p6/4p3/2P1P3/2N3P1/PP1PNP1P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,Fianchettoes the KB.
10,Nf6,g8f6,rn1qk2r/pbppbppp/1p3n2/4p3/2P1P3/2N3P1/PP1PNP1P/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,"White has very strong control of d5 at this point, also has shared control of d4 due to Black's c-pawn hanging back."
11,Bg2,f1g2,rn1qk2r/pbppbppp/1p3n2/4p3/2P1P3/2N3P1/PP1PNPBP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 6,"White has very strong control of d5 at this point, also has shared control of d4 due to Black's c-pawn hanging back."
12,O-O,e8g8,rn1q1rk1/pbppbppp/1p3n2/4p3/2P1P3/2N3P1/PP1PNPBP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 3 7,"White has very strong control of d5 at this point, also has shared control of d4 due to Black's c-pawn hanging back."
13,O-O,e1g1,rn1q1rk1/pbppbppp/1p3n2/4p3/2P1P3/2N3P1/PP1PNPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 4 7,"White has very strong control of d5 at this point, also has shared control of d4 due to Black's c-pawn hanging back."

15,d4,d2d4,r2q1rk1/pbppbppp/1pn2n2/4p3/2PPP3/2N3P1/PP2NPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 8,"....instead I get my Q into the mix by playing 8. d4, counter to Kosten's strategy of securing the center with d3 then pawn-storming the K-side."
16,exd4,e5d4,r2q1rk1/pbppbppp/1pn2n2/8/2PpP3/2N3P1/PP2NPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 9,This of course invites an exchange of pawns...
17,Nxd4,e2d4,r2q1rk1/pbppbppp/1pn2n2/8/2PNP3/2N3P1/PP3PBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 9,....followed by an exchange of N's....

19,Qxd4,d1d4,r2q1rk1/pbppbppp/1p3n2/8/2PQP3/2N3P1/PP3PBP/R1B2RK1 b - - 0 10,....with an ensuing conquest of the entire diagonal containing d4 by Black's KB!  This is a rather disappointing turn of events considering....

22,Re8,f8e8,r2qr1k1/pbpp1ppp/1p3n2/2b5/2P1P3/2NQ2P1/PP3PBP/R1B2RK1 w - - 3 12,Put off indefinitely is more like it as my insecure center appears to have attracted some notice by the opposition.
23,h3,h2h3,r2qr1k1/pbpp1ppp/1p3n2/2b5/2P1P3/2NQ2PP/PP3PB1/R1B2RK1 b - - 0 12,Makes way for the K as well as keeping Black away from f2.
24,Rb8,a8b8,1r1qr1k1/pbpp1ppp/1p3n2/2b5/2P1P3/2NQ2PP/PP3PB1/R1B2RK1 w - - 1 13,This allows for the QB holding its own versus White's KB should White decide to advance his KP.
