I had a peek through Nuntar's past game history and I spotted this little game.  This was against Coach Ion.  In this game Ion deviates from the usual Bxf7+ and plays Nxf7.  Here is how it all works out ...."

If Ion makes a ""sensible"" developing move such as 15. d3?? or Nc3?? then Rf8+ 16. Kg1 Qf2#.  There is only one way Coach Ion can avoid copping Old Matey and that is 15. h3.

The final position is interesting.  Coach Ion is 8 points ahead on material but his queenside is undeveloped and that is after move 15.  Ion was given no time to develop anything else.  It just goes to show that sometimes grabbing copious material at the expense of developing your pieces in the opening can meet with condign punishment, remember, the white player is a very strong Expert and don't I know it but here he came within a whisker of copping Old Matey from a 1600+ opponent, as it was, he had to concede a Low Draw.  I think this is why Nxf7 is NOT played by white against the Traxler as it lead to the above scenario.  Your attack was extremely enterprising, nuntar and I hope I have learned something from it.  You developed your pieces quickly and took advantage of the open lines and made multiple threats.  I take my hat off to you.  Cheers - Joanne"
