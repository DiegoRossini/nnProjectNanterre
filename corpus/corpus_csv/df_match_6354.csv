This game is about grinding down your opponent with the center. having the center is extremely important in the end game,not having it can result a loss. In this game my opponent made a mistake causing him to loose the center and the game."
61,Bxc7,b6c7,5k2/2B1b1p1/5p1p/pN2pn2/2P5/7P/P4PP1/5K2 b - - 0 31,"Alright here's another end game,i am white,my opponent is black. This game is about grinding down your opponent with the center. having the center is extremely important in the end game,not having it can result a loss. In this game my opponent made a mistake causing him to loose the center and the game."
62,a4,a5a4,5k2/2B1b1p1/5p1p/1N2pn2/p1P5/7P/P4PP1/5K2 w - - 0 32,my bishop was attacking that a5 pawn so just moving it out of the bishop's sight is ok to do. You may ask ''why not 31. ... Bb4?'' which seems ok however the problem with that move is that now the bishop becomes defensive. In the end game you dont want to be defensive because you won't have any chances of winning. it's better to be aggressive even tho you might not win that piece.
63,Ke2,f1e2,5k2/2B1b1p1/5p1p/1N2pn2/p1P5/7P/P3KPP1/8 b - - 1 32,"Now i am aiming to move the king closer to the center,centralizing the king is a good thing to do,heck centralizing every piece is a good thing to do in the end game. Even tho i feared Nh4 to create weaknesses on the king side i decided that my king really needs to get in to the game. and as long as i stay on light squares i should be ok. as you see most of my pieces are on light squares to avoid the dark squared bishop. Now you are probably wondering also why not Nc3? well i feared the let go of the d4 and d6 squares and decided that i can play that move maybe later but first getting my king up is my main objective. Getting the knight off the center was a scary thing to do,i decided it is on an ok outpost at the moment."
64,Bc5,e7c5,5k2/2B3p1/5p1p/1Nb1pn2/p1P5/7P/P3KPP1/8 w - - 2 33,"Bc5. Well the bishop is simply better placed on c5 than on e7. Now it is targeting the f2 pawn preventing my king from moving to d3 which was my plan (d3-e4-d5 to support that passed pawn). also he is using a trick,he is blockading my passed pawns and that is an excellent thing to do in the end game."
65,Kf3,e2f3,5k2/2B3p1/5p1p/1Nb1pn2/p1P5/5K1P/P4PP1/8 b - - 3 33,i have to go to f3 instead if i want to move up. The downside with this move is that it is blocking in the f2 pawn. however i wasn't planning to camp on f3 anyways.
66,Ke7,f8e7,8/2B1k1p1/5p1p/1Nb1pn2/p1P5/5K1P/P4PP1/8 w - - 4 34,now he is moving his king closer to the center. the second point is moving to e6 (out of my bishop's range and protecting that knight)
67,Ke4,f3e4,8/2B1k1p1/5p1p/1Nb1pn2/p1P1K3/7P/P4PP1/8 b - - 5 34,see? told you i wasn't going to stay on f3. moving the king to the center was my point all a long.
68,Ke6,e7e6,8/2B3p1/4kp1p/1Nb1pn2/p1P1K3/7P/P4PP1/8 w - - 6 35,just defending the knight while attacking f2 on the same time
69,f4,f2f4,8/2B3p1/4kp1p/1Nb1pn2/p1P1KP2/7P/P5P1/8 b - - 0 35,"i decided the the most important thing to do here is Not letting his king come in to the 5th rank. exchanging pawns remove the pressure and making my king more elastic on the 4th rank. in the end game you don't want to give up ranks,they are important as well as seizing a file in the middle game."
70,Ng3+,f5g3,8/2B3p1/4kp1p/1Nb1p3/p1P1KP2/6nP/P5P1/8 w - - 1 36,"well we could expect this move,pushing my king back"
71,Kf3,e4f3,8/2B3p1/4kp1p/1Nb1p3/p1P2P2/5KnP/P5P1/8 b - - 2 36,attacking his knight

74,Nf5,g3f5,8/6p1/4kp1p/1Nb2n2/p1P2B2/5K1P/P5P1/8 w - - 1 38,"this position is better for white than a few moves back,all his pieces are out of the white squares expect the dark squared bishop."
75,Ke4,f3e4,8/6p1/4kp1p/1Nb2n2/p1P1KB2/7P/P5P1/8 b - - 2 38,"this position is better for white than a few moves back,all his pieces are out of the white squares expect the dark squared bishop."
76,Ne7,f5e7,8/4n1p1/4kp1p/1Nb5/p1P1KB2/7P/P5P1/8 w - - 3 39,"This move was a mistake. firstly he over looked my next move which is strong, secondly he is moving away from the center and now i am trying to use the center to grind him down, making him cramped until he will have no way out and this is interesting to see."
77,Nc7+,b5c7,8/2N1n1p1/4kp1p/2b5/p1P1KB2/7P/P5P1/8 b - - 4 39,"a good move, of course now it isn't possible to play Nc3 but i was really afraid of playing Nc3,moving pieces away from the center. but this move pushes his king back which is the first step of taking out my foe."
78,Kd7,e6d7,8/2Nkn1p1/5p1p/2b5/p1P1KB2/7P/P5P1/8 w - - 5 40,Kd7 Best move here but now comes a good move
79,Na6,c7a6,8/3kn1p1/N4p1p/2b5/p1P1KB2/7P/P5P1/8 b - - 6 40,Na6. I am knocking off that bishop from blockading my passed pawns and now things become to heat up.
80,Bg1,c5g1,8/3kn1p1/N4p1p/8/p1P1KB2/7P/P5P1/6b1 w - - 7 41,well in this position exchanging his dark squared bishop for my knight is just loosing for him since it is generally known a bishop is better than a knight.
81,c5,c4c5,8/3kn1p1/N4p1p/2P5/p3KB2/7P/P5P1/6b1 b - - 0 41,c5. now i am planning to move my pawn to queen. Look on the difference on the position now and after 38. Ke4. he has two pieces pushed down.
82,Kc6,d7c6,8/4n1p1/N1k2p1p/2P5/p3KB2/7P/P5P1/6b1 w - - 1 42,blockading the pawn with his king a king is a good blockader in the very end game due to if it gets knocked off it can simply move one step backwards and it will take time queening that passed pawn.
