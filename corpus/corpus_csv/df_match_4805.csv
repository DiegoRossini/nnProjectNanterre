2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,The standard opposition
3,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,"One of my favs, hate having bishops stuck behind pawns.. better in front"
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 3,standard
5,d3,d2d3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 3,"again wanted to give my bishop some breathing room, knights are more easily played later in the game as they can jump pawns"
6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3pp3/2B1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 4,"Offensive move, I could tell he really wanted the center of the board"
7,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3Pp3/2B5/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 4,As expected

9,Qf3,d1f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3np3/2B5/3P1Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 1 5,"I now move my queen out for two reasons one is to get it out, he cant really attack the queen anytime soon as his knight is in the middle of the board and cant protect that crucial g4 tile for the bishop.  I also attack his knight and put a little but of pressure on the f7 pawn"
10,Be6,c8e6,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4b3/3np3/2B5/3P1Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 2 6,He covered both
11,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4b3/3np3/2B5/2NP1Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 3 6,"At this point he is in danger of losing his b7 pawn if he moves his knight, that is why I attacked hi knight on d5"
12,Bb4,f8b4,rn1qk2r/ppp2ppp/4b3/3np3/1bB5/2NP1Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 4 7,He obviously did not like that
13,Bd2,c1d2,rn1qk2r/ppp2ppp/4b3/3np3/1bB5/2NP1Q2/PPPB1PPP/R3K1NR b KQkq - 5 7,"Everytime an opponent does that bishop move I find it is a perfect opportunity to play your own bishop and get his out, sort of creates a stalemate on that piece now.."
14,c6,c7c6,rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/2p1b3/3np3/1bB5/2NP1Q2/PPPB1PPP/R3K1NR w KQkq - 0 8,He realizes he need more support for that knight and also wants to protect the b7 pawn
15,Nge2,g1e2,rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/2p1b3/3np3/1bB5/2NP1Q2/PPPBNPPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 1 8,"At this point I really wanted to get all of my pieces into the middle of the board.. it seems like it was gonna be a stalemate type of game in the middle, having more pieces is always good"
16,O-O,e8g8,rn1q1rk1/pp3ppp/2p1b3/3np3/1bB5/2NP1Q2/PPPBNPPP/R3K2R w KQ - 2 9,We both castle
17,O-O,e1g1,rn1q1rk1/pp3ppp/2p1b3/3np3/1bB5/2NP1Q2/PPPBNPPP/R4RK1 b - - 3 9,We both castle
18,f5,f7f5,rn1q1rk1/pp4pp/2p1b3/3npp2/1bB5/2NP1Q2/PPPBNPPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 10,"This was a big move for him, it showed me that he is attacking with everythign he is got, giving up that protection of his king.. in my opinion, with my white bishop where he was, this move was too dangerous and a mistake.."
19,a3,a2a3,rn1q1rk1/pp4pp/2p1b3/3npp2/1bB5/P1NP1Q2/1PPBNPPP/R4RK1 b - - 0 10,"I attacked bishop, because now my black bishop on d2 is not protected and hence my knight on c3 is pinned down.. I dont like that"
20,b5,b7b5,rn1q1rk1/p5pp/2p1b3/1p1npp2/1bB5/P1NP1Q2/1PPBNPPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 11,"Again.. showing me that he is very offensive, and he potentially realizes what threat the bishop of mine has, it is infact pinning down his knight.. I actually focused on exploiting that weakness for most of the game"
21,Bb3,c4b3,rn1q1rk1/p5pp/2p1b3/1p1npp2/1b6/PBNP1Q2/1PPBNPPP/R4RK1 b - - 1 11,"So I retreat, keeping the pressure on"
22,Bxc3,b4c3,rn1q1rk1/p5pp/2p1b3/1p1npp2/8/PBbP1Q2/1PPBNPPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 12,"He takes me.. I have 2 options now..take with my bishop or take with my knight, if I take it with my bishop I put pressure on the e5 pawn, however as I thought about this, this would just give him reason and opportunity to get his other knight into play, so I did not want to do that"
