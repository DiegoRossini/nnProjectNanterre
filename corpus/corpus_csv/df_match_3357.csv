1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I always start e4.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,attacking my pawn
3,e5,e4e5,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/4P3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,attacking his knight and securing space in the centre
4,Nd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/3nP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,I cant see why black opts for 1...Nf6. It just gives white the opportunity to secure space while black has to keep moving the knight cos its chased by pawns.
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/3nP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"When playing players rated higher than myself, I prefer an open, attacking game wherever possible. I have found that better players can often grind you down in long positional struggles. So i was glad to get a chance to open up here."
6,d6,d7d6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p4/3nP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,I'm ok exchanging pawns if he wants
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p4/3nP3/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,continuing my development
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2np4/3nP3/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,as does he
9,c4,c2c4,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2np4/3nP3/2PP4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,continuing my plan to gain space and harass him
10,Nb6,d5b6,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/1nnp4/4P3/2PP4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,he retreats
11,e6,e5e6,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/1nnpP3/8/2PP4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,I got this idea from opening theory and it suited me fine here. I sacrifice a pawn in order to cramp his development. 6...Bxe6 loses a piece for two pawns so he has to play the following...
12,fxe6,f7e6,r1bqkb1r/ppp1p1pp/1nnpp3/8/2PP4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,I can now develop quickly whilst he is cramped. I'm eyeing a king side attack.
13,Be3,c1e3,r1bqkb1r/ppp1p1pp/1nnpp3/8/2PP4/4BN2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 7,developing a piece whilst bolstering my central pawns. I'm happy with this position.
14,g6,g7g6,r1bqkb1r/ppp1p2p/1nnpp1p1/8/2PP4/4BN2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,preparing Bg7 - to free his cramped bishop and exert pressure on the a1 h8 diagonal.
15,h4,h2h4,r1bqkb1r/ppp1p2p/1nnpp1p1/8/2PP3P/4BN2/PP3PP1/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,It all takes valuable time though which I didn't intend to give him - Here goes my king side attack !
16,Bg7,f8g7,r1bqk2r/ppp1p1bp/1nnpp1p1/8/2PP3P/4BN2/PP3PP1/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 1 9,as expected
17,h5,h4h5,r1bqk2r/ppp1p1bp/1nnpp1p1/7P/2PP4/4BN2/PP3PP1/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 9,My attack continues - I'm happy enough with this.
18,e5,e6e5,r1bqk2r/ppp1p1bp/1nnp2p1/4p2P/2PP4/4BN2/PP3PP1/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 10,"With his bishop in place, he stakes a claim to the central dark squares."
19,d5,d4d5,r1bqk2r/ppp1p1bp/1nnp2p1/3Pp2P/2P5/4BN2/PP3PP1/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 10,I dont want the centre open yet. This move gives me some control over the light coloured squares c6 and e6 and he is forced to move a knight out of the way again.
20,e4,e5e4,r1bqk2r/ppp1p1bp/1nnp2p1/3P3P/2P1p3/4BN2/PP3PP1/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 11,clearing e5 for his knight
