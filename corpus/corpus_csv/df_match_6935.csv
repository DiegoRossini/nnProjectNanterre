1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

This game is against another buddy of mine, Warren.  We are participating in the King's Indian Defense 4 pawns attack mini-tournament.  In some ways for the white player, it is like facing a Sicilian Dragon except that white usually castles short here.  I did castle long in my 4 pawns attack game against Master Freddy but sadly I lost that game.  I will take the action on to move 6 which is the first of the non-forced moves."
