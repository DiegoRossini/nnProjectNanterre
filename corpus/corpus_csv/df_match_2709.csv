8,dxe5,d6e5,rnb1kbnr/ppp1qppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"(?!) I don't think I would play this in a rated game, but it certainly made for an interesting game.  I think black is best served with 5. ...Nf6, but there are a variety of options.  The key points are that the queen can't be kicked by a pawn immediately (because of Qxe5) and the queen is holding the white bishop to c8 with the threat of Qxb7.  This breaks plenty of accepted principles, but I haven't thought of a line yet in which white is clearly behind because of it.  If anyone sees one please let me know!"
