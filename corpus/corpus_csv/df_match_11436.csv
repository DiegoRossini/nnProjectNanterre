1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was a close fought battle, despite having the black pieces I had the initiative throughout the match, eventually this told as my opponents position fell apart"
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Meeting the pawn head on and keeping a foothold in the centre. Blacks plan in d4 openings is usually to advance the c-pawn to break apart whites potencially crushing centre.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"White developes his knight, this knight belongs on the f3 square so it's a good plan to put it there. Also developing this knight first keeps the option of moving the c-pawn in the future, whereas moving the b8 knight to c3 will block the pawn."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"Played for the same reason as white, it develops a piece, and retains the possibility of a c-pawn advance"
5,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,White takes the initiative in attacking the centre early. The c4 pawn is undefended however if I take it I will find it near impossible to hold onto and white will get a large advantage in development if I try.
6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Protects the pawn, and releases the f8 bishop. This move blocks the c8 bishop however I need to move the f8 bishop in order to castle, so this is my priority. Also I will be aiming to attack the centre with c5, so I want to keep this option without wasting a move with c6 first."
7,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"Played to protect the c4 pawn, and similar to my move frees the f1 bishop to allow early castling"
8,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/2PP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Attacking the centre. This position is very open on the queenside for both sides so early kingside castling is essential as the centre is about to be ripped apart, and the king will be very vulnerable in the centre"
9,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pP4/3P4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"This move gives the f1 bishop alot of room to move, and takes a centre pawn for a side pawn."
10,exd5,e6d5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/5n2/2pp4/3P4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"This move allows white to take the c-pawn, leaving me with an isolated d-pawn, which is seen as a major weakness by some masters, and and advantage by some masters (""He who is afraid of an isolated pawn should not play chess."" Tarrash)"
11,dxc5,d4c5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/5n2/2Pp4/8/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"Throwing the centre wide open and isolating my pawn, however my immediate bishop recapture will allow my to castle to safety"
12,Bxc5,f8c5,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/5n2/2bp4/8/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,Retaking the pawn
13,g3,g2g3,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/5n2/2bp4/8/4PNP1/PP3P1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,Planning to bring the pawn to g2 and preparing to castle to safety. This is logical as the bishop will be on the same diagonal as my 'weak' d5 pawn so may in the future allow him to build up pressure on the pawn
14,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/5n2/2bp4/8/4PNP1/PP3P1P/RNBQKB1R w KQ - 1 8,Castling to safety
15,Bg2,f1g2,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/5n2/2bp4/8/4PNP1/PP3PBP/RNBQK2R b KQ - 2 8,Preparing castling next move
16,Nc6,b8c6,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2n2n2/2bp4/8/4PNP1/PP3PBP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 3 9,"The series of exchanges and whites decision to develop the bishop to g2 have given me an advantage in development, 3 developed pieces and castled, to 2 pieces and uncastled. This will allow me to slowly build up pressure on my less developed opponent."
17,O-O,e1g1,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2n2n2/2bp4/8/4PNP1/PP3PBP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 4 9,"Castles to safety. The white kingside looks solid however the queenside is a problem, and white needs to develop it quickly"
18,Bg4,c8g4,r2q1rk1/pp3ppp/2n2n2/2bp4/6b1/4PNP1/PP3PBP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 5 10,"Developing the bishop and pinning the knight to the queen, this will allow me to pressure the knight as it cannot move"
19,a3,a2a3,r2q1rk1/pp3ppp/2n2n2/2bp4/6b1/P3PNP1/1P3PBP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 0 10,"This looks a strange move, however white has little else to do at this point. Another consideration may have been h3 to drive away the pesky bishop, however this weakens the position around the king. The played move prepares b4 and will gain space on the queenside"
20,Ne5,c6e5,r2q1rk1/pp3ppp/5n2/2bpn3/6b1/P3PNP1/1P3PBP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 1 11,Putting pressure on the knight although it is adequately protected so it doesn't cause any problems immediately
