15,Nxc6,d4c6,2kr1bnr/pppb1ppp/2Np1q2/1B6/4P3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 8,This appeared to be the best way to attempt to refute black's overaggressive play in the opening.  8 Nd5 came into consideration but was dismissed as wanting.

Ka8 14 Qb4! forces mate at once.  13 ... c5 14 Qa5 is the quietus.  Perhaps the most elegant line is 13 ... c5 14 Qa5 Ka8 15 Qxc7 Rb8 16 Qc6+!! Bxc6 17 Nc7mate.
