2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,Always a solid reply from black.

4,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"I don't normally see this reply, but i assumed we would eventually find ourselves into a QGD like position."
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,Development and adding a defender to the d4 square as well as trying to control the e5 square.
6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,Increasing the scope of the bishop as well as adding control to d5.
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,Further development and fighting for the center.

9,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pP4/3P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"Here my idea was that if he played exd5 i could play dxc5, creating an isolated d pawn which i could try and target."
10,Nxd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4p3/2pn4/3P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,Clearly that won't work now...
11,Nxd5,c3d5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4p3/2pN4/3P4/5N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,I'm wondering if this was an alright move to make. Perhaps i should of continued developing pieces via e3 to open up my Bishop?
12,Qxd5,d8d5,rnb1kb1r/pp3ppp/4p3/2pq4/3P4/5N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"Capturing with the Queen, i'm assuming to prevent the isolated d pawn."
13,b3,b2b3,rnb1kb1r/pp3ppp/4p3/2pq4/3P4/1P3N2/P3PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"Here i was looking to add support to d4, in retrospect i'm wondering if Bf4 was the better move. No worries though."

16,Be7,f8e7,r1b1k2r/pp2bppp/2n1p3/2pq4/3P4/1P3N2/PB2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 3 9,But first i'm going to free my bishop from the confines of the back rank.
