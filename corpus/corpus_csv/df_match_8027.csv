1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,A move as common as sunrise.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Sicilian, I see it a lot in expert play, and I have been playing it more frequently lately.  I figure if the big boys play it, it must be good!"
3,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,This is the Grand Prix Attack.
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Pretty standard play so far.
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/4PP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,The knight has to go somewhere. Standard chess dogma tells us that moving a piece twice before developing the other pieces is not the best practice.
6,dxe4,d5e4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2p5/4pP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,The knight has to go somewhere. Standard chess dogma tells us that moving a piece twice before developing the other pieces is not the best practice.
7,Ng5,f3g5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2p3N1/4pP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,As good a spot as any for the knight.  Better than going back to the home square any day.
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2p3N1/4pP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,"Black develops a knight, guards the advancing pawn on the e file and clears a spot kingside perhaps in hopes of a castle later. Having played this game, I know that is a dream."
9,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2p3N1/2B1pP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 5,White is throwing some firepower at f7. Makes 4 Ng5 look a lot smarter!
10,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2p3N1/2B1pPb1/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 6,"Black goes after the White Queen. With White's f pawn advanced so far the queen can only be protected by the knight or bishop which means ""backward advancement"" for white!"
11,Qxg4,d1g4,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2p3N1/2B1pPQ1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 6,What?
12,Nxg4,f6g4,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/8/2p3N1/2B1pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 7,"well, D'oh!  Thanks for the queen white, nice trade! But white has plans for the double attack on f7. White seems to believe that the positional advantage was worth the Queen."
13,Bxf7+,c4f7,rn1qkb1r/pp2pBpp/8/2p3N1/4pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 7,"This is the first move by the ""real"" players. Yikes! Was my first impression of Blacks position when these games started. As black, I felt like I was in trouble, even with the queen advantage!"
14,Kd7,e8d7,rn1q1b1r/pp1kpBpp/8/2p3N1/4pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 1 8,The only possible move.
15,Be6+,f7e6,rn1q1b1r/pp1kp1pp/4B3/2p3N1/4pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 2 8,White gets a little material back with this move.
16,Kc6,d7c6,rn1q1b1r/pp2p1pp/2k1B3/2p3N1/4pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 3 9,I choose the move c6 over c7 to keep the c pawn close and to allow escape into the corner after clearing the Queen's Knight and rook and a6 ... that was my idea anyhow.
17,Bxg4,e6g4,rn1q1b1r/pp2p1pp/2k5/2p3N1/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 0 9,"Bye Bye knight! now black is only up 3 points, but the queen advantage is helpful. White is still in good position and black's defenses are pretty shaky."
18,g6,g7g6,rn1q1b1r/pp2p2p/2k3p1/2p3N1/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 0 10,"I'll be honest, I moved here because it was the most popular move in the GK DB. I was worried about Ne6, but that should result in trading bishop for bishop and white must be careful about trading to blithely due to the queen deficit."
19,Nc3,b1c3,rn1q1b1r/pp2p2p/2k3p1/2p3N1/4pPB1/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 1 10,"White prepares to castle. Without a queen in the fray, protecting the King is paramount!"
20,Na6,b8a6,r2q1b1r/pp2p2p/n1k3p1/2p3N1/4pPB1/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 2 11,"Clearing space for my king on the home row, I hope I can manage to get him back there!"
21,Ngxe4,g5e4,r2q1b1r/pp2p2p/n1k3p1/2p5/4NPB1/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 0 11,"Giving away this pawn, but the black diagonals it blocked had to be cleared."
22,e6,e7e6,r2q1b1r/pp5p/n1k1p1p1/2p5/4NPB1/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 0 12,"Giving away this pawn, but the black diagonals it blocked had to be cleared."
