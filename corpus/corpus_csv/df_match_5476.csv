2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"This guy always plays Bc4 on me.  I don't really know if my continuation with Sicilian is appropriate, so any feedback here would be appreciated.  Every book and video I read/watch never covers when Bc4 is played here during Sicilian.  Also, I can bet that the d pawn won't move up to d4 to challenge my c pawn.  We'll see."

It prevents my knight and bishop from moving to g4, but does it in any way compromise King's defense?  This opponent typically does this on both sides of the board.  a3 will be a move at some point... or has been in previous games."

If 10.Nxd4 then cxd4 and that knight is gone and I gain a tempo attacking his other knight.

If he does something else, I will move Nxf3.  Eventually, I want to push ..d4, exd5..exd5.. and eventually bring my dark-squared bishop to d6.  I like the attacking lines of both bishops there."

i'm thinking move Be7 now, and hopefully contain my loses... which will be huge. 

where did I go wrong in the opening to find myself here?"
