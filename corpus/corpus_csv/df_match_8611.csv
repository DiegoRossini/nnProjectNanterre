1,g3,g2g3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/6P1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone - sometimes things do have a habit of biting you on the behind!  Take this game.  Now, I am trying to rid myself of the disease Passivitis, but guess what?  In trying to do so, I invite the very thing that I am trying to avoid.  I try to set up my knight on what I think is a strong outpost only for Freddy to undermine its support by an exchange for pawn sacrifice and boy does it not just work in his favour!  I start off with 1. g3.  I remember the last time I played g3 against an Expert, who is now Master Heinzkat and see if I have learnt anything from it......"
