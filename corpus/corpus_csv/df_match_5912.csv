In fact I hope to play the infamous Bryntse gambit, which is 1. e4 c5 2. f4 d5 3. Nf3 dxe4 4. Ng5 Nf6 5. Bc4 Bg4 6. Bxf7+ Kd7 7. Qxg4+ Nxg4 8. Be6+ with an all-out attack."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,But my opponent does not comply. Oh well...
5,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4PP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 3,"My opponent places his bishop to a strong square. He also prepares to castle. If he does, I would have a hard time to break through his defenses."

10,gxf5,g6f5,r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n5/2p2p2/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,He accepts the gambit. The h5-e8 diagonal has somewhat opened for business.

15,exf5+,e4f5,r1bq2nr/pp1pp1bp/2n3k1/2p2PN1/8/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQ - 0 8,"Of course! If I can bring his king towards my pieces, I may be able to mate him! That would be great..."
16,Kxg5,g6g5,r1bq2nr/pp1pp1bp/2n5/2p2Pk1/8/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 0 9,Black is really greedy here. I don't know if there is a better move though.
17,d4+,d2d4,r1bq2nr/pp1pp1bp/2n5/2p2Pk1/3P4/8/PPP3PP/RNBQK2R b KQ - 0 9,Of course!

22,Ke5,f6e5,r1bq2nr/pp1pp1bp/8/2p1kPBQ/3n4/8/PPP3PP/RN2K2R w KQ - 2 12,This move serves two purpose: It protects the c2 pawn while allowing my rook on the e file. My king cannot be checked for now as well.
