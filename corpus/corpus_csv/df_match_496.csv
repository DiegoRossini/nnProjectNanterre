4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,"Consistent with the idea of playing a Colle, but rather a conservative line.  I half expected White to play 3.Bg5 - the Veresov Attack.  You might notice that the thing would have looked like a left-handed Ruy Lopez: quite playable.  Otherwise, White might have played a quiet developing line like 3.Nf3, or even something wild and woolly: 3.e4!?, the dreaded Blackmar-Diemer Gambit (3.e4 dxe4 4.f3 exf3 5.Nxf3 ... with quick development for White).  Developing players wishing to hone their attacking skills could do worse than try out the Blackmar-Diemer."

White threatens to advance the pawn to e5 (the double attack on knight and bishop is a bonus), at the same time freeing the dark-square bishop.  White often starts thinking about K-side attack, from here on."

But you might already be noticing something about Black's light-square bishop.  Where is it going?  Its scope is pretty limited.  Recalling that Black has been playing a 'colours reversed' Colle system, we see here the downside of the System if the e-pawn doesn't make it to the fourth rank.  The c8-bishop won't be developed for another seven moves..."

Normally I hold this sort of thing back until an enemy piece lands on g5, and then I might hit it with the ...h6 move.  But take a look at Whites Queen and bishops.  Their focus is very much on the K-side.  It seemed to me as well to keep the White minor pieces back for the time being whilst I completed my development."

To illustrate the potential for K-side operations, had White played Qd2 and Black castled, this might have happened: 12.Qd2 0-0  13.Bxh6!? gxh6 14.Qxh6 Be7 (defending the attacked Knight) 15.Ng5 Qd8 16.Bh7ch Kh8 (NOT 16...Nh7 17.Qxh7#) 17.Bg6 Kg8 18.Bh7ch ... and a draw by threefold repetition.  If a snap attack like that was good enough to draw the game, who knows what White might have developed with more preparation?"

But this sortie is premature, and costs a pawn.  Not disastrous, White does obtain some compensatory activity for her developed pieces.
