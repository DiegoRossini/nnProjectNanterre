11,a3,a2a3,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/P1N2N2/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQ - 0 6,I see that my opponent had little surprise for me in this game. I was already prepared to continue with 6.Be2 but I wasnt worried about this move even that with this move white tries to put pressure on queenside later in this game.
12,e5,e7e5,rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/3p1np1/4p3/2PPP3/P1N2N2/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 0 7,I keep responding normally as normal moves are safe moves.
13,d5,d4d5,rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/3p1np1/3Pp3/2P1P3/P1N2N2/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQ - 0 7,Now this move has been played more rarely but it is used even that position isint same as normally with move Qe7. If we dont look at the move 6.a3 but instead 6.Be2 e5 7.e3 Qe7 then we see in which position this move is normally performed.
14,Qe7,d8e7,rnb2rk1/ppp1qpbp/3p1np1/3Pp3/2P1P3/P1N2N2/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 1 8,Now this move has been played more rarely but it is used even that position isint same as normally with move Qe7. If we dont look at the move 6.a3 but instead 6.Be2 e5 7.e3 Qe7 then we see in which position this move is normally performed.
15,Be2,f1e2,rnb2rk1/ppp1qpbp/3p1np1/3Pp3/2P1P3/P1N2N2/1P2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 2 8,In here 8.a5 0-0 is probably even better as a5 tries to fight back against white possible queenside pawn storm but by moving 8...Na6 im looking for possibility to play knight on c7.
16,Na6,b8a6,r1b2rk1/ppp1qpbp/n2p1np1/3Pp3/2P1P3/P1N2N2/1P2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 3 9,In here 8.a5 0-0 is probably even better as a5 tries to fight back against white possible queenside pawn storm but by moving 8...Na6 im looking for possibility to play knight on c7.
17,b4,b2b4,r1b2rk1/ppp1qpbp/n2p1np1/3Pp3/1PP1P3/P1N2N2/4BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 9,White starts his pawn pushing on early stage.
18,c5,c7c5,r1b2rk1/pp2qpbp/n2p1np1/2pPp3/1PP1P3/P1N2N2/4BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ c6 0 10,Now I was just trying to stop my opponent pawn pushing on queenside and looking for knight to be placed on c7.
19,b5,b4b5,r1b2rk1/pp2qpbp/n2p1np1/1PpPp3/2P1P3/P1N2N2/4BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 10,So know I am just forced to move Nc7. I was expecting 10.dxc6 bxc6 11.0-0 Bb7 but I think that 10.b5 and 10.dxc6 are about equal.
20,Nc7,a6c7,r1b2rk1/ppn1qpbp/3p1np1/1PpPp3/2P1P3/P1N2N2/4BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 1 11,These kind of slow positions are what I favour more than those energic attacking positions.
21,O-O,e1g1,r1b2rk1/ppn1qpbp/3p1np1/1PpPp3/2P1P3/P1N2N2/4BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 2 11,Now I am just looking for to play knight on h6 and pawn to f5.
22,Ng4,f6g4,r1b2rk1/ppn1qpbp/3p2p1/1PpPp3/2P1P1n1/P1N2N2/4BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 3 12,Now I am just looking for to play knight on h6 and pawn to f5.
23,h3,h2h3,r1b2rk1/ppn1qpbp/3p2p1/1PpPp3/2P1P1n1/P1N2N1P/4BPP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 12,12...Nf6 Re2 would lose the meaning of 11...Ng4.
24,Nh6,g4h6,r1b2rk1/ppn1qpbp/3p2pn/1PpPp3/2P1P3/P1N2N1P/4BPP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 13,12...Nf6 Re2 would lose the meaning of 11...Ng4.
25,a4,a3a4,r1b2rk1/ppn1qpbp/3p2pn/1PpPp3/P1P1P3/2N2N1P/4BPP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 13,White keeps pushing on.
26,f5,f7f5,r1b2rk1/ppn1q1bp/3p2pn/1PpPpp2/P1P1P3/2N2N1P/4BPP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 14,"This is normal move on Kings indian, I trying to open position little bit."
27,Bg5,c1g5,r1b2rk1/ppn1q1bp/3p2pn/1PpPppB1/P1P1P3/2N2N1P/4BPP1/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 14,Good move. This is also quite normal in Kings indian to move bishop this way and there also escaping route to h2 now. 14.Bxh6 Bxh6 is quite useless as it wont give anything to white.
28,Qd7,e7d7,r1b2rk1/ppnq2bp/3p2pn/1PpPppB1/P1P1P3/2N2N1P/4BPP1/R2Q1RK1 w - - 2 15,White keeps pushing again.
29,a5,a4a5,r1b2rk1/ppnq2bp/3p2pn/PPpPppB1/2P1P3/2N2N1P/4BPP1/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 15,White keeps pushing again.
30,Nf7,h6f7,r1b2rk1/ppnq1nbp/3p2p1/PPpPppB1/2P1P3/2N2N1P/4BPP1/R2Q1RK1 w - - 1 16,This is natural after moving knight to h6 followed by pawn to f5.
31,Bh4,g5h4,r1b2rk1/ppnq1nbp/3p2p1/PPpPpp2/2P1P2B/2N2N1P/4BPP1/R2Q1RK1 b - - 2 16,16.Bd2 Qe7 is what computer offered but black can move 16...Ne8 17.Bd3 Nf6 18.Qb3 f4 19.b6 a6 so that option isint any better than 16.Bh6.
32,h6,h7h6,r1b2rk1/ppnq1nb1/3p2pp/PPpPpp2/2P1P2B/2N2N1P/4BPP1/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 17,I am just securing g5 square with this move.
33,exf5,e4f5,r1b2rk1/ppnq1nb1/3p2pp/PPpPpP2/2P4B/2N2N1P/4BPP1/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 17,Only good capture of f5 pawn as 17...Qxf5? 18.Bd3 Qd719.Bxg6 fails.
34,gxf5,g6f5,r1b2rk1/ppnq1nb1/3p3p/PPpPpp2/2P4B/2N2N1P/4BPP1/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 18,Only good capture of f5 pawn as 17...Qxf5? 18.Bd3 Qd719.Bxg6 fails.
