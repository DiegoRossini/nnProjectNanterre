1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"e4 is good choice, open debut when you want to play and win"
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,e5 is correct
3,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,bishop on c4 is old idea but so what???
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 3,c6 looks not good and in my oppinion is waste of time
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 3 3,c6 looks not good and in my oppinion is waste of time
6,c6,c7c6,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2p2n2/4p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 4,c6 looks not good and in my oppinion is waste of time
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2p2n2/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,but knight on f3 is not the best move now...
8,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p2n2/3pp3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,d5 is absolute expectable
9,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p2n2/3Pp3/2B5/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,e:d is just one if white doen't want to play only in defence in this game...
10,b5,b7b5,rnbqkb1r/p4ppp/2p2n2/1p1Pp3/2B5/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,b5 is in the first view active move but in deeply thought is bad waste of temp
11,Bb3,c4b3,rnbqkb1r/p4ppp/2p2n2/1p1Pp3/8/1BN2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,b4 is maybe outside of a correct course
12,b4,b5b4,rnbqkb1r/p4ppp/2p2n2/3Pp3/1p6/1BN2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,b4 is maybe outside of a correct course
13,Na4,c3a4,rnbqkb1r/p4ppp/2p2n2/3Pp3/Np6/1B3N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,knight goes to the end of board and this is not best zone for active play...
14,e4,e5e4,rnbqkb1r/p4ppp/2p2n2/3P4/Np2p3/1B3N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,e4 is not conditional move in my strategy... so untypical move
15,Ng5,f3g5,rnbqkb1r/p4ppp/2p2n2/3P2N1/Np2p3/1B6/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 8,this may be  not the best idea there for white to play...
16,Nxd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/p4ppp/2p5/3n2N1/Np2p3/1B6/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,now black control the center and have good bishops... white have quick Chance to make 0-0
17,Nxe4,g5e4,rnbqkb1r/p4ppp/2p5/3n4/Np2N3/1B6/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 9,White take a pawn and black now have a good temp and attack
18,Qe7,d8e7,rnb1kb1r/p3qppp/2p5/3n4/Np2N3/1B6/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 10,horse on e4 is bad animal ;-)
19,Qe2,d1e2,rnb1kb1r/p3qppp/2p5/3n4/Np2N3/1B6/PPPPQPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 2 10,just one saving move there for white
20,Nf4,d5f4,rnb1kb1r/p3qppp/2p5/8/Np2Nn2/1B6/PPPPQPPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 3 11,so interesting idea - now have knight on g2...
21,Bxf7+,b3f7,rnb1kb1r/p3qBpp/2p5/8/Np2Nn2/8/PPPPQPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 0 11,now white make decision to play aggressive and make risk move
22,Kxf7,e8f7,rnb2b1r/p3qkpp/2p5/8/Np2Nn2/8/PPPPQPPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 0 12,best move because if queen takes on f7 white have knight on d6!
23,Qf3,e2f3,rnb2b1r/p3qkpp/2p5/8/Np2Nn2/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 1 12,NOW there are 2 stupid animals on the board - on e4 and f4
