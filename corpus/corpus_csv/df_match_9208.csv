6,dxc4,d5c4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/2pP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,I don't like this move. Far better to play 4.e4 and build up a strong pawn centre. 4.e3 is too passive and blocks in the dark-squared bishop.

Note that this would not have been so easy for White if Black had developed his minor pieces sooner and castled as soon as possible...which in turn means he should not have been wasting moves messing around with his queen so early and so much.
