18,bxc6,b7c6,r2qk2r/p2bbppp/2pppn2/1B6/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w kq - 0 10,"Regarding my previous comment, I may should have played ...Bxc6 to be less cramped. Still I wanted to keep as much pieces on the board as possible avoiding drawish tendencies. Now I have a solid center without need to spend time on ...a6."
19,Ba4,b5a4,r2qk2r/p2bbppp/2pppn2/8/B3P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq - 1 10,"I regard this a waste of time and would have let the bishop on d7 bound to it's mundane task to keep an eye on c6. I was expecting a kingside attack by f4, g4, g5 etc."
20,O-O,e8g8,r2q1rk1/p2bbppp/2pppn2/8/B3P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 2 11,"I regard this a waste of time and would have let the bishop on d7 bound to it's mundane task to keep an eye on c6. I was expecting a kingside attack by f4, g4, g5 etc."

22,Qc7,d8c7,r4rk1/p1qbbppp/2pppn2/8/4P3/1BN5/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 4 12,A somewhat tame move but I guess a neccessity because my knight will be under attack soon and the bishop on e7 is in doubled duty of defending Nf6 and Pd6.
23,Qd3,d1d3,r4rk1/p1qbbppp/2pppn2/8/4P3/1BNQ4/PPP2PPP/R1B1R1K1 b - - 5 12,"Yes, a good square for the queen. My opponent plays this as a positional game alltogether. Quite in alliance with his 9th move. The goal seems to increase pressure on my d-pawn forcing it to move thereby making e5 possible."
24,Rab8,a8b8,1r3rk1/p1qbbppp/2pppn2/8/4P3/1BNQ4/PPP2PPP/R1B1R1K1 w - - 6 13,"I am not that happy with this move anymore. There is an open file so I seize it, was my motiv. The b-pawn could become a target in the long run."
25,h3,h2h3,1r3rk1/p1qbbppp/2pppn2/8/4P3/1BNQ3P/PPP2PP1/R1B1R1K1 b - - 0 13,So white doesn't want to abandon the idea of a kingside pawn storm completely. By 12. Qd3 a possible g4 lacks support.
26,Rfd8,f8d8,1r1r2k1/p1qbbppp/2pppn2/8/4P3/1BNQ3P/PPP2PP1/R1B1R1K1 w - - 1 14,Further backing of the d-pawn.

Exchanging queens seemed to fit the bill. But now I see 18. ...Da7, 19. Qg3 a4, 20. Bc4 Rxb2 was a better option. I was afraid of the aggressive image of white given after 21. e5 Be7 and then 22. Ne4!"

43,Ne2,c3e2,3r2k1/3b1pp1/R3p2p/p3b3/2B1P3/7P/PrP1NPP1/4R1K1 b - - 1 22,One of the pawns on c2 and a2 is doomed anyway. So I invest a tempo to save my a-pawn. A draw is within reach.
