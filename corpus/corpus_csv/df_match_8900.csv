Now it looks like he has transposed into a Queen's Gambit (it's not much of a gambit now with his bishop defending the pawn at c4), maybe the Marshall Defense with the black knight at f6, though an early pawn move to e3 is not really main line for white in the Marshall Defense."

Bd2 we just end up exchanging bishops. I wanted to keep the position complex, so exhanging pieces early was contrary to my plans in that regard. Of course, white can easily play c5 at any time to drive back my bishop, so e6 might not have been the wisest choice for black here."
