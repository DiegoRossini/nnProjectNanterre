1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is one of the more interesting games I have played here at Gameknot.  It starts from a quiet, double-king pawn opening and becomes a double-edged game with attacking possibilities for both sides.  Most of the action is created when we castle on opposite sides, leading to a bit of a race to the king.  Enjoy!"

Whatever disadvantage comes from the bishop's lack of mobility early is made up for later."

With the kings on opposite sides, the potential for full-scale onslaughts on both sides of the board emerges.  This game turns into a race; however, with my development, I'm ahead already.  Also, notice that my g2 bishop is potentially a very good piece if I can open the center."
