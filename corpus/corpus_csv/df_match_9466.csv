1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone, just found this game scrawled on a piece of A4 paper.  It was an old OTB game played nine years ago.  I played a young 18 year old upper 6th form student in a best of 3 friendlies at my local Cambridge City Chess Club that night called Patrick Scott who had a BCF rating of 184 - I have translated this into ELO as above.  I went down 2.5 - 0.5 overall, but here is how the half point transpired.  It was the last of the 3 games and in fact my last ever game with him as the following week he moved away from Cambridge to digs near his prospective university.  This is the only time in my whole chess career that I have managed to draw any match of any description against an Expert."

I used to play the French Defense as black a lot in tournaments and in some friendlies such as this one.  This knight move, although it blocks in the white dsb does support the pawn on e4."
