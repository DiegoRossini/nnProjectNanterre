1,g3,g2g3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/6P1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This is a common opening played by Grandmasters and is usually followed by 2. Bg2 aiming to 'fianchetto' his Dragon Bishop controlling one of the longest diagonals on the board. Normal replies for Black are 1. ... e5/Nf6/g6 but the most common is 1. ... Nf6 (for Grandmasters).
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/8/6P1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"!? This move is also great as it aims to block the h1-a8 diagonal with the Caro-Kaan Defence, following with 2. ... d4, so if white plays 2. Bg2 he'll find that his diagonal is blocked and as bishops do not work well in closed positions, his bishop is not much use. This is also a great setup opening to the 'Brick Wall' which you will learn about later."
3,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/8/6P1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,"White sets off his Dragon Bishop, with the task of controlling the longest diagonal on the board, even though he knows that Black is going to play the Caro-Kaan Defence. This is because White aims to use his bishop as a defending piece in the opening and early middlegame, and as an attacking piece in the late middlegame and endgame."
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/8/6P1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 3,"Black sets up the Caro-Kaan Defence ready to block the bishop's line. Unfortunately, White does not much want an active bishop here at the moment, but hopes to use it in the late middlegame and endgame, as mentioned. The Caro-Kaan Defence is most likely to cause a Brick Wall."
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/8/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 3,The bishop now has limited squares to move on so that's why White hasn't cared about the fact that Black was playing the Caro-Kaan Defence.
6,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p1b2/8/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 4,"Black is very much focused on developing the bishop before moving the pawn to e6, ready to form another pawn chain and a Brick Wall. To be honest, it is better to have a bishop behind a pawn chain rather than in front, where it may get easily attacked and will have to move. Also, the central pawns will already be protected by other pawns, so the bishop is just giving it some backup."
7,O-O,e1g1,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p1b2/8/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 3 4,"This is a form of 'quiet castling' where no central pawns have been moved, no queenside pieces have been developed and the king knight and king bishop are all close to home, and all the pieces/pawns are no further than the third rank."
8,Nd7,b8d7,r2qkbnr/pp1npppp/2p5/3p1b2/8/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 4 5,"Black thinks the opposite, and aims to develop all his queenside pieces and aiming for long-castling, attacking aggressively in the centre. This will occupy a few moves, but is better than not castling at all, of course."
9,Nc3,b1c3,r2qkbnr/pp1npppp/2p5/3p1b2/8/2N2NP1/PPPPPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 5 5,"Even though the knight has moved, all the pieces are still close to home and are still no further than the third rank. Still, White aims to develop all the knights before moving any central pawns, and possibly fianchetto the opposing bishop."
10,e6,e7e6,r2qkbnr/pp1n1ppp/2p1p3/3p1b2/8/2N2NP1/PPPPPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 6,"Black aims to form lots of pawn chains, so he can create a Brick Wall where no pieces/pawns can attack him. This is misleading, as pieces on the dark squares will easily get into Black's position."
11,d4,d2d4,r2qkbnr/pp1n1ppp/2p1p3/3p1b2/3P4/2N2NP1/PPP1PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 6,"White opens up his first central pawn and aims to control the dark squares. Since he has a light squared bishop on g2, it will be difficult to attack white no matter which colour square you are on."
12,Bd6,f8d6,r2qk1nr/pp1n1ppp/2pbp3/3p1b2/3P4/2N2NP1/PPP1PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 1 7,"This move enables the bishop to develop to a safe square, and for the queen to come to e7, without blocking the bishop, and also disables White's DSB to come to f4 without messing up his pawn structure. This also guards the Black squares, so no pieces can get into Black's castles."
13,b3,b2b3,r2qk1nr/pp1n1ppp/2pbp3/3p1b2/3P4/1PN2NP1/P1P1PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,"White aims to develop his bishop through the c1-a3 diagonal, without blocking any pawns."
14,Qe7,d8e7,r3k1nr/pp1nqppp/2pbp3/3p1b2/3P4/1PN2NP1/P1P1PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 1 8,"Black is now preparing for queenside castling (O-O-O), and develops his queen to a safe square, where it protects the bishop and the knight, and also the f7 pawn. Note that 7. ... Qc7! is just as good, and maybe even better as the queen and bishop may aim at White's kingside."
15,Bb2,c1b2,r3k1nr/pp1nqppp/2pbp3/3p1b2/3P4/1PN2NP1/PBP1PPBP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 2 8,"White has now got control of both long diagonals on the board, and Black will hardly be able to control any after the lines have been opened!"
16,O-O-O,e8c8,2kr2nr/pp1nqppp/2pbp3/3p1b2/3P4/1PN2NP1/PBP1PPBP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 3 9,"And now Black's plan has been achieved. He has got all his bishops coming into play, his knight controlling the e5 square, his queen in a good position, his king safe, and only the knight on g8 is needed to come into play."
17,Qd2,d1d2,2kr2nr/pp1nqppp/2pbp3/3p1b2/3P4/1PN2NP1/PBPQPPBP/R4RK1 b - - 4 9,"White now connects his rooks and brings his queen into play, onto a safe square, of course."
18,Ngf6,g8f6,2kr3r/pp1nqppp/2pbpn2/3p1b2/3P4/1PN2NP1/PBPQPPBP/R4RK1 w - - 5 10,"Black does the same, and connects his rooks, bringing the knight into play."
19,e3,e2e3,2kr3r/pp1nqppp/2pbpn2/3p1b2/3P4/1PN1PNP1/PBPQ1PBP/R4RK1 b - - 0 10,"White now forms a pawn chain, making the Brick Wall better than ever."
20,Rhe8,h8e8,2krr3/pp1nqppp/2pbpn2/3p1b2/3P4/1PN1PNP1/PBPQ1PBP/R4RK1 w - - 1 11,Black centralizes his rooks...
