There's an old game, Spielmann vs. Eliskases (1932) -- link here: http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1040762 -- where if black plays gxf5 on his 12th move, white gets a mate in exactly this fashion.  Somehow, I thought of that tactic in this position."

But this move carries -- at least I saw -- the immediate threat of Bxb7, where white achieves (at least) material equality and a superior position to boot."

White offers his QUEEN for what must be an all-out attack.  The only reasonable way to decline the sacrifice that I've found is Qc5, as Qd8 runs into the nightmarish Nxe6, and all other moves either result in her capture or a loss of material after something like Nc7+."
