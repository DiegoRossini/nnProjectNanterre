6,d5,d7d5,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/3pp3/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"The battle for the center. If i don't take exd5 then i lose pawn, if i defend it with d3 pawn, then d5xe4 and if take it with d3xe4   Qxd1  Kxd1 i'll be forced to echange queens lose tempos and cannot castle, and the game is pretty much in Black Hands.  

So instead, the only good move i see is counter attack with Bb5"

Besides Attacking c6 im also attack e4 two valuables pawns for Black


If Qxe5 then Qc6  forking king and rook, following next move i take rook.
knight for a rook & pawn while opening black king defenses is not good choice.

If Qxg2 I again reply with Qc6"
