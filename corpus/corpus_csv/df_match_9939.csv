1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game is is titled ""The last march of the Pawns."" The cool thing about this game is that at one point goes up a rook in material. However yet it is he who ends up in the mating net."

7,Qxd4,d1d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/8/2PQP3/8/PP3PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 0 4,I played the queen back to her orginal square because at this point I was not sure which diagonal she would be best on. Also I wanted to keep my bishop lines clear and free. AT this point my goal is to setup a typical mazanony bind in the centre.

10,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/8/2P1P3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 3 6,defending the e4 pawn and developing my knight to a central square.

12,Bb4,f8b4,r1bqk2r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/8/1bP1P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 5 7,a pin in the spirit of the mizo-Indian defense. Black is trying to create pressure on e4.
13,Nge2,g1e2,r1bqk2r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/8/1bP1P3/2N5/PP2NPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 6 7,This is weaker than Qc2 because it lets black take e4 with very little consequence.
14,Nxe4,f6e4,r1bqk2r/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/8/1bP1n3/2N5/PP2NPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,Defending e4 and threatening mate on f2.

17,Be3,c1e3,r1b1k2r/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/8/1bP1n2q/2N1B3/PPQ1NPPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 3 9,defends the f3 and develops another peice
18,Ne5,c6e5,r1b1k2r/pp1p1ppp/4p3/4n3/1bP1n2q/2N1B3/PPQ1NPPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 4 10,trying to win the hanging pawn on c4

20,Nxc3,e4c3,r1b1k2r/pp1p1ppp/4p3/4n3/1bP4q/2n1B1P1/PPQ1NP1P/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 11,This helps white by freeing his position. Also this trade is a bad trade for black because he is giving up his good knight for a inferior one and allowing white to place his other knight on superior square. Nf3  would have been very tough for white to defend
21,Nxc3,e2c3,r1b1k2r/pp1p1ppp/4p3/4n3/1bP4q/2N1B1P1/PPQ2P1P/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 11,Black wins the rook but he will have to waste valuable time getting his queen back in the game. In contrast white is almost completely mobilized and Black has not even castle yet. Black also has the problem of his light bishop being stuck on it original square. In conclusion white is doing better here and has more than enough compensation for the rook
22,Bxc3+,b4c3,r1b1k2r/pp1p1ppp/4p3/4n3/2P4q/2b1B1P1/PPQ2P1P/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 12,Black wins the rook but he will have to waste valuable time getting his queen back in the game.

36,Qh5,f3h5,r1br2k1/pp3ppp/3Bp3/7q/2P1Q3/3B2P1/PP3P1P/2KR4 w - - 3 19,black can not afford to give up his queen so is forced to make another positional consession
