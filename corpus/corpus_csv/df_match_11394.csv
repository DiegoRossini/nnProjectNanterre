2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Maybe my pawn structure will not be very stable but I'll get a quick development with tempo

5,Nd4,f3d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3Np3/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,Didnt wonnt to play c5 immediately since Nb3 with d3 and c4 undermines my center very easy
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/8/3Np3/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,Didnt wonnt to play c5 immediately since Nb3 with d3 and c4 undermines my center very easy
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/8/3Np3/2N1P3/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 4,I know this is not the best place for my bishop but I wannted to prevent 5.d3 with 5....ed3: 6.Bd3: Bc3: and a double pawn
8,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/8/1b1Np3/2N1P3/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 4 5,I know this is not the best place for my bishop but I wannted to prevent 5.d3 with 5....ed3: 6.Bd3: Bc3: and a double pawn
9,Na4,c3a4,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/8/Nb1Np3/4P3/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 5 5,"? Iam not sure what was the idea, maybe preventing the double pawn on c line aftder playing d3"
10,d5,d7d5,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/Nb1Np3/4P3/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,? Oh so thats all about the previous move. One can see that white has no idea what to play not to mention a bigger plan or strategy.
11,c3,c2c3,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/Nb1Np3/2P1P3/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,? Oh so thats all about the previous move. One can see that white has no idea what to play not to mention a bigger plan or strategy.
12,Bd6,b4d6,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/3b1n2/3p4/N2Np3/2P1P3/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,This either brings the bishop in a good position or lurkd the night on b5
13,c4,c3c4,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/3b1n2/3p4/N1PNp3/4P3/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,Thats a logical and first realy good move from white. Taking the pawn would just allow him to develop his bishop for free 7. ... dc4: 8. Bc4:
14,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/3b1n2/3p4/N1PNp3/4P3/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 1 8,Kings safety first
15,Qb3,d1b3,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/3b1n2/3p4/N1PNp3/1Q2P3/PP1P1PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQ - 2 8,Not so bad but the queen is not good positioned: 1. only a minor threat on d5 2. not active 3. away from his king - at least 2 precious moves
16,Be5,d6e5,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/5n2/3pb3/N1PNp3/1Q2P3/PP1P1PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ - 3 9,Now the queen defends the pawn on d5
17,Nb5,d4b5,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/5n2/1N1pb3/N1P1p3/1Q2P3/PP1P1PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQ - 4 9,?Again a bad move eliminating both knights by placing them on the table border
18,c6,c7c6,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/2p2n2/1N1pb3/N1P1p3/1Q2P3/PP1P1PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ - 0 10,"I could leave this knight there but was just too curious where the hack will he place him, aside I was planning now a pawn breakthrough."
19,Nbc3,b5c3,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/2p2n2/3pb3/N1P1p3/1QN1P3/PP1P1PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQ - 1 10,"Now take a look at the position: Whits development is at least bad, Bishops closed, Nights on the border, Queen hiden out of reach, king in the middle without adequate defense and no chance to castle in  at least 4 moves since Bd3 is very bad. If black breaksthrough white is in deep...trouble"
20,d4,d5d4,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/2p2n2/4b3/N1Ppp3/1QN1P3/PP1P1PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ - 0 11,"Baby here I come!
Taking it means 11.ed4: Be4: with pressure on f2 since blacks Knight can also move on g4 attacking f2 and h2"
21,Ne2,c3e2,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/2p2n2/4b3/N1Ppp3/1Q2P3/PP1PNPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQ - 1 11,? White nows the threats on f2 and complicates but unfortunately to his own damage
22,d3,d4d3,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/2p2n2/4b3/N1P1p3/1Q1pP3/PP1PNPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ - 0 12,"! This has a lot of consequences: 
White can not develop his balck bishop
White can not develop his white bishop
White can not castle"
23,Nec3,e2c3,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/2p2n2/4b3/N1P1p3/1QNpP3/PP1P1PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQ - 1 12,"? Bad again, N3 would hold the position, at least for a while.
Now he has again a minor threat 13. Nc5 with attack on e4 pawn."
24,b6,b7b6,rnbq1rk1/p4ppp/1pp2n2/4b3/N1P1p3/1QNpP3/PP1P1PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ - 0 13,"Although the pawn doesnt matter because the name of the game is crash all the available forces against the white king, the knight on e4 would make it hard attack the king."
25,f3,f2f3,rnbq1rk1/p4ppp/1pp2n2/4b3/N1P1p3/1QNpPP2/PP1P2PP/R1B1KB1R b KQ - 0 13,"?? This winns the game, its just the black is the one who wins!
1. diagonal e1 h4 is open
2. king has no place except d1
3. from d1 there is no way out!!!!
4. no one near to help the king, especially the white queen
5. The black white fielded bishop can  jump in one move on g4!"
