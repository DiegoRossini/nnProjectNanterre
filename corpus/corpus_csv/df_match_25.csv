1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Reminder of the time limit - 40 moves in 90 minutes, plus 30 minutes if your time runs out before then, plus 30 second increment."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,Again I was late for the start - 18 minutes this time - because of road works on the A41 near Chester.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,So it starts conventionally enough.
4,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,I was expecting this.
5,d5,d4d5,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2pP4/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"I reply with the main line, heading for the Benoni group of openings. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benoni_Defense"
6,b5,b7b5,rnbqkb1r/p2ppppp/5n2/1ppP4/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"A slight surprise, as he had played e7-e5 earlier in the tournament. I did see he had played this, the Benko Gambit, before. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benko_Gambit"
7,f3,f2f3,rnbqkb1r/p2ppppp/5n2/1ppP4/2P5/5P2/PP2P1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,Modern practice is to decline the gambit although this may not be the best way of declining it.
8,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/p2p1ppp/4pn2/1ppP4/2P5/5P2/PP2P1PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,He develops.
9,e4,e2e4,rnbqkb1r/p2p1ppp/4pn2/1ppP4/2P1P3/5P2/PP4PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,This is the natural move.
10,bxc4,b5c4,rnbqkb1r/p2p1ppp/4pn2/2pP4/2p1P3/5P2/PP4PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,He takes.

15,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/p4ppp/3p1n2/2pP4/2B5/2N2P2/PP4PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 8,Normal development.
16,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/p3bppp/3p1n2/2pP4/2B5/2N2P2/PP4PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 2 9,"In many lines of the Benko the Bf8 goes to g7, but in this position I can throw in a queen check on e2 if he tries that."

10.	Ng3	Re8
11.	O-O	a6
12.	a4	Nbd7
13.	Re1	Ne5 which I think is better than what he played. The Gameknot game wwgia (1745) vs. hbking (2023) continued with Nbd7
11.	Ng3	Ne5
12.	b3	Qa5
13.	Bb2	Nxc4
14.	bxc4	Ba6 which I think is also better."
