1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"A game from one of my Queen's Gambit Accepted tournaments. First 2 moves are given:
1.d4,d5
2.c4,dxc4
...then I regularly play 3.e4:
Black forfeits the centre & so white occupies it. It seems also to be generally accepted that the advanced c-pawn can not be held. So most players of black concentrate on releasing their white bishop & developing."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"My usual 3rd move - to occupy the centre, with a view to playing Nc3 & pawn to d5."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"My usual 3rd move - to occupy the centre, with a view to playing Nc3 & pawn to d5."
4,dxc4,d5c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2pP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"My usual 3rd move - to occupy the centre, with a view to playing Nc3 & pawn to d5."

6,b5,b7b5,rnbqkbnr/p1p1pppp/8/1p6/2pPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Well, I've read of a number of counters to this, the main one being..."
7,a4,a2a4,rnbqkbnr/p1p1pppp/8/1p6/P1pPP3/8/1P3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,a fiancietto-ed bishop doesn't usually hold up against the strong centre of QGA in my experience... unless you haven't build the centre yet:
8,Bb7,c8b7,rn1qkbnr/pbp1pppp/8/1p6/P1pPP3/8/1P3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,a fiancietto-ed bishop doesn't usually hold up against the strong centre of QGA in my experience... unless you haven't build the centre yet:
9,axb5,a4b5,rn1qkbnr/pbp1pppp/8/1P6/2pPP3/8/1P3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,...totally ignoring the unprotected e-pawn
10,Bxe4,b7e4,rn1qkbnr/p1p1pppp/8/1P6/2pPb3/8/1P3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,of course
11,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qkbnr/p1p1pppp/8/1P6/2pPb3/2N5/1P3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 6,"And finishing myself off: This move demonstrates the danger of over-confidence with a particular opening. One which I must have played a hundred times on Gameknot alone.
Also, it highlights the importance of move order when playing d5.
Good luck!
