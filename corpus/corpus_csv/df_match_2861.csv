1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Now this makes me chuckle. I know it is the beginning of the French defense, which many grandmasters do play, but I don't like it. Just because, I often move an early e5 to give black fits and take him out of any ideas of a traditional French. Yes, it loses a tempo and is probably unsound. But it's fun, and to me, that is what chess is. Fun!"

You see, here is the fun in what I just did: black ought to play aggressively now and continue to do so. But someone who favors a certain style of play can't easily switch gears... yet... if I'm playing a really highly rated player, I don't play like this. There's no getting away with such games then!"

But unfortunately, I did not think past that thought, and white really now already is lost. But wait, I'm not just playing Dr. Jekyll. Mr Hyde will soon show."

So far my opponent has played very well, demonstrating a good grasp of strategy, while I've played simply awful."

Now this guy was rated 1650, and although I have defeated players rated above 2300 (well and lost to those also), he's just plain kicking my posterior. In this rather sad position, I realize I will lose this game without a major shift on my part."

This game is lost, Dr. Jekyll has seen to it... but wait a minute, Dr. Jekyll is no where to be found, of a sudden. Instead, there is naught but a hideous noise now as Mr. Hyde suddenly sits on the other side of the board."
