2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"e4 e5, very popular opening among ""beginners"". This often leads to an open game.   In open games it's important to have the bishop pair (so if you have the possiblity to exchange a knight for a bishop, you should consider it) because the bishop can control a complete diagonal when the center is open."

Nb3 is good because black is forced to move his bishop again = no tempo lost. Nf3 is less good."
