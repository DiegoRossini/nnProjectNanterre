1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"This was my final game in a mini-tournament with several strong players from chessgames.com, in which I had met with very limited success. In this game I experimented with the Leningrad Dutch - and got lucky in a complex position."
2,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,"I have recently taken to playing this flexible response to 1.Nf3. If white keeps me guessing, I will keep him guessing too."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,Now I can transpose to a Dutch without worrying about the Staunton Gambit.

5,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1p1pp/3p4/5p2/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,The usual white strategy.
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1p1pp/3p1n2/5p2/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,The usual white strategy.
7,g3,g2g3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1p1pp/3p1n2/5p2/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,The usual white strategy.
8,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1p2p/3p1np1/5p2/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,And now we have transposed into a typical Leningrad Dutch.
9,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqkb1r/ppp1p2p/3p1np1/5p2/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,And now we have transposed into a typical Leningrad Dutch.
10,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppp1p1bp/3p1np1/5p2/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 6,And now we have transposed into a typical Leningrad Dutch.
11,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk2r/ppp1p1bp/3p1np1/5p2/2PP4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 6,"Cramping black's position, preventing any thrusts with the e-pawn, and intending to expand on the queen's side."
12,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1p1bp/3p1np1/5p2/2PP4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 4 7,"Cramping black's position, preventing any thrusts with the e-pawn, and intending to expand on the queen's side."

16,c6,c7c6,rnb1qrk1/pp2p1bp/2pp1np1/3P1p2/2P5/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 9,An important challenge to white's pawn.
17,Rb1,a1b1,rnb1qrk1/pp2p1bp/2pp1np1/3P1p2/2P5/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/1RBQ1RK1 b - - 1 9,On the few occasions when I have played the Leningrad Dutch (only in blitz before this game) I have often been inconvenienced by Ng5. However white continues his queen's side strategy.
18,Na6,b8a6,r1b1qrk1/pp2p1bp/n1pp1np1/3P1p2/2P5/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/1RBQ1RK1 w - - 2 10,"This exchange sets the scene for the next passage of play, much of which focusses on the b-file and especially control of b5."

White could have ended up with a passed a-pawn, though whether it would have been strong is another matter.

The d7 bishop is easily able to contest the diagonal, while the black rooks will attack the a and b files; and black also has good chances in the centre."

35,Ba3,b2a3,rr4k1/2nbq1bp/2pp1np1/4pp2/1PP1P3/BQN2NP1/5PBP/1R1R2K1 b - - 2 18,"As it turns out the threatened discovered attack down the diagonal will again not materialize, and the exposed position of this bishop will overwork the white queen."
