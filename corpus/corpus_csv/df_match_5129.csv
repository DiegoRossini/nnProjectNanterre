2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,I always play Nf6 in hope (which is often the case) white plays 2. c4 which will allow me to turn into a hopeful benko gambit or the very least a benoni.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"I'm most unfamiliar with the decline with Nf3, but I'm not extremely off balance."
