1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The result of this match wasn't much of a surprise, since my rating was over 250 points higher than my opponent. I like it solely for the checkmate that I pulled off. Apart from that I made a ridiculous error during the end of the opening stage of the game. I'll point out why I made certain moves after that point."
