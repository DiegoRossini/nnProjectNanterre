8,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqk1nr/pp1pppbp/6p1/8/3p1B2/2P1P3/PP3PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,As good as d5.

17,Bd3,f1d3,r1bqk2r/pp2ppbp/2np2p1/8/3PnBP1/2PB1N1P/PP3P2/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 2 9,"Another plan could have been b4. Is the only way to prevent Na5, in order to build an attack on f7 after castling with moves like Nc4, Qb3, Ng5. I know by experience that it is an attack black can defend from, and I sense my opponent knows it very well. So I went for this. I have to take advantage from my g pawn: if f5, I can open the g column for my attack."
18,d5,d6d5,r1bqk2r/pp2ppbp/2n3p1/3p4/3PnBP1/2PB1N1P/PP3P2/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 10,"I threat to win a central pawn. Developing in the meantime. Now, Nd2 or Ng5 can be emergency plans if needed."

22,Rxh5,h8h5,r1bqk3/pp2ppb1/2n3p1/3p3r/3PnB2/2PB1N1P/PPQ2P2/RN2K2R w KQq - 0 12,"Ok, my h3 pawn is threatened, but I have my pawn win waiting for me too."

29,Ng5,f3g5,r3k3/pp2ppb1/1qn3p1/5bNr/3P1B2/2P4P/PP2QP2/RN2K2R b KQq - 4 15,"Now I stopped for a moment and realized that I was falling on my own trick. If now Nd6 (threatening NxBg7+), after BxN and QxB, black has Qxb2. This threatens QxR and... wow, very hard to get into. Can I allow myself to wait?"
30,f6,f7f6,r3k3/pp2p1b1/1qn2pp1/5bNr/3P1B2/2P4P/PP2QP2/RN2K2R w KQq - 0 16,"Now I stopped for a moment and realized that I was falling on my own trick.

31,Nf3,g5f3,r3k3/pp2p1b1/1qn2pp1/5b1r/3P1B2/2P2N1P/PP2QP2/RN2K2R b KQq - 1 16,"Let's see. I said ""no"" to the tactic line. Your turn to do something. This is an antinatural strategy I won't recommend, but in this case, it is stupid to go into a tactic you spotted if you realize it won't work. I'll accept the return of a pawn, and will go Na3, Nc4 as planned. g5 is not a concern after Nxg5, RxN (or QxR+), BxR, fxB, Qh5+, followed by choice between going on with checks or play b3, stopping black."
32,Bxh3,f5h3,r3k3/pp2p1b1/1qn2pp1/7r/3P1B2/2P2N1b/PP2QP2/RN2K2R w KQq - 0 17,Pawn grabbed and B threatening Bg4. I am sure he didn't expect my next one:
33,Rg1,h1g1,r3k3/pp2p1b1/1qn2pp1/7r/3P1B2/2P2N1b/PP2QP2/RN2K1R1 b Qq - 1 17,"As before, g5 is not wise (in my opinion. Later, with the analysis borard I'll be able to tell)."
