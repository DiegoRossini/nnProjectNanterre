1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Evan's gambit accepted. This game shows the danger of letting the center of the board be controlled by white. With accurate play, black can come out stronger, but not in this game. The more the end nears, the more complex the game becomes. Pay special attention to moves 17-21. I hope you enjoy."

19,Qf3,d1f3,r1bq1rk1/ppp1nppp/2np4/b7/2BNPP2/2P2Q2/P5PP/RNB2RK1 b - - 1 10,"The idea is to launch an attack on the king-side, using both Rf1 and Qf3. Tempo is very important in this game, because white has to win back the lost pawn. When black is ready developing, whites advantage will be lost. Somehow I feel this move isn't accurate enough though... If anyone has ideas (Qh5?), please let me know."

There is one big flaw here, which will be exploited for the rest of the game: Black's Bishop on c8 is not yet developed, which keeps the Rook on a8 from entering the game."
