1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,My favorite opening
2,b6,b7b6,rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/1p6/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,Moving out his pawn...
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/1p6/8/8/2N2N2/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"I bring out my other knight (notice that as it approaches the endgame, those knights come in super handy)"
4,a5,a7a5,rnbqkbnr/2pppppp/1p6/p7/8/2N2N2/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,Moving out his farthest pawn... not the best opening moves. Better to try and gain control of the middle board instead.
5,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/2pppppp/1p6/p7/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,Gaining control of the middle board
6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/2pp1ppp/1p2p3/p7/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"He responds, probably intending to move the pawn on d two spaces."
7,d3,d2d3,rnbqkbnr/2pp1ppp/1p2p3/p7/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,Protecting my outmost pawn
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/2pp1ppp/1pn1p3/p7/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,Moving out the knight
9,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqkbnr/2pp1ppp/1pn1p3/p5B1/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,Threatening the queen
10,f6,f7f6,r1bqkbnr/2pp2pp/1pn1pp2/p5B1/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,Protecting the queen
11,Bf4,g5f4,r1bqkbnr/2pp2pp/1pn1pp2/p7/4PB2/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,Moving the bishop out of danger
12,Nb4,c6b4,r1bqkbnr/2pp2pp/1p2pp2/p7/1n2PB2/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 7,"Moving his knight; there is no point to this move, and I can easily deflect it..."
13,a3,a2a3,r1bqkbnr/2pp2pp/1p2pp2/p7/1n2PB2/P1NP1N2/1PP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,...like so. Now he is forced to move the knight again or else lose it.
14,h5,h7h5,r1bqkbnr/2pp2p1/1p2pp2/p6p/1n2PB2/P1NP1N2/1PP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,"Does not move the knight, but instead does this pawn maneuver. This was one of Black's biggest mistakes in the game. After this, he was basically just responding to my attacks instead of making his own moves."
15,Be2,f1e2,r1bqkbnr/2pp2p1/1p2pp2/p6p/1n2PB2/P1NP1N2/1PP1BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 8,Moving out my other bishop to threaten the h pawn
16,a4,a5a4,r1bqkbnr/2pp2p1/1p2pp2/7p/pn2PB2/P1NP1N2/1PP1BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 9,Moving his pawn forward... not sure why.
17,Nd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/2pp2p1/1p2pp2/7p/pn1NPB2/P1NP4/1PP1BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 9,Bringing my other knight out into play
