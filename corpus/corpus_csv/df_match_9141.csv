The Najdorf variation... 
Look at the board. Black seems to be behind in development, and maybe is true. But he's good and ...a6 is not a waste of time!! It prevents Ndb5 and prepares ...b5, pushing queenside pawns."

I was looking for queenside castle, while developing the Queen in an optimum square."

To prevent Knight infiltrations."

Out of book. Well, 9 moves in the book. Not so bad for an amateur match. But someone can note that, with the Sicilian, it's easier. I agree.

However, I think that d7 is more suitable for Knights than white-squares Bishop."
19,O-O-O,e1c1,rn1q1rk1/1p1bbppp/p2p1n2/4p3/4P3/1NN1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR1B1R b - - 2 10,"10.O-O-O

And now my development is near to be completed. 

Look at the position. I have no real advantages, but the only piece I not already moved is the white-squares Bishop, which however controls an open side of the board. Moreover I control the d-file and I'm planning a kingside pawns ride. 

Black position is worse: the Queen-Knight is still in b8, the e7-Bishop is blocked, the open c-file isn't useful yet...

I was feeling good."

Maybe is better to develop. Besides, this could led in future to a bishop sacrifice in h6 to expose the black monarch."

Putting pressure at the King position. No real menaces, but an annoying pawn march."

Do you remember 7. ...Be7? This move contradicts it. Now, I'm practically a move ahead."

I gain other space. My pawns are uncomfortable for black."

Why? Development isn't made yet and my b3-Knight didn't threaten anything. And besides, this is the third Bishop's move in the last four moves.

Again... good for me! I was feeling still very good."
25,axb3,a2b3,rn1q1rk1/1p2bpp1/p2p1n1p/4p3/4P1PP/1PN1BP2/1PPQ4/2KR1B1R b - - 0 13,"13.axb3

Obviously not 13.cxb3?! discovering the King in the c-open file.

What about the weakness of my shield pawns? No problem, what can do black here? Nothing! On the contrary now I don't have to go to b1 with my King to protect the a2 pawn! :)"

I think looking at g5. In only a single move g5 is reached by the Bishop, the Queen, the h7-Knight and the h6 pawn."
27,h5,h4h5,rn1q1rk1/1p2bppn/p2p3p/4p2P/4P1P1/1PN1BP2/1PPQ4/2KR1B1R b - - 0 14,"14.h5

What else? Maybe 14.Bc4, but I didn't want to lose a pawn. Obviously not 14.Nd5 Bxh4 15.Bc4 (15.Nb6 threatens nothing) Ng5 16.Bxg5?? Bxg5 and the Queen is pinned (and also lost)."
28,Bg5,e7g5,rn1q1rk1/1p3ppn/p2p3p/4p1bP/4P1P1/1PN1BP2/1PPQ4/2KR1B1R w - - 1 15,"15.f4

Why not just Bxg5? I want to liberate myself from the backward f-pawn. Besides, f4 is not covered by the black Queen and, from here, is still visible the weak d6-pawn."

Exactly the position I was looking for. My Bishop is still at home, but is the same for the black Queen-Knight. My Queen and my d-Rook point towards d6 and the position of the black King is trembling for the my advanced pawns."

Finally black develops his second Knight. But now is too late."

Grab the pawn and attacking the Queen. When things go well in chess, it's easy to find prophylactic moves."
