7,Bxc6+,b5c6,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2Bp4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,White should wait until the bishop is attacked before making the exchange. Better was 4.d4.
8,bxc6,b7c6,r1bqkbnr/p1p2ppp/2pp4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"This cedes control of d4 to Black. Better was  5.d4, threatening to win the Black e-pawn."
