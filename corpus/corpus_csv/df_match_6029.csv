It highlights the secondary reason why it's bad to move the Q out early, and that is frequently it can be trapped with so many pieces still on the board. The primary reason masters practically NEVER bring a Q out early is that it allows the opponent to just threaten the Q continually with minor pieces and pawns, thereby developing his position while the Q is forced to run around. Anytime your opponent brings out his Q, look to do just that--attack his Q while  developing--and also look to trap his Lady. Sometimes you'll note he has only 2 or 3 squares to go to, and you can deploy a piece to cover those squares before he realizes he's in trouble (that is, sometimes you have to plan and ""create"" the trap!)."

His black B is therefore worth more, so to speak. Thus, Ne4 (harrying his Q, which is usually a good thing to do) followed by Bg5 would allow you to chase his black B away from its nice perch, or to exchange it. Note that an exchange is in your favor, as his B was better placed. You can think of the exchange as worth maybe a tenth of a point in your favor. All these tenths of a point (like creating an opponent's isolani or doubled P, or exchanging a c/f  P for a d/e P) add up and frequently decide a game (especially in master play)."

Another real danger is that if your opponent puts a Bishop 3 squares straight out from the N (e5 here) then the N can never move (unless otherwise protected).
