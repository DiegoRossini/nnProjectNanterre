* 14)..., dxc3. 15) Qxc3, f6. 16) Ng5! (threatening the now unprotected e6 and also f7 under protection of the knight), Bc8  (hoping to avoid variation 2!). 17)  h6+, Kh8 (the only option) 18) Nf7+ winning a rook for a knight and an excellent position. 

* 15) ..., f6. 16)Ng5, Qe8 17) Ne6+ !, Kh8, 18) Nxf8, Qxf8. 19) Hxg6, Nxg6, 20) Qh3 (leading to positions ismilar to those found after move 20 in this game only with slightly fairer material.
