19,Nxd5,c3d5,r1bq1rk1/pppn1ppp/4p3/3N4/3P4/3BPN2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 10,...and I'm amenable.
20,exd5,e6d5,r1bq1rk1/pppn1ppp/8/3p4/3P4/3BPN2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 11,"The skirmish is complete, and the position still even."
21,O-O,e1g1,r1bq1rk1/pppn1ppp/8/3p4/3P4/3BPN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 11,May as well go through with my plan and castle.
22,Nf6,d7f6,r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/3BPN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 2 12,Placing the Knight on the natural square to protect his own K-side.
23,Ne5,f3e5,r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/5n2/3pN3/3P4/3BP3/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 3 12,I centralize *my* Knight.
