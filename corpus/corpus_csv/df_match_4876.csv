It may have seemed drawish at first, but I looked at a move that may have changed things. Im tired right now and decided no analysis board, so please check my analysis and ideas for me."

In this closed position, both players have potential in f4 or f5, when properly developed. Also, whites got an outpost on d5, while black has no outpost. White's position, while not greatly superior, is more comfortable in general. But f6 is not seriously wrong."

Black's position is now riddled with dark square weaknesses, and the white knights are going to take advantage of this. Moves like Nh4, Nd5, in conjunction will cause trouble in the black position.

He has the opportunity to attack with Nd5, c3 or a3, with b4, and opening the position of the king. The 2 rooks can be transfered quickly. That plan springs to mind in an instant. White may also consider moves like Qh5, Nf5 or Ng6 with Nd5 and f4. Black's position is very difficult already. Most stronger players on this site could recieve a winning ad from this position as white. Once black hass castled, a critical principle comes in play. When 2 players are castled opposite, the one that gets to the other first will usually recieve the advantage. Whether it is with pieces(open positions generally) or pawns, morelikely, this principle will likely decide the game in these kind of positions. Black cannot really attack now, he is not developed enough and his attack is hard to generate."
