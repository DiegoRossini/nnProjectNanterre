1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Team match, I am playing black. Tired of the Sicilian, I try something new. The Nimzovich. New to me, anyway. Interesting note: Apparently GameKnot changed some things in the Game Annotation Screen. The old link at the bottom of the window to edit the title is gone and there is a new link at the top of the window to replace it. Also, until today, the ratings of the players displayed their ratings at the start of the game (1506 for white, 1504 for me) but today it displays our current ratings (1448 for white, 1706 for me) - I liked the old way so I edited it back to the initial ratings."
