7,Nxe5,f3e5,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4N3/2BnP3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,4.Nxd4 is a sure thing for White but we all need a little spice in our life. Thses type of games are usually so much more romantic than closed positions
8,Qg5,d8g5,r1b1kbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4N1q1/2BnP3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 5,So the giving up of the e pawn was not really a true gambit as white will now be material down
9,Bxf7+,c4f7,r1b1kbnr/pppp1Bpp/8/4N1q1/3nP3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,The only way to avoid disatser. 5.Nxf7?? leads to 5...Qxg2 6.Rf1 Qxe4 7.Be2 Nf3# -a pretty mate and embarrassing for white.
10,Ke7,e8e7,r1b2bnr/ppppkBpp/8/4N1q1/3nP3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 1 6,Offering the knight as a sort of counter gambit. White will have excellent central control and room for his pieces to attack Black's exposed king
11,O-O,e1g1,r1b2bnr/ppppkBpp/8/4N1q1/3nP3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 2 6,Offering the knight as a sort of counter gambit. White will have excellent central control and room for his pieces to attack Black's exposed king
12,Qxe5,g5e5,r1b2bnr/ppppkBpp/8/4q3/3nP3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 0 7,Chasing the Knight away and avoiding losing the rook
13,Bxg8,f7g8,r1b2bBr/ppppk1pp/8/4q3/3nP3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 0 7,Chasing the Knight away and avoiding losing the rook
14,Rxg8,h8g8,r1b2br1/ppppk1pp/8/4q3/3nP3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 0 8,Chasing the Knight away and avoiding losing the rook

16,Nc6,d4c6,r1b2br1/ppppk1pp/2n5/4q3/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 1 9,8...Ne6 was playable too.
