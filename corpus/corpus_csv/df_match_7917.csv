1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

It was a great day for me, firstly in the cricket the Ozzys were well and truly Freddied by Flintoff, secondly I was very pleased to have brought this match to a satisfying winning conclusion.  It meant I have now got 9 points out of my 12 completed games in this tournament.  I have done the double over my buddy Bob and I briefly held on to a rating of 1800 (the first time I got to that milestone in my entire chessic career), achieved yesterday after Bob waved the white flag.  Unfortunately I could not hold on to that rating because I lost a game to john_wr in another mini-tournament.  That game will be annotated straight after this one, but now on to the action which starts on move 10 when I play 10. Nc3 - essential to get pieces out quickly, especially when facing a 3 point or more deficit."
