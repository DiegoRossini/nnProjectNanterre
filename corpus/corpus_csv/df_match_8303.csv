1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone,

Sadly my unbeaten run in the 1700-1800 mini-tournament came to an end with this game.  Strangely I managed to draw my game with Paul playing him as black.  This opening turns out to be a Latvian.  I seem to get into a very good position, but, I ""win"" the b pawn.  This I think led to me losing the game, but you the jury may think otherwise.  Anyhow, on with the game which starts of with 1. e4."

56,Bd6,g3d6,5r1k/Q5pp/3b3q/2p5/8/2P4P/PP4P1/R6K w - - 1 29,28. ....... Bd6 - Qa4 would have been the best move here but then black could play Rf4 and then the Wicked Witch would play Qh4 followed by Qg3 threatening mate again on g2.  I would have had to have ceded Glenda for the black bishop on e6 to have prevented the mate.  So I resigned on the grounds of ruinous loss of material.  This I think may be a salutary lesson against pawn grabbing and then holding onto the material when the chips are down.  Do this and you really will go down!  Do you the jury agree?
