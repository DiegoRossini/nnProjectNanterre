1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is one of the most epic games I've ever played. It was in the final round of the 34th GK tournament against the highest ranking player. The game features probably the best counter attack I've ever pulled off - recovering from a miserable situation caused by an opening blunder. The foundation of my counter attack was the recognition that I had enough tempo to be able to sacrifice pieces while still keeping white in an immensely dangerous position. In fact, once the counter attack began, the remainder of the game was spent with white on the defence. The result of the game was a very strange draw with plenty of pieces still remaining on the board.

I'm annotating this game in order to illustrate the importance of tempo and how one can apply the basic idea of tempo in order to turn a game around."

When first seeing this, I kicked myself for not recognising how dangerous a position I was in a bit earlier. I realised that I could defend F8 with my king, but that would very quickly lead to a White queen on G3 and a push of the white pawns along the F and E file. 

All in all, no matter how I positioned my king on the kingside, I would inevitably fall behind in development (with a trapped castle on H7 and a badly positioned King and Queen). I don't need to explain my predicament any further. It's pretty obvious that I'm in a lot of trouble.

I do have one advantage in this position however. I have more pieces in play - and therefore the advantage of tempo. The white knight and white bishop have both moved twice in the opening, meaning that 1: the knight is out of position - even if he has the advantage of an open attack on G2. 2: The white bishop took my knight early, allowing for the development of my white bishop - giving me two more 'tempi' (to use Nimzovitch's term) than white.

Lastly, notice how White's King is very poorly defended. My bishop has it's sights on G2 and my Queen is prepared to move to G4 once the knight gets out of the way. This led me to realise that G2 should logically be my target - even though a bishop and Queen alone are not enough to attack it. 

This realisation gave birth to the counter attack which was realised in the following move..."
