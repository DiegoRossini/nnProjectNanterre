1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I go for my usual.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,No Sicilian shenanigans for this match.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Still common for my White play.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"Looking good so far, this is what I'm used to playing against."
5,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"I try a Scotch opening for this match. It's a been a long time since I've used this, but I find it a touch more aggressive for White than the Four Knights approach. I was interested to see how a match against a skilled player would go for me, as I didn't feel like playing as passive this time."
6,exd4,e5d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"He exchanges, as per the main line."
7,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,This is usual for White to do.
8,Nxd4,c6d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3nP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"For Black, not so much. I normally see Black succeeding more with the Nf6 line, as the c6 knight can keep the Queen at bay from exchanges, whereas now I might be able to get away with pulling her out. This is more aggressive than I'm used to."
9,Qxd4,d1d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 5,So my queen takes the center.
10,c5,c7c5,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/8/2p5/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 6,Black is still opting for more aggressive development. I had to think for a few seconds.
11,Qc3,d4c3,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/8/2p5/4P3/2Q5/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"Qd1 would waste moves on my tempo. Qd5 could be chased by Nf6, and any 4th-rank square could allow Black to develop more pawns while I draw my queen away. While this does block both the c-pawn and Nc3, I felt this was the most logical move on my part to allow for more development on my end."
12,d6,d7d6,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/2Q5/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 7,Black plans to stake a claim to the center with better central pawns than White can offer. It works.
13,Be3,c1e3,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/2Q1B3/PPP2PPP/RN2KB1R b KQkq - 1 7,"So I plan to fight back with back-rank piece development, starting with this bishop as this will give a possibly needed Qd2 more freedom. I need not worry about Bb4 for the next bit of time."
14,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/3p1n2/2p5/4P3/2Q1B3/PPP2PPP/RN2KB1R w KQkq - 2 8,He hits my e-pawn and strengthens a possible d5 after his O-O.
15,Bd3,f1d3,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/3p1n2/2p5/4P3/2QBB3/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R b KQkq - 3 8,"I don't want to do f3 just yet. I haven't fully figured out which way I want to castle yet, and I don't want to indicate a forced direction by pushing the other six pawns too soon."
16,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/3p1n2/2p5/4P3/2QBB3/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R w KQkq - 4 9,"Black, however, clearly gets more out of castling short for this match."
17,b4,b2b4,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/3p1n2/2p5/1P2P3/2QBB3/P1P2PPP/RN2K2R b KQkq - 0 9,"This means that a queenside pawn storm is inevitable if I don't deter it now. My king is not in danger for the time being, and I want to give myself some sort of edge on the board once we decide to put the kings away in a corner. Is there another case I could make to do O-O-O instead?"
18,b6,b7b6,r1bqk2r/p3bppp/1p1p1n2/2p5/1P2P3/2QBB3/P1P2PPP/RN2K2R w KQkq - 0 10,"He decides to defend the attack. Even so, I feel as though 9 ...d5 would have been stronger here. It would have centralized his pawns even further, and there wouldn't be much for me to do about it."
19,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk2r/p3bppp/1p1p1n2/2p5/1P2P3/2QBB3/P1P2PPP/RN3RK1 b kq - 1 10,"With something going on in the board now, I move to hide the kings."
20,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/p3bppp/1p1p1n2/2p5/1P2P3/2QBB3/P1P2PPP/RN3RK1 w - - 2 11,"He obliges, probably wanting to see what I plan on doing."
