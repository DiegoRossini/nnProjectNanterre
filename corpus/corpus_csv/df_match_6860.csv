Nc3 generally leads to a quiet game against most Black set-ups, against Dutch it is a sharp and ambitious line. White intends to play e4, with a sort of mirror-universe Sicilian position. Black has the option of preventing this with …d5, but that has its own dangers, as we will see.
My opponent knew very well that I like to play this line against the Dutch, having suffered against it several times, and so he came prepared this time…"

The alternative …e6 allows White to take over the center right away. The famous game Ed. Lasker vs. G. A. Thomas is an excellent example of the dangers Black faces in this type of game: http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1259009"

At the same time, White is ahead in development and has the f-pawns as a target. Black's Bishop pair is unlikely to be of much use in this closed position, but on the other hand White has blocked the c-pawn and so the usual c4 pawn break will be harder to organize than usual. White's plan, at its simplest, is to play Bd3, Qf3, and Nge2 to pressure the f-pawns, and then to further weaken them with either h3-g4 or h4-h5. This plan does not pan out so well in this game, so an example of how powerful it can be seems in order: Browne vs R. Byrne, 1977 (http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1333279) was the game that first persuaded me to give this variation a try."

I really liked this move at the time, since it prevents …Nb4 in order to preserve my Bishop and (I thought) deprive the Knight of any future. As the Knight is headed to e7 anyway, the latter point is simply not true. As for the former, I am not sure that there is anything wrong with allowing …Nb4 and …Nxd3. The Bishop ends up being pretty pathetic for most of the game (especially in contrast to Black's Knight), and after 8. Nge2 Nb4 9. 0-0 Nxd3 10. cxd3 I have an open c-file, a possible minority attack with b4-b5 if Black plays …c6, Knights against Bishops is a closed position, and support for a potential e4 push. Black would be better off continuing 8. …Ne7 as in the game.
In short, with 8. a3 I weaken my Queenside to prevent a move that Black probably didn't want to make, anyway."

At this point I realized that I was in real trouble on the Kingside, and decided to at least get my King out of the way ASAP. White's problem is one of dynamics: although White appears to have the better pawn structure, Black's pawns are in fact more dangerous for one simple reason: they can move. Black's pieces, seemingly huddled in confusion on the last two ranks, are in fact well placed behind the pawns to support their advance. White's pieces, meanwhile, however far advanced they may seem, actually block White's own pawns – particularly, the Nc3 inhibits the vital pawn break c4. 
0-0-0 does nothing to solve these problems – in fact, it simply gets in the way of the Queen's escape route and causes a traffic jam for the retreating White pieces. Moreover, the King's position on c1 makes it even harder to get c4 in. 
Much better would have been Qd1, intending to leave the King in the center, retreat the f-Knight to e2, and get on with organizing c4 and Queenside play."

Black takes a move out to tuck away his King. Still, 12. …g5 13. Ne2 h5!, threatening to trap the Queen and forcing Ng1, would have been more direct, and Black could have already claimed an obvious advantage."

White needs to resolve a major tactical problem: The Queen and the Knight both need to retreat via e2, or else one of them risks being trapped. Re2, g3, Ne2-g1, and even h4 would have all been unpleasant, but they would have addressed this vital problem. Even better would be Bb5!, allowing the Knight into d3, which I played (too late) next move."

My plan is to get the Bishop off d3 with tempo, provoking a weakness in Black's castled position at the same time. Unfortunately, right now I don't have time for this and have to respond to the veiled tactical threat of …g5 and …Bh5 with 14. g3."
