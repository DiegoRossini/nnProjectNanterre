1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

This is a thematic tournament that I am taking part in and another game against the Master Mater.  I did not get Freddied this time but he did have me all bottled up at the end and I ended up resigning the game on the grounds of ruinous loss of material as I would drop a knight just for starters.  We pick up the action on move 6 because the first five moves are forced."

Qh4+ - I did consider taking on e5 but to do so against the Master Mater, especially as he has the Wicked Witch of the West and his dsb on the board would be sheer, utter folly, almost crying out to be Freddied (and he will gladly oblige!).  So, I figured out that the only chance of regaining my pawn would be to force a doubleton on the kingside, but not with the Witch on the board.  So, I saw a queen check.  Either he blocks on f2 or Freddy displaces his king and Glenda sits in his arc.  If the Witch blocks on f2 and then QxQ+, Kxf2 then surely the exchange of Fou Lenoir for that knight on e5 bears some logic, especially as Freddy just lurves those horsies of his?  I then figured that I might find some way of rounding up that e5 pawn and restore parity ....."

I therefore feel I have sufficient grounds for resignation as the material loss coupled with the passivity is ruinous.  Therefore I would prefer to wave the white flag than suffer further torture.  So I make the jammy so and so's weekend by handing him one rating point.  I am now playing him as white and I hope I can do better - I will never give up until I end that losing run against him and I don't care how long it takes, but when I do it will be a big event when the Genie finally arises from the bottle - cheers and bye for now.
