The computer line goes 14...cxb4 15.Be3+ Kc6 16. Nd2 Nd7

an alternative to 16. Nd2 would be 16.a3!? I think this movee keeps in spirit of the opening. if 16...bxa3 17. Nxa3 followed by 18. Rb1 would be very uncomfortable for the Black player"

30,Nxc5,a6c5,r3qb1r/pp2p1pp/1k2N3/2n5/4pPB1/3P4/P1P3PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 0 16,?! but surely 15...Kc6 is better. The pawn would then restrict some of the open lines to the King and the King arrives on c6 as stated was better earlier

Ne5! forces Black to give up the Queen with 19...Qxe6 20. Bxe6 Nxe6. Material is even but White has an development advantage and Black has an exposed king"

41,dxe4+,d3e4,5b1r/pp2p1pp/k5q1/8/4PP2/N3B3/P1r1B1PP/1R2K2R b K - 0 21,"? This is the reason the sac works. 
but better is
21. Nxc2 exd3 (for some reason the comp does not want to take the pawn even though I think it is best.) 22.Bf1 b6 23. Nb4+ Kb7 24.Nxd3 is a pawn up for White.

but all hope is not lost for Black. His king is safe and White's pieces are all of the sudden all behind the 4th rank.

24...e6 is the best way to stay in. Now Black has possible threats like ...Qe4 and Bb4+
In a way the roles are reversed."
