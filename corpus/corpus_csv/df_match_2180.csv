1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,My Usual Opening
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,Black continues with indian defence
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Opens lines for queen and and attacks important d5 square
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Black could be going for Nimzo Indian defence of queen's indian defence
5,g3,g2g3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/6P1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,Idea is to try and control d5 square and avoid indian defences
6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/6P1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Good Move because it attacks centre and blocks diagonal(a8-h1) where my LSB will develop
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"Devloping,Therefore this must be good and white does not need to worry about black playing dxc4 as white can just win pawn back with Qa4+"
8,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,Preparing kindside castling
9,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 5,Preparing kingside castle and putting pressure on light squares
10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 4 6,Kingside development done. Now black just needs to start developing on queenside
11,O-O,e1g1,rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 5 6,Same for me
12,c5,c7c5,rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/4pn2/2pp4/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 0 7,Good move becauses it prepares Nc6 without block the diagonal a5-e8 and attack my centre
13,dxc5,d4c5,rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/4pn2/2Pp4/2P5/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 0 7,The idea it to make black lose a tempo by moving his bishop again and allow me maybe to pin his knight on f6 thereby weaking his control of e4 and d5
14,Bxc5,e7c5,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/2bp4/2P5/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 0 8,The idea is to force black to play exd5 creating an isolated pawn for me to attack.If Black plays Nxd5 his LSB will never be developed
15,cxd5,c4d5,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/2bP4/8/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 0 8,The idea is to force black to play exd5 creating an isolated pawn for me to attack.If Black plays Nxd5 his LSB will never be developed
16,Nxd5,f6d5,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4p3/2bn4/8/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 0 9,I think this is black positional mistake. He should have played exd5 allowing his bishop to enter the game. Nxd5 just now causes black to have an passive game
17,Qc2,d1c2,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4p3/2bn4/8/5NP1/PPQ1PPBP/RNB2RK1 b - - 1 9,"Preparing to bring Rd1 and preparing to develop Nc3 and if black takes on c3 latter I will simply take with my Queen ,keeping my pawn islands together."
18,Bb6,c5b6,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/1b2p3/3n4/8/5NP1/PPQ1PPBP/RNB2RK1 w - - 2 10,Qc7 is possible but weaker
19,Rd1,f1d1,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/1b2p3/3n4/8/5NP1/PPQ1PPBP/RNBR2K1 b - - 3 10,Pinning knight
20,Qe7,d8e7,rnb2rk1/pp2qppp/1b2p3/3n4/8/5NP1/PPQ1PPBP/RNBR2K1 w - - 4 11,Getting out of line with rook because white threaten e4
21,Nc3,b1c3,rnb2rk1/pp2qppp/1b2p3/3n4/8/2N2NP1/PPQ1PPBP/R1BR2K1 b - - 5 11,Just continue with development and threating to pawn
