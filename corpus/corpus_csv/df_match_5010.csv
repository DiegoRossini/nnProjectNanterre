1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

I am playing in a MT in memory of the victims of the Japanese Earthquake.  Both the above players are my current opponents.  I saw that my buddy Jim had lost his Master status and found that he had, sadly, lost a game to a Class B player called Delta38.  It shows that amateurs CAN BEAT Masters and as I am currently playing a huge crop of Masters and a Grandmaster I will play through this game to show myself how it can be done.  Gameknot Analysis is provided here: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15498364&fb=1&rnd=0.41857366360436593.  Jim starts off with 1. e4 and Delta gives him the French Defense with e6."

Another white pawn drops off and suddenly black is TWO pawns to the good.
