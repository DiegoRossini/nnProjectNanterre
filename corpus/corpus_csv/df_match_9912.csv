1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Mon Capitan asked me to annotate a few games for the team with the reason why I made the move I did.  The notes have been made as the game progressed, rather than after.(although I have tidied them up a bit at the end)  They are basically the short term notes I leave for myself.

c4 - Transpositional opening.  Black can put a stamp on what that is straight away."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,My standard reply to c4.  Mainly because I don't like playing queen's gambit as black.
