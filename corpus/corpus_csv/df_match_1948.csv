1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"A crucial win from last week's match, which helped take us to the top of the table.  I gained a crushing grip at the end of the opening, which I maintained through the middle game, but then lost my way in trying to force the win with a king chase when swapping off to capitalise on my material advantage would have won more easily."

Patrick also thought it had been a mistake when we chatted afterwards.  The motivation behind it was obviously to give me weak isolated doubled pawns but Black never got to exploit them.
