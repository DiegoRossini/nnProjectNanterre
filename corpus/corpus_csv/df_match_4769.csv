1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,a hopeless game when looking at the grade difference but it is always good playing someone who is a grandmaster to learn that tiny bit extra!
2,b5,b7b5,rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/8/1p6/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,an opening i don't usually play but one i decided to try
3,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/8/1p6/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,straight into the attack and the control of the centre
4,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/p2ppppp/2p5/1p6/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,i defend. now imagine if both our queens and kings were the other way around- white would have had a checkmate:)

7,a4,a2a4,rnbqkbnr/p3pppp/2pp4/1p6/P2PP3/5N2/1PP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,white wants to get those pawns out of its way
