1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi all! This is a game between me and my long-standing Arch-Rival, who has only recently come to GameKnot. He is playing White, and before this game the score between us is 1.5-1.5. So there's a lot to play for..."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"I play the move for Black which points the way to main line Queen Pawn openings, such as the King's Indian, Nimzo-Indian, or Benoni. The benefit of this move is that Black has more or less complete freedom to choose the opening."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 2,Pointing the way to a King's Indian Defence.

5,c3,c2c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/3P4/2P2N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"This solid move, my Arch-Rival told me, is often played to bypass the sharp play and the theoretical lines of the King's Indian Defence, also blunting Black's fianchettoed bishop. Annoying for me, as I am more comfortable with main line KID."
