2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,So far it is quite a normal game.
3,Bf4,c1f4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P1B2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,I bring my bishop out.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3p4/3P1B2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,And black his knight.
5,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3p4/3P1B2/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 3 3,I also bring my knight out.
6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3p4/3P1B2/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 4 4,And so does black.
