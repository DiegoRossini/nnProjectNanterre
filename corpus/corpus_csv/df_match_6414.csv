1,b3,b2b3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Lost my 44th game to Freddy the Master Mater.  At least I was trying to win this one but in doing so I over-extended myself which is what some of my lower-rated opponents have been guilty of doing against me.  So how did this all happen?  Well, it all starts with the Larsen's Opening, 1. b3 - a favourite of the Danish GM Bent Larsen.  As usual I will provide the Gameknot Analysis link to the game here.  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=14047427&fb=1&rnd=0.7658726204127998"
