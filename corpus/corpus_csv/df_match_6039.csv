One of the greatest lessons I've taken out of playing this knight sacrifice, the Perenyi, is to forget about the supposed ""piece values"" (e.g. knight ~ 3, rook ~5). If you think of each piece's usefulness in terms of the current position, it really helps develop your tactical skills among other things!

Anyway, I hoped you enjoyed the game, and I would really recommend similar lines of the Sicilian for anyone having trouble against it."
