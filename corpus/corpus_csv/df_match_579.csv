1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,My standard opening move
2,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Hmm my opponent throws me off guard here. This is the first time I would encounter this opening I guess
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,So I grab a share of the centre with this pawn thrust
4,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,The logical follow-up to his previous move I guess
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 3,I continue developing
6,d6,d7d6,rnbqk1nr/ppp1ppbp/3p2p1/8/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,My opponent makes way for his LSB
7,h3,h2h3,rnbqk1nr/ppp1ppbp/3p2p1/8/3PP3/5N1P/PPP2PP1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,Probably not the best move but I decided to restrict his LSB movement
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP3/5N1P/PPP2PP1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,My opponent developes while threatening to win a pawn
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,A good developing move to deal with my opponent threat
10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 3 6,My opponent gets his king to safety... Not bad play from both sides so far
11,Be3,c1e3,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N1BN1P/PPP2PP1/R2QKB1R b KQ - 4 6,"Since I didn't know where to put my LSB yet, I decided to develop my DSB to this good spot"
12,b6,b7b6,rnbq1rk1/p1p1ppbp/1p1p1np1/8/3PP3/2N1BN1P/PPP2PP1/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 7,"Hmm since the c8-h3 diagonal isn't favorable for my opponent LSB, I think he decides to fianchetto it"
13,Qd2,d1d2,rnbq1rk1/p1p1ppbp/1p1p1np1/8/3PP3/2N1BN1P/PPPQ1PP1/R3KB1R b KQ - 1 7,This move makes way for queen side castling. I had a plan to castle queenside and launch a powerful attack on my opponents king
14,Ba6,c8a6,rn1q1rk1/p1p1ppbp/bp1p1np1/8/3PP3/2N1BN1P/PPPQ1PP1/R3KB1R w KQ - 2 8,"Hmm I could have sworn my opponent would play Bb7 next. However, this move didn't trouble me"
15,Bh6,e3h6,rn1q1rk1/p1p1ppbp/bp1p1npB/8/3PP3/2N2N1P/PPPQ1PP1/R3KB1R b KQ - 3 8,I played this to eliminate my opponent potentially powerful bishop which would point at my planned castled position later in the game
16,Bxf1,a6f1,rn1q1rk1/p1p1ppbp/1p1p1npB/8/3PP3/2N2N1P/PPPQ1PP1/R3Kb1R w KQ - 0 9,"Given the position of the black pawn structure, I would have held on to this LSB as black. The removal of this LSB might cause serious weakness for black along the light squares but since white also dosent have a LSB, black can breath a sigh of relief for the mean time"
17,Rxf1,h1f1,rn1q1rk1/p1p1ppbp/1p1p1npB/8/3PP3/2N2N1P/PPPQ1PP1/R3KR2 b Q - 0 9,The only option if I wanted to castle
18,c5,c7c5,rn1q1rk1/p3ppbp/1p1p1npB/2p5/3PP3/2N2N1P/PPPQ1PP1/R3KR2 w Q - 0 10,"After this move, I thought about playing d5 but instead played...."
19,O-O-O,e1c1,rn1q1rk1/p3ppbp/1p1p1npB/2p5/3PP3/2N2N1P/PPPQ1PP1/2KR1R2 b - - 1 10,Probably not the best now as my opponent can capture the d-pawn and open lines to my castled position. Instead my opponent played....
20,Nbd7,b8d7,r2q1rk1/p2nppbp/1p1p1npB/2p5/3PP3/2N2N1P/PPPQ1PP1/2KR1R2 w - - 2 11,Hmm I guess he just wanted to complete development
