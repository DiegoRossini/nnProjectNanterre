1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,My opponent opens with d4.  I myself use the queen's gambit when white so I feel that this is a strong opening move.

3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"h4? white's first questionable move.  Now, I'm sure theres a purpose to this, but I don't see it.. maybe to defend his bishop soon to be on g5, but his bishop stays put costing white a tempo."

7,Na4,c3a4,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2pp4/N2P3P/8/PPP1PPP1/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,"White's knight is not threatening to me, and allows me to free up my light squared bishop without losing tempo."
8,b6,b7b6,rnbqkbnr/p4ppp/1p2p3/2pp4/N2P3P/8/PPP1PPP1/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"White's knight is not threatening to me, and allows me to free up my light squared bishop without losing tempo."

12,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk1nr/p4ppp/1pnbp3/2pp4/N1PP3P/1P6/P3PPP1/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 7,I do not feel that this is in his best interest as I am much more developed than him and if we trade off pawns I will have centre control with all my big pieces.

34,Nfd3+,f2d3,3rk2r/pb3ppp/4p3/2b5/1n4PP/1P1n1N2/PB6/2R1KBR1 w k - 2 18,.. because this three-pronged fork and discovered attack on the rook leaves him in a much worse position than before.
