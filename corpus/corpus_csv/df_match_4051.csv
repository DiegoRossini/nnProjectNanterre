1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

It is one thing to win a piece and think that you are winning.  However, if your opponent chooses to keep his king upright you have work to do.  You may even start wondering, where do I go from here?  If your opponent has a higher rating from you you may even be tempted to hit that Offer Draw button, particularly if you have lost a ""won"" position three material points up (I am still haunted by that loss against Expert Charleshiggie!) against that opponent in the past.  However, before you get your mits on that Offer Draw button, it may well pay to take a deep breath, count to ten and start coming up with some kind of strategy, to perhaps make a move which you think will strengthen your position further so that you may force greater material gains, or even return some of the won material to simplify into a won endgame.  This is what Yours Truly ended up doing in this endgame.  The opening is, for the record, The Ruy Lopez."
