1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"A game in the 106th GameKnot tournament; a trick by White as early as move 6 leaves me two pawns to the good; focus then turns to a passed pawn that I had, me trying to hold on to it while Black tried to get rid of it - he had an opportunity to eliminate said pawn but when he missed it that pawn - along with other pieces - turns out to be Black's downfall!"

5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,Standard response - in fact the most popular one in the GK database...
6,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2pp4/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,!? for all intents and purposes unorthadox; the move seems passive and it makes the development of the b8 knight more difficult but Black...doesn't want to see d5? Not exactly - Black has something else in mind that takes this game out of the database altogether!
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2pp4/4p3/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,Might as well do simple development here...
8,Qa5,d8a5,rnb1kbnr/pp3ppp/2pp4/q3p3/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,?! Puzzling - that square for the queen is normally seen in the Scandinavian Defence (1.e5 d4 2.exd4 Qxd4 3.Nc3 Qa5) which is a hypermodern sort of opening which relies more on counter-attacking than space occupying - I don't think that idea is as effective here!
9,Bd2,c1d2,rnb1kbnr/pp3ppp/2pp4/q3p3/3PP3/2N2N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 3 5,Why not? Black's last move was just crying out for this response!
10,Qb4,a5b4,rnb1kbnr/pp3ppp/2pp4/4p3/1q1PP3/2N2N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 4 6,"? The last move was dubious at best but this one's just a mistake; Black's plan I assume was that both d4 and b2 come under threat but never mind dxe5, never mind the development Black has sacrificed for this, never mind the infamous 'poisoned pawn' that b2 may turn out to be White has a trick here!"
11,Nb5,c3b5,rnb1kbnr/pp3ppp/2pp4/1N2p3/1q1PP3/5N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 5 6,! Discovered attack - and it's important that the knight jumps to b5 and not d5 for what I have in mind! The black queen has only one place to go...
12,Qxb2,b4b2,rnb1kbnr/pp3ppp/2pp4/1N2p3/3PP3/5N2/PqPB1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,6...Qa4?? 7.b3 Qa6 8.Nc7+ wins for White
13,Bc3,d2c3,rnb1kbnr/pp3ppp/2pp4/1N2p3/3PP3/2B2N2/PqP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 7,No Nc7+ here? Of course it was considered but the logic behind this move from my point of view was; 1) the queen is removed from anywhere where she can cause trouble/inconvenience (if the knight went to d5 instead the queen escapes with Qa3) 2) When Black captures the knight the f1 bishop can capture the pawn and 3) There is better value for White point-wise through this sequence than through 7.Nc7+ where the knight will not escape the corner after Kd8

17,dxe5,d4e5,rnb1kbnr/pp3ppp/3p4/1p2P3/4P3/5N2/P1P2PPP/B2QKB1R b Kkq - 0 9,...but not for long! Two pawns are now under threat and as dxe5 is met with Bxb5+ and Nxe5 Black will be losing at least one more pawn at the moment!
18,a6,a7a6,rnb1kbnr/1p3ppp/p2p4/1p2P3/4P3/5N2/P1P2PPP/B2QKB1R w Kkq - 0 10,"9...dxe5 10.Bxb5+ Nc6 11.Bxc6+ bxc6 12.Bxe5 has Black three points worse off rather than two - as well as being straddled (admittedly, like White) with two isolated pawns so this move seems the most sensible."
19,exd6,e5d6,rnb1kbnr/1p3ppp/p2P4/1p6/4P3/5N2/P1P2PPP/B2QKB1R b Kkq - 0 10,"That being said - passed pawn! White will want to keep hold of it and Black will want rid of it; he will also want to castle kingside but his dark-square bishop is hard to develop; the a1 bishop prevents the g-pawn moving! f3, then g3, then Bg7/Bh6 is the only way to do it"

It was probably the better more solid move but thanks to the a1 bishop White has a very real threat of 12.Nxf7! if he's not careful; 11...b6?? 12.Nxf7! Kxf7 13.Qh5+ and from here; [1] 13...Ke6 14.Qd5# or [2] 13...g6 14.Qd5+ Ke8 15.Qe6+ Kd8 16.Bxh8 with an overwhelming advantage for White!

23,Bxe5,a1e5,r1b1kbnr/1p3ppp/p2P4/1p2B3/4P3/8/P1P2PPP/3QKB1R b Kkq - 0 12,Preventing the pawn advance again - and perhaps setting up 0-0-0? It is never played but I think it would have been a reasonable move especially given how the rook can possibly target d6 after castling!
