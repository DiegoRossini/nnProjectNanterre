1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game comes before much harder matches, for example against Fritz 10's top rated level (in game 2 I played one of its weakest rated levels) and some Internet programs which I have heard are very strong. So this should be an easier, more relaxed interlude. Rest assured that most of my stronger opponents to come will be nowhere near as easy as this one.

So: I start with the queen pawn, my principal opening as White."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"Windows Vista Chess opts for a move that could lead into a number of main line queen pawn openings, such as the Nimzo-Indian Defence, King's Indian Defence or Benoni, or even transposing back to the Classical Queen's Gambit Declined or Marshall Defence."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"I play the most usual move. I am anxious to know which queen pawn opening my opponent has in mind - or should that be ""in silicon chips""?"
4,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"The Benoni Defence. Windows Vista Chess has chosen the Benoni Defence, which mainly leads to closed positions."
5,d5,d4d5,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2pP4/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"I play by far the most common move, accepting the Benoni Defence."
6,b5,b7b5,rnbqkb1r/p2ppppp/5n2/1ppP4/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,The Benko Gambit - Black aims to sacrifice a pawn to fragment White's strong central pawn structure.
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/p2ppppp/5n2/1ppP4/2P5/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,"Attacking the b-pawn and preparing for e4, grabbing a greater share of the centre and strengthening my central pawn formation."
8,bxc4,b5c4,rnbqkb1r/p2ppppp/5n2/2pP4/2p5/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"Unusual, but not entirely unheard-of. I very rarely see a bishop developed straight onto the side of the board, but Windows Vista clearly thinks it is the best move in this situation to defend the c4-pawn."
9,e4,e2e4,rnbqkb1r/p2ppppp/5n2/2pP4/2p1P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"Unusual, but not entirely unheard-of. I very rarely see a bishop developed straight onto the side of the board, but Windows Vista clearly thinks it is the best move in this situation to defend the c4-pawn."

13,e5,e4e5,rn2kb1r/p2ppppp/b4n2/q1pPP3/2p5/2N5/PP1B1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 7,"An irresistible grab of space and tempi. I simply adored my immensely powerful-looking pawns in my opponent's side of the centre, pushing him backwards and constricting his development. However, perhaps this is slightly premature..."
14,Ng8,f6g8,rn2kbnr/p2ppppp/b7/q1pPP3/2p5/2N5/PP1B1PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 1 8,Yeah! Back where that knight belongs! I was pleased to see my silicon opponent retreating behind his barriers.
15,Nf3,g1f3,rn2kbnr/p2ppppp/b7/q1pPP3/2p5/2N2N2/PP1B1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 2 8,"On reflection, I think here I should definitely have played 8.f4, in order that after 8...d6 I should hold my powerful pawn formation. In this position I could see that after 8...e6 I would play 9.d6, completely blocking in Black's dark-squared bishop and controlling more and more of my opponent's space..."
16,d6,d7d6,rn2kbnr/p3pppp/b2p4/q1pPP3/2p5/2N2N2/PP1B1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 9,...but this is an altogether different problem. After 9.e6 fxe6 10.dxe6 my e-pawn is isolated and could fall easily. So I suppose I have no choice but to accept the exchange and allow my centre control to blow away...
