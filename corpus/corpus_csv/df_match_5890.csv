1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

It had been a long time since I last played a game with Coach Ion.  The last time I played him I was lucky to get a High Draw against him.  I found out he was playing in the Traxler so I decided to join it!  I am playing him at the moment but, I can report, that I have managed to get my first win of the tournament against a Class C Player with the black pieces.  I ended up investing an enormous amount of material (-9 the equivalent of a whole queen down) but my opponent lost his king so it was worth it.  Gameknot analysis has been requested and you will find the game in my past games profile."

No doubt white intended for Fou Leblanc to be chased off the h5-d1 diagonal, but Glenda has other ideas.  I now announced #3 and my opponent waved the white flag.
