5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"Kings knight variation. I mostly play this variation, but since the purchase of Thomas Johansson's 'The Fascinating King's Gambit' I'm starting to play the King's Bishop variation too."
6,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk1nr/ppppbppp/8/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,"An odd move, black's obviously going for the check on h4. Sure, it stops me from castling, but i think this line gives white too much of a free hand. Most common (and better) are 3..d6 3..d5 and 3..g5"
7,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqk1nr/ppppbppp/8/8/2B1Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 4,"I could stop the check with 4.h4, but i decide to go for a no-nonsense aproach with Bc4; developing the bishop to its best square, and by threatening to castle, i'm provoking black into continuing with his 'plan'."
8,Bh4+,e7h4,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1Pp1b/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 5,"i could've taken on h4, but i decide that the bishop on h4 would have to move again wasting another tempo for black."
9,Kf1,e1f1,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1Pp1b/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1K1R b kq - 5 5,"i could've taken on h4, but i decide that the bishop on h4 would have to move again wasting another tempo for black."
10,Nh6,g8h6,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/7n/8/2B1Pp1b/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1K1R w kq - 6 6,"The knight doesn't look good on h6, but its the only place it can go without leaving the bishop on h4 hanging. Better would've been d6."
11,d4,d2d4,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/7n/8/2BPPp1b/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQ1K1R b kq - 0 6,"If black doesn't want the centre then i'll be too happy to take it for him, in doing so I gain a tempo in threatening to take on f4."
12,Bg5,h4g5,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/7n/6b1/2BPPp2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQ1K1R w kq - 1 7,Another Bishop move!
13,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/7n/6b1/2BPPp2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1K1R b kq - 2 7,7.h4 would kick the bishop around further and thus allowing me to take on f4. But Nc3 seems the more natural move.
14,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/7n/6b1/2BPPp2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1K1R w - - 3 8,Kicking the Queen around.
15,Nxg5,f3g5,rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/7n/6N1/2BPPp2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQ1K1R b - - 0 8,Kicking the Queen around.
16,Qxg5,d8g5,rnb2rk1/pppp1ppp/7n/6q1/2BPPp2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQ1K1R w - - 0 9,Kicking the Queen around.
17,Nd5,c3d5,rnb2rk1/pppp1ppp/7n/3N2q1/2BPPp2/8/PPP3PP/R1BQ1K1R b - - 1 9,Kicking the Queen around.
18,Qd8,g5d8,rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/7n/3N4/2BPPp2/8/PPP3PP/R1BQ1K1R w - - 2 10,Regaining my invested pawn with another gain of tempo in attacking c7 (and the Rook on a8)
19,Bxf4,c1f4,rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/7n/3N4/2BPPB2/8/PPP3PP/R2Q1K1R b - - 0 10,Regaining my invested pawn with another gain of tempo in attacking c7 (and the Rook on a8)
20,d6,d7d6,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/3p3n/3N4/2BPPB2/8/PPP3PP/R2Q1K1R w - - 0 11,"Gaining yet another tempo, boy, is that Knight on h6 looking silly now."
21,Qd2,d1d2,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/3p3n/3N4/2BPPB2/8/PPPQ2PP/R4K1R b - - 1 11,"Gaining yet another tempo, boy, is that Knight on h6 looking silly now."
22,c6,c7c6,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/2pp3n/3N4/2BPPB2/8/PPPQ2PP/R4K1R w - - 0 12,"The only challenging move (but still not a good one), taking on h6 would now be a mistake for white since after black takes on d5 he also attacks the bishop on c4 leaving black to sweep up the bishop on h6."
23,Bg5,f4g5,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/2pp3n/3N2B1/2BPP3/8/PPPQ2PP/R4K1R b - - 1 12,After a long stint of thought i spot a combination which takes advantage of blacks exposed Queen and badly placed Knight.
24,Qd7,d8d7,rnb2rk1/pp1q1ppp/2pp3n/3N2B1/2BPP3/8/PPPQ2PP/R4K1R w - - 2 13,"A good move. It wins a pawn by force. After the g pawn takes the Knight blacks own Knight on h6 is hanging, and the King is in grave danger."
25,Nf6+,d5f6,rnb2rk1/pp1q1ppp/2pp1N1n/6B1/2BPP3/8/PPPQ2PP/R4K1R b - - 3 13,"A good move. It wins a pawn by force. After the g pawn takes the Knight blacks own Knight on h6 is hanging, and the King is in grave danger."
26,gxf6,g7f6,rnb2rk1/pp1q1p1p/2pp1p1n/6B1/2BPP3/8/PPPQ2PP/R4K1R w - - 0 14,"Threatening mate and the Knight, the point of the sacrafice."
27,Bxf6,g5f6,rnb2rk1/pp1q1p1p/2pp1B1n/8/2BPP3/8/PPPQ2PP/R4K1R b - - 0 14,"Threatening mate and the Knight, the point of the sacrafice."
28,Qg4,d7g4,rnb2rk1/pp3p1p/2pp1B1n/8/2BPP1q1/8/PPPQ2PP/R4K1R w - - 1 15,The only move.
29,Qxh6,d2h6,rnb2rk1/pp3p1p/2pp1B1Q/8/2BPP1q1/8/PPP3PP/R4K1R b - - 0 15,Attacking the Bishop (and effectively stopping White's threat of mate).
30,Nd7,b8d7,r1b2rk1/pp1n1p1p/2pp1B1Q/8/2BPP1q1/8/PPP3PP/R4K1R w - - 1 16,Attacking the Bishop (and effectively stopping White's threat of mate).
31,h3,h2h3,r1b2rk1/pp1n1p1p/2pp1B1Q/8/2BPP1q1/7P/PPP3P1/R4K1R b - - 0 16,"A horrific mistake, the loosing move allowing a mate in one. ...Qg6 and black would've survived to fight another day, but even then it still looks bad as white has a substantial lead in development and a pawn to the good. But anything's better than this."
32,Qxe4,g4e4,r1b2rk1/pp1n1p1p/2pp1B1Q/8/2BPq3/7P/PPP3P1/R4K1R w - - 0 17,"A horrific mistake, the loosing move allowing a mate in one. ...Qg6 and black would've survived to fight another day, but even then it still looks bad as white has a substantial lead in development and a pawn to the good.

33,Qg7#,h6g7,r1b2rk1/pp1n1pQp/2pp1B2/8/2BPq3/7P/PPP3P1/R4K1R b - - 1 17,"An enjoyable game for me, in which two dodgey moves by black in the opening give white a free hand and an initiative. My efforts crowned by a brilliant combination based on the Nf6 sac."
