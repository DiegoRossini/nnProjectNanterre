1,f3,f2f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5P2/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,this move was very confusing to face. It does not help development and weakens the e1-h4 diagonal
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/5P2/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,i take the center
3,Kf2,e1f2,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/5P2/PPPPPKPP/RNBQ1BNR b kq - 1 2,and now this! however the bad king position can not be exploited yet so i develop
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/8/5P2/PPPPPKPP/RNBQ1BNR w kq - 0 3,we can see that black is much better here. He has 2 pawns in the center and a piece in play
5,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/8/4PP2/PPPP1KPP/RNBQ1BNR b kq - 0 3,we can see that black is much better here. He has 2 pawns in the center and a piece in play

7,g3,g2g3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3pp3/8/4PPP1/PPPP1K1P/RNBQ1BNR b kq - 0 4,white seeks to open up the game but this is wrong as he has no pieces in play
