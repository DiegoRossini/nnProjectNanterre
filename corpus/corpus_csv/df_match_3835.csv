Before, we had NO NEED to calculate any variations really. The only calculation we needed to do was the safety check when considering ideas. Even then, it was very brief. We really did not even need to use our full thought process, since we planned out our ideas, and they were obvious and followed the correct principles. However, now we will need to use our thought process, and find the best move in this critical position: **Whenever the structure or material has changed, it is an important position and we need to make changes in our general plans.**
1.Our opponent's last move was reasonable and good. It puts some pressure against the black weaknesses. It is tactically safe, and makes no threats;We can move on to our own ideas.
2.We would like to attack against the white king, since we have open lines against it. We have massive center and bishop pair; Our king is quite safe in the center, and we need to open the position for our bishops. So we need to put our king behind the center pawns while keeping them fluid; so don't move the pawns until you are ready.
3.Candidate moves. 3a)The queen has an attack 13...Qa5, but 14.Nf3 e5 is considerable. So we only have one with the queen. 3b)13...Rg8, activates the rook, so it is candidate. 3c)13...Be5 is attacking, but it clearly is not too great after 14.Rad1. Still we should consider this the last of our candidate moves. 3d)13...e5 is not a useful move. It restricts the activity of our pieces and allows 14.e4 at least. It is not good. 3e)King moves? Ke7-We should consider this lastly.  
4.Now we have found the candidates, 4 moves. We should go from the potentially strongest to the weakest, most forcing to non forcing. By the way, all of these moves are safe :) I have inadvertantly calculated basic safety in step 3. So let us calculate 13...Be5, 13...Rg8, 13...Qa5 13...Ke7. 13...Be5 14.Rad1(no other considerable moves really) and the position has no more forcing moves. Thus we should evaluate: black should still be more active, but with his 13th move he has not helped activity. White is close and has more pieces developed. Therefore, white has gained in acitivty and is about equal, or slightly worse. In material, it is equal. thus the position is about equal after 13...Be5. Many players will try to think about doubled pawns, the attack, the king in the middle...etc... It just confuses them and they can't make a final judgement anyways. The 2 factors of activity and material will be the evaluation, and it is extremely accurate in almost all the positions. Now we look at 13...Rg8. This is a very good looking move, but it does give white a pawn. Since black has activated his rook and is clearly ahead in the activity department, white MUST take the material. 14.Qxh6 Ke7 Now the position seems quiet, and we should make the evaluation. However, black does have a ""threat"". He threatens 15...B"

I used the rule: If there is a sacrifice(reasonable: Maybe an unclear or dubious at best) for activity, play it on the board if it is safe. This is great against strong and weaker players alike. 1.It shows you are not afraid of them, and are playing for their throat 2.Weaker players are frightened by aggressive sacrifices It is reasonable, and gives quite a lot of activity.
