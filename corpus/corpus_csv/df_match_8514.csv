1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"A combination of some very poor chess and some very tricky tactics, but in the end it came together surprisingly. I am black playing at the time an opponent of very similar chessic knowledge. E4"
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"C5 the sicilian defence, i like the sicilian because i always like to develop away from the centre and counter attack later on"
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"d4, an aggressive leap. White generally wants to have no options for black to extend its pawns to the centre. I personally dont mind this as this system doesnt require such a dominant presence in the centre"
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,d6 keeps my presence there but nothing forcing.
5,d5,d4d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2pP4/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"d5 closing the space, stopping my queen knight on the c6 square. Its annoying for black, but at the moment I didnt really mind this otherwise i would of probably taken on d4"
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/2pP4/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"nf6, attacking both. developing a piece. Nothing more complex than that"
7,f3,f2f3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/2pP4/4P3/5P2/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,f3 defending
8,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3ppn2/2pP4/4P3/5P2/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"i played e6 to again open up for development, counter and trying to pursue white to give up his nice centre"
9,dxe6,d5e6,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3pPn2/2p5/4P3/5P2/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"he exchanges pawns allowing me to develop my bishop, the centre i feel now is mine."
10,Bxe6,c8e6,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/3pbn2/2p5/4P3/5P2/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"he exchanges pawns allowing me to develop my bishop, the centre i feel now is mine."
11,Bb5+,f1b5,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/3pbn2/1Bp5/4P3/5P2/PPP3PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 6,simple bishop check
12,Nc6,b8c6,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/2npbn2/1Bp5/4P3/5P2/PPP3PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 7,i gave up my knight in the hope he will give up his light square bishop to make mine strong. My knight isnt really doing anything in this position.
13,Bxc6+,b5c6,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/2Bpbn2/2p5/4P3/5P2/PPP3PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 7,my pawns are doubled. doubled pawns arent always bad. The double pawns sort of cement my presence in the centre allowing any attack to undouble my pawns and obtain a dominant pawn island
14,bxc6,b7c6,r2qkb1r/p4ppp/2ppbn2/2p5/4P3/5P2/PPP3PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 8,my pawns are doubled. doubled pawns arent always bad. The double pawns sort of cement my presence in the centre allowing any attack to undouble my pawns and obtain a dominant pawn island

17,b3,b2b3,r2qk2r/p3bppp/2ppbn2/2p5/4P3/1P3P2/P1P1N1PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 9,trying to flanchetto that bishop
18,d5,d6d5,r2qk2r/p3bppp/2p1bn2/2pp4/4P3/1P3P2/P1P1N1PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 10,trying to undouble my pawns

22,d4,d5d4,r2qk2r/p2nbppp/2p1b3/2p1P3/3p4/1P3P2/PBP1N1PP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 12,"i really like this move, d4 shuts down that bishop. This move i feel played a huge part in my victory. I always had the idea that his dark squared bishop would be a weakness as my centre is much stronger and the influence of the piece is very limited. As you notice the game develop keep and eye on d4"
