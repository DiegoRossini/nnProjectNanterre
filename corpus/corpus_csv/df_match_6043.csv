However, black seems to have plenty of resources, and white must be careful each turn. @eden8: After your line 15...exd5?? 16.Nxd5 Ne5, white just chops off the queen with 17.Nxf6"

The bishop is immune, like the rook. NOW STOP!!!!! and see if you can find the tactic that I that I had prepared. Tiktiktiktiktik.... After you find the solution, you can flip to MOVE 25, and see if you were right. Anyways, the move completely destroys the black king's cover."
