1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This is a game I played against rio1962 - he was extremely good until he faced an unstoppable (?) mate. Enjoy.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Normal.
3,Qh5,d1h5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p2Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"[?!] Here, it starts to get intriguing - I have reviewed rio1962's playing style and noticed that somehow he likes to develop his queen early."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p2Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 2 3,I defend the e5 pawn.
5,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p2Q/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 3 3,"[!?] Bc4- the most obvious, threatening Scholar's mate."
6,g6,g7g6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1p1p/2n3p1/4p2Q/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 0 4,"Another way was Nh6 or d5, but this seemed better."
7,Qf3,h5f3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1p1p/2n3p1/4p3/2B1P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 1 4,Having a second try.
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1p1p/2n2np1/4p3/2B1P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 2 5,"Again, blocking mate."
9,Qd3,f3d3,r1bqkb1r/pppp1p1p/2n2np1/4p3/2B1P3/3Q4/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 3 5,"[?!] I do not understand this move, but perhaps he wanted to make c3 a flight square for his knight."
10,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk2r/pppp1p1p/2n2np1/2b1p3/2B1P3/3Q4/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 4 6,"I develop my bishop - of course, considering there is a hole on g7, I could have fianchettoed it, but all the well."
11,g4,g2g4,r1bqk2r/pppp1p1p/2n2np1/2b1p3/2B1P1P1/3Q4/PPPP1P1P/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 0 6,"[?] I considered this move, and thought it to be a rather waste of a pawn - the idea is clear - g5 Ng4 7. Qd5 threatening mate, or 6. ... Nxg4 7. Qd5 but then I can play Qf6/Qe7 and that would defend it well."
12,Nxg4,f6g4,r1bqk2r/pppp1p1p/2n3p1/2b1p3/2B1P1n1/3Q4/PPPP1P1P/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 0 7,[!?] I take the pawn.
13,Qd5,d3d5,r1bqk2r/pppp1p1p/2n3p1/2bQp3/2B1P1n1/8/PPPP1P1P/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 1 7,"[!?] The reason that this move is not given a [!] is that the f2-pawn is target and I can play Bxf2+, but I decide playing Qf6 was safer.

EDIT: This move attacks the c5 bishop as well as mate, so the best move is Bxf2+."
14,Qf6,d8f6,r1b1k2r/pppp1p1p/2n2qp1/2bQp3/2B1P1n1/8/PPPP1P1P/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 2 8,"EDIT: [??] Leaving a piece to be taken on c5, and after Bxc5, f2 is also covered."
15,f3,f2f3,r1b1k2r/pppp1p1p/2n2qp1/2bQp3/2B1P1n1/5P2/PPPP3P/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 0 8,"[?] Rather, this move loses the rook.
EDIT: Loses rook for bishop."
16,Nf2,g4f2,r1b1k2r/pppp1p1p/2n2qp1/2bQp3/2B1P3/5P2/PPPP1n1P/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 1 9,Winning the rook for the bishop.
17,d4,d2d4,r1b1k2r/pppp1p1p/2n2qp1/2bQp3/2BPP3/5P2/PPP2n1P/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 0 9,This gives me a chance to save my bishop.
18,Bxd4,c5d4,r1b1k2r/pppp1p1p/2n2qp1/3Qp3/2BbP3/5P2/PPP2n1P/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 0 10,[!] This move is good since after Bxg5 there would be checkmate on f7.
19,Bg5,c1g5,r1b1k2r/pppp1p1p/2n2qp1/3Qp1B1/2BbP3/5P2/PPP2n1P/RN2K1NR b KQkq - 1 10,[!] This move is good since after Bxg5 there would be checkmate on f7.
20,Qe6,f6e6,r1b1k2r/pppp1p1p/2n1q1p1/3Qp1B1/2BbP3/5P2/PPP2n1P/RN2K1NR w KQkq - 2 11,I considered this the only move other than Qg7.
21,Qb5,d5b5,r1b1k2r/pppp1p1p/2n1q1p1/1Q2p1B1/2BbP3/5P2/PPP2n1P/RN2K1NR b KQkq - 3 11,Notice how now my queen is also attacked.
