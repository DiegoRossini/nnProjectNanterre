1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"In this game, Black plays inaccurately in the opening, allowing White to annex a large amount of space and slowly squeeze the position towards a tactical finish."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The O'Kelly variation, which has a deservedly poor reputation (specifically it can be lively tricky, but not really solid). Black has played a typical Sicilian move, preventing Nb5 after, for example, d4/...cxd4/Nxd4.  One problem is that White doesn't have to play d4 immediately (or at all!). Then, Black's committal pawn move may prove awkward, while White can transposition at his leisure."

5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/1p1ppppp/p7/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"White is not concerned with a direct refutation of Black's opening, which involves lines my opponent should know. It seems more practical to enter an open Sicilian and try to outplay Black on more familiar terrain."
6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p3p3/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"A strange transposition. Now White has many plans, including the status quo Nc3, the ""anti-Sicilian"" c3, and c4 in the Maroczy bind spirit. That fact that many moves have been tired (successfully) here speaks to Black's opening choice. His dark squares are in critical condition (see d6 and b6), and he has yet too develop a piece in 3 moves. No doubt many White players past and present have attempted to refute this indulgence with various systems, but in reality Black's Kan-type system will not fall apart so easily with accurate play from the second player."
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p3p3/2p5/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,Inviting Black to enter the Sicilian Kan via ..cxd4

9,d5,d4d5,rnb1kbnr/1pqp1ppp/p3p3/2pP4/4P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,Surely best. Black is cramped and underdeveloped.

In effect, White is preparing to suffocate Black on the queenside while he struggles to develop and bring his king to safety. White is clearly better now."
11,a4,a2a4,rnb1kbnr/1pq2ppp/p2pp3/2pP4/P3P3/2N2N2/1PP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"'!' This prevents ..b5 and secures c4 for the typical manuever Nf3-d2-c4, which arises in many Benoni structures.

But in reality e5 is not coming any time soon from White, while ..e5 is not particularly useful now as Black ought to develop on the kingside via ..Ne7-g6 or ..Be7."
13,Be2,f1e2,rnb1kbnr/1pq2ppp/p2p4/2pPp3/P3P3/2N2N2/1PP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,"Blocking ...Bg4 ideas with development (e.g. 7...Bg4? Nd2 and White will reach c4 and trade off his bad bishop for Black's only good piece, when White is essentially winning)."

The point of ...Nd7 should have been twofold: 1) hitting the e5 square in view of White's obvious f2-f4 ideas which, after an exchange, leave e5 as a powerful outpost; 2) threatening ...Nb6 to counter White's dream knight that will come to c4 soon. Even ..Ndf6 (after ..f7-f5 ideally) might be possible. The text simply wastes time...there is no point developing the bishop to b7, where it does nothing. Much better is ..Ne7, intending ..Ng6 to halt Whites f2-f4 plan."

The noose tightens, as Black loses even more space and still has not castled. White is winning. Also possible was the typical Qe1 plan, piling up on the kingside dark squares via Qg3/h4 and Bg5.
