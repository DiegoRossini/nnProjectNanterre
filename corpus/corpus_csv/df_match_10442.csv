1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Standard opening.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,It looked to me that he was going for a quick kill.
3,Qh5,d1h5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p2Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 1 2,It looked to me that he was going for a quick kill.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p2Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 2 3,I took a chance and continued to develop...the worst I could lose is the ability to castle.
5,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p2Q/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 3 3,"Consistent with ""Scholar's Mate."""
6,g6,g7g6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1p1p/2n3p1/4p2Q/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 0 4,Threaten the Queen and see what he does.
7,Qf3,h5f3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1p1p/2n3p1/4p3/2B1P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 1 4,Backed off but the situation is still fluid.  He can come back with the Queen or Bishop.
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1p1p/2n2np1/4p3/2B1P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 2 5,But normal development partly protects me at this point.
9,b3,b2b3,r1bqkb1r/pppp1p1p/2n2np1/4p3/2B1P3/1P3Q2/P1PP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 0 5,I chose a bolder move than normal to test his resolve.
10,d5,d7d5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2p1p/2n2np1/3pp3/2B1P3/1P3Q2/P1PP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 0 6,I chose a bolder move than normal to test his resolve.
11,exd5,e4d5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2p1p/2n2np1/3Pp3/2B5/1P3Q2/P1PP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 0 6,I chose a bolder move than normal to test his resolve.
12,Nd4,c6d4,r1bqkb1r/ppp2p1p/5np1/3Pp3/2Bn4/1P3Q2/P1PP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 1 7,I chose a bolder move than normal to test his resolve.
13,Qd1,f3d1,r1bqkb1r/ppp2p1p/5np1/3Pp3/2Bn4/1P6/P1PP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 7,He backs up to home.
14,Bg4,c8g4,r2qkb1r/ppp2p1p/5np1/3Pp3/2Bn2b1/1P6/P1PP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 3 8,This was my first mistake since it gives me no real advantage and allowed him to continue development.
15,f3,f2f3,r2qkb1r/ppp2p1p/5np1/3Pp3/2Bn2b1/1P3P2/P1PP2PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 8,I cannot even tell you why I made this move.  A normal fianchetto would have been preferable.
16,Bh6,f8h6,r2qk2r/ppp2p1p/5npb/3Pp3/2Bn2b1/1P3P2/P1PP2PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 9,I cannot even tell you why I made this move.  A normal fianchetto would have been preferable.
17,fxg4,f3g4,r2qk2r/ppp2p1p/5npb/3Pp3/2Bn2P1/1P6/P1PP2PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 9,And I give up a powerful piece for nothing.  I should have backed off.
18,Ne4,f6e4,r2qk2r/ppp2p1p/6pb/3Pp3/2Bnn1P1/1P6/P1PP2PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 10,For some reason I become ultra aggressive.
19,c3,c2c3,r2qk2r/ppp2p1p/6pb/3Pp3/2Bnn1P1/1PP5/P2P2PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 10,Probably to prevent him from being able to castle.
20,Nf2,e4f2,r2qk2r/ppp2p1p/6pb/3Pp3/2Bn2P1/1PP5/P2P1nPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 11,Probably to prevent him from being able to castle.
21,Kxf2,e1f2,r2qk2r/ppp2p1p/6pb/3Pp3/2Bn2P1/1PP5/P2P1KPP/RNBQ2NR b kq - 0 11,Probably to prevent him from being able to castle.
22,Qf6+,d8f6,r3k2r/ppp2p1p/5qpb/3Pp3/2Bn2P1/1PP5/P2P1KPP/RNBQ2NR w kq - 1 12,"All of this movement results in arrested development, the loss of two power pieces and no significant advantage.  He cannot castle but I cannot claim any advantage."
23,Ke1,f2e1,r3k2r/ppp2p1p/5qpb/3Pp3/2Bn2P1/1PP5/P2P2PP/RNBQK1NR b kq - 2 12,"Instead of moving my knight back to a safe position I castle, but at this point I have handed him a significant advantage.   In retrospect this was the one GOOD thing I did which will be vindicated later."
24,O-O,e8g8,r4rk1/ppp2p1p/5qpb/3Pp3/2Bn2P1/1PP5/P2P2PP/RNBQK1NR w - - 3 13,"Instead of moving my knight back to a safe position I castle, but at this point I have handed him a significant advantage.   In retrospect this was the one GOOD thing I did which will be vindicated later."
25,cxd4,c3d4,r4rk1/ppp2p1p/5qpb/3Pp3/2BP2P1/1P6/P2P2PP/RNBQK1NR b - - 0 13,Loss of 2nd knight and nothing is gained.  I could not have moved the knight to safety but I could have moved it to a place where its loss would have been productive.
26,Rae8,a8e8,4rrk1/ppp2p1p/5qpb/3Pp3/2BP2P1/1P6/P2P2PP/RNBQK1NR w - - 1 14,Trying to consolidate what I have left and see a strategy which will result in something good.
27,d3,d2d3,4rrk1/ppp2p1p/5qpb/3Pp3/2BP2P1/1P1P4/P5PP/RNBQK1NR b - - 0 14,Does he recognize the really bad situation I am in?
28,exd4+,e5d4,4rrk1/ppp2p1p/5qpb/3P4/2Bp2P1/1P1P4/P5PP/RNBQK1NR w - - 0 15,Finally turned the tide of loses but the check is incidental.
