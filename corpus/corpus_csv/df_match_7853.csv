Black threatens to simply win a pawn and thus is forcing White to either play e3 and close his dark square Bishop in, or to weaken b4 with a4, or to liquidate the center with cxd5.

Old pundits claimed that a6 was premature and that it weakened the dark squares but recent practice has shown that Black gets a good game."

A basic rule in endgames is that you shouldn't be afraid to sacrifice material if you can queen a pawn. As a side note f3 isn't possible because of Ng3+."
