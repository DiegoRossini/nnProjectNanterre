No real threa on the black diagonal (not while the c pawn is mobile), but I have space to manouver. Now, if I lose time by freeing my lsb, maybe - just maybe - I miss the chance to cause him some problems."

But it was just a bad idea, since white can easily answer c4 - I'm giving him the occasion by allowing my N to be threatened. True is that in order to play it he has to play a3 first, and I can try the Qa5 attack where if b4, Nxb4, etc, since a3 is pinned to the R."

On the other side, white has more or less the same problem: he has to castle just under my advancing pawns, and his minor pieces can be harassed - soon or later. If I play d6, Bd7, o-o-o... he will do whatever he wants (like c4. Fortunately for me, he assumes that Nb4 is still very powerful, but he can easily move his lsb from d3, or play a3 and make c4 a threat.)"

I'm doing this because I want to keep my R on th h column, in sight of a possible sacrifice (Nxg5). Moreover: I can play on this lsb by harassing it with d6, and It will be lost for white. In return, I'll have to waken my e6 pawn, which is very dangerous in this asset. The advantage of doing that: white, as far as I can see, is in no position to cause a serious threat on e6 in few moves. My lsb will become active without even having moved from his home square. My R is trapped, as his. A R on the 7Âºth will always help my K..."
