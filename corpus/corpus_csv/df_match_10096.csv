2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"First of all, the higher rated player is supposed to play for a win, especially in a tournament."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"And maybe she or he is tired to see you perform all these grandmaster moves in the opening that you keep looking up in the gameknot database. So she or he might come up with some surprising move to throw you out of the book, even if this move is not necessarily the best move to be played."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,I must admit that this trick works fine with me most of the time.
5,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,"But not this time, as we will see in the game."
6,Nd4,c6d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/1B2p3/3nP3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,"Ruy Lopez, Bird's defence, a variation that can lead to complicated positions."

15,exd5,e4d5,r1bqk1nr/pp3ppp/2p5/2bP4/2Bp4/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,I guess you would think that black will continue with 9. ...Bd7.
16,cxd5,c6d5,r1bqk1nr/pp3ppp/8/2bp4/2Bp4/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 9,I guess you would think that black will continue with 9. ...Bd7.

18,Kf8,e8f8,r1bq1knr/pp3ppp/8/1Bbp4/3p4/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 2 10,"But there it is, the unexpected move I was talking about. (At least, it was a surprise for me, and yet, there is no other game in the over 1900 gameknot data base). My opponent fondrak plays 9. ...Kf8, he no longer will have the right to castle and it will take him some moves to free his rook on h8. So what seems to be the most ""natural"" response to 9. ...Kf8? I guess it's 10. Re1, claiming the e-file. But I did not even consider to play this move. I was sure that my opponent had some home preparation at hand in case of 10. Re1. This is why I kept looking for something else. 
And in fact, he'd probably play 10. ...Be6 and white is not sure to take any advantage of black's uncomfortable king-side position. (For this annotation, I have checked the gameknot data base again and there really is such a fondrak game where he later brings his king over to h7 and finally wins the game.)"
