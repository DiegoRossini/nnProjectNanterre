1,g3,g2g3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/6P1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This is one of many games I have played against spirit1. I know he likes to fianchetto his bishops thereby attacking the centre from a distance
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/8/6P1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The gameknot database describes this as Benko's opening. It;s a slightly unusual one for me as black, however I wanted to push my pawns forward in the centre as I knew I would have the opportunity to do"
3,b3,b2b3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/8/1P4P1/P1PPPP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"The gameknot database describes this as Benko's opening. It;s a slightly unusual one for me as black, however I wanted to push my pawns forward in the centre as I knew I would have the opportunity to do"
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/8/1P4P1/P1PPPP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,The first fianchetto
5,Bb2,c1b2,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/8/1P4P1/PBPPPP1P/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 2 3,The first fianchetto
6,e5,e7e5,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n5/2p1p3/8/1P4P1/PBPPPP1P/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,This restricts the diagonal of the fianchetto'd bishop and applies some pressure in the centre
7,e3,e2e3,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n5/2p1p3/8/1P2P1P1/PBPP1P1P/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,This is the first move that varies the move order in Benko's opening
8,d5,d7d5,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n5/2ppp3/8/1P2P1P1/PBPP1P1P/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"This applies further pressure on the centre and opens the diagonal for my lsb. The disadvantage of this position is that it is tricky to get my dsb to a good diagonal, it is however supporting the c5 pawn should it be needed"
9,Bg2,f1g2,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n5/2ppp3/8/1P2P1P1/PBPP1PBP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 1 5,As expected
10,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/2ppp3/8/1P2P1P1/PBPP1PBP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 2 6,This returns us to Gameknot database Benko's opening territory
11,d3,d2d3,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/2ppp3/8/1P1PP1P1/PBP2PBP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 0 6,This is probably about the best square for my dsb at the moment and it opens up the kings side for castling
12,Bd6,f8d6,r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2nb1n2/2ppp3/8/1P1PP1P1/PBP2PBP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 1 7,This is probably about the best square for my dsb at the moment and it opens up the kings side for castling
13,Nd2,b1d2,r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2nb1n2/2ppp3/8/1P1PP1P1/PBPN1PBP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 2 7,"Opening up possibilities of castling long, if he does however I am ready for a queen side assault"
14,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2nb1n2/2ppp3/8/1P1PP1P1/PBPN1PBP/R2QK1NR w KQ - 3 8,At this point there are two games in the Gameknot database and black won both. Although both sides are almost equal in development I prefer black at the moment as  I feel the peices are a little more co-ordinated for an assault.
15,c4,c2c4,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2nb1n2/2ppp3/2P5/1P1PP1P1/PB1N1PBP/R2QK1NR b KQ - 0 8,I have the option now of opening the game up by taking the pawn or closing the centre and possibly opening the e file with pawn d5
16,Be6,c8e6,r2q1rk1/pp3ppp/2nbbn2/2ppp3/2P5/1P1PP1P1/PB1N1PBP/R2QK1NR w KQ - 1 9,In the end I opted for this to maintain pressure on the centre. I was also looking now to prevent him from castling if possible
17,cxd5,c4d5,r2q1rk1/pp3ppp/2nbbn2/2pPp3/8/1P1PP1P1/PB1N1PBP/R2QK1NR b KQ - 0 9,I wanted to keep my lsb and this also opened the diagonal for my queen as he will most likely castle on the kings side now. If I had taken with the knight he would probably be forced to Ng f3 preparing the way for him to castle. I didn't want to push him to making a move he wanted to anyway
18,Nxd5,f6d5,r2q1rk1/pp3ppp/2nbb3/2pnp3/8/1P1PP1P1/PB1N1PBP/R2QK1NR w KQ - 0 10,I wanted to keep my lsb and this also opened the diagonal for my queen as he will most likely castle on the kings side now. If I had taken with the knight he would probably be forced to Ng f3 preparing the way for him to castle. I didn't want to push him to making a move he wanted to anyway
19,Ngf3,g1f3,r2q1rk1/pp3ppp/2nbb3/2pnp3/8/1P1PPNP1/PB1N1PBP/R2QK2R b KQ - 1 10,Putting further pressure on the centre and preparing for a push with my pawns
20,f5,f7f5,r2q1rk1/pp4pp/2nbb3/2pnpp2/8/1P1PPNP1/PB1N1PBP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 11,Putting further pressure on the centre and preparing for a push with my pawns
21,e4,e3e4,r2q1rk1/pp4pp/2nbb3/2pnpp2/4P3/1P1P1NP1/PB1N1PBP/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 11,"I think this is probably a mistake, in his position I would be strongly tempted to castle, pretty much completing development. my threat of pawn to e4 would probably come to little"
22,Nf6,d5f6,r2q1rk1/pp4pp/2nbbn2/2p1pp2/4P3/1P1P1NP1/PB1N1PBP/R2QK2R w KQ - 1 12,I'm happy for him to take the pawn as it gives a half open e file and If I get to open the file I can pressure his king
23,O-O,e1g1,r2q1rk1/pp4pp/2nbbn2/2p1pp2/4P3/1P1P1NP1/PB1N1PBP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 2 12,"reopens the diagonal for my bishop and cramps the white position further, the white queen has limited options"
24,f4,f5f4,r2q1rk1/pp4pp/2nbbn2/2p1p3/4Pp2/1P1P1NP1/PB1N1PBP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 13,"reopens the diagonal for my bishop and cramps the white position further, the white queen has limited options"
25,Nc4,d2c4,r2q1rk1/pp4pp/2nbbn2/2p1p3/2N1Pp2/1P1P1NP1/PB3PBP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 13,Threatens the bishop and the e pawn. however if he takes the bishop I retake with my queen and can then put a rook on d to pressure his d pawn which would be difficult to defend.
26,Bg4,e6g4,r2q1rk1/pp4pp/2nb1n2/2p1p3/2N1Ppb1/1P1P1NP1/PB3PBP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 2 14,Pinning the knight and relieving some of the pressure on my e pawn
