10,h6,h7h6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p2/7p/6N1/4PppP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,Now I have to run through the gallows if I am going to survive.

14,d5,d7d5,rnbq1bnr/ppp2k2/7p/3p4/2B1PppP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQK2R w KQ - 0 8,now someone else in our club forums tried playing Nf6 here but this is much stronger.
15,Bxd5+,c4d5,rnbq1bnr/ppp2k2/7p/3B4/4PppP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQK2R b KQ - 0 8,This is where I started to really pour into the position. Then I started to cry( I am serious I started to cry and yes like a little school..) because after 9... f3 10. gxf3 Nf6 11. Nc3 Nxd5 12. Nxd5 c6 13. Nf4 Rg8 is super bad looking.
16,Ke8,f7e8,rnbqkbnr/ppp5/7p/3B4/4PppP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQK2R w KQ - 1 9,This is where I started to really pour into the position.

18,Bd6,f8d6,rnbqk1nr/ppp5/3b3p/3B4/3PPppP/8/PPP3P1/RNBQK2R w KQ - 1 10,I was expecting 9. ...f3 but this I might work some magic on. It does give me a sliver of time to develop another piece and consolidate my center
19,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk1nr/ppp5/3b3p/3B4/3PPppP/2N5/PPP3P1/R1BQK2R b KQ - 2 10,For a brief moment I thought I just might be ok. But then...
20,c6,c7c6,rnbqk1nr/pp6/2pb3p/3B4/3PPppP/2N5/PPP3P1/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 11,"When I saw this move I could believe my eyes. I rubbed them once, I rubbed them twice and yelled, ""hello Christmas morning!"" As you can tell from the glee in my spoken word this is a game altering blunder by black. Instead, of charcoal which I get from 10... Ne7!! 11. Qd3 (11. e5?? Bb4 12. Be4 Rf8 13.
a3 Bxc3+ -/+) 11... Rf8 12. Bb3 c5 13. Ba4+ Bd7 14.Nb5 Bc7 15. O-O a6 16. Nxc7+ Qxc7 17. Bb3 b5 18. Bd5 Bc6 19. Be6 Bd7 20. Bd5 Nbc6 is black all the way man"

22,Ne7,g8e7,rnbqk2r/pp2n3/2pb3p/8/3PPppP/1BN5/PPP3P1/R1BQK2R w KQ - 2 12,"Hum interesting, a little late chump the guy on d5 has gone home."
23,O-O,e1g1,rnbqk2r/pp2n3/2pb3p/8/3PPppP/1BN5/PPP3P1/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 3 12,Now I may have tried to push my luck with 12. e5!? but nah Santa already come I said.
24,f3,f4f3,rnbqk2r/pp2n3/2pb3p/8/3PP1pP/1BN2p2/PPP3P1/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 13,now there is a forced draw here which I would have taken(yes I know whimps never draw *points up to the title of the game*). Can you find it?
25,gxf3,g2f3,rnbqk2r/pp2n3/2pb3p/8/3PP1pP/1BN2P2/PPP5/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 13,now there is a forced draw here which I would have taken(yes I know whimps never draw *points up to the title of the game*). Can you find it?
26,g3,g4g3,rnbqk2r/pp2n3/2pb3p/8/3PP2P/1BN2Pp1/PPP5/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 14,now there is a forced draw here which I would have taken(yes I know whimps never draw *points up to the title of the game*). Can you find it?
27,f4,f3f4,rnbqk2r/pp2n3/2pb3p/8/3PPP1P/1BN3p1/PPP5/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 14,?? Now I get have my Christmas cake and eat it too. Instead of me telling you why this is a bad move let me show you....

29,f5,f4f5,rnbqk2r/pp2n3/2pb4/5P1p/3PP2P/1BN3p1/PPP5/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 15,"!! There it is a past pawn and all her glory. With the all of the queen's men sitting at home watching the game and the all of king's rook on full time guard duty for h5, even the blinded queen(knight on e7) could not  see what was about befall her beloved man. It is so much like the humpty dumpty tragedy"
30,Qb6,d8b6,rnb1k2r/pp2n3/1qpb4/5P1p/3PP2P/1BN3p1/PPP5/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 16,Now this turns out to be a good move because it forces me to keep a piece back to guard d4. Which really cramps my swagger in a few moves.
31,f6,f5f6,rnb1k2r/pp2n3/1qpb1P2/7p/3PP2P/1BN3p1/PPP5/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 16,The d-pawn is adequately defended so I take what is given and squeeze down harder.
32,Bg4,c8g4,rn2k2r/pp2n3/1qpb1P2/7p/3PP1bP/1BN3p1/PPP5/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 17,Now this is sinister. Do you know why?
