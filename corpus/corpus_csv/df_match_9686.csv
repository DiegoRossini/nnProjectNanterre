1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,Reti Opening
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 2,I am black. I decided to match white's Nf3 move
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,"Again I match. Also if white were to play 1. d4 I would play Nf3 And then if he played 2. Nf3 I would play d5 contesting to the center. I have read that Nf3 is a delayed Queen's gambit move, a anit-indian setup and also called the Torre attack. But now all the openings available have funnel down to one opening..."

5,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,Queen's gambit
6,dxc4,d5c4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/8/2pP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,Which I accept
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/8/2pP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"preventing b5
By the way Nc3 is okay but it is not the best way to continue QGA. I used to play Nc3 also when the gambit was accepted but it gives black a tempo. Better would be e3 or Na3. Nc3 is for Novice players folks!"
