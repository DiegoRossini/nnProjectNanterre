3,a3,a2a3,rnbqkbnr/1ppppppp/p7/8/8/P3P3/1PPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,I could have done that in one move. Not that it's a good move anyway...

7,Qxa5,h5a5,1nbqkbnr/1ppppppp/r7/Q7/8/P3P3/1PPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQk - 0 4,Here I could have taken his Queen. But...
8,h5,h7h5,1nbqkbnr/1pppppp1/r7/Q6p/8/P3P3/1PPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQk - 0 5,Apparently I was focused on getting my other Rook involved. Amazing to look back and try and figure out what goes on in the brain of a very young child...
9,Qxc7,a5c7,1nbqkbnr/1pQpppp1/r7/7p/8/P3P3/1PPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQk - 0 5,D. B. was apparently impressed that the Queen could move in any direction.
10,Rah6,a6h6,1nbqkbnr/1pQpppp1/7r/7p/8/P3P3/1PPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQk - 1 6,I apparently felt my Rooks should guard each other.

17,Qxb8,b7b8,1Qb2bnr/4pkp1/5p1r/7p/7P/P2qP3/1PPP1PP1/RNB1KBNR b KQ - 0 9,I'm guessing I wanted to put my heavy pieces together?

20,Kg6,f7g6,2Q2bnr/4p1pq/5pkr/7p/7P/P3P3/1PPP1PP1/RNB1KBNR w KQ - 1 11,"Now all my major pieces -- Rooks, Queen, and King -- are all clustered together. Apparently my 3-year-old mind thought that was good strategy."
21,Qe6,c8e6,5bnr/4p1pq/4Qpkr/7p/7P/P3P3/1PPP1PP1/RNB1KBNR b KQ - 2 11,"At this point, according to my dad, he told us the game was over because I couldn't move, and no one was the winner. I apparently asked him how you could have a game where no one won and he assured us it was possible.

Other than my father's say so and his handwritten score sheet, which he brought over for me to have when he picked up my son from school earlier this week, I have no other evidence the game happened. Obviously at 3 years old, me and D.B. wouldn't remember if it did or not. Assuming it did, what a weird game... but 3-year-olds produce weird stuff."
