1,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The Van't Kruijs. Not a popular opening at high levels, but notable for its transpositional potential, and used famously on multiple occasions by Kasparov against the Fritz engine."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/8/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"More popular are 1...e5 or 1...d5, but I was hoping for 2.c4 b6 and a reversed Nimzovitch-Larsen attack."
3,a3,a2a3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/8/P3P3/1PPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"With this second unusual move we stray further from the book and the usual transpositions. I think 2.b3, 2.c4, or 2.Nf3 are stronger and more straightforward."
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/8/P3P3/1PPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"I was already planning to fianchetto this bishop; it's an even more obvious choice now, with b4 in White's control."
5,b4,b2b4,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/1P6/P3P3/2PP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"Again, I think 2.b3 is cleaner. This is certainly more aggressive, but I've already made it clear that I don't intend to seriously contest the b4 square right away. As of this move, we are entirely off-book (with one game in Gameknot's World database following this line for another couple of moves)."
6,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/1P6/P3P3/2PP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,Releasing the queen's bishop and preparing for an eventual ...c5.
7,Bb2,c1b2,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/1P6/P3P3/1BPP1PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 2 4,Releasing the queen's bishop and preparing for an eventual ...c5.
8,d6,d7d6,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/1P6/P3P3/1BPP1PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,Releasing the queen's bishop and preparing for an eventual ...c5.
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/1P6/P1N1P3/1BPP1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 1 5,Continuing to develop the queenside aggressively. I think 5.Nf3 or 5.c4 might be more in line with the attack White is preparing here; he could benefit from the assistance of the c-pawn.
10,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bqk2r/pppnppbp/3p1np1/8/1P6/P1N1P3/1BPP1PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 2 6,"I think ...Nc6 or even ...Bg4 would be fine here, but I was wary of an early pawn push against my undeveloped queenside. I'll also need to expand eventually, so I put the Knight where it can see c5."
11,d4,d2d4,r1bqk2r/pppnppbp/3p1np1/8/1P1P4/P1N1P3/1BP2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,"Mildly restricting ...c5 for now, though I felt at the time like this weakened White's queenside unnecessarily. I'm going to get c5 eventually; I think a simple developing move might have been stronger for White."
12,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pppnppbp/3p1np1/8/1P1P4/P1N1P3/1BP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQ - 1 7,I take a moment to collect myself in case all those pawns start pouring down the board. I'm also getting my King out of the way for when the position inevitably opens up.
13,Nf3,g1f3,r1bq1rk1/pppnppbp/3p1np1/8/1P1P4/P1N1PN2/1BP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 2 7,White starts mobilizing his kingside.
14,e6,e7e6,r1bq1rk1/pppn1pbp/3ppnp1/8/1P1P4/P1N1PN2/1BP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 8,"At the time, I was concerned about 7...c5 8.d5 e6 9.e4 and my resulting backwards pawn at d6, but I don't think it looks so bad now. 7...b6 followed by ...Bb7 before playing ...c5 would probably do better; this e6 pawn proves to haunt my position for a long time to come."
15,Nd2,f3d2,r1bq1rk1/pppn1pbp/3ppnp1/8/1P1P4/P1N1P3/1BPN1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 1 8,"I'm not sure of the purpose behind this move. White may be aiming for a Knight on e4 or c4, but either post is easily assailable, and exchanging one of his knights for my expendable one on f6 doesn't seem productive."
16,c5,c7c5,r1bq1rk1/pp1n1pbp/3ppnp1/2p5/1P1P4/P1N1P3/1BPN1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 9,"With the White Queen momentarily out of the picture, this is a good time to get off my back three ranks."
17,dxc5,d4c5,r1bq1rk1/pp1n1pbp/3ppnp1/2P5/1P6/P1N1P3/1BPN1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 9,"The computer labels this an inaccuracy, and gives the continuation 9...Nd5 10. Ndb1 dxc5 11. b5 a6 12. Ra2 Nc7 13. bxa6 Nxa6, which certainly looks good for Black, with a significant developmental lead and good prospects against White's cramped position. The computer recommends 9.Be2 instead..."
18,dxc5,d6c5,r1bq1rk1/pp1n1pbp/4pnp1/2p5/1P6/P1N1P3/1BPN1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 10,"But I don't see the discovered pin on the Knight, and simply recapture."
19,b5,b4b5,r1bq1rk1/pp1n1pbp/4pnp1/1Pp5/8/P1N1P3/1BPN1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 10,"Risky but aggressive, and my Queenside is still looking pretty unprepared for a real attack. The computer thinks 10.Nc4 is better here (to protect against ...Nd5)."
20,b6,b7b6,r1bq1rk1/p2n1pbp/1p2pnp1/1Pp5/8/P1N1P3/1BPN1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 11,"The computer is still obsessed with ...Nd5, but I'm not feeling that aggressive at this point in the game. I'm trying to clamp down on White's advanced position and get my Bishop into the action, but..."
21,Qf3,d1f3,r1bq1rk1/p2n1pbp/1p2pnp1/1Pp5/8/P1N1PQ2/1BPN1PPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 1 11,"...There goes my Bishop's only good square, and it's going to take some work to get him into play. This move also puts some pressure on my Knight on f6, threatening to open up a powerful discovered attack down the long diagonal."
22,Nd5,f6d5,r1bq1rk1/p2n1pbp/1p2p1p1/1Ppn4/8/P1N1PQ2/1BPN1PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 2 12,Blocking the attack down the h1-a8 diagonal and preparing for ...Bb7. I open up my own pin first to keep White's Knight from trying anything tricky.
