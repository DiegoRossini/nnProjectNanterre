1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"As Black, I made a few mistakes that ended up with me losing two pawns, but all of a sudden I see a possible counter-attack on my opponent. One move later, I lose to a brilliant knight move. I love unusual mate positions (unusual, clever, pretty, dashingly handsome - they're all good!) even if they're played against me. This one involves a mate with a bishops and two knights"
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,This is my prime move when the King's Pawn is played - the silican. I might (as I mentioned in another annotation) work on what I can do with the Scandinavian defence though (1...d5)
3,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,White brings out his bishop - but this is not the best response to the silican. I take the recommendation of nuntar and play...
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 3,"with the threat of d5, gaining tempo and driving back the bishop"
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 3,bringing out the knight
6,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1p1p/4p1p1/2p5/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 4,"playing my normal developing move, but if I wanted to play defensively then 3...a6 would work as well"
7,a3,a2a3,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1p1p/4p1p1/2p5/2B1P3/P1N5/1PPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 4,"?! Though this pawn move may have looked good for Black, it seems like a waste of a move for White - right now I'm not planning to land a knight on the b4 square anyway. Maybe White was thinking of 5.b4, but although Black would lose some centre control, it'd weaken White's queenside, as well as lose a pawn (5...cxb4 6.axb4 Bxb4... but then White could play d4 to strengthen his centre control, which may compensate)"
8,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk1nr/pp1p1pbp/4p1p1/2p5/2B1P3/P1N5/1PPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 1 5,the bishop now has control of the long diagonal (fianchetto)
9,Nce2,c3e2,rnbqk1nr/pp1p1pbp/4p1p1/2p5/2B1P3/P7/1PPPNPPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 2 5,"hmm.... this could be a little slow for White, but there's nothing seriously wrong with this move (I'd have played Nge2 or Nf3)"
10,Ne7,g8e7,rnbqk2r/pp1pnpbp/4p1p1/2p5/2B1P3/P7/1PPPNPPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 3 6,"Opening up a castling opportunity kingside. I do consider Nf3, but I'd lose tempo if White were to play e5 - the e-pawn would be vulnerable, but a) Ne4, Ng4 and Nh5 would all be open for White's pawns to push my knights around (f3 if Ne4/Ng4, and g4 if Nh5) and b) the time taken for Black to take the free pawn would allow White to catch up in development"
11,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk2r/pp1pnpbp/4p1p1/2p5/2B1P3/P4N2/1PPPNPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 4 6,"White brings out his other knight, and the knight pair looks stable where they are (both knights control the d4 square). Also, White can now castle..."
12,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp1pnpbp/4p1p1/2p5/2B1P3/P4N2/1PPPNPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 5 7,as Black does here
13,c3,c2c3,rnbq1rk1/pp1pnpbp/4p1p1/2p5/2B1P3/P1P2N2/1P1PNPPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 7,"?! another strange pawn move - perhaps White is thinking of b4 here? (though to be fair, that option was open to White since move 5)"
14,d5,d7d5,rnbq1rk1/pp2npbp/4p1p1/2pp4/2B1P3/P1P2N2/1P1PNPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 8,now's a good time as any - the White bishop has overstayed its welcome
15,exd5,e4d5,rnbq1rk1/pp2npbp/4p1p1/2pP4/2B5/P1P2N2/1P1PNPPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 8,"White shouldn't retreat its bishop straight away due to 8...dxe4, forcing the White knight to move"
16,exd5,e6d5,rnbq1rk1/pp2npbp/6p1/2pp4/2B5/P1P2N2/1P1PNPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 9,Black's centre control looks good here
17,Ba2,c4a2,rnbq1rk1/pp2npbp/6p1/2pp4/8/P1P2N2/BP1PNPPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 1 9,"better than Bb3, because of...."
18,c4,c5c4,rnbq1rk1/pp2npbp/6p1/3p4/2p5/P1P2N2/BP1PNPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 10,"White would have been forced to retreat again had he only retreated the bishop one square, but this move still packs a punch - it blocks off the a2-g8 diagonal for the bishop"
19,d4,d2d4,rnbq1rk1/pp2npbp/6p1/3p4/2pP4/P1P2N2/BP2NPPP/R1BQK2R b KQ d3 0 10,"halts any further advancement of Black's pawns - I had a game where my opponent had me trapped like this in the opening moves - my first and only attempt with the French Defence as Black (1. d4 d6 2.d5 e5 3.e4 c5 4.c4 - that ended up being too cramped of a game for me, and I lost to a king/queen fork by my opponent's knight)"
20,b5,b7b5,rnbq1rk1/p3npbp/6p1/1p1p4/2pP4/P1P2N2/BP2NPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 11,I start a possible queenside attack
