1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi all! Annotating this game on a request from chicoboy, who was playing the White pieces. A bloody opening leaves only Rooks and a couple minor pieces left on the board, and each player misses a couple important safety checks in the dangerous mid-end game, which their opponents are happy to capitalize on. Enjoy!"

This can easily transpose to an equal (if perhaps dull) Four Knights' Game with 3...Nc6, or stay the Petrov line with 3...Bb4 (where Black will get his e-pawn back without much trouble if White cares to take it) and fighting chances."

Note that Bc4 doesn't really prevent Black from playing ...Be6, as after 5.Bxe6 fxe6 the half-open f-file could prove more troublesome for White than for Black."

Black can do nothing to prevent White from claiming the extra space, and therefore freedom of movement, afforded by d2-d4, so White may as well play it."

I give this a ?! rather than a straight ? because the d4 thrust is a good idea; it just should have been played at once. Better options were probably 6.O-O or 6.Be3, simply continuing development."

Another possibility worth a look was the immediate 6...exd4!? where Black maintains the initiative after White retakes and may play ...Nc6 or ...c5 at his leisure.

Probably 7...Bxf3 8.Qxf3 dxe5 was a better move order, as now White can break the pin with tempo. So, Black is the first to miss a quick safety check, and the balance swings in White's favor."

It remains to be seen whether the weakened pawn structure White inherits (after Bxf3 gxf3) will severely impact his game, but regardless, he should simply have played 9.Nxe5 and taken the free pawn. Missing the clearly correct choice, White shunts the advantage off to the Black side of the board."

By retaking with the pawn rather than the Bishop, White isolates his doubled f-pawns and limits the Bishop's scope. 12.Bxd5 would keep the Bishop active and put pressure on both f7 and b7, as well as preventing an eventual ...e4 push from Black."
