1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Of all the openings that I've tried out over the course of the past few years to counter e4, I find this one the most interesting. The games are usually exciting and aggressive and although it contradicts my playstyle, something about this opening is just very appealing."

3,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,"This is a move you never really see in an over the board game, but here on gameknot I see it all the time. It's not played a lot in real life games, so there's not much opening theory behind it. I suppose the opponent wants to draw me out of the book lines. I personally think it's a mistake since it allows black to equalize far too easily after an eventual d5 push.That being said, black still has to be a little bit careful. The proper move order to equalize has to be e6 -> Nc6 -> d5. Nc6 generally has to be played before the d5 push since otherwise the black king is exposed on the a4-e8 diagonal. White can then play Bb5+ immediately or in the near future and it makes things slightly bothersome. An example could be 1.	e4	c5
2.	Bc4	e6
3.	Nf3	d5
4.	Bb5+	Nc6
5.	exd5	exd5
6.	Ne5.	
This cramps the position for black enormously. Of course you can always play Bd7 to defend rather than Nc6, but that isn't optimal either. I'm pretty sure that Bd7 does also lead to at least a positional advantage for white. If It wasn't for me preferring the Taimanov Sicilian I probably wouldn't know about this tiny piece of opening theory that Bc4 brings, so I can definitely see how it could throw d6 Sicilian players out of their comfort zone."
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 3,I guess his plan is to get his bishop on a2 if it has to flee and maybe prepare a b4 push. With this we're already out of the gameknot database.

6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/2B1P3/P7/1PPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 4,"Preparing d5 and immediately putting a halt to b4 ideas. I was also considering a6, with the idea to chase his bishop to the end of the earth. ( figuratively speaking of course ) That being said, Nc6 is probably the best/most multifunctional move here."
7,d3,d2d3,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/2B1P3/P2P4/1PP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 4,And the fun starts.

10,exd5,e6d5,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n5/2pp4/2B5/P2P4/1PP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,"I actually wasn't expecting this move despite it being such an important theme in the limited amount of opening theory for this opening. It's probably correct, but trading here doesn't seem optimal for white. Granted I get 3 finicky pawns, but that's worth it considering the development and space advantage I'd have after bxc6. I was anticipating either Ba2 of Bb3."

12,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/1Bpp4/8/P2P4/1PP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 7,"This feels too early. You usually don't want to get rid of pins as they sometimes can be exploited. For example if white had played Nf3 here instead then black would have to be cautious of Ne5 ideas in the future, which is a move solely possible because the knight on c6 wouldn't be able to move."

14,bxc6,b7c6,r1bqkb1r/p4ppp/2p2n2/2pp4/8/P2P4/1PP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 8,"The bishop pair, a semi-open b-file,  strong control of the center and a potential a6 square for my light squared bishop. I can definitely work with this. It aren't game winning advantages just yet, but white will have to thread carefully. The only real weakness black has are double pawns and a very weak c6 pawn, but that pawn isn't that easy to reach for white at this moment."
15,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkb1r/p4ppp/2p2n2/2pp4/8/P2P1N2/1PP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 8,I immediately wanted to seize the initiative.  9.h3 Bb5 10. g4 creates too much issues for white in my opinion since it makes castling king side really risky and his queen side isn't exactly the most solid fortress either.

Qe7 almost ensures a queen trade, but I'm so ahead in development that it seems really questionable to me. I guess his plan is to trade all the pieces of the board and then try and pry on the c6 pawn ( which believe it or not is actually a mistake and his eventual downfall. )"

Better would have been to castle kingside or play something like Bf4. At this point in time I start calculating whether or not it's worth it to make him win the pawn on c6 if he moves the same knight a 3th time.
24,Bd6,e7d6,r3k2r/p4ppp/2pb1n2/2ppN2b/8/P2P3P/1PP2PP1/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 2 13,The calculations are made. After Nxc6 I calculated 13. Nxc6 Kd7 14. Na5 Rh8e8+ with Re2 ideas.

26,Kd7,e8d7,r6r/p2k1ppp/2Nb1n2/2pp3b/8/P2P3P/1PP2PP1/RNB1K2R w KQ - 1 14,I checked this one with a chess program after the game. The computer says that white should just ignore the knight and accept that he lost material. I guess this attack was more powerful than I realized at this moment.

29,Kd2,e1d2,r3r3/p2k1ppp/3b1n2/N1pp3b/8/P2P3P/1PPK1PP1/RNB4R b - - 4 15,"He chooses for the better option, although his future seems bleak nonetheless."
