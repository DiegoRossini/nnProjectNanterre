actually h6 turned out ok, because his bishop can't put anymore pressure on my knight. but in truth there really is no threat for anyone. so far not a lot has happened in this game, just check out both our development."

i did this actually just to block his knight from moving back. But exposing the rook is an old trick, the qeen becomes quickly trapped. i wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't blink an eyelid; having the rook just lie there openly, it's GOT to be a trap. Bobby Fischer had this happen to him once but he got out of it."

right now if he had gone nXc6, dXc6, QXc6 then he would have gotten out of it without losing too much. following that, i would have gone bXf2+ to simplify, rXf2, bXh3."
