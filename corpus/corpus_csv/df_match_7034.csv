Still, the natural c4 is met by Qxd4, I didn't want it. The game is quickly developing into a ""black attacks the queenside and white the kingside"", one of those nice situations in which is very hard to see who would be quicker.
I saw it, and decided to play the exchanges. I couldn't imagine how complex will turn out to be the situation in few moves..."

Still, I had the nice Nc4, forcing the queen to a7 (or d8), maybe better for me. This was a conditional move I set before...

But later, I saw that the simple 16. Nxf7 would have been enough to win here! Do you agree?"
