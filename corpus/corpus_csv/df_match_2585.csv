1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Said to be ""The best by test"" I'm actually not that great against it so maybe it's true."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"All standard so far (and boring, I need to learn the Sicilian properly someday)."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"All standard so far (and boring, I need to learn the Sicilian properly someday)."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"All standard so far (and boring, I need to learn the Sicilian properly someday)."
5,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,Well this is new to me. I'm used to Bb5 or Nc3 which probably explains my mistakes in the next few moves.
6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,"At the time I was unhappy with this move. I still am, but according to the 'book' (which I didn't consult until after the game) it was entirely correct."
7,Ng5,f3g5,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p1N1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 5 4,"Ugh! Knights forking pieces is one of my pet peeves, you'd think all my mucking around in the Chess Tactics section would have taught me to watch out for them but noooo..."
8,Qe7,d8e7,r1b1kb1r/ppppqppp/2n2n2/4p1N1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 6 5,"The 'book' response is d5 which leads to a very tricky game, I considered it but didn't like my initial read so this was the only other option to defend the fork."
9,d3,d2d3,r1b1kb1r/ppppqppp/2n2n2/4p1N1/2B1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,Opening up the dark-squared bishop to protect the knight. My gut feeling says this is a wasted move at this point - better to press the attack with Bxf7+ forcing Kd8 and threatening to fork with Nf7+
10,d6,d7d6,r1b1kb1r/ppp1qppp/2np1n2/4p1N1/2B1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"Looking to get the light-squared bishop in on the action. Without the Queen on d8, d5 is no longer an option"
11,Bxf7+,c4f7,r1b1kb1r/ppp1qBpp/2np1n2/4p1N1/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,Setting up for Nf7+
12,Kd8,e8d8,r1bk1b1r/ppp1qBpp/2np1n2/4p1N1/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 1 7,Setting up for Nf7+
13,Bb3,f7b3,r1bk1b1r/ppp1q1pp/2np1n2/4p1N1/4P3/1B1P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQ - 2 7,Setting up for Nf7+

15,f3,f2f3,r2k1b1r/ppp1q1pp/2np1n2/4p1N1/4P1b1/1B1P1P2/PPP3PP/RNBQK2R b KQ - 0 8,"At this point, I'm still not happy with the position but we're now past the early crisis and I want to kill this bishop. I'm always happy to exchange knights for bishops and if I can make an opponent double his pawns into the bargain then so much the better."
16,Bh5,g4h5,r2k1b1r/ppp1q1pp/2np1n2/4p1Nb/4P3/1B1P1P2/PPP3PP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 1 9,"At this point, I'm still not happy with the position but we're now past the early crisis and I want to kill this bishop.

In hindsight, I should have gone Nxb3 and if either axb3 or cxb3 used the tempo to get my bishop clear or if my bishop was taken, capture the rook on a1. Either way is good."
20,Bg6,h5g6,r2k1b1r/ppp1q1pp/3p1nb1/n3p1N1/4P1P1/1BNP1P2/PPP4P/R1BQK2R w KQ - 1 11,"I'll admit to having mentally flipped a coin here.

I presume my opponent was looking for h5 to pressure my light-squared bishop but I still have the initiative to deny it. Watch this space though, that pawn will be critical shortly."
