1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,In this game my opponent played the Benko gambit.  I'm not familiar with this opening at all so I was just pretty much winging it from move 6 on.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,I thought that my opponent would go for the Queen's Indian (2...e6 3. Nf3 b6) or the Nimzo-Indian (2....e6 3. Nc3 Bb4) considering they are the most common openings on Gameknot in the Queen pawn game with Nf6.  Instead they went for the Benko gambit and caught me completely off guard.

7,cxb5,c4b5,rnbqkb1r/p2ppppp/5n2/1PpP4/8/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"The Benko accepted.  Now I have to find a way to develop the f1 bishop.  That is the biggest problem for white in the Benko gambit.  Fianchettoing (sp?) on g2 doesn't look that good because of the pawn on d5, but I opted for it anyway.  The other option is to play Nc3 followed by e4.  Then after the capture on f1 (Bxf1) my castling privileges are gone and I would have to castle manually with g3 and Kg2.  I don't like the idea of g2 without my light-squared bishop to cover the holes.  So I went for the awkward fianchetto."

11,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qkb1r/3ppppp/b4n2/2pP4/8/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 6,I waited a few moves to develop my bishop because I wanted to see what my opponent was going to do.  Besides it's better to develop your knights before your bishops.  Now that I see that he can't take advantage of my kingside weaknesses right away I try to get my king out of the center before it opens up.
