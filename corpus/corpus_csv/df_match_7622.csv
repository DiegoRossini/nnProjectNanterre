Ng3 however is in no way bad, and controls central squares with the added bonus of a possible ready-made attack should black castle kingside."

Deciding on the retreat square took even less time - on d2 it will not be hit by a knight coming to d5. Bh4 is just a disaster."

20,Rc8,a8c8,2rqk2r/pbpnbpp1/1p2pn1p/8/3P4/3B1NN1/PPPBQPPP/R3K2R w KQk - 4 11,"He wants to play the waiting game too. This move however, permits me to force the exchange of ls bishops or else losing an exchange. However, after the game, this proved quite an interesting line:
11. Ba6 Ba8; 12. Bxc8 Qxc8; 13. 0-0 0-0: 14. Rfe1 c5 could go either way - I do not like the idea of the Queen/Bishop potential battery effectively pinning the knight to g2, and if white safeguards his central pawn by c3, then cxd4 cxd4 will give white an inferior isolated queen's pawn position, given black's dominance of the crucial d5 square needed to liquidate the weakness. Note that after Nxd4, then Qb7 forces f3, with glaring weaknesses in the white camp."
21,Ba6,d3a6,2rqk2r/pbpnbpp1/Bp2pn1p/8/3P4/5NN1/PPPBQPPP/R3K2R b KQk - 5 11,I would have been tempted to let Her Majesty gorge herself on the a7 pawn in favour of fast development. But this caution is not in any way bad.

27,Qb5,a6b5,r2qk2r/p1pnbp2/1p2pn1p/1Q4p1/3P4/5NN1/PPPB1PPP/R4RK1 b k - 1 14,"I feel that now that development had been completed, it was time for a long think, and a plan. I wanted to play Ne5 at some point, and then perhaps f4 to break up black's kingside. The rooks can take up active roles on c1/d1/e1 depending on the position. With a queenside pawn majority, moves like c4 followed by c5/d5 could get the pawns rolling. This was, I felt very comfortable for white.
The purpose of the text was to pin the knight (obviously) but to try and lure the king into castling into the weakened kingside in order to escape the pin. Then after 0-0, a sacrifice on g5 would prove decisive."

As an alternative, I think that Rae1 would be suitable, as then the bishop doesn't do much. There is no need to fear Bxg3 - true, I would like a knight to end up on e4 at some point, but then the open f-file spells catastrophe for black.
Instead..."

Nf4 was a fear, but I doubt black can get anything tangible after Bxf4 gxf4 (disposing of the bad bishop) where the open g-file is compensated by the black king being stuck in the centre. A rook move, or perhaps Ne4 was a better option."
