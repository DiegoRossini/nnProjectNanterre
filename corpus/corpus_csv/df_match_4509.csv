1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"My opponent bring some great input to the game, as I hope to have done also, I've kept my ideas about the Keres system is a nice draw weapon against the Sicilian but not much more at this ""correspondence"" slow pace, but what would have happened had I've played 8.bxc6, could things gone wrong for black? or white would have trouble to cope with the asymmetrical pawn structure, and couldn't have managed to hold the draw? 
After that, several exchanges, made me believe the game was going to became a boring draw... but then I was wrong, white kept one of the rooks and started pushing some pawns soon putting my position under severe pressure, I was never able to remove my bishop from the front of the e pawn to push it foreword to e5, and white kept gaining space, I needed a break on the other wing, so I've opened a column for my rook and profited from some lack of mobility from white's rook for some moments I thought I was going to win easily attacking white's pawns from behind but then 31.e5! increased the tension on the king's wing and 34.Bd1! forcing another of my pawn to a light square made me step down to reality, this was going to be a draw, but an hard fought one!
Congrats vobonk for a nice game"
