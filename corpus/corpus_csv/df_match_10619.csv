1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"Round three of the 2007 Wa Open.  After drawing a Sicilian Maroczy bind the night before, I came to the board looking for blood.  Unfortunately for my opponent, I was able to exploit some move order inaccuracies and get the upperhand early and never let go."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,The d5 strongpoint systems against the Reti are my favorites to play against.  You are guaranteed a fight from move two!
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,"Black has other moves, including 2...dc, 2...c6, 2...Nf6, 2...d4 and a few others."
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"Black has other moves, including 2...dc, 2...c6, 2...Nf6, 2...d4 and a few others."
5,g3,g2g3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2P5/5NP1/PP1PPP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,This move is a little strange.  It seems like Black should be developing and preparing to castle.  There is plenty of time for this move later.  3...Nf6 must be stronger.
6,b6,b7b6,rnbqkbnr/p1p2ppp/1p2p3/3p4/2P5/5NP1/PP1PPP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,This move is a little strange.  It seems like Black should be developing and preparing to castle.  There is plenty of time for this move later.  3...Nf6 must be stronger.
7,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqkbnr/p1p2ppp/1p2p3/3p4/2P5/5NP1/PP1PPPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"Falling further behind in development, but he does have a solid center."
8,Bb7,c8b7,rn1qkbnr/pbp2ppp/1p2p3/3p4/2P5/5NP1/PP1PPPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,"Falling further behind in development, but he does have a solid center."

11,cxd5,c4d5,rn1qkbnr/pb3ppp/1p2p3/2pP4/8/5NP1/PP1PPPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 6,I wanted to clarify Black's intentions as to his developmental scheme and at the same time avoid the cramping ...d4.
12,exd5,e6d5,rn1qkbnr/pb3ppp/1p6/2pp4/8/5NP1/PP1PPPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,Black is going to accept the hanging pawns!  This is one reason why ...Nf6 should have been played already.  Then Black can avoid the coming pawn weaknesses with ...Nxd5.
13,d4,d2d4,rn1qkbnr/pb3ppp/1p6/2pp4/3P4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,"Fixing the d-pawn, blocking the light-squared bishop and preparing to play Qc2, Nc3 and Rd1, followed by dc, when my pressure down the d-file will be dangerous."
14,Nf6,g8f6,rn1qkb1r/pb3ppp/1p3n2/2pp4/3P4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 8,"Qc2 was better, but Black misses his best response"

19,Qc2,a4c2,rn1qk2r/p3bppp/1pb2n2/2pp4/3P4/2N2NP1/PPQ1PPBP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 6 10,"Attempting to either isolate the d-pawn, or saddle Black with hanging pawns that will be weak."

13...h6 14. Nxd5! Bxd5 15. Bxd5 hxg5 16. Bxa8 Qxa8 17. Bxg5, when White has the initiative, the better pawn structure and open lines for the heavy pieces.  After 13...Nb6 14. e4! Black cant play 14...d4? when 15. e5! wins a piece due to the threat of mate.  15...Bxg2 16. ef g6 17. fxe7 Qxe7 18. Kxg2 dxc3 19. Qxc3, leaves black down a piece and with two isolated pawns."
