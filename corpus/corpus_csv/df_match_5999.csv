It has been a long time since I annotated my last game.   Ever since early June chess has taken a back seat for me as I have had to deal with the loss of a close friend to Secondary Lung Cancer.  My friend, Rita received the death sentence in early June and passed away on 27.7.10.  Her funeral was on August 17th.  I still miss her even now and I am at the moment undergoing bereavement counselling.  Amazingly I have still managed to make moves in my games but my rating has taken a bit of a knockback and I will be lucky to be able to hold on to my Class A status.  However, it is time to get my chess back on track and my first step is to annotate a game between my buddy, Steve, which ebbed and flowed all the way through until we reached a fascinating endgame which resulted in a Low Draw for me.  How did this happen?  Well, I will continue my commentary on Move 10 because the first 9 moves are the most popular moves in the MT although 7.... Ke8 has been a good choice for black in this MT.  Anyhow, before I go any further, here is the link to Gameknot Analysis for you to follow this game more easily.  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=14262186&rnd=0.2819884328735607"
