1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I have been asked to annotate this game by kse6710 to see where he could improve his game
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,!? I have never seen this move however I see it as a move to create an attack similar to that of the 4-pawns attack of the KID(King's Indian Defence)
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,!? I have never seen this move however I see it as a move to create an attack similar to that of the 4-pawns attack of the KID(King's Indian Defence)

6,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p1b2/2PP1P2/8/PP2P1PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,Black has no targets to hit so this is fine especially if he plans to play Nd7 and e6 he needs his bishop outside the pawn chain. Nf6 is also fine
7,cxd5,c4d5,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3P1b2/3P1P2/8/PP2P1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,I prefer cxd5 which means after Nc6 and Rc8 black has control of the open c-file. Black's queen can be attacked with tempo and so his edge in development while be neutralised
8,Qxd5,d8d5,rn2kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3q1b2/3P1P2/8/PP2P1PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,I prefer cxd5 which means after Nc6 and Rc8 black has control of the open c-file. Black's queen can be attacked with tempo and so his edge in development while be neutralised
9,Nc3,b1c3,rn2kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3q1b2/3P1P2/2N5/PP2P1PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 5,White has the right idea attack with tempo
10,Qd6,d5d6,rn2kbnr/pp2pppp/2pq4/5b2/3P1P2/2N5/PP2P1PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 6,I like Qd8 better which although seems strange black admits he made a mistake and he can then continue. At the moment the the queen gets way in the smooth development of the DSB (Dark Squared Bishop) after e6 and so Black may need to play g6 and Bg7 to develop the bishop. The Queen can't do to d7 because it blocks Nd7
11,Nf3,g1f3,rn2kbnr/pp2pppp/2pq4/5b2/3P1P2/2N2N2/PP2P1PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 6,"I don't know why black exchanged because after white play BxB and then e5 he has good central control and is better developed. Also black gives up his most useful piece. He wasted a tempo playing Bg4 and also his queen at the moment is more of a nuance than a help because it blocks the development of his DSB. Black needs to hit the center with f5 after Something like Qc7,Bb4  Ne7 and then f5"
12,e6,e7e6,rn2kbnr/pp3ppp/2pqp3/5b2/3P1P2/2N2N2/PP2P1PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"I don't know why black exchanged because after white play BxB and then e5 he has good central control and is better developed.

17,Bxf3,e2f3,rn2kbnr/pp3ppp/2pqp3/8/3PPP2/2N2B2/PP4PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 9,Black's pawn break is taken away from him

22,Bxc3,b4c3,rn2k1nr/ppq2ppp/2p1p3/5P2/3PP3/2b2B2/PP4PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 12,"Again black trade bishops for knight and at the moment white is winning comfortably. Better developed, more space, safer king and of course he has a big center which could be seen as a target but Black has to develop to attack it and then white will have time to protect it. White will also win the endgame if he can keep his bishops because his two bishops will put preform black's knights."
