1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

After going through a Big Slump and losing my previous game to Klaus to a pin motif, I was really chuffed to get this result!  Yet again I had Operation Joblock to thank here.  There was a lot of play down the middle and it resulted in a mid-game queen trade.  I think both players found it very hard to figure out how to make progress from such attrition.  Klaus did leave a pawn for me to pick off, but I knew it was toxic because if Fou Leblanc had snapped it off, he would have been trapped on the queenside.  There was no way I was gonna allow this, so I took great steps to make sure that Klaus could make no in-roads into my position.  Once I was convinced that I had shut him out, I offered him a draw and he kindly accepted it.  So, how did this all happen?  Well, here is the thematic Dutch Defense.  We kick off with 1. d4 and then f5."

I did not want to take it on the previous move because I was worried that Fou Leblanc would be trapped.  With this move it looks as if Klaus just wants to shut up shop.  I decided to take this moment to make a bid for only my third ever Master Draw in my chessic career by moving Fou Lenoir to defend my backward a3 pawn.  Klaus kindly accepted the offer.  Gameknot analysis showed that I had a positional plus of +0.40 and neither side made any errors whatsoever so I am very pleased with that.  As it is a draw and not a win, I am still plain jstevens1 and not TheBlackQueen, but at least I have achieved another milestone in my chessic career and I hope I can add to the tally.   Klaus, you have played really well and have done nothing wrong but you have simply encountered a lot of resistance which has prevented you from achieving victory here. Do you the Inquest Jury agree?  Anyhow, I will be back when I have another game to annotate.  Until then, have a good read - bye for now - Joanne"
