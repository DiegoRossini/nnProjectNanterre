1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I was White in this team match where I played a risky overextensive attack.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The Sicilian Defense is the most common response to e4, and leads to imbalanced interesting positions."
3,c3,c2c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,This is passive compared to the normal Nf3. Although it is safer than Open Sicilian and White often gets a microscopic advantage if played accurately. Right now I'm trying to master the Open Sicilian lines. The Alapin variation (2.c3) is somewhat drawish.
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Most common moves for Black are 2...Nf6 and 2...d5.
I recommend Nf6."
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/3PP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,The point of c3.
6,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3pP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Black usually doesn't take the pawn immediately. This opening is very passive for Black, but it is safer than the common variations, and Black can play this to avoid studying, although in the variations where Black gives up the centre instead of fighting for it with Nf6 or d5, White is usually better."
7,cxd4,c3d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3PP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"Black usually develops his dark bishop to e7 in this opening. Aiming for a dragon-type setup here isn't as good as it is in Open Sicilian, because here I have a pawn on d4 which would block the fianchetto."
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/3PP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"Black usually develops his dark bishop to e7 in this opening. Aiming for a dragon-type setup here isn't as good as it is in Open Sicilian, because here I have a pawn on d4 which would block the fianchetto."
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/3PP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 5,"Black usually develops his dark bishop to e7 in this opening. Aiming for a dragon-type setup here isn't as good as it is in Open Sicilian, because here I have a pawn on d4 which would block the fianchetto."
10,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"Black usually develops his dark bishop to e7 in this opening. Aiming for a dragon-type setup here isn't as good as it is in Open Sicilian, because here I have a pawn on d4 which would block the fianchetto."
11,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p1np1/6B1/3PP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 1 6,Other developing moves aren't as active.
12,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/6B1/3PP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 2 7,"This is slightly overextensive. I considered Qd2 then Bh6, but it doesn't really do much to help me. I couldn't think of a good plan here, so I'm just starting a kingside pawnstorm."
13,f4,f2f4,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/6B1/3PPP2/2N5/PP4PP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 7,"This is slightly overextensive. I considered Qd2 then Bh6, but it doesn't really do much to help me. I couldn't think of a good plan here, so I'm just starting a kingside pawnstorm."
14,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/6B1/3PPP2/2N5/PP4PP/R2QKBNR w KQ - 1 8,Castles into my attack.
15,Be2,f1e2,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/6B1/3PPP2/2N5/PP2B1PP/R2QK1NR b KQ - 2 8,Preparing g4.
16,a6,a7a6,rnbq1rk1/1p2ppbp/p2p1np1/6B1/3PPP2/2N5/PP2B1PP/R2QK1NR w KQ - 0 9,Preparing to gain space on queenside.
17,g4,g2g4,rnbq1rk1/1p2ppbp/p2p1np1/6B1/3PPPP1/2N5/PP2B2P/R2QK1NR b KQ - 0 9,"My kingside is totally overextended, but I'm adding pressure against Black's king."
18,b5,b7b5,rnbq1rk1/4ppbp/p2p1np1/1p4B1/3PPPP1/2N5/PP2B2P/R2QK1NR w KQ - 0 10,"Black's knight is worth more than my bishop, since the knight defends the kingside and puts pressure on e4, while my bishop isn't necessary for my attack."
19,Bxf6,g5f6,rnbq1rk1/4ppbp/p2p1Bp1/1p6/3PPPP1/2N5/PP2B2P/R2QK1NR b KQ - 0 10,"Black's knight is worth more than my bishop, since the knight defends the kingside and puts pressure on e4, while my bishop isn't necessary for my attack."
20,exf6,e7f6,rnbq1rk1/5pbp/p2p1pp1/1p6/3PPPP1/2N5/PP2B2P/R2QK1NR w KQ - 0 11,Black decides to weaken his d-pawn and enclose his bishop. He was probably afraid of g5 tempo gain by recapturing with bishop. But exf6 is weakening.
21,f5,f4f5,rnbq1rk1/5pbp/p2p1pp1/1p3P2/3PP1P1/2N5/PP2B2P/R2QK1NR b KQ - 0 11,"Now Black's f-pawns can't advance, so his bishop will never become powerful on its long diagonal."
22,Bb7,c8b7,rn1q1rk1/1b3pbp/p2p1pp1/1p3P2/3PP1P1/2N5/PP2B2P/R2QK1NR w KQ - 1 12,"As for the light bishop, it is strong on the other long diagonal, since it aims at my weakened kingside."
23,Bf3,e2f3,rn1q1rk1/1b3pbp/p2p1pp1/1p3P2/3PP1P1/2N2B2/PP5P/R2QK1NR b KQ - 2 12,Counters Black's pressure on the long diagonal.
24,Nd7,b8d7,r2q1rk1/1b1n1pbp/p2p1pp1/1p3P2/3PP1P1/2N2B2/PP5P/R2QK1NR w KQ - 3 13,"Re8 is slightly more accurate since it threatens to win the e-pawn with b4, but it didn't really matter since Black played the threat next move."
25,h4,h2h4,r2q1rk1/1b1n1pbp/p2p1pp1/1p3P2/3PP1PP/2N2B2/PP6/R2QK1NR b KQ - 0 13,"My kingside is now fully overextended, so I need to be careful not to let Black's pieces into my weakened squares on the kingside. This is an example of a superdynamic imbalanced position.
Will I succeed in my overextensive attack on the kingside? or will Black take advantage of my uncastled king and loose centre pawns?"
