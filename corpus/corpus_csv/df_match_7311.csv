1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This checkmate felt to me like a legals mate. It was only a bit like it, but it still used bishops and knights."
2,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"This man always responds like this. I say it only wins him the opening about 10% of the time, but I am more experienced in the openings."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"This move stabilizes the center, and gets ready for D4."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p1n2/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,This protects the E pawn.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p1n2/8/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 3,This protects the E pawn.
6,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,Planning to get his bishop out. Perfect time to get into action.
7,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"I always do that move, followed by Ng5, to atack at F7. That is the part less like a legals mate."
8,Bh6,f8h6,rnbqk2r/ppp1pp1p/3p1npb/8/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,This is the part were I invade. I am lucky that he does not see the future attack. :)
9,d4,d2d4,rnbqk2r/ppp1pp1p/3p1npb/8/2BPP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"D4 is my attack. I have a harder to find attack on h6, and his bishop."
10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1pp1p/3p1npb/8/2BPP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 1 6,"Now I have a free bishop, and am close to his king, the invasion part."
11,Bxh6,c1h6,rnbq1rk1/ppp1pp1p/3p1npB/8/2BPP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 6,That was his only option of he didn't want to lose another 2 points.
12,Re8,f8e8,rnbqr1k1/ppp1pp1p/3p1npB/8/2BPP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 1 7,That was his only option of he didn't want to lose another 2 points.
13,Ng5,f3g5,rnbqr1k1/ppp1pp1p/3p1npB/6N1/2BPP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 2 7,"The f7 attack I planned earlier is now in action. No longer avoidable by D5, but by e6"
14,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qr1k1/ppp1pp1p/3p1npB/6N1/2BPP1b1/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 3 8,Here i shall show you the risk of legals.
15,Nxf7,g5f7,rn1qr1k1/ppp1pN1p/3p1npB/8/2BPP1b1/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 8,"if I were to lift my knight up now, it would be checkmate. Another 5 moves and it is. A free queen doesn't matter."
16,Qd7,d8d7,rn2r1k1/pppqpN1p/3p1npB/8/2BPP1b1/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 1 9,obviously
17,Ne5+,f7e5,rn2r1k1/pppqp2p/3p1npB/4N3/2BPP1b1/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 2 9,But that did not quite do it for black. A discovered kill makes it easier to win.
18,Kh8,g8h8,rn2r2k/pppqp2p/3p1npB/4N3/2BPP1b1/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 3 10,His only spot.
19,Nxd7,e5d7,rn2r2k/pppNp2p/3p1npB/8/2BPP1b1/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 10,"Now that we trade out queens, all I need is a protection on g7 to win"
20,Bxd1,g4d1,rn2r2k/pppNp2p/3p1npB/8/2BPP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2bK2R w KQ - 0 11,"Now that we trade out queens, all I need is a protection on g7 to win"
21,Nxf6,d7f6,rn2r2k/ppp1p2p/3p1NpB/8/2BPP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2bK2R b KQ - 0 11,"I have a mate in 2, avoidable, but not very. Luckily, He gives me a free checkmate by playing the game waster, Bxc2"
22,Bxc2,d1c2,rn2r2k/ppp1p2p/3p1NpB/8/2BPP3/2N5/PPb2PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 12,"Now I have a forced checkmate next move, no matter what he does. This isn't exactly what I call a ""legals mate,"" but it IS what I call a 'feels like a legals mate.'"
23,Nxe8,f6e8,rn2N2k/ppp1p2p/3p2pB/8/2BPP3/2N5/PPb2PPP/R3K2R b KQ - 0 12,"Now I have a forced checkmate next move, no matter what he does. This isn't exactly what I call a ""legals mate,"" but it IS what I call a 'feels like a legals mate.'"
24,Nc6,b8c6,r3N2k/ppp1p2p/2np2pB/8/2BPP3/2N5/PPb2PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 1 13,"This move has variations, (Nd7, Ba4, g5,) but they all lead up to the killing checkmate...."
