1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"All standard Sicilian Najdorf variation so far, hacked out at speed by both of us.  This move signifies the English Attack normally.  On Gameknot, I don't have a good record against it.  I normally play 6 ...e5, which forces White to move the Nd4 but leaves a hole at d5 that White may subsequently exploit.  I've also toyed with an immediate 6....Ng4 to harass the Be3 but with limited success.  This game, I decided on a more conservative approach."

I'd expected 7. f3 followed by a g4 advance as is standard in the English Attack but I don't think there's anything wrong with this move."

However, as is typical of many Sicilian variations, White's pieces are better developed than Black's whose pawns have made more moves, so I'd normally expect a vigorous attack from White to begin now."

17,f4,f2f4,rnbq1rk1/1p2bppp/p2ppn2/8/3NPP2/2N1B3/PPP1B1PP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 9,"Sure enough, the f-pawn launches forward and White is threatening to attack Black's central pawn fortification."
18,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bq1rk1/1p1nbppp/p2ppn2/8/3NPP2/2N1B3/PPP1B1PP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 1 10,"I continue with my development, preferring this square for the QN as it both supports the other N on f6 and also covers e5 and c5.  If I can get ...Nc5 in, I can counter-attack White's e-pawn."
19,Bf3,e2f3,r1bq1rk1/1p1nbppp/p2ppn2/8/3NPP2/2N1BB2/PPP3PP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 2 10,"White occupies the long diagonal, discouraging me from playing the standard ...b5 advance, followed by fianchetto on b7.  This also over-defends e4, if he doesn't want to advance it."
20,Qc7,d8c7,r1b2rk1/1pqnbppp/p2ppn2/8/3NPP2/2N1BB2/PPP3PP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 3 11,A standard square for the Q.  I played this now in order to enable ...b5 and ...Bb7 followed by centralisation of the Ra8.
21,f5,f4f5,r1b2rk1/1pqnbppp/p2ppn2/5P2/3NP3/2N1BB2/PPP3PP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 11,"!? White spots the opportunity to win a pawn and fork Q and R if Black allows 12. fxe6 fxe6 13. Nxe6!  So this appears to force a careful response from Black.  I actually didn't think very long about my reply, though, as I spotted an attractive move to unclog my position, exploiting a newly available square."
22,Ne5,d7e5,r1b2rk1/1pq1bppp/p2ppn2/4nP2/3NP3/2N1BB2/PPP3PP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 1 12,"This frees up the Bc8 to defend e6 and simultaneously threatens to swap the N from White's Bf3, giving Black an advantage on the White squares."
23,fxe6,f5e6,r1b2rk1/1pq1bppp/p2pPn2/4n3/3NP3/2N1BB2/PPP3PP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 12,"The immediate recapture on e6 would have allowed White to avoid the swap, so I preferred to interpose this move.  The disadvantage of this sequence is that Black ends up with an awkward pawn formation of three islands of 2 and is faced with the threat that White will storm Black's position by exploiting the open f-file.  However, I felt that I could cope with that."
24,Nxf3+,e5f3,r1b2rk1/1pq1bppp/p2pPn2/8/3NP3/2N1Bn2/PPP3PP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 13,"The immediate recapture on e6 would have allowed White to avoid the swap, so I preferred to interpose this move.

25,Qxf3,d1f3,r1b2rk1/1pq1bppp/p2pPn2/8/3NP3/2N1BQ2/PPP3PP/R4RK1 b - - 0 13,White now also has options to play Qg3 followed by Bh6 if he so chooses.
26,fxe6,f7e6,r1b2rk1/1pq1b1pp/p2ppn2/8/3NP3/2N1BQ2/PPP3PP/R4RK1 w - - 0 14,"I preferred this recapture to the B recapture as I wanted to preserve the advantage of 2 bishops if at all possible.  Furthermore, the swap on f3 had been intended to create an advantage on White squares, dependent on keeping the B, which currently also supports the central pawn island."
27,Qe2,f3e2,r1b2rk1/1pq1b1pp/p2ppn2/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP1Q1PP/R4RK1 b - - 1 14,?!  Odd.  Not quite sure why he played this.
28,Bd7,c8d7,r4rk1/1pqbb1pp/p2ppn2/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP1Q1PP/R4RK1 w - - 2 15,Now I wanted to connect and possibly double my rooks as quickly as possible.
29,Rad1,a1d1,r4rk1/1pqbb1pp/p2ppn2/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP1Q1PP/3R1RK1 b - - 3 15,Standard developing move but White is not creating any immediarte threats or exploiting the weaknesses in Black's position.
30,Rf7,f8f7,r5k1/1pqbbrpp/p2ppn2/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP1Q1PP/3R1RK1 w - - 4 16,Preparing to double on the f-file in the hope of converting a perceived weakness into a strength.
31,Nf3,d4f3,r5k1/1pqbbrpp/p2ppn2/8/4P3/2N1BN2/PPP1Q1PP/3R1RK1 b - - 5 16,Threatening to attack the Rf7.  I can't now double because the Rf7 would be trapped after 16...Rf7 17. Ng5.
32,h6,h7h6,r5k1/1pqbbrp1/p2ppn1p/8/4P3/2N1BN2/PPP1Q1PP/3R1RK1 w - - 0 17,"Hence this defensive push that leaves a hole on g6.  If I'd been White, I would have rushed to exploit this with 17. Nh4."
33,Bd4,e3d4,r5k1/1pqbbrp1/p2ppn1p/8/3BP3/2N2N2/PPP1Q1PP/3R1RK1 b - - 1 17,But White clearly had other plans.  Maybe 16. Nf3 had been played with the objective of enabling this all along.  White now threatens to advance his isolated pawn and use e5 as a strongpoint from which to attack Black's line of pieces on his second rank.
