5,d5,d4d5,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/3Pp3/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"The second choice, leading to a completely different game from the Budapest I usually face (dxe, Ng4)."
6,Bb4+,f8b4,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/3Pp3/1bP5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"Black must be careful not to be squeezed in, so I get the B into the game with tempo, prepared to exchange it, even for a N, for developement tempos. In my experience, I kind of ""have to"" play this way, giving my B pair for castling and d6, if don't want to go for a slow and squeezed game as black. Not my style (not on blitz, anyway!)."
7,Bd2,c1d2,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/3Pp3/1bP5/8/PP1BPPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 2 4,Standard...
8,Qe7,d8e7,rnb1k2r/ppppqppp/5n2/3Pp3/1bP5/8/PP1BPPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 3 5,"Getting my pieces out. Now, if BxB, QxB+, white has to play Qe2, and black is fine after, say, a lot of possible moves including a5, QxQ+, or Qc5 (heading for Ng4)"
9,a3,a2a3,rnb1k2r/ppppqppp/5n2/3Pp3/1bP5/P7/1P1BPPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"Ok, you want the exchange, and I know that is nothing better than..."

12,e4,e5e4,rnb1k2r/ppppqppp/5n2/3P4/2P1p3/P7/1P1NPPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,"! Sorry for the undeserved exclamation, but this is important. White can't attack trice the pawn, defenden twice. Black has it easy to play d6-Bf5. f3 is not playable, or e3. The Ng can't go to c3. Black is not any bad, isn't he?"
13,e3,e2e3,rnb1k2r/ppppqppp/5n2/3P4/2P1p3/P3P3/1P1N1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 7,What else?

Not a real danger, but say Nd7, Qa4, o-o, b4, Nb6, Qa5... and maybe white has something to bother me for a while."

And I can castle, for sure. (secretely, I DON'T want to castle, here: I want to attack! My pawn in e5 has now the power to make f3 unthinkable for white, so a bit vulnerable. I have to exploit those weaknesses, this is all chess's about, after all! :-)"
