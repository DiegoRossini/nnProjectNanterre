1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,4. Bc4 - This is the King Bishop's Gambit arising out of the KGA.  Develops a piece and hits at f7.  Black can check on h4 here but this is not advisable.  Check out a game between Anderssen and Kiezeritzky where Kiezeritzky lost spectacularly.  I have seen that particular game in several regicide manuals but it could be found on the net.

Black now makes a lot of queen moves from move 7 onwards.  Had it been me, I would have done everything I could to shift that wood from the back row!  Mind you, after my KGA game against Master Chrisobee I have plenty of room to talk!"
