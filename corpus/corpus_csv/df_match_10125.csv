1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I opened this game with a fairly standard King's Gambit, which my opponent accepted.  I was unable to win back the pawn at any point in the game, which is unusual in my games, but I took as a mark of superior play on my opponent's part.  The game itself was somewhat unusual, but I do not intend to analyze the greater portion of it.  On move 33 I missed a possibility and was forced either to exchange Rooks - which I had been avoiding - or lose a tempo, which could have been crucial."

But in the meantime, White's isolated a-pawn is weak, and in combination with Black's King-side majority will probably lose the game.  White cannot keep at least one from Queening, and is forced to play for his own Queen.  Play might proceed: 35. ... Kb6 36. e4 Ka5 37. f5 Ka4 38. Kg6 g4! 39. Kxh6 gxf3 40. Kg7 f2 41. h6 f1=Q 42. h7 Qg2 .  Even if White can Queen the h-pawn, he will be forced to interpose and exchange, and Black can Queen his a-pawn with relative ease.  If instead 39. fxg4 f3, White is another move behind in Queening his pawn and there is no doubt whatsoever."
