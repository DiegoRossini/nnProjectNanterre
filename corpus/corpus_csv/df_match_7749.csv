1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Once again, a never-say-die attitude pays dividends :-)  My last game in the 2009 Championship.  When we started this game jklarl's rating was way higher than mine, so I started with the strategic 1. d4, as I feel that slower styled games give me a better chance against better players.  Crash bang wallop open games tend to end up with me being the walloped one."
