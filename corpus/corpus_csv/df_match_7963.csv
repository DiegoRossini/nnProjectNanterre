1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Yesterday an unrated game finished quite unexpectedly.  For the first 20 moves I seemed to be getting nowhere, my opponent seemed so safe but she suddenly left herself vulnerable at the back, just like a football team pressing forward for a goal and leaving the goalie on his own.  It then only needs one enemy footballer to press through and shoot at goal.  As you will see, a similar thing happens here."

Dmaestro, apastpawn and the Master Mater have all had success against me with it."

It will look quite fascinating I think.  Funnily enough I had a similar set up in this game against my buddy The Carpenter but I went on to win it! http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/material-imbalances-2-pieces-v-1-rook-pt-5?gm=24800"
