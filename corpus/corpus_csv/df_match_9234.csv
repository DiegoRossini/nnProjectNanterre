1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I joined this game as black and set some conditional moves just for the beginning. If 1. d4 then 1...Nf6  If 1.e4 then 1...c5. Pretty standard moves and my favorite replies. However I entered something incorrectly...
2,b5,b7b5,rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/8/1p6/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,?! Whoops! I came back to the game later and saw a '-1' next to it in my list and was very confused. After I realized what happened I decided to defend my heart out.

I need to stake my claim to the center but don't want to restrict my fianchettoed bishop, so 4...c5 seemed like a good move."
