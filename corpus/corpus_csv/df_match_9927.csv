1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The London System.  One of my standards from the white side.  A very versitle opening that tends to focus on solidifying the center and seeking out opprotunites to lauch flank attacks (at least the way I play it).  White still maintians the option of transposing to a queens gambit by playing c4 although the bishop will be misplaced for some QG variations and white should be very careful in making that decision.

I did state Saturday, after the tournament, that I'm begining to become frustrated with the sometimes stagnant and frankly uninspired games I've been getting out of this system lately.  I'm starting to favor sharper, more tactical opernings and that has reflected in my email chess paterns as I shift back and forth from 1d4 to 1e4"
