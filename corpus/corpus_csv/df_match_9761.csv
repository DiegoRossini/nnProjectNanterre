Now here's a lesson for you, just don't do what I do later on, exchange down to a king and pawn ending with the pawn structure as it is now.  As you will see, you will lose!  You will lose!  I got suckered into playing into the K & P ending because I have never been in a K & P ending with an Expert, 500 points north of my rating with material even before and I though I would be OK because my king was more centralised than my opponent's.  My opponent quashed this illusion and gave me a thorough lesson in how to exploit this type of K & P ending!"
