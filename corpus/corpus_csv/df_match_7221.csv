1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I'm more familiar with the Queen pawn but it's good to work on one's weaknesses
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,My ability with the Sicilian is very limited. I should probably try it more often.
3,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,I've only got a couple of games played with King's Pawn Gambit and I always declined in the past and things didn't work out so well!
4,exf4,e5f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Accepted
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,Development
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,I thought Nf6 would be bad because e5
7,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3PPp2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,White controls the center
8,d6,d7d6,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/8/3PPp2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,Trying to get my pieces out
9,Bxf4,c1f4,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/8/3PPB2/5N2/PPP3PP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,More development and control of center
10,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/8/3PPB2/5N2/PPP3PP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,Safe now
11,e5,e4e5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4P3/3P1B2/5N2/PPP3PP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,Or so I thought!
12,dxe5,d6e5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/4p3/3P1B2/5N2/PPP3PP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,I thought it was better to clean up the middle than continue to allow white dominance
13,Nxe5,f3e5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/4N3/3P1B2/8/PPP3PP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,Keeps the Bishop
14,Qxd4,d8d4,r1b1kb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/4N3/3q1B2/8/PPP3PP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,I thought this was better than Nxe5 with the center cleared. A trade of Queens leaves us with even development
15,Nd3,e5d3,r1b1kb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/8/3q1B2/3N4/PPP3PP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 8,Perhaps Nxc6 is better doubling my pawns but also losing the right to castle after 8. ... Qxd8 9. Kxd8
16,Qe4+,d4e4,r1b1kb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/8/4qB2/3N4/PPP3PP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 2 9,I really want to trade queens
17,Be2,f1e2,r1b1kb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/8/4qB2/3N4/PPP1B1PP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 3 9,Now comes the crucial point of the game. If I immediately 9. ... Qxg2 it is followed by 10. Bf3 and eventually Qe2+
18,Bg4,c8g4,r3kb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/8/4qBb1/3N4/PPP1B1PP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 4 10,My thinking was to pin the white light squared Bishop in place preventing Qe2+
19,Nd2,b1d2,r3kb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/8/4qBb1/3N4/PPPNB1PP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 5 10,Driving my queen off
20,Qxg2,e4g2,r3kb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/8/5Bb1/3N4/PPPNB1qP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 11,I expected 11. Rf1 thus giving me time to Queen side castle.
