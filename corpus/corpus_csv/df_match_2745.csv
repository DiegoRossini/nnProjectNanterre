But I was worried that White plays Bh6 at some point and I wanted to be able to play Bf8 for defence, and possibly Ne8 if necessary. However, especially with opposite side castling, concrete lines are more important than vague ideas."

I was calculating what happens after White plays 14. e5. Then White can play Bxb7 in many lines attacking the rook and basically forcing the recapture with the queen. I did not like the queen on b7. Now the rook can capture the bishop. But the other side of the coin is that the rooks are not easily connected, which leaves the d8-rook a little vulnerable, and the b5-square is an obvious square for a knight fork, if White can make it work tactically."

33,Bxf6,g5f6,1n1r2k1/rbq1bppp/p3pB2/4P3/3N4/2p2BQ1/PPP3PP/1K1RR3 b - - 0 17,"Ok, White takes with the bishop and not with the pawn. After 17. exf6 I had planned 17...Qxg3 simplifying into an endgame, where Black has better pawn structure."
34,Bxf6,e7f6,1n1r2k1/rbq2ppp/p3pb2/4P3/3N4/2p2BQ1/PPP3PP/1K1RR3 w - - 0 18,"This is a mistake, although at that point it seemed like a logical choice, because I still expected 18. exf6 Qxg3 19. hxg3 and a nice endgame."
35,Nb5,d4b5,1n1r2k1/rbq2ppp/p3pb2/1N2P3/8/2p2BQ1/PPP3PP/1K1RR3 b - - 1 18,"This is the blow that ends the game. I just stared at the board for a while, and slowly I began to see that I was completely lost. White did not take back the piece, but offers an other one. But 18...axb5 19. exf6 threatening both the queen and a checkmate on g7 wins, because 19...Qxg3 is followed by 20. Rxd8#. A counter-threat like 17...Qb6 is just not enough: 18. exf6 g6 19. Rxd8+ Qxd8 20. Nxa7 and White can probably even save the knight, because the knight on b8 is only protected by the queen. I did not like losing a rook, so I decided to give White a chance to go wrong."
