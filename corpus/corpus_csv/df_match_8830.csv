1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,My first rated challenge game with cyko. We played fast and loose in a previous unrated game.  A bit tighter here but still entertaining.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I rarely deviate from the Sicilian, which nearly always makes for an exciting game."
3,c3,c2c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"This option is one of White's least exciting responses!  It is a good way of avoiding the most bookish lines, though, so very popular on Gameknot."
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"I've not been too successful recently with the most direct response, 2...d5, so I decided to adopt a more cautious approach.  This move helps develop my KB and prepares ...d5 as a more conservative move, while retaining the option of ...d6"
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"White by-passes the pawn, setting up a strong central pawn."
6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2pp4/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"White by-passes the pawn, setting up a strong central pawn."
7,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/8/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"White by-passes the pawn, setting up a strong central pawn."
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2ppP3/8/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"which I immediately attack, while developing the QN to its best square.  This move often provokes Bb5, when I like it if White swaps the B for the N, leaving me with the bishop pair.  I sometimes have trouble deciding how best to retake though."
9,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/1BppP3/8/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 5,as predicted
10,Bd7,c8d7,r2qkbnr/pp1b1ppp/2n1p3/1BppP3/8/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 3 6,"relieving the pin and developing another piece.  In this position, compared with other Bb5 lines, White cannot crank up the attack on the pinned pieces with Ne5 because of his pawn on e5"
11,d4,d2d4,r2qkbnr/pp1b1ppp/2n1p3/1BppP3/3P4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,completing the pawn chain
12,a6,a7a6,r2qkbnr/1p1b1ppp/p1n1p3/1BppP3/3P4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,asking the bishop the question
13,Ba4,b5a4,r2qkbnr/1p1b1ppp/p1n1p3/2ppP3/B2P4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,"as in the non-Exchange versions of the Spanish, White preserves his B by retreating it.  This loses a couple of tempi while Black completes his queenside development but the B retains its power for later."
14,b5,b7b5,r2qkbnr/3b1ppp/p1n1p3/1pppP3/B2P4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"With White's pawn on e5, Black can't develop his kingside completely normally.  ...Nf6 just loses the N; ...Nh6 allows White to swap on h6, giving him awkward doubled rook's pawns.  Developing the B first gives Black's N nowhere to develop.  Fianchettoing the B leaves weak dark squares everywhere on the kingside, while the B bites on granite.  So the plan is ....Nge7-g6 followed by ...Be7 and kingside castling, and continuing expansion on the queenside, though I have to be careful about White's Bs which control the diagonals b1-h7 and c1-h6 and a lightning strike by White's Q and Ns on my kingside."

By developing the B first, White seizes the initiative against Black's queenside and avoids hemming in his B with his N, which cannot develop to c3 because of White's pawn already there.  If Black takes on d4, then after the pawn retakes, his N can develop to c3 after all."
