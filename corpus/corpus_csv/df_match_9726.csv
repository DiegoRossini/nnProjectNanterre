1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I think that i'll call this game Discovered attack madness.  I had allot of fun with this game because i usually dont get to be so creative with my games.  I have noticed that they have been real strait forward lately and with this game it was very fun.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,2. Qh5 made me think right away that one either he doesnt know what he is doing or two he thinks that i'm a chump.  I lost almost 200 points in one week because of time outs so with this game i was bellow 1100.  1336 being my highest rating so far.
