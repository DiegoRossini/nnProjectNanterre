1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"A few days ago, I started a mini-tournament, in which all games start with the King's Indian Defence: Four Pawns Attack. All participants have to annotate at least 2 of their finished games, and ideally I would like all completed games to be annotated by mini-tournament. Incidentally, there is still one slot open in this 11-player mini-tournament, so if anyone wants to enter, could you please contact me - particularly if you are rated between 1600 and 1900, as there are no players so far within this rating range. The mini-tournament table can be viewed here: http://gameknot.com/mt.pl?id=41731"

White has taken advantage of Black's hypermodern play - Black has not yet committed to a central formation - and grabbed a large share of the centre, in exchange for a very slight advantage in development for Black.

I personally am hoping to play above my rating in this tournament, since I have done quite a lot of preparation on the 4PA! I am also hoping to gain valuable experience of this sharp opening in this tournament."

The other option is 10.e5, and after 10...dxe5 11.fxe5 my consolation is that the position is similar to that reached after 9...Re8 10.e5 dxe5 11.fxe5, which contains some known drawing variations."
