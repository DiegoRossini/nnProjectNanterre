17,b3,b2b3,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/1n4p1/2p5/2PP4/1PN1BN1P/P4PP1/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 9,"9. b3.  For the first 8 moves I have been following the database but I accepted these moves because they do have a clear purpose.  The database is very thin, in fact there is only one illustrative game with this move in the 1500  database and not in the 1900s.  It suggests I take on c6 but after doing an analyse the board I find that my pawn structure will be broken up.  I therefore decide to give my c pawn pawn backup."
