1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,White begins with the Reti opening.
2,a6,a7a6,rnbqkbnr/1ppppppp/p7/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,"A very unorthodox move for black.  I suppose he is just toying with me, or perhaps he is providing a handicap in order to give me a chance.  I am sure there is a name for this defense but I don't know what it is.  The GameKnot database says that there have only been 83 people in the history of the universe that have ever used this response to the Reti."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/1ppppppp/p7/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,White pushes the d pawn rather than the c which means that we are no longer following Reti.  I was spooked away from pushing the c because I thought my opponent had something up his sleeve.
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p3p3/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,Black opens the diagonals for the Queen and Bishop.  This strikes me as a conservative move.  Not showing any aggression here.
5,Bf4,c1f4,rnbqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p3p3/8/3P1B2/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,Developing a Bishop.
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p3pn2/8/3P1B2/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,Developing a Knight.
7,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p3pn2/8/2PP1B2/5N2/PP2PPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,I push the c pawn which discorages the black d pawn from coming forward and it also opens a diagonal for my Queen.
8,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/1pppbppp/p3pn2/8/2PP1B2/5N2/PP2PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,Another conservative move for black.  This allows him to castle on the next move if he desires to do so.
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk2r/1pppbppp/p3pn2/8/2PP1B2/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,Developing my other horse.
10,d5,d7d5,rnbqk2r/1pp1bppp/p3pn2/3p4/2PP1B2/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,Here comes that d pawn that I was expecting.  The black d pawn is protected in 3 ways.
11,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqk2r/1pp1bppp/p3pn2/3P4/3P1B2/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"I decide to swap pawns.  The experts say that center pawns are worth more than the others, so if I can take a d pawn with a c pawn then it seems like a good idea to me."
12,Nxd5,f6d5,rnbqk2r/1pp1bppp/p3p3/3n4/3P1B2/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,Black evens up the score using his horse.  This threatens the unprotected white Bishop which perhaps should never have been placed there to begin with.
13,Bd2,f4d2,rnbqk2r/1pp1bppp/p3p3/3n4/3P4/2N2N2/PP1BPPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 7,The white Bishop tucks his tail and retreats whilst giving a little more support to the white Knight.
14,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/1pp1bppp/p3p3/3n4/3P4/2N2N2/PP1BPPPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 2 8,Black castles.  Another solid conservative move.
15,e4,e2e4,rnbq1rk1/1pp1bppp/p3p3/3n4/3PP3/2N2N2/PP1B1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 8,"White now has a pawn on e4 and d4 supported by Knights on c3 and f3.  In all the books I have read, this is a really good thing for white.  This is the classic center-controlling set up that people drool over.  I am feeling really good at this point."
16,Nxc3,d5c3,rnbq1rk1/1pp1bppp/p3p3/8/3PP3/2n2N2/PP1B1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 9,Black decides to swap Knights.  This negates my protection on e4.
17,bxc3,b2c3,rnbq1rk1/1pp1bppp/p3p3/8/3PP3/2P2N2/P2B1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 9,White evens the score.  I opted to take the Knight with the b pawn instead of the Bishop.  In my opinion its a good idea to support your center pawns with other pawns rather than with pieces.  This gives my Bishop a chance to do other things rather than to babysit with pawns.
18,c5,c7c5,rnbq1rk1/1p2bppp/p3p3/2p5/3PP3/2P2N2/P2B1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 10,Black attacks my precious center pawns which I was so proud of.  Looks like they won't stay there for long.
19,Rb1,a1b1,rnbq1rk1/1p2bppp/p3p3/2p5/3PP3/2P2N2/P2B1PPP/1R1QKB1R b K - 1 10,"White ignores the pawn threat because the d pawn is so nicely protected by the c pawn.  White decides to take control of that empty b file.  In the books that I have read, it says that controlling territory is a good thing."
20,Nc6,b8c6,r1bq1rk1/1p2bppp/p1n1p3/2p5/3PP3/2P2N2/P2B1PPP/1R1QKB1R w K - 2 11,Black piles more threats on d4 and develops a Knight in the ordinary fashion.
