1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,My customary 1. e4 opening.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The Ruy Lopez is my default play in this sequence.  Though I admit my knowledge of its theory is a little weak, I've played it a number of times.  It tends to produce a ragged queenside pawn structure at this level which helps to compensate for the tempi White loses while his bishop is hunted by Black pawns.  It usually ends up on b3, which isn't a bad spot for it anyway."

6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,The Berlin Defence.  It has a solid reputation.
7,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1B2p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 5 4,"The game transposes to the Four Knights Game. 4. d3 or 4. d4 are also options here, as is 4. 0-0, but I feel that 4. Nc3 is equally as useful at this point."
8,a6,a7a6,r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/1B2p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,Black moves to drive the White bishop away.
9,Ba4,b5a4,r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/4p3/B3P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,"Attacks the knight, and although the pawn is far extended it isn't necessarily over-ambitious."
10,b5,b7b5,r1bqkb1r/2pp1ppp/p1n2n2/1p2p3/B3P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"Attacks the knight, and although the pawn is far extended it isn't necessarily over-ambitious."

12,b4,b5b4,r1bqkb1r/2pp1ppp/p1n2n2/4p3/1p2P3/1BN2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"Attacks the knight, and although the pawn is far extended it isn't necessarily over-ambitious."
13,Nd5,c3d5,r1bqkb1r/2pp1ppp/p1n2n2/3Np3/1p2P3/1B3N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,"However, the white knight is reasonably comfortable here for the time being.  He may not stay that way long, however, if Black opts to develop the queenside pawns."
14,Nxe4,f6e4,r1bqkb1r/2pp1ppp/p1n5/3Np3/1p2n3/1B3N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"Black's attacks have won him a pawn, but at the same time his developent is slowed down and only going to get worse."
15,d3,d2d3,r1bqkb1r/2pp1ppp/p1n5/3Np3/1p2n3/1B1P1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,"Another attack on White's bishop, who can find no peace.  Perhaps he should have become a monk instead."
16,Nc5,e4c5,r1bqkb1r/2pp1ppp/p1n5/2nNp3/1p6/1B1P1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 9,"Another attack on White's bishop, who can find no peace.  Perhaps he should have become a monk instead."
17,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkb1r/2pp1ppp/p1n5/2nNp3/1p6/1B1P1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 2 9,"The bishop is basically stuck.  Bc4 Na5 and White is in much the same position, facing a trade that leaves his pawns doubled, and so gives up on the bishop in favour of protecting his king."
18,Nxb3,c5b3,r1bqkb1r/2pp1ppp/p1n5/3Np3/1p6/1n1P1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 10,"Appears to be setting up attacks on both the knights, especially the hard to defend (thanks to the b4 pawn and en passant) d5 knight."
19,axb3,a2b3,r1bqkb1r/2pp1ppp/p1n5/3Np3/1p6/1P1P1N2/1PP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 10,"Appears to be setting up attacks on both the knights, especially the hard to defend (thanks to the b4 pawn and en passant) d5 knight."

Perhaps threatening the pawn in case the c6 knight moves to allow the Black lsb to attack, perhaps threatening to play Qe1 and kick off a fight on b4 before Black wants it.  It's tough to find a good home for this bishop here (a fianchetto would have been nice, given the opportunity).  Perhaps Re1 or Qe1 then Bf4 would be better."
22,a5,a6a5,r2qkb1r/1bpp1ppp/2n5/p2Np3/1p6/1P1P1N2/1PPB1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 12,Supports the endangered pawn.
23,Qe2,d1e2,r2qkb1r/1bpp1ppp/2n5/p2Np3/1p6/1P1P1N2/1PPBQPPP/R4RK1 b kq - 1 12,"Brings the queen into the fight, and that lonely pawn needs friends soon.  e2 over e1 as it allows a rook to develop.  e2 also might allow something else, if White spots the danger."
24,d6,d7d6,r2qkb1r/1bp2ppp/2np4/p2Np3/1p6/1P1P1N2/1PPBQPPP/R4RK1 w kq - 0 13,The pawn gets a friend.
25,d4,d3d4,r2qkb1r/1bp2ppp/2np4/p2Np3/1p1P4/1P3N2/1PPBQPPP/R4RK1 b kq - 0 13,The e5 pawn is of course pinned by the queen.
26,Ba6,b7a6,r2qkb1r/2p2ppp/b1np4/p2Np3/1p1P4/1P3N2/1PPBQPPP/R4RK1 w kq - 1 14,A skewer.  White must sacrifice a rook for his queen.
27,Qe3,e2e3,r2qkb1r/2p2ppp/b1np4/p2Np3/1p1P4/1P2QN2/1PPB1PPP/R4RK1 b kq - 2 14,"Black is trying, I think, to build a strong pawn centre."

32,Ne7,c6e7,r2qkb1r/2p1n1pp/3p1p2/p2Np3/1p1P4/1P1Q1N2/1PPB1PPP/5RK1 w kq - 2 17,"White now threatens Nxc7+ with more danger for black.  White's threats are coming one at a time.  Ideally, he would like to build more danger up before unleashing multiple threats at once, but he has very low piece activity here: his f3 knight would need to go via h4 to get anywhere and even then he wouldn't be able to do a lot unless the black knight is moved or removed.  Black's pawns dominate White's bishop and White's remaining rook is in a very defensive position.  Although Black has limited activity himself, he looks defensively sound.  Overall, to me, the position looks quite drawish, though of course at this level either side could blunder easily."
