The inherent problem with the Dutch Defense is the early weakening of the kingside with 1...f5.

If 9...Bxe5?, then 10.Qh5 ! (zwischenzug) and White recovers the piece with a centralized Queen and a better position, since Black is forced to give up castling or weaken his kingside with 10...g6.

Also weak is 9...Bxe4? 10.Bxe4 where Black has parted with his fianchettoed Bishop along with his light squares.  The Rook on a8 is attacked, making 10...d5 absolutely forced.  Other blocking moves are worse; 10...c6 is inadequate in light of 11.Qd3 g6 12.h4! (12...Bxh4?? 13.Bxg6 ! is crushing); and of course not 10...Nc6?? 11.Nxc6 dc 12.Bxc6  and White wins.

Here White is threatening 11.Ng5 h6 12.Bh7  Kh8 13.Ng6# which is veiled by a secondary and rather basic threat of 11.Nxf6  Rxf6 12.Qxh7  followed by total annihilation of the kingside and a winning material advantage.
20,Qe7,d8e7,rn3rk1/pbppq1pp/1p2pb2/4N2Q/3PN3/3B4/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 6 11,"The game-losing blunder, but one could hardly blame Thomas for missing this one in blitz!  10...Bxe5, giving up the Bishop Pair to remove White's monster Knight on e5, is pretty much forced.  Now in this position, after the text move (10...Qe7??) and the supposed 11.Nxf6  gxf6 (not 11...Rxf6?? 12.Qxh7  Kf8 13.Qh8#) the Black Queen covers h7.

I actually had the rare privilege of playing this same game against a computer on the Internet Chess Club.  The crazy thing was the computer, rated around 2100, fell victim to the ""horizon effect"", a well-known phenomenon where a chess engine cannot ""see"" the final mate position because it simply cannot calculate far enough into the position (beyond its horizon).  In this position, the engine probably calculated 6 moves ahead and assessed that Black is ""safe"" after 10...Qe7, since h7 is guarded and there is no way to force mate in 6.  But there IS a way to force mate in 7, if you look beyond the horizon!  Drum roll..."
