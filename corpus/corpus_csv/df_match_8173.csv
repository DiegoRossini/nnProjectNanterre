19,Re1,f1e1,r1bq1rk1/2p2pp1/p1np1n1p/1pb1p3/4P2N/1BNP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - - 3 10,the losing move.  it was perhaps best for the horse to beat a retreat with 10 Nf3 though after 10 ... Bg4 stands well.
20,Ng4,f6g4,r1bq1rk1/2p2pp1/p1np3p/1pb1p3/4P1nN/1BNP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 4 11,winning material

28,Be6,c8e6,r2q1rk1/2p2pp1/p1npb2p/1pb1p3/4P3/1BN2N2/PPP3PP/R1B1Q2K w - - 1 15,this is good by white.  this could have made black work a bit since there is always the possible Bxh6 hanging over black

33,Bd2,c1d2,r4rk1/2p3p1/p1nppq1p/1pb1p3/4P3/2N2NQ1/PPPB2PP/R6K b - - 3 17,"this is good, stealing a pawn since 18 Rc1 drops the exchange to 18 ... b4"
