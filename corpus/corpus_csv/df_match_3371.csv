6,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 4 4,"A good developing move.  Equally good is 3...Nf6: the Four Knights Opening, if White plays 4.Bb5; the Giuoco Pianissimo or Two Knight's defence if 4.Bc4.  Here White can transpose into the Giuoco Pianissimo if she plays 4.Bc4..."
7,a3,a2a3,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/4P3/P1N2N2/1PPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"[4.a3?!]  Given that Black has already decided to place his Bishop on c5, this move is probably less good than moving her own Light Square Bishop (LSB) to c4 or b5.  White could be aiming for an eventual strike at the bishop on c5, but whilst preparing this, Black can make better use of her time.  I've given the move a 'dubious' mark (?!) rather than a 'mistake' (?), as it is playable enough, and doesn't seriously compromise White's game."

It might be objected, though, that as the situation stands, White can pick up Black's e-pawn into the bargain.  That is certainly what White thought..."

14,Be6,c8e6,r2q1rk1/ppp2ppp/2p1bn2/2b1N3/4P3/P1N5/1PPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 1 8,"[...Be6?]  Not Black's best response to White's raid.  There were two ways Black could have gone about visiting his retribution upon White: [A]: 7...Re8!?  8.f4 ... and now comes the really juicy bit: 8... Nxe4!! 9.Nxe4 Rxe5!!  10.fxe5 ... Black is a whole rook down, for what?  This is for what:  10...Qh4ch (Everyone has seen this sort of attack before!)  11.Kf1 (11.Ng3 Bg4!) ...Qxe4  12.Qe2 Qxc2.  At this point, though still the exchange down, Black's superior mobility should ensure that he keeps White bailed up for a long time to come.  But that isn't even the best line!  Try this [B]:  7...Qd4!  This move attacks the Knight at e5, and the f2-square (...Qxf2#) simultaneously.  How can White defend?  There is but one way to save both: 8.Nd3! Nxe4  9.Ne2! Qf6!  10.f3! ... This weakening move is just about forced, so heavy is the pressure against f2; 10...Qh4ch  11.Kf1 Rd8 (Threatening to take out the remaining defence of f2)  12.Qe1 Qf6  13.Nxc5 Nxc5.  At this point, although White has successfully repulsed Black's heavy attack, Black has got his pawn back, and retains the more mobile position.  Exciting stuff, eh?"
15,Qf3,d1f3,r2q1rk1/ppp2ppp/2p1bn2/2b1N3/4P3/P1N2Q2/1PPP1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 2 8,"[8.Qf3!?]  Probably OK, though if for any reason the e5-Knight has to retreat, d3 is where it will have to go.  That's safe enough but could be inconvenient if White wants to advance her d-pawn and develop her Queen's Bishop along the c1-h6 diagonal."

17,Nd3,e5d3,r4rk1/ppp2ppp/2p1bn2/2b5/3qP3/P1NN1Q2/1PPP1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 4 9,"[...Rad8?]  Desirable though this development is, Black had a bit of tidying up to do first.  Unhandy as the d3-square is for the Knight standing on it, Black ought to have deprived White of a cheap means of rectifying the situation.  White could now have played 10.Nxc5 Qxc5  11.d3 (rubbing it in) with a fine game, having kept hold of her stolen pawn.   So a better move than the text would have been 9...Bb6."

Although after 10.e5 Nd7  11.Nxc5 Qxc5 White sorts out the situation on the d-file, Black will be able to win back the e-pawn and re-establish material equality, with about a level game."

21,Ne4,c3e4,3r1rk1/ppp2ppp/2p1b3/2b1P3/3qN1n1/P2N1Q2/1PPP1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 2 11,"[11.Ne4?!]  Plausible looking, but Black now picks up the e-pawn with extreme prejudice..."

Quite why White thought she could get away with Black playing 12...Nxf3ch, I can't imagine.  But even after White's best try, 12.Nxe5, Black would have come out with the better chances: 12.Nxe5 Qxe5 (it appears that 12...Bd5! would have been equally strong) 13.0-0 Bd5.  The pin against the Knight at e4 would have been a real bone in the throat for White."

25,Nxe5,d3e5,3r1rk1/ppp2ppp/2p5/2N1N3/3q2b1/P4Q2/1PPP1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 0 13,"[13.Nxe5??]  There must be something going wrong with White's calculations.  Instead of this, 13.Qg3 would have kept White in the game, and, better yet, 13.Qe3 would have put White on top!  Here's the plot:  13.Qe3!! Nxd3ch  14.cxd3!! ... (This is the key to White's defence.  She can now hold out) 14...Rfe8  15.Ne4 f5 (The raging attack is still coming in, but White can now step out from behind her shield wall with an infantry advance on the right flank:)  16.h3! Bh4  17.g4 fxe4  (17...Bg6  18.gxf5 and the pin at e4 loses most of its effect)  18.Qxd4 Rxd4  19.gxh5 exd3ch 20.Kf1.  Under siege for so long, White emerges ahead a Bishop for 2 Pawns.  Once she mobilizes her reserves, Black will have a fight on his hands simply to hold a draw."
