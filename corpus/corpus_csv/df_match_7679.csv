12,Bc5,f8c5,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/8/2bP4/4nP2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 7,If c6 then white plays Nbd2 trades pieces and gives the pawn back in exchange for a strong initiative. If Bf5 or another wasteful move then I'll grab the a7-g1 diagonal with Be3.
13,Qe2,d1e2,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/8/2bP4/4nP2/5N2/PPP1Q1PP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 3 7,Why not Bf2+ ? Well after Kd1 Qxd5 Nfd2 and white is going pile pieces onto the fixed knight probobaly winning a pawn and maybe some kind of Qh5+ Ideas as f5 is pretty forced.
14,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qk2r/ppp2ppp/8/2bP1b2/4nP2/5N2/PPP1Q1PP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 4 8,Why not Bf2+ ? Well after Kd1 Qxd5 Nfd2 and white is going pile pieces onto the fixed knight probobaly winning a pawn and maybe some kind of Qh5+ Ideas as f5 is pretty forced.
15,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qk2r/ppp2ppp/8/2bP1b2/4nP2/2N2N2/PPP1Q1PP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 5 8,"Still all theory, at this point black has a choice of 2 directions to go, NxNc3 which allows Bxc5 Nxe2 Bxe7 Nxf4 Ba3 and white will be a pawn down but have the bishop pair and a lead in development. I was very happy to go into this if my opponent allowed it."
16,Qe7,d8e7,rn2k2r/ppp1qppp/8/2bP1b2/4nP2/2N2N2/PPP1Q1PP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 6 9,"Still all theory, at this point black has a choice of 2 directions to go, NxNc3 which allows Bxc5 Nxe2 Bxe7 Nxf4 Ba3 and white will be a pawn down but have the bishop pair and a lead in development.

19,Qxe3,e2e3,rn2k2r/ppp1qppp/8/3P1b2/4nP2/2N1QN2/PPP3PP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 10,"This is the Critical position to analayze and one in which I was extremely happy to find myself in as It allowed me to play it out rather than the ""This is according to the players who are far better than I'll ever be... a win for white"". As it turns out it is a rather easy position to play with white and it kind of plays itself.

Black is a pawn down, he will regain this pawn its inevitable. However he will lose at least a move in doing so. If we can couple this with the weak position of his king black is starting to look rather shaky. White is going to exploit it and the bishop to speed up his position to allow him time to grab space on the kingside."

24,Bxc2,f5c2,rn5r/ppp1kppp/8/3P4/5P2/2P2N2/P1b3PP/R3KB1R w KQ - 0 13,Alternative is Bd4 Ng5 and after Bxd5 white plays 0-0-0 with tempi the black king is going to be abused.
25,Kd2,e1d2,rn5r/ppp1kppp/8/3P4/5P2/2P2N2/P1bK2PP/R4B1R b - - 1 13,Kick the bishop freeing up the e file for the rook.

35,h4,h2h4,rn1r4/ppp2pp1/5kbp/3PR3/3N1PPP/2P5/P2K4/5B1R b - - 0 18,Rather than Bd2 as this allows me to take the knight in some lines if he tries Nd7 to kick my rook.
