1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"In this game I was holding DJ for most of the game. Then my greed gets the better of me, I take a poisoned pawn and it is quickly lost."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,So I play my usual Sicilian
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,He plays the usual
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,and I follow the main line
5,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 3,What is this? is he intending a closed variation after all?
6,d6,d7d6,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,I wait and see
7,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/2p5/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,He opts for the open variation
8,cxd4,c5d4,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/8/3pP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,I take
9,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,He takes back
10,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,And we reach the usual position
11,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/1B6/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 6,"This is slightly unusual, Bg5, Bc4 and Be2 are more common"
12,Bd7,c8d7,r2qkb1r/pp1bpppp/2np1n2/1B6/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 3 7,I have to defend my knight

14,g6,g7g6,r2qkb1r/pp1bpp1p/2np1np1/1B6/3NP3/2N4P/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"As he has avoided the sharpest variations such as the Yugoslav attack, I may as well fianchetto my bf8"
15,Be3,c1e3,r2qkb1r/pp1bpp1p/2np1np1/1B6/3NP3/2N1B2P/PPP2PP1/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 8,He develops

18,O-O,e8g8,r2q1rk1/pp1bppbp/2np1np1/1B6/3NP3/2N1B2P/PPP2PP1/R2Q1RK1 w - - 4 10,So do I
19,Nf3,d4f3,r2q1rk1/pp1bppbp/2np1np1/1B6/4P3/2N1BN1P/PPP2PP1/R2Q1RK1 b - - 5 10,"I am not sure why he played this either, he seems to be going backwards. This position has been reached before, but there is no games with Nf3 on the Gameknot World Database, but there is on the database of Gameknot games."
20,a6,a7a6,r2q1rk1/1p1bppbp/p1np1np1/1B6/4P3/2N1BN1P/PPP2PP1/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 11,a6 is often a move played in the Open Sicilian. Here I can play it with tempo.
