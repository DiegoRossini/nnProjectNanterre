7,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3P4/5p2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,A beginer mistake. It was better to play Nf6 and after Bb5  c6! or Bc4 Nxd5 0-0
8,Qxd5,d8d5,rnb1kbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3q4/5p2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,A beginer mistake. It was better to play Nf6 and after Bb5  c6! or Bc4 Nxd5 0-0

10,Qe6+,d5e6,rnb1kbnr/ppp2ppp/4q3/8/5p2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,Kf2! was a stronger move with a dangerous threat Bb5  followed by Re1 loosing the queen. Still white can exchange the queens with good lead in development

12,Bd6,f8d6,rnb1k1nr/ppp2ppp/3bq3/8/5p2/2N2N2/PPPPQ1PP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 4 7,A natural developing move and defending the f4 pawn.If pawn on f4 will be protected well whites game will be harder but it was proven that defending this pawn gives black another trouble
13,Nb5,c3b5,rnb1k1nr/ppp2ppp/3bq3/1N6/5p2/5N2/PPPPQ1PP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 5 7,good move!I liked this move very much.White threat is unstoppble to win the f4 pawn
