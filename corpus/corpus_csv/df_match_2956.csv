1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Another game from my French Defence mini tournament. I decided to annotate this one as I felt I played a lot better than I have in many games recently, I'd be interested to see if others agree or not with some of my move choices. 

Analysis is available - http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=19076547&rnd=0.6846651595551521

In this game the white bishops proved to be a powerful force to be reckoned with.

Interestingly, so far in the tournament I have won more games as white than black"
