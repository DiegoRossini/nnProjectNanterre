1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,A recent trend for me: I have played Maroczy bind positions against 1. c4 for a while but have never really played 1...c5. I like Maroczy bind positions but don't really know any theory although I seem to have a good feel for the positions so I'm not sure it matters.

3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Designed to avoid the Rossolimo variation of which I know nothing.
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,Designed to avoid the Rossolimo variation of which I know nothing.
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,3. c3!? was also possible giving rise to an alapin position-type.
6,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,4. Qxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 is the critical line according to Casten and Heine Neilson's book on the Accelerated Dragon.
7,Nxd4,f3d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,4. Qxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 is the critical line according to Casten and Heine Neilson's book on the Accelerated Dragon.
8,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk1nr/pp1pppbp/6p1/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"5.c4 is of course, the Maroczy Bind. The move played is more combative."
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk1nr/pp1pppbp/6p1/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,"5.c4 is of course, the Maroczy Bind. The move played is more combative."
10,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 3 6,7. Be2 O-O 8. O-O d5! 9. ed Nxd5 10. Nxd5 Qxd5! is an interesting pawn sacrifice.
11,Be3,c1e3,r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 4 6,7. Be2 O-O 8. O-O d5! 9. ed Nxd5 10. Nxd5 Qxd5! is an interesting pawn sacrifice.
12,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/pp1pppbp/2n2np1/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 5 7,7. Be2 O-O 8. O-O d5! 9. ed Nxd5 10. Nxd5 Qxd5! is an interesting pawn sacrifice.
13,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqk2r/pp1pppbp/2n2np1/8/2BNP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 6 7,7. Be2 O-O 8. O-O d5! 9. ed Nxd5 10. Nxd5 Qxd5! is an interesting pawn sacrifice.
14,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp1pppbp/2n2np1/8/2BNP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 7 8,7...Qa5 is the other main move which is not nearly as passive as some sources claim.
15,Bb3,c4b3,r1bq1rk1/pp1pppbp/2n2np1/8/3NP3/1BN1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 8 8,8.f3? Qb6! is a trap Fischer once fell into. 8...d5!? is also worth a look.
16,a5,a7a5,r1bq1rk1/1p1pppbp/2n2np1/p7/3NP3/1BN1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 9,"Aiming to swap the a-pawn for the e-pawn. The threat of ...a5-a4-a3 with pressure on the queenside dark squares is a major strategic theme in this line, as is dark-square counterplay in all variations of the accelerated dragon. 8...d6 9. f3 Bd7 and now 10.h4!? (10. Qd2 is a full-blown Dragon) is a sharp alternative to the Dragon main lines."
17,f3,f2f3,r1bq1rk1/1p1pppbp/2n2np1/p7/3NP3/1BN1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 9,9.a4 Ng4 is a drawish variation. 9.O-O!? a4 10. Nxa4 Nxe4 is murky and is what I'd least like to face as Black.
18,d5,d7d5,r1bq1rk1/1p2ppbp/2n2np1/p2p4/3NP3/1BN1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 10,The only consistent move - Black generally aims to get this in without the need for a preliminary ...d7-d6.
19,Bxd5,b3d5,r1bq1rk1/1p2ppbp/2n2np1/p2B4/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 10,"10. exd5 Nb4 11. Nde2 a4 12. Nxa4 Bf5 or 12...e6 are supposed to be fine for Black, but things are sharper than at first glance. Interesting is how many unfashionable lines there are with possibilities here."
20,Nxd5,f6d5,r1bq1rk1/1p2ppbp/2n3p1/p2n4/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 11,Simultaneously aiming at c2 and d5.
21,exd5,e4d5,r1bq1rk1/1p2ppbp/2n3p1/p2P4/3N4/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 11,Simultaneously aiming at c2 and d5.

26,b5,b7b5,r2q1rk1/4ppbp/6p1/pp1P1b2/1n6/2N1BP2/PPP1N1PP/2RQK2R w K - 0 14,Black gets his queen-side counterplay going.

28,Nxc2+,b4c2,r2q1rk1/4ppbp/6p1/pp1P1b2/8/P1N1BP2/1Pn1N1PP/2RQK2R w K - 0 15,"Noteworthy is how fast the queen-side pawns have moved down the board and how potentially threatening the dark-squared bishop on g7 is in tandem with them. If black gets time to activate his rooks, white will be in trouble."
29,Rxc2,c1c2,r2q1rk1/4ppbp/6p1/pp1P1b2/8/P1N1BP2/1PR1N1PP/3QK2R b K - 0 15,"Noteworthy is how fast the queen-side pawns have moved down the board and how potentially threatening the dark-squared bishop on g7 is in tandem with them.

33,Nb5,c3b5,r2q1rk1/4ppbp/6p1/pN1P4/1p6/P3BP2/1PQ1N1PP/4K2R b K - 1 17,? This has a nasty flaw as is subsequently demonstrated 17. Na4 Qxd5 18. Nb6 Qe6 and now 19. Kf2 (19. Nxa8 Qxe3 20. Nc7 and either 20...Bd4!? or 20...Rc8 give Black ample compensation) 19...Rab8 is a balanced endgame where both sides must be very careful.
34,Qxd5,d8d5,r4rk1/4ppbp/6p1/pN1q4/1p6/P3BP2/1PQ1N1PP/4K2R w K - 0 18,?? This just leads to a lost game
