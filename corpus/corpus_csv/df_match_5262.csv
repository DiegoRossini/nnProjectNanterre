1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,My usual opening which I play looking for a Sicilian or a Roy Lopez
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Caro-Kann an opening I had little experience facing. It seems that the Caro-Kann was one of the most played openings alongside Indian Defences at the club.
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,I may not have faced the Caro-Kann that often but I knew how to play it.
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,I wasn't a fan of the exchange variation or the Panov-Botvinnik attack or the advance Caro-Kann
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,I wasn't a fan of the exchange variation or the Panov-Botvinnik attack or the advance Caro-Kann

7,Nxe4,c3e4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/3PN3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,Not 4... Nf6 5. Nxf6+ exf6 or gxf6 which is what I had faced in my little experience of playing the Caro-Kann
8,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/5b2/3PN3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,Not 4... Nf6 5. Nxf6+ exf6 or gxf6 which is what I had faced in my little experience of playing the Caro-Kann
9,Bd3,f1d3,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/5b2/3PN3/3B4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 2 5,My Opening book suggested 5.Ng3
10,Qxd4,d8d4,rn2kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/5b2/3qN3/3B4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,It took some time to decide whether to capture with the Bishop or the queen.
11,Qf3,d1f3,rn2kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/5b2/3qN3/3B1Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 1 6,It took some time to decide whether to capture with the Bishop or the queen.
12,Bxe4,f5e4,rn2kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/3qb3/3B1Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 0 7,It took some time to decide whether to capture with the Bishop or the queen.
13,Qxe4,f3e4,rn2kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/3qQ3/3B4/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 0 7,I decided to trade queens because with a 2 Bishops and the center looking rather open I thought my Bishop would be better than a knight and so I wanted to trade.
14,Qd8,d4d8,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/4Q3/3B4/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 1 8,Interesting move because Not only does he lose a tempo when he is already one tempo down but he also loses his only developed piece and so loses two tempi. If he had have played Qxe4 Bxe4 Nf6 he could have made me lose a tempo.
15,b3,b2b3,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/4Q3/1P1B4/P1P2PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 0 8,I planned on Castling Queenside and wanted my bishop on the long diagonal.
16,Nf6,g8f6,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/8/4Q3/1P1B4/P1P2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 1 9,Now I had to decide whether to put my queen on e3 or f3.
17,Qf3,e4f3,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/8/8/1P1B1Q2/P1P2PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 2 9,I decided f3 would be better because with him having no LSB I could control the light central squares and also with Bb2 and Ne2 I could gain some control of the dark squares. Also at e3 Nd5 attacks the Queen and forces me to move it again.
18,e6,e7e6,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/8/8/1P1B1Q2/P1P2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 0 10,After I made Qf3 I expected e6 straight away I saw no other good move. g7 to try and fianchetto his bishop but It gave him no attack on the Light center squares.
19,Ne2,g1e2,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/8/8/1P1B1Q2/P1P1NPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 1 10,This was forced as Bb2 Bb4+ causes me to weaken the position of my DSB with c3 or lose the right to castle. However this does nothing to stop it but It means If I can play Bb2 before Bb4+ I can play Nc3
20,Be7,f8e7,rn1qk2r/pp2bppp/2p1pn2/8/8/1P1B1Q2/P1P1NPPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 2 11,This threatened Bxh7+ Nxh7 Rxd8 Rxd8 whichg means I lose a bishop and rook for a queen. However I would have liked to have Bishop and Rook rather than queen but It makes him think
21,Bb2,c1b2,rn1qk2r/pp2bppp/2p1pn2/8/8/1P1B1Q2/PBP1NPPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 3 11,This threatened Bxh7+ Nxh7 Rxd8 Rxd8 whichg means I lose a bishop and rook for a queen. However I would have liked to have Bishop and Rook rather than queen but It makes him think
22,O-O,e8g8,rn1q1rk1/pp2bppp/2p1pn2/8/8/1P1B1Q2/PBP1NPPP/R3K2R w KQ - 4 12,This threatened Bxh7+ Nxh7 Rxd8 Rxd8 whichg means I lose a bishop and rook for a queen. However I would have liked to have Bishop and Rook rather than queen but It makes him think
23,O-O-O,e1c1,rn1q1rk1/pp2bppp/2p1pn2/8/8/1P1B1Q2/PBP1NPPP/2KR3R b - - 5 12,This threatened Bxh7+ Nxh7 Rxd8 Rxd8 whichg means I lose a bishop and rook for a queen. However I would have liked to have Bishop and Rook rather than queen but It makes him think

25,h4,h2h4,r2q1rk1/pp1nbppp/2p1pn2/8/7P/1P1B1Q2/PBP1NPP1/2KR3R b - - 0 13,Starting a pawn storm
26,Qc7,d8c7,r4rk1/ppqnbppp/2p1pn2/8/7P/1P1B1Q2/PBP1NPP1/2KR3R w - - 1 14,I was waiting for this
27,g4,g2g4,r4rk1/ppqnbppp/2p1pn2/8/6PP/1P1B1Q2/PBP1NP2/2KR3R b - - 0 14,I was waiting for this
28,Ne5,d7e5,r4rk1/ppq1bppp/2p1pn2/4n3/6PP/1P1B1Q2/PBP1NP2/2KR3R w - - 1 15,I was waiting for this
29,Bxe5,b2e5,r4rk1/ppq1bppp/2p1pn2/4B3/6PP/1P1B1Q2/P1P1NP2/2KR3R b - - 0 15,I lost my second Bishop and also control of the Dark center squares. This also threatened Ba3 Kb1 Qb2#
30,Qxe5,c7e5,r4rk1/pp2bppp/2p1pn2/4q3/6PP/1P1B1Q2/P1P1NP2/2KR3R w - - 0 16,I lost my second Bishop and also control of the Dark center squares. This also threatened Ba3 Kb1 Qb2#
31,c3,c2c3,r4rk1/pp2bppp/2p1pn2/4q3/6PP/1PPB1Q2/P3NP2/2KR3R b - - 0 16,With No DSB I didn't need to worry about this however It also meant I could try and regain control of the dark squares.
