1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"my old favourite, maybe the one I know best. Are you the same if I say that, though it is my favourite, I feel unconfident to play it against better players. I feel pretty sure that they will find ways to distress me in it. The first move is always a plague for me, whatever side I play, white or black. c4? d4? Nf3? and what against e4? Shall I play a sicilian or try the Petrov? What against the e4 e5 f4 thing?  Sometimes, I wonder how far I have been in chess, and wouldn't it be better to stop it for good."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"ok, this is a classical one. Craftyfox is a good average player; I guess I'll have no surprise until move 9 or 10"
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"looking for a direct fight, threatening slightly Ne4."
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"looking for a direct fight, threatening slightly Ne4."

6,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"looking for a direct fight, threatening slightly Ne4."
7,Qc2,d1c2,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PPQ1PPPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 3 4,"as Bd2 is weak and f3 is considerably weakening my king side, I prefer this defensive move. I know it would probably better to play a more offensive one, as Nf3 or e3, or mayba a3. This I'd better play in real chess games."
8,b6,b7b6,rnbqk2r/p1pp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PPQ1PPPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"this sounds less effective than o-o, c5 or Nc6."
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk2r/p1pp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/1bPP4/2N2N2/PPQ1PPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"much much more effective is e4. But I was in a defensive mood, looking for a draw with white... Lazy, perhaps. I'll change dureing the game, but it is due to very different time. As you know, internet games cannot meet us with constant ways of considering a game. You all remember games you were comfortable with during 20 days, and then all of sudden losing interest about.
Up and down mood in internet games are proabably more dangerous than in real game where only fatigue can change the mood.
I feel much better now in real game..."

Maybe some of you has an explanation. Well, yes, I am temporarily exposed to a potential Ne4 move, but long after a black queen move and the exchange of bishops on e4"

On the king side, I would be exposed to the black light bishop and potential Bxf3 gxf situation. Ok, this would open the g column for a direct attack on king. Though I felt discomfortable with it. I had a better feeling with a direct g4 attack, so I had to protect my knight first and link the rook. Ke2 makes both. And it is surprising, isn't it?"
