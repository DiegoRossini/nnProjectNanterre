White should try to exploit his material lead to expand that lead into a more decisive advantage before the endgame is reached. Hence, it's usually wise to avoid trading pawns when ahead by such a small margin. Further, the white pawn on e5 is now a passed pawn and will be a continuous thorn in black's side (or center) for the rest of the game. Finally, letting black get his bishop onto a strong square with tempo (the discovered attack against the white queen is also not a useful strategy.
