1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I decided to annotate this game because I won it using the g and h pawns (having already castled kingside!) usually this is not recommended as it leaves the king open, but here it worked out well in the end

Queen's pawn opening: I always like to play this, and then play the Blackmar-Diemer gambit if black moves d5 - it leads to a very open game and an interesting trap, the Halosar trap, if black makes all the obvious moves (1. d4 d5 2. e4 dxe4 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. f3 exf3 5. Qxf3 Qxd4 6. Be3 Qb4 7. O-O-O Bg4 8. Nb5)"
