1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This game is from a mini-tournament that I am currently in.  This is my second annotation.  I begin with d4 hoping to go into the Queen's Gambit.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"I guess I won't be trying for the Queen's Gambit.  This is a good move, help to take control of the center before pushing any pawns."
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 2,Preparing to push to e4.
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"No e4 push for me, yet."
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,Move the knight to gain more ground in the center.
6,c6,c7c6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,I think this move loses some momentum.  There are already two pieces protecting this pawn with only one of my pieces threatening.  Nc6 would have been a better move in my opinion.
7,Bf4,c1f4,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/3P1B2/2N2N2/PPP1PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,This is going to be my 'bad' bishop so I want to get it into the middle of the board and hopefully trade it later on for a more active black piece.
8,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bqkb1r/pp1npppp/2p2n2/3p4/3P1B2/2N2N2/PPP1PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,My opponent blocks his white square bishop as well as takes away the queen's protection for d5.  The only place for Nd7 to go to become more active is b6 but the only square it can really protect from there is d5.
9,e3,e2e3,r1bqkb1r/pp1npppp/2p2n2/3p4/3P1B2/2N1PN2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,I pushed this so I can move the white square bishop out to castle.
10,e6,e7e6,r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/3P1B2/2N1PN2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Trying to get the black squared bishop, the 'strong' one, more active."
11,Bd3,f1d3,r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/3P1B2/2NBPN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 6,Opening up so I can castle.
12,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/pp1nbppp/2p1pn2/3p4/3P1B2/2NBPN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 7,Opening up to castle but now his pieces are starting to bunch up on 7th row.
13,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk2r/pp1nbppp/2p1pn2/3p4/3P1B2/2NBPN2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 3 7,Trying to trade off my bad bishop.

17,Bxf6,g5f6,r1bq1rk1/pp1nbpp1/2p1pB1p/3p4/3P4/2NBPN2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 9,What I expected from that trade.

19,e4,e3e4,r1bq1rk1/pp1n1pp1/2p1pb1p/3p4/3PP3/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 10,Now pushing to e4 since I removed the knight from f6.
20,dxe4,d5e4,r1bq1rk1/pp1n1pp1/2p1pb1p/8/3Pp3/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 11,Now I gain some ground in the center with this move.  I have no intentions to take the bishiop.

23,Re1,f1e1,r1bq1rk1/pp1nbpp1/2p1p2p/8/3PN3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 b - - 2 12,Taking over the half open e file after I move the knight at e4.
24,Nf6,d7f6,r1bq1rk1/pp2bpp1/2p1pn1p/8/3PN3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 w - - 3 13,Starting to push into his territory although now I leave the d4 pawn completely exposed to the queen.
