12,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/pp1nbppp/2p1pn2/3p4/3P1B2/3BPN2/PPPN1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 7,"Here we go. Maybe I should have waited, since I was considering taking the long castling in case black aimed for a short one. I still keep the idea to advance on the black king´s flank in case of castling, and even moving my own king to f1 in case of check (a long future one)"

It seems to be a duel on knights controlling the centre, since I thought black can (in the future) jump onto d5. But now, BB in c8 is passive while its counterpart on the white side is still a pain... in BK neck´s."

But you really have to be a good player to come out with something profitable in a short period of time. Otherwise, you lose your time, and thus, most likely the game. I just thought how great would be to expel that N in f6. Any suggestions here are more than welcome!"

Now I can think again about a long castling and bring the second rook to cooperate in the attack (although during the game, I did not think about that castling at all...). Maybe f5 would have been a nice alternative."
