1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"Here is game from my repetoire that I have memorized.  This game shows Reti's hypermodern play against a semi-slav type setup by Black.  The latent power of the White position is shown when Reti opens the position to unleash the power of the double fianchettoed bishops.  Bogoljubov tries to extricate himself tactically, however, his position is demolished by a beautiful combination."

White is better due to the fact that both of his bishops are actively placed, where the c8 bishop is still on its home square.  An important lesson is to remember that an advantage in development is a dynamic advantage and Black will eventually solve his problems by playing ...b6, ...Bb7, and ...c5.
