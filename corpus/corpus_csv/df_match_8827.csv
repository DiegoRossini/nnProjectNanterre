1,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!  It can really be quite deflating when you think you have a plan.  You carry it out but your opponent crosses you with a surprise move, sometimes one that will really put a spanner in the works or may cause you to lose at least a tempo to deal with the surprise move.  But you could have prevented that surprise move by taking preventative measures called Prophylaxis.  In this game, shortly after getting out of the database I was planning to exchange heavy pieces on the open e file and end up with a perfectly reasonable and tenable game.  Alas!  Many a slip twixt cup and lip and here is how it all unfolds.  Here is where the prophylactic move a6 is certainly appropriate!  If I had played it I would have kept Freddy's knight out of b5 (the surprise move!).   That error was compounded by me failing to eject Freddy's knight out of d6 by playing Glenda back to c7.  Instead I played my bishop to c6 trying to screen out the c file first.  This wasted tempo proved fatal and I then lost my f pawn.  In this game I let Freddy walk all over me and got what I deserved - being Freddied (Jospeak for getting checkmated by Freddy)!  He starts off with 1. e3 which is Van Krujts Opening."
