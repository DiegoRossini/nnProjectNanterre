1,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/2N5/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 1,In all the games on gameknot this is one I remember the most and enjoyed. It happened 3 years ago against clagersie. As normal there are many mistakes in my games but some good moves too. I start with the Dunst opening. A change from moving my normal e4.
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/2N5/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I made this move to block blacks advance and chasing my knight. It would have extended his pawns however. Also my bishop comes into play. I thought should I move e4 to prompt a pawn exchange but decided against it.
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,I made this move to block blacks advance and chasing my knight. It would have extended his pawns however. Also my bishop comes into play. I thought should I move e4 to prompt a pawn exchange but decided against it.
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"Black protects his knight on f6 . A knight - bishop exchange would have meant  a double up of Black's pawns on the king side, I guess black did not want that."
5,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p2B1/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 2 3,"Black protects his knight on f6 . A knight - bishop exchange would have meant  a double up of Black's pawns on the king side, I guess black did not want that."
6,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bqkb1r/pppnpppp/5n2/3p2B1/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 3 4,"Black protects his knight on f6 . A knight - bishop exchange would have meant  a double up of Black's pawns on the king side, I guess black did not want that."
7,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkb1r/pppnpppp/5n2/3p2B1/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 4 4,I continue my development.
8,e6,e7e6,r1bqkb1r/pppn1ppp/4pn2/3p2B1/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,e3 a mirror move of Black's e6 was my other move. I choice e4 was to be a little more aggressive. Tempting a pawn exchange knowing if 5... dxe4. 6. Nxe4. Black knight unable to take my knight because my bishop pinning his knight against his Queen. My hope is that he will turn down the exchange  so I can advance my e pawn to e5 and pressure his knight.
9,e4,e2e4,r1bqkb1r/pppn1ppp/4pn2/3p2B1/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,e3 a mirror move of Black's e6 was my other move. I choice e4 was to be a little more aggressive. Tempting a pawn exchange knowing if 5... dxe4. 6. Nxe4. Black knight unable to take my knight because my bishop pinning his knight against his Queen. My hope is that he will turn down the exchange  so I can advance my e pawn to e5 and pressure his knight.
10,h6,h7h6,r1bqkb1r/pppn1pp1/4pn1p/3p2B1/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,Black turns down the exchange but sees the potential advance of e5  so black needs my bishop moved to unpin his knight.
11,Bxf6,g5f6,r1bqkb1r/pppn1pp1/4pB1p/3p4/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,I felt I had to make this move. Bh4 would have been foolish as black would have pushed g5 and Bishop would have to retreat further resulting the loss of my pawn on e4.
12,Nxf6,d7f6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2pp1/4pn1p/3p4/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,e4 needs protecting. other options were e5 and Bd3 but I decide to move my Queen in preparation to castle Queen side. Was Bd3 better. Should I have prepared to castle king side instead? comments please.
13,Qe2,d1e2,r1bqkb1r/ppp2pp1/4pn1p/3p4/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP1QPPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 1 7,e4 needs protecting. other options were e5 and Bd3 but I decide to move my Queen in preparation to castle Queen side. Was Bd3 better. Should I have prepared to castle king side instead? comments please.
14,dxe4,d5e4,r1bqkb1r/ppp2pp1/4pn1p/8/3Pp3/2N2N2/PPP1QPPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 8,Black looks to fianchethis bishop attacking knight on e4.

17,O-O-O,e1c1,r1bqkb1r/p1p2pp1/1p2pn1p/8/3PN3/5N2/PPP1QPPP/2KR1B1R b kq - 1 9,I decide to castle. Maybe castling this side was a little weak as I've lost my black bishop to defend c1-h6 line and my knight is off c3.
18,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/p1p1bpp1/1p2pn1p/8/3PN3/5N2/PPP1QPPP/2KR1B1R w kq - 2 10,I thought black might have moved Bb7 here but instead looks to castle.
19,h4,h2h4,r1bqk2r/p1p1bpp1/1p2pn1p/8/3PN2P/5N2/PPP1QPP1/2KR1B1R b kq - 0 10,Knowing that I have a weakness on c1-h6 line I decide to give g5 square extra protection.Also knowing that black will probably castle king side h4 starts a Queen side attack.
20,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/p1p1bpp1/1p2pn1p/8/3PN2P/5N2/PPP1QPP1/2KR1B1R w - - 1 11,Looking to move to Nc6.attacking Queen and bishop.

22,Bb7,c8b7,r2q1rk1/pbp1bpp1/1p2pn1p/4N3/3PN2P/8/PPP1QPP1/2KR1B1R w - - 3 12,Black stops that move  and now has a doumle attack on my knight at e4.
23,Nc3,e4c3,r2q1rk1/pbp1bpp1/1p2pn1p/4N3/3P3P/2N5/PPP1QPP1/2KR1B1R b - - 4 12,Was f3 better? Maybe it was and it would have put a pawn in the centre if the piece exchange was made. I did not want to move my knight to g3 as it would have hindered my pawns so decided a defensive move to protect my kings pawns.
24,Bb4,e7b4,r2q1rk1/pbp2pp1/1p2pn1p/4N3/1b1P3P/2N5/PPP1QPP1/2KR1B1R w - - 5 13,Protecting my knight. I don't want 13... Bxc3 14. bxc3. That would weaken my pawn defense.
25,Qd3,e2d3,r2q1rk1/pbp2pp1/1p2pn1p/4N3/1b1P3P/2NQ4/PPP2PP1/2KR1B1R b - - 6 13,Protecting my knight. I don't want 13... Bxc3 14. bxc3. That would weaken my pawn defense.
