1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Another OTB game and the final game of the tournament. I have managed to string together a few wins and am looking pretty close to the top of the list of my grade. If I win this game and the current leader doesn't then I would at least have a share of the top spot.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"Alekhine's defence. I notice that when I play this OTB, my opponents tend to raise an eyebrow and look a bit uncomfortable."
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 2,And (unlike on GK) this seems to be the most common response. I suspect trying to avoid unfamiliar territory.
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Keeping my opponent uncomfortable hopefully!
5,e5,e4e5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3pP3/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,Now it becomes the Spielmann variation.
6,Nfd7,f6d7,rnbqkb1r/pppnpppp/8/3pP3/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"Also playable is 3...d4, it often leads to the violent follow on of: 4. exf6 dxc3 5. fxg7 cxd2+ 6. Qxd2 Qxd2+ 7. Bxd2 Bxg7 after which I think white has the better of it."
7,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/pppnpppp/8/3pP3/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"Poking a pawn out to defend e5, release the DSB and claim some more of the centre."
8,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppn1ppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,Defending d5 and opening some dark diagonals.
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppn1ppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"Developing and adding some fortification to white's advanced centre. This is a strong knight, which Black is often prepared to give up the bishop pair to remove - however in this line Blacks LSB isn't going to make it anywhere near that knight for quite some time."
10,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,Looking to undermine White's advanced central pawns.
11,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"White's central pawns have fallen, and Black is a pawn to the good. White does have more development, but I think Black has the edge for now."
12,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/4p3/3pP3/3p4/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"White's central pawns have fallen, and Black is a pawn to the good. White does have more development, but I think Black has the edge for now."
13,Nxd4,f3d4,rnbqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/4p3/3pP3/3N4/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,"White's central pawns have fallen, and Black is a pawn to the good. White does have more development, but I think Black has the edge for now."
14,Nxe5,d7e5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4p3/3pn3/3N4/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"White's central pawns have fallen, and Black is a pawn to the good. White does have more development, but I think Black has the edge for now."
15,Bf4,c1f4,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4p3/3pn3/3N1B2/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 8,Looking to develop further with tempo.
16,Qf6,d8f6,rnb1kb1r/pp3ppp/4pq2/3pn3/3N1B2/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 9,"Seems early to send forth the queen while the back rank is looking so full, but in this case I think it is justified. Nd7 would have been the only safe square for the knight and White's massive lead in development would more than compensate for the pawn."
17,Bg3,f4g3,rnb1kb1r/pp3ppp/4pq2/3pn3/3N4/2NB2B1/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 3 9,"Catching up on development. Challenging for the centre, and looking through the knight towards White's f pawn."
18,Bc5,f8c5,rnb1k2r/pp3ppp/4pq2/2bpn3/3N4/2NB2B1/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 4 10,"Catching up on development. Challenging for the centre, and looking through the knight towards White's f pawn."
19,Ndb5,d4b5,rnb1k2r/pp3ppp/4pq2/1Nbpn3/8/2NB2B1/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 5 10,Threatening a knight fork at c7.
20,Na6,b8a6,r1b1k2r/pp3ppp/n3pq2/1Nbpn3/8/2NB2B1/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 6 11,"I gave 10...Ng4 piling up on the f pawn, a good hard look, but White can ward off the threat with Qf3 after a check at c7, securing a rook. Nxd3 doesn't fare any better."
21,Qe2,d1e2,r1b1k2r/pp3ppp/n3pq2/1Nbpn3/8/2NB2B1/PPP1QPPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 7 11,"This move adds protection to the f-pawn, creates a threat to the knight at e5, and gives white the option of castling long."
22,Nxd3+,e5d3,r1b1k2r/pp3ppp/n3pq2/1Nbp4/8/2Nn2B1/PPP1QPPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 12,"There didn't seem to be an efficient way of defending the knight, nor moving it to safety. This gets rid of White's bishop pair, and maintains pressure on f2."
23,Qxd3,e2d3,r1b1k2r/pp3ppp/n3pq2/1Nbp4/8/2NQ2B1/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 0 12,Dulling the threat of Nc7. It seemed that this move needed to happen sooner or later anyway.
24,O-O,e8g8,r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/n3pq2/1Nbp4/8/2NQ2B1/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 1 13,Dulling the threat of Nc7. It seemed that this move needed to happen sooner or later anyway.
25,O-O,e1g1,r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/n3pq2/1Nbp4/8/2NQ2B1/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - - 2 13,"Renewing protection for f2, and connecting the rooks."
