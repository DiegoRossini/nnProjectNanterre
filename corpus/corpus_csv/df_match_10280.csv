1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Alright. Same opening, different variation."
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Ok already black is going to fall into trouble fast as he is giving me the centre of the board. I have lots of options here but which one is best? Well his pawn push stops any attempt for the 4 move checkmate. I am sure everyone is familiar with it, but just in case I will include it below.
1. e4
2. Bc4
3. Qf3
4. Qxf7# 
These are whites moves only and of course it depends entirely on blacks responses to these moves. 
Note: King's gambit also chases the same square but after white castles King-side the Rook would also be baring down on f7."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Might as well take the centre seeing as how he is giving it to me.
4,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2p1p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Right. Black has opened his Queen up for both directions but the real threat is d5 to try and gain control of the centre.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2p1p3/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,Develop.
6,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/2p1p3/8/1b1PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"I'm glad he did this, remember Rule #5? Bishop stronger than Knights in the endgame. Now Black probably really doesn't want to take my knight here. I wouldn't. This is a tactic to get me to push him away with my Queen-side pawns(4. a3  Ba5  5. b4 Bb6), which would force me to castle King-side, having destroyed my Queen-side pawn structure,  and giving his bishop an attack on f2. That is what I would do anyway. If he does take it he is breaking Rule #5 anyway so that will ultimately be to my advantage."
7,Bd2,c1d2,rnbqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/2p1p3/8/1b1PP3/2N5/PPPB1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 3 4,Now if he takes my Knight here I can keep my pawn structure and my bishop will be in a position to attack Black on his King-side which at this stage is probably going to be the side he wants to castle on.
8,d5,d7d5,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3p4/1b1PP3/2N5/PPPB1PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"Ok, the pawn push. Now he is trying to control the centre. I can't take here as he has 2 pawns and his Queen on it, so I will just push on."
9,e5,e4e5,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3pP3/1b1P4/2N5/PPPB1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"Now I have the ability to develop Nf3 and then possibly later on chase his queen with my bishop, but not yet. Also because my pawn is now on e5 It has become somewhat of a priority for me. His Knight can only develop to two squares, Nh6 which is very bad (Rule #3), or Ne7 which isn't much better. Ne7 means e will probably push the f7 pawn 1 or 2 squares on the next turn, or castle. His alternative is to push the pawn 1 or 2 squares now. of course 2 squares and I En passen his ass."
10,h6,h7h6,rnbqk1nr/pp3pp1/2p1p2p/3pP3/1b1P4/2N5/PPPB1PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"Well he is trying to preempt my bishop move, but this is really a no meaning move. I have two pieces to his one developed so he really should be developing. If I had already brought my Nf3 then I would expect him to play it in response."
11,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk1nr/pp3pp1/2p1p2p/3pP3/1b1P4/2N2N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,I'm going to do it anyway. 3-1 in development.
12,a6,a7a6,rnbqk1nr/1p3pp1/p1p1p2p/3pP3/1b1P4/2N2N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,This was another no meaning move. What black is trying to do here is give his bishop a place to retreat to (Ba7) If/when I decide to chase him. Nothing to do with my f1 Bishop as I already cannot move beyond d3. Black is assuming that I am planning on castling King-side. Note: I prefer my opponent to castle first so that I can plan his demise.
13,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqk1nr/1p3pp1/p1p1p2p/3pP3/1b1P4/2NB1N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 7,"4-1 in the development stage. Ready to castle king-side (only if I have to). Black is so far behind in development now, it's gonna take a miracle for him to beat me at this stage."
14,c5,c6c5,rnbqk1nr/1p3pp1/p3p2p/2ppP3/1b1P4/2NB1N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"Mmmm. Let's see. If I take the pawn @c5, black gets what he wants in two moves instead of three
8. d4xc5   Bxc5 then he can retreat to a7 and give my f2 pawn pressure (no real meaning at the moment as he has nothing to back it up with).
But seeing as how I am vindictive I will make him work for it with...."
15,a3,a2a3,rnbqk1nr/1p3pp1/p3p2p/2ppP3/1b1P4/P1NB1N2/1PPB1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 8,Mmmm Take my knight or back off.
16,Ba5,b4a5,rnbqk1nr/1p3pp1/p3p2p/b1ppP3/3P4/P1NB1N2/1PPB1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 1 9,A fine choice but I can now claim my free piece.
17,dxc5,d4c5,rnbqk1nr/1p3pp1/p3p2p/b1PpP3/8/P1NB1N2/1PPB1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 9,Yummy!
18,d4,d5d4,rnbqk1nr/1p3pp1/p3p2p/b1P1P3/3p4/P1NB1N2/1PPB1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 10,"Now this is mistake by black. Better to do Nc6, I feel, get some development happening."
19,Ne4,c3e4,rnbqk1nr/1p3pp1/p3p2p/b1P1P3/3pN3/P2B1N2/1PPB1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 10,Now black is getting into trouble. The big threat from white is Nd6 . If he does Bxd2  I take with my Queen and then I can castle either side.
20,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk1nr/1p3pp1/p1n1p2p/b1P1P3/3pN3/P2B1N2/1PPB1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 11,"Don't know why he develops the Knight now as I can't take his Bishop with mine, he has his Queen on it which would put me in check, I would take with my Queen, Queen-swap and I would have to take with my Knight which would be detrimental to my development. Best to push his Bishop away..."
