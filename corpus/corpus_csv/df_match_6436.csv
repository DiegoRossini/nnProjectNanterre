1,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"""Oh great,"" I thought, ""out of theory already"" My strategy for any time I face an uncommon opening like this,I just follow opening principles (Develop pieces,Get king to Safety,Knights before Bishops,etc.)"
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I just treat this like any king's pawn opening and thrust my pawn to e5,accepting the invitation to the center by White"
3,b3,b2b3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/1P2P3/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"At the time,this move shocked me but now it makes sense. The e3 pawn is blocking the Bishop,so why not give it a chance for prosperity?"
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/8/1P2P3/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,another move that I quite didn't get at the time. White stakes claim to the d5 square for his valiant knight. If I'm correct I think this is a position that is similar to that of the Nimzowitsch-Larsen opening. (1.b3)
5,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2P5/1P2P3/P2P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,another move that I quite didn't get at the time. White stakes claim to the d5 square for his valiant knight. If I'm correct I think this is a position that is similar to that of the Nimzowitsch-Larsen opening. (1.b3)
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2P5/1P2P3/P2P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,Staying true to my plan
7,Bb2,c1b2,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2P5/1P2P3/PB1P1PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 2 4,This looks like an awkward square for the Bishop but I could not find a place for it that had a purpose. I just want to castle
8,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/2n2n2/4p3/2P5/1P2P3/PB1P1PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 3 5,This looks like an awkward square for the Bishop but I could not find a place for it that had a purpose. I just want to castle
9,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/2n2n2/4p3/2P5/1PN1P3/PB1P1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 4 5,!? A move that also stunned me. I knew he had a purpose of moving it there but can a 1500 really figure it out? I know I couldn't
10,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/ppppbppp/2n2n2/4p3/2P5/1PN1P3/PB1P1PPP/R2QKBNR w KQ - 5 6,!? A move that also stunned me. I knew he had a purpose of moving it there but can a 1500 really figure it out? I know I couldn't

12,d6,d7d6,r1bq1rk1/ppp1bppp/2np1n2/4p3/2P5/1PN1P3/PB1P1PPP/RQ2KBNR w KQ - 0 7,Let's just ignore that and go on with my plan
13,Nf3,g1f3,r1bq1rk1/ppp1bppp/2np1n2/4p3/2P5/1PN1PN2/PB1P1PPP/RQ2KB1R b KQ - 1 7,A move that supports a possible b4 with queenside expansion
14,Bg4,c8g4,r2q1rk1/ppp1bppp/2np1n2/4p3/2P3b1/1PN1PN2/PB1P1PPP/RQ2KB1R w KQ - 2 8,A move that supports a possible b4 with queenside expansion

Let's give him doubled pawns weakening his castling position when he castles kingside! However,this move is wrong because Freddy had no intention of castling whatsoever. Also,the open g-file will be a great spot to start attacking my king on."
17,gxf3,g2f3,r2q1rk1/ppp1bppp/2np1n2/4p3/2P5/PPN1PP2/1B1P1P1P/RQ2KB1R b KQ - 0 9,"At this point of time,I was very happy of the position I got out of the Opening. Black is devloped,castled and connected his rooks. White on the other hand had doubled pawns an awkward queen on b1 and no really safe place to castle. Boy was I wrong"
18,Qd7,d8d7,r4rk1/pppqbppp/2np1n2/4p3/2P5/PPN1PP2/1B1P1P1P/RQ2KB1R w KQ - 1 10,"At this point of time,I was very happy of the position I got out of the Opening.

20,a6,a7a6,r4rk1/1ppqbppp/p1np1n2/4p3/2P5/PPN1PP2/1BQP1P1P/R3KB1R w KQ - 0 11,defending against a possible b4-b5 by this and ...Na7 if necessary
21,Nd5,c3d5,r4rk1/1ppqbppp/p1np1n2/3Np3/2P5/PP2PP2/1BQP1P1P/R3KB1R b KQ - 1 11,The White knight completes his journey to d5...
22,Nxd5,f6d5,r4rk1/1ppqbppp/p1np4/3np3/2P5/PP2PP2/1BQP1P1P/R3KB1R w KQ - 0 12,Only to be captured on d5
23,cxd5,c4d5,r4rk1/1ppqbppp/p1np4/3Pp3/8/PP2PP2/1BQP1P1P/R3KB1R b KQ - 0 12,"However! Black's knight will get kicked back into an unactive spot.

Computer: Gives Freddy a slight advantage here"
24,Nb8,c6b8,rn3rk1/1ppqbppp/p2p4/3Pp3/8/PP2PP2/1BQP1P1P/R3KB1R w KQ - 1 13,Looking for a rerouting to d7
25,d4,d2d4,rn3rk1/1ppqbppp/p2p4/3Pp3/3P4/PP2PP2/1BQ2P1P/R3KB1R b KQ - 0 13,"White finally gets his strike back in the center

Computer: Gives 13.Bd3 as best followed by 13...f5 with a +/-"
26,exd4,e5d4,rn3rk1/1ppqbppp/p2p4/3P4/3p4/PP2PP2/1BQ2P1P/R3KB1R w KQ - 0 14,? This gives the bishop on b2 the open diagonal. This bishop will point to g7 and the rook can hop over to g1 and make the Black King less comfortable
27,Bxd4,b2d4,rn3rk1/1ppqbppp/p2p4/3P4/3B4/PP2PP2/2Q2P1P/R3KB1R b KQ - 0 14,"Now,5 moves after I was very comfortable with my position,I feel like I'm losing the battle"
