7,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pPb2/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 4,"At the time that Kotronias wrote his book, this line had fallen out of favour, with players like Short preferring 4. Nf3 and 5. Be2.  However, Kotronias found new life in the old line.  I've found his strategy to be very attractive as White, using it exclusively against the Caro-Kann.  My losses have usually resulted from over-stretching myself and playing too loosely but I've had some satisfying wins."
8,e6,e7e6,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3pPb2/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,The start of White's exploitation of the exposed position of Black's Bishop.  White gains tempi to establish a formidable territory on the kingside.

Looking quickly through the book, I can only find a few examples of Ng3 being played early by White and none of them are in similar positions to this.  The objective is to prevent Black from playing ...Be4, disturbing White's KR.  However, it does invite Black to disturb White's pawn structure.  Better was an immediate 7. h4, when, if Black plays 7...Be4, White can play 8. Rh3 followed by Ng3 to chase off the bishop."
14,Bxc3+,b4c3,rn1qk1nr/pp3ppp/2p1p1b1/3pP3/3P2P1/2b3N1/PPP2P1P/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,"?! Another dubious move.  As Eddie said, Black should play this line like a Nimzo-Indian, only swapping the B for N when pushed to.  This exchange does weaken White's queenside pawns but Black fails to follow it up to exploit the weakness.  Better was 7...c5."

However, on this occasion, I felt that it was a good gain of tempi to swap off a B that has made one move for one in which Black has invested 3 already.  The swap would also develop my Q to a good square."

With his queenside in disarray, castling long was no more attractive than this and leaving the K in the centre would encourage Black to exploit the weakness on c3 sooner rather than later.  The risk of this strategy is that, in attacking with his kingside pawns, White over-stretches and his King is exposed to lethal fire from Queen and Rooks on the open files thus created.  Alternatively, Black gets Queen and Knights behind enemy lines and wreaks havoc."

The position I had been aiming for, threatening to advance the f-pawn again and open lines to Black's uncastled king.  If Black castles kingside, it looks like he is walking into a pawn storm (which look more frightening than it really is if you analyse it).  Black sank into a long think ..."

I thought ...Rhg8 was better, aesthetically at least, though White could have responded with 19. Qh7.  Perhaps 18...c4 to push the Q off that diagonal before moving the rook to defend g7 would have been better, also fixing White's weaknesses on c3 and c2 to enable a swift counter-attack with an appropriately timed ...Qa4"
