1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I've chosen to annotate this game because of the strong endgame play that transpires. I hope it might give some players tips on how to play endgames, and maybe stronger players can find a mistake that Black should capitalise on for the win."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The Ruy Lopez opening - an opening that I play against a lot, and feel comfortable to do so."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"The Ruy Lopez opening - an opening that I play against a lot, and feel comfortable to do so."

6,a6,a7a6,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,"The most popular reply to 3. Bb5, forcing the bishop to do something."
7,Bxc6,b5c6,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1B5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,"This move annoys me - Ruy Lopez Exchange Variation. My experience is that it is played by lower ranked players to try and lull into a drawn game by swapping all material. In my personal database, five games have followed this line and the average rating of my opponent was 1515. The more popular 4. Ba4 has an average rating of 1639 in my personal database.

I should probably say this is my personal experience and I do not mean to insult anyone that chooses to play it. 

All that being said, I'm happy to play against it. I think my endgame is reasonably strong and the quicker we get there, the better."
8,dxc6,d7c6,r1bqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1p5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"Move favourable for Black because it opens up the c8-h3 diagonal for the LSB and half-opens the d-file for the Queen to get out quickly. 4. bxc6 is weaker in my opinion. I don't think Black can benefit from that open b-file, and the LSB on b7 is not great due to the half-open file and the pawn on c6 blocking its a8-h1 diagonal."
9,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1p5/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"This is called the Ruy Lopez Exchange Alekhine variation, apparently."
10,exd4,e5d4,r1bqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1p5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"I can't see much choice for Black but to accept the pawn, it'll cause him too many problems in the centre."
11,Qxd4,d1d4,r1bqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1p5/8/3QP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 6,"This seems really negative, too, from White. With the open (and White-controlled) centre, Black's lack of development so far, Black's inability to castle quickly and White able to quickly call up more pieces, I feel that Black's only real option again is to swap Queens.

I've felt forced into many of these moves so far."
12,Qxd4,d8d4,r1b1kbnr/1pp2ppp/p1p5/8/3qP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 7,"Finally Black has time to make a move. The LSB has very few safe squares with the current state of the board but I want to move it so I can castle on the queen-side. This is the quickest side to castle and get my king to safety, but also puts my rook quickly onto the open d-file."
13,Nxd4,f3d4,r1b1kbnr/1pp2ppp/p1p5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 7,"Finally Black has time to make a move.

This is the quickest side to castle and get my king to safety, but also puts my rook quickly onto the open d-file."

18,Bb4,f8b4,2kr2nr/1ppb1ppp/p1p5/8/1b1NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 5 10,"I wanted to develop the DSB before the knight but had to choose where. c5 is a bad square because of 10. Nxc6. Putting my bishop on e7 was far too passive. d6 might have been a good choice but seeing as I've looked to seize the d-file, I didn't want to block it in again. With 9. Bb4, I'm pinning the knight and threatening to double White's pawns."
19,Nde2,d4e2,2kr2nr/1ppb1ppp/p1p5/8/1b2P3/2N1B3/PPP1NPPP/R3K2R b KQ - 6 10,"Re-positions his d4 knight and defends his c3 knight, stopping me from doubling pawns on the c-file. The half-open b-file would probably have helped White anyway, so I probably wouldn't have done so."
