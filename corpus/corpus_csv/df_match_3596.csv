1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"My usual Petroff. At GM level pretty drawish, but at amateur level any result can come out of it. I do not play it to get a draw, I always want to win even as Black."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"My usual Petroff. At GM level pretty drawish, but at amateur level any result can come out of it. I do not play it to get a draw, I always want to win even as Black."

5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 3,"The main move is 3.Nxe5, usually followed by 3...d6 4.Nf3 Nxe4 when White has a number of choices, the most common being 5.d4, but also the recently popular 5.Nc3 is possible and some less interesting lines (5.d3 and 5.Qe2). Here, 3.d4 is another possibility and even 3.Bc4 can be played. The text is also possible, but less challenging to Black."
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 4 4,This has to be the simplest of all openings: the four knights.
7,d4,d2d4,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"The Scotch four knights - a line I know very well, from both sides. This has to be the variation I have played the most games with."
8,exd4,e5d4,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/3pP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,Pinning the knight and putting pressure on e4.

11,Nxc6,d4c6,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2N2n2/8/1b2P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,The usual freeing break for Black in e4 openings. Also by far the most common in the position though 7...O-O is also possible.
12,bxc6,b7c6,r1bqk2r/p1pp1ppp/2p2n2/8/1b2P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,The usual freeing break for Black in e4 openings. Also by far the most common in the position though 7...O-O is also possible.

16,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/p1p2ppp/2p2n2/3p4/1b2P3/2NB4/PPPB1PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 2 9,"I looked at a pawn-winning line, namely 8...Bxc3 9.Bxc3 Nxe4 10.Bxe4 dxe4 11.Qxd8+ Kxd8, but my pawn structure after that is pretty awkward and I'm lacking in development, so I decided not to play it. What I didn't even see is that 12.Bxg7 would immediately win the pawn back and after 12...Rg8 White has the intermezzo 13.Bf6+ and can defend his g2 pawn afterwards, so the line wouldn't even have won a pawn after all."
17,O-O,e1g1,r1bq1rk1/p1p2ppp/2p2n2/3p4/1b2P3/2NB4/PPPB1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 3 9,"But now that we have castled, I can take with the rook on d8 in the line mentioned before so I decided the pawn win was safe now."

19,Bxc3,d2c3,r1bq1rk1/p1p2ppp/2p2n2/3p4/4P3/2BB4/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 10,"?! White was playing passively until now, but now that he gets aggressive, it's just the wrong time for it. He prevents 11...Nxc3?? 12.Qxh7# and 11...Nf6?? to chase the queen is also not possible because of 12.Bxf6 and there's a mating threat on h7 again. But I have..."

22,g6,g7g6,r1bq1rk1/p1p2p1p/2p3p1/3p3Q/4n3/2BB4/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 12,"... This move, which does weaken the dark squares around the king, but chases the queen and prevents the mate."
23,Qe5,h5e5,r1bq1rk1/p1p2p1p/2p3p1/3pQ3/4n3/2BB4/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - - 1 12,"Another mating threat, but it's easily parried again. 12.Qh6 does not accomplish anything either after 12...Nxc3 13.bxc3 and now for example 13...Qf6 and White has to retreat to prevent losing a second pawn."
24,f6,f7f6,r1bq1rk1/p1p4p/2p2pp1/3pQ3/4n3/2BB4/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 13,"Seems like the best square since on d4 it can be chased yet again with 13...c5. (Yes, it can be chased from this square with 13...g5, but that would needlessly weaken the kingside.)"

26,Nxc3,e4c3,r1bq1rk1/p1p4p/2p2pp1/3p4/5Q2/2nB4/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 14,"We can see now that Black has an advantage. He is a pawn up and has nice central control. The only factors that may be to White's advantage are the slightly unstable position of the Black king and White's superior development, but there are no immediate threats so Black can simply develop and try to catch up with White before White can take advantage of those advantages."

29,Qe3,f4e3,r1b2rk1/p1p4p/2pq1pp1/3p4/8/2PBQ3/P1P2PPP/R4RK1 b - - 2 15,"The exchange with 15.Qxd6 cxd6 would give Black a strange pawn structure of which it's not clear to me whether it's strong or weak. The computer thinks that 15.Qh4 would have been slightly better, because on e3 the queen is vulnerable to attacks yet again, this time by the rooks that cannot wait to be developed onto the open e-file."
30,Bd7,c8d7,r4rk1/p1pb3p/2pq1pp1/3p4/8/2PBQ3/P1P2PPP/R4RK1 w - - 3 16,"Developing, connecting the rooks and covering the e8 square (if I would have developed the bishop to, say, b7 and White would have played 16.Rfe1, I could not have played 16...Rfe8? because White could then get two rooks for a queen with 17.Qxe8+! Rxe8 18.Rxe8+ Kg7)."
31,Rfe1,f1e1,r4rk1/p1pb3p/2pq1pp1/3p4/8/2PBQ3/P1P2PPP/R3R1K1 b - - 4 16,"The computer prefers 16.c4, probably to prevent 1 ...c4 push by me and to close the center, where Black has a pawn majority. The pawn exchange with 16...dxc4 17.Bxc4+  does not offer Black real winning chances due to his doubled c-pawns and the lack of a passed pawn."
32,Rae8,a8e8,4rrk1/p1pb3p/2pq1pp1/3p4/8/2PBQ3/P1P2PPP/R3R1K1 w - - 5 17,"!? I did not do a safety check before this move and was awakened by White's next move. But actually this move is not bad at all, since for the pawn White gets superior center control and Black's queen is in an awkward position after it has taken the pawn on a7. But if I'd have seen that my pawn would be hanging, I'd have played 16...Rfe8 for sure."
33,Qxa7,e3a7,4rrk1/Q1pb3p/2pq1pp1/3p4/8/2PB4/P1P2PPP/R3R1K1 b - - 0 17,"Highlighting the bad position of the White queen, threatening to trap her with ...Ra8 and/or ...Bc6."
