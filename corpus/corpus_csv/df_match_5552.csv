6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp2pp/4pn2/5pB1/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,Black's other option is 4...d5.
7,Nbd2,b1d2,rnbqkb1r/pppp2pp/4pn2/5pB1/3P4/5N2/PPPNPPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,Black's other option is 4...d5.

9,Bxf6,g5f6,rnbqk2r/ppppb1pp/4pB2/5p2/3P4/5N2/PPPNPPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,The point of this variation - white now gains all sorts of space in the center.
10,Bxf6,e7f6,rnbqk2r/pppp2pp/4pb2/5p2/3P4/5N2/PPPNPPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,The point of this variation - white now gains all sorts of space in the center.
11,e4,e2e4,rnbqk2r/pppp2pp/4pb2/5p2/3PP3/5N2/PPPN1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,The point of this variation - white now gains all sorts of space in the center.
12,fxe4,f5e4,rnbqk2r/pppp2pp/4pb2/8/3Pp3/5N2/PPPN1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,White gets a clear advantage after this. Black's best try is probably to leave the tension in the center unresolved and play 6...O-O and 7...d5.
13,Nxe4,d2e4,rnbqk2r/pppp2pp/4pb2/8/3PN3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,?! this creates a weakness on e6.  Perhaps black wants to play ...e5 next?
14,d6,d7d6,rnbqk2r/ppp3pp/3ppb2/8/3PN3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,?! this creates a weakness on e6.  Perhaps black wants to play ...e5 next?
15,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqk2r/ppp3pp/3ppb2/8/3PN3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 8,"Now if black plays 9...O-O, my plan is to castle long and attack on the King side. 9.c3, besides supporting d4 and preventing ...Nb4, also readies ""plan B"" - expand on the Q-side - if black delays O-O."

20,Qe7,d8e7,r3k2r/pppbq1pp/2nppb2/8/3PN3/2PB1N2/PP2QPPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 3 11,But black makes a waiting move.
21,O-O,e1g1,r3k2r/pppbq1pp/2nppb2/8/3PN3/2PB1N2/PP2QPPP/R4RK1 b kq - 4 11,"I can't wait forever, so time for Plan B."
22,O-O,e8g8,r4rk1/pppbq1pp/2nppb2/8/3PN3/2PB1N2/PP2QPPP/R4RK1 w - - 5 12,Clever - avoids the immediate K-side attack by waiting for white to castle first.
23,b4,b2b4,r4rk1/pppbq1pp/2nppb2/8/1P1PN3/2PB1N2/P3QPPP/R4RK1 b - - 0 12,Plan B is under way.
24,g6,g7g6,r4rk1/pppbq2p/2nppbp1/8/1P1PN3/2PB1N2/P3QPPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 13,Sealing off the b1-h7 diagonal

35,Ne4,d2e4,4rrk1/p1pb2qp/1p1pp1p1/nP6/3PNP2/2PB4/P3Q1PP/4RRK1 b - - 4 18,"The N is on its way to g5, where it increases the pressure on e6."
36,d5,d6d5,4rrk1/p1pb2qp/1p2p1p1/nP1p4/3PNP2/2PB4/P3Q1PP/4RRK1 w - - 0 19,"This is a serious positional error, as now white's N will become a monster on e5. Surprisingly, GK's computer doesn't see anything wrong with this move. I would move 18...Nb7, trying for counterplay with ...c5. Note that 18...e5 loses to 19.fxe5 dxe5 20.dxe5, creating a strong passed pawn (and 20...Rxd5? or 20...Qxd5 21.Nf6+! wins)."
