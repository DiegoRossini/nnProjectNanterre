1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Queens pawn, to be quite honest i am far more comfortable playing the caro-kann."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,Pretty standard reply.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Taking up space on the queen side, all pretty standard in this type of game."
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"I'm pretty hit or miss with the KID, although i am pretty comfortable with it."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,All standard so far.
6,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,Fianchetto the bishop and castle.
7,e4,e2e4,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"Taking up more space, still very standard lines."
8,d6,d7d6,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,Required as i have to have some way to challenge the center.
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"So with my king tucked away it is time to start contesting the center, this is all pretty common in the KID."
10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 2 6,"So with my king tucked away it is time to start contesting the center, this is all pretty common in the KID."
11,Be2,f1e2,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 3 6,Still in the books...
12,Bg4,c8g4,rn1q1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP1b1/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 4 7,"I'm not quite sure about the merit of this move, is Bd7 the more appropriate move? My thought process was merely development at this point..."
13,Be3,c1e3,rn1q1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP1b1/2N1BN2/PP2BPPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 5 7,Bolstering the center.
14,Nbd7,b8d7,r2q1rk1/pppnppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP1b1/2N1BN2/PP2BPPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 6 8,I've seen people often play Na6 with the eventual intention of moving it to c7 but i just can't bring myself to move my Knight to a6. My intention is to continue to eye the center of the board. Thoughts?
15,O-O,e1g1,r2q1rk1/pppnppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP1b1/2N1BN2/PP2BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 7 8,"So for the most part i think this is all standard stuff. My king is safe, my pieces are developed, it is time to start to really fight for the center."
16,e5,e7e5,r2q1rk1/pppn1pbp/3p1np1/4p3/2PPP1b1/2N1BN2/PP2BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 9,Challenges the center of the board.
17,Rc1,a1c1,r2q1rk1/pppn1pbp/3p1np1/4p3/2PPP1b1/2N1BN2/PP2BPPP/2RQ1RK1 b - - 1 9,I usually encounter either dxe5 or d5.
18,Re8,f8e8,r2qr1k1/pppn1pbp/3p1np1/4p3/2PPP1b1/2N1BN2/PP2BPPP/2RQ1RK1 w - - 2 10,"Bolsters the center and if he doesn't play d5, i can open a line for my rook."
19,b4,b2b4,r2qr1k1/pppn1pbp/3p1np1/4p3/1PPPP1b1/2N1BN2/P3BPPP/2RQ1RK1 b - - 0 10,"? I'm not too sure about this move. Yes it continues to take up queen side space but the fight really is in the center of the board right now and that doesn't contribute all too much. Also, after exd4 white is going to lose a pawn."
20,exd4,e5d4,r2qr1k1/pppn1pbp/3p1np1/8/1PPpP1b1/2N1BN2/P3BPPP/2RQ1RK1 w - - 0 11,Now the e4 pawn will fall.
21,Nxd4,f3d4,r2qr1k1/pppn1pbp/3p1np1/8/1PPNP1b1/2N1B3/P3BPPP/2RQ1RK1 b - - 0 11,"However, first he initiates an exchange of bishops."
