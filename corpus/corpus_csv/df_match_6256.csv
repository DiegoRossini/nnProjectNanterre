1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I've been playing the Caro-Kann more often these days. It's not uncommon to derive claustrophobic positions from this opening but I enjoy its solidity.

3,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"2. f4 ?! 
Quite honestly, this was a twist for me. I am reminded of horrible experiences against the Grand Prix Attack in the Sicilian. I was also somewhat relieved when I remembered the difficulties White had in playing the King's Gambit."
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"With nothing to fear, I decide to carry out my original plan to occupy the centre and mobilize pieces."
5,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pP3/5P2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,I figured the Knight on the flank bolsters support against an early pawn storm while not impeding the dark-squared Bishop along the a3-f8 diagonal.

The bonus prize here included the doubled pawns on the f-file which are easily stopped and an open g-file to the King. The pawns on f4 and e5 will be useful in restricting White's dark-squared Bishop's mobility.
20,Nfxd4,f5d4,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1p3/1BppP3/3n1P2/3Q1P2/PPP4P/RNB2RK1 w kq - 0 11,Down goes the pawn.

26,bxc6,b7c6,r2qk2r/p3bppp/2p1p3/2ppPn2/5P2/2PQ1P2/PP5P/RNB2RK1 w kq - 0 14,White no longer has any minor pieces developed or significant presence in the middle. There are multiple lines toward White's King which can be exploited over time. I do not mind giving up the c6 pawn to the Queen.

At this point, I expected some attempt at removing my Knight (Nb3-c2-e3 or the like) and activation of the Bishop and Rook against my King. I was unclear of how to press against his King now."
