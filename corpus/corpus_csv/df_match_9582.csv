1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Playing as white. Queens pawn.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,? Dubious in my opinion. Neither attacks the center or flanks. Defends against the bishop pin on the knight.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,? Dubious in my opinion. Neither attacks the center or flanks. Defends against the bishop pin on the knight.
4,a6,a7a6,rnbqkb1r/1ppppppp/p4n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,? Dubious in my opinion. Neither attacks the center or flanks. Defends against the bishop pin on the knight.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/1ppppppp/p4n2/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,Developing the knight.
6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p3pn2/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Free's up the diagonal for the bishop.

10,h6,h7h6,rnbqkb1r/1pp2pp1/p3pn1p/3p4/2PP1B2/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,Again non developing move. Perhaps weakens king side slightly.
11,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/1pp2pp1/p3pn1p/3p4/2PP1B2/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,Free's the white bishop and defends the c4 pawn.

13,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqkb1r/1pp2p2/p3pnpp/3p4/2PP1B2/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 7,Here I'm looking at a bishop queen battery because I think he's going to castle king side.
14,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/1pp2pb1/p3pnpp/3p4/2PP1B2/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 8,Clears way for the king side castle.

I might be looking at a bishop sacrifice down the road to clear the defenders. I miss the intruding Nb4 when analyzing but I see the answer to the problem when the move comes."
