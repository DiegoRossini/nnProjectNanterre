1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"starting out with the English opening. I start out the game finding myself in a position I disliked because of some bad play in the opening, however as the middle game approaches I decide the time is ripe to sacrifice a pawn and suddenly all my pieces find themselves with beautiful squares/diagonals and I get to take control of the game as my opponent finds no real lines of attack."
