1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Perhaps nozar is a dedicated e4 player. I shouldn't be too concerned either way.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I've cut my teeth defending through the Sicilian. A powerful counter which may be unwieldy at times. Nevertheless, I think it is appropriate here. This should be a treat for both of us."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Well at least he's not a Grand Prix Attack player.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,Nc6 instead of d6 because I mean business today.
5,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,I aim my Kalashnikov...
6,cxd4,c5d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,I aim my Kalashnikov...
7,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,I aim my Kalashnikov...
8,e5,e7e5,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n5/4p3/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,I aim my Kalashnikov...
9,Nf3,d4f3,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,... and am left somewhat disappointed that White backs down
10,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,At least the tempo is good for development
11,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 6,Why not be bold? It's just a blitz.
12,Bb4,f8b4,r1bqk2r/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/1b2P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 4 7,Why not be bold? It's just a blitz.
13,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqk2r/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/4p1B1/1b2P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 5 7,White has joined the dance.

15,Bxf6,g5f6,r1bq1rk1/pp1p1ppp/2n2B2/4p3/1b2P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 8,Bxf6?! Once again nozar allows me to damage his pawn structure. I wonder if he understands the implications of doing so?

Somehow, I am going to isolate files a,b & c from the rest of the game and then force a pawn through.
