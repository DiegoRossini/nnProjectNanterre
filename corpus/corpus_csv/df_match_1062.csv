Maybe 5.Bg5 would have yielded a better defense here, and opens the possibility of a long castling."

There must be many better and aggressive alternatives for white here instead of the castling I did, like Ng5, but , again, I didn´t think much of it, I just wanted to finish the opening and not waste too much time in preemptive attacks."

I just felt shocked and it was that feeling that made me feel like my position was inferior, much worse than what it was in reality. I tried to look for a counterattack , but then, I found nothing; it seemed that black´s King is safe enough to focus on attack and I don´t have much left. It is one of those occasions when you feel like not accepting the gambit, because there must be a good reason not to (opening the column, etc) and yet, it is more than doable (after a light post-game analysis from my side)"
