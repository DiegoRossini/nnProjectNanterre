1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I like to play the queens pawn because it is less common and thus more likely to throw my opponent off

I played this game very badly, if your looking for a good learning game this isnt it, unless your me, which you aren't, so move along little doggy."
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"This is the obvious continuation, givnig me great central control"
3,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"This is the obvious continuation, givnig me great central control"
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,everything seems fine
5,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"This seems like a good move, cutting black back a bit early in the game

I also noticed upon annotation that this effectively crunches his king side while widening mine, obviously this had the opposite on my queenside, but shes not the most important peice on the board"
6,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,I dont really know how to respon properly to this
7,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/2PP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"I supose at the time  this seemed like a good move, I think i would play nf3 probably would have been a better response, or even the simple c3"
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2ppP3/2PP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"this is getting dangerous, 2 to 1 on d4 already"
9,Be3,c1e3,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2ppP3/2PP4/4B3/PP3PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 2 5,"this seemed good at the time an still does, based on where I am wtih this game"
10,Qb6,d8b6,r1b1kbnr/pp3ppp/1qn1p3/2ppP3/2PP4/4B3/PP3PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 3 6,"This is a terrible move effectivly destroying whatever hold I had on d4, I dont know what I was thinking, probably that I wanted to castle right quick. E2 would have been OK however the reality is that Nf3 would have been about 100 times better."
11,Bd3,f1d3,r1b1kbnr/pp3ppp/1qn1p3/2ppP3/2PP4/3BB3/PP3PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 4 6,"This is a terrible move effectivly destroying whatever hold I had on d4, I dont know what I was thinking, probably that I wanted to castle right quick.

12,cxd4,c5d4,r1b1kbnr/pp3ppp/1qn1p3/3pP3/2Pp4/3BB3/PP3PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 0 7,"It becomes apparent how bad my neglection of nf3 was, not to mention bd4 which continues to cause me greif"
13,Bd2,e3d2,r1b1kbnr/pp3ppp/1qn1p3/3pP3/2Pp4/3B4/PP1B1PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 1 7,...I think this speaks for itself
14,Nxe5,c6e5,r1b1kbnr/pp3ppp/1q2p3/3pn3/2Pp4/3B4/PP1B1PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 0 8,the lack of Nf3 continues to hound me
15,b3,b2b3,r1b1kbnr/pp3ppp/1q2p3/3pn3/2Pp4/1P1B4/P2B1PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 0 8,"Not bad, reinforces c4, recovers the b file from Qb6, which in my opinion black was a fool not to play on, not that he has a bad game at this point.

The problem with this move however is that it should have been made about 4 or 5 turns ago.  Qc2 would have been much better as it would have prevented Nxd3+"
16,Nxd3+,e5d3,r1b1kbnr/pp3ppp/1q2p3/3p4/2Pp4/1P1n4/P2B1PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 0 9,"Im not going to say anything more about the lack of Nf3

Now Im starting to get into some real trouble, loosing my ability to castle"
