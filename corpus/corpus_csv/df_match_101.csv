1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This was the last match of the 2016-7 season.
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"It is a sweet little game, where I mate him on move 21."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,So I play my usual.
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"This is the third or fourth time I have met this, this season, so it is obviously popular, at least at this level. See this game http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/colwyn-bay-v-malpas-oswestry?gm=62362"
5,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/3P4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,So I take again.
6,Nxd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3n4/3P4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,He takes back.
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3n4/3P4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"I deviate from the above mentioned game. The reason is on Wednesday April 12 I played in a quick-play tournament in Krakow. I was playing Julia Wiszniewska, 1054. She is just 9 years old. I had white. This was how the game started: 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 d5 3. cxd5 Nxd5 4. e4 Nf6 5. Bd3 Nc6 6. Ne2 I was quite happy with this, I seemed to have control of the centre.
But then came this
6..............e5
7.	d5	Nb4
8.	Nbc3	Bc5
9.	Bb1	Ng4
10.	O-O	Qh4
11.	h3	Nxf2
12.	Rxf2	Bxf2+
13.	Kh2	O-O
And I am just a pawn and the exchange down without any compensation. But after 
14.	a3	Na6
15.	Ba2	Nc5
16.	Qc2	f5
17.	b4	Nxe4
18.	Nxe4	fxe4
19.	Bb2	Bf5
20.	Bxe5	e3
21.	Qxc7	Rf7
22.	d6
I had at least equalised, and after 
........................Qe4??
23.	Qxf7+	Kh8
24.	Bxg7#
I had won a game I really should have lost."
8,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4p3/3n4/3P4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,I tend to think g6 going into a Grunfeld- type position is better.
9,e4,e2e4,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4p3/3n4/3PP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,Now I do take the centre.
10,Bb4+,f8b4,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4p3/3n4/1b1PP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,He throws in a check.
11,Nbd2,b1d2,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4p3/3n4/1b1PP3/5N2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 6,I thought it better to keep pieces on as I have the space advantage. I was slightly surprised to find out later that Bd2 is more common.
12,Nf6,d5f6,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/8/1b1PP3/5N2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 3 7,"Knight retreats. My e pawn is now attacked, as my Nd2 is pinned."
13,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/8/1b1PP3/3B1N2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 4 7,So I protect it.
14,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/8/1b1PP3/3B1N2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 5 8,"Attacking d4. c4 is probably better, maybe leading to  c5 8. Qb3 Nc6 9. dxc5 Bxc5 10. O-O O-O 11. Nc4 Qc7 12. e5 Ng4 13. Bf4 f6 14. Rae1 fxe5 15. Bxe5 Ncxe5 16. Nfxe5 Bxf2+ 17. Rxf2 Nxf2 18. Re3 Qc5 19. Be2 Ne4 20. Kh1 Nf2+ 21. Kg1 Ne4 22. Kh1 Nf2+ 23. Kg1"
15,a3,a2a3,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/8/1b1PP3/P2B1N2/1P1N1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,"If he takes on d2 I was going to take back with my queen, and if he then plays Nxd4 I can exchange knights and then win his queen with Bb5+"
16,Ba5,b4a5,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/b7/3PP3/P2B1N2/1P1N1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 9,"He drops back. I think Be7 was better, but he said he wanted to re-route the bishop to attack d4."
17,b4,b2b4,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/b7/1P1PP3/P2B1N2/3N1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 9,So I attack it again.
18,Bb6,a5b6,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/1bn1pn2/8/1P1PP3/P2B1N2/3N1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 10,He drops back.
19,Nb3,d2b3,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/1bn1pn2/8/1P1PP3/PN1B1N2/5PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 10,I give d4 more protection
20,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/1bn1pn2/8/1P1PP3/PN1B1N2/5PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 3 11,I think this is a mistake. What would you play now?
