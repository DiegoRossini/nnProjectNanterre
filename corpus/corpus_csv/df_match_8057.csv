3,c3,c2c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,This is a different take on the Sicilian than normal.  White looks to play 3. d4 and have a two-pawn center (pawns on d4 and e4).

20,Bb4,f8b4,r3k2r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/3q3b/1b1P4/4BN1P/PP2BPP1/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 1 11,"Out of book (book source: Chessmaster XI).  This move looks to control space deep in white's camp; however, white can play 11. a3 to drive that bishop off the square.  Chessmaster's annotation suggests Be7, simply opening up for the kingside castle (which this move does), and leading to 11. Nc3 Qd6.  Personally, I would play Bd6, challenging some of white's kingside control.
One other thing that this move does: it forces Deep Blue to begin calculations, as it is not in the computer's opening book."
