1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Once again I lost the toss and had to defend with black
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,So I play my usual.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 2,"And he does this, fairly standard, but ruling out certain variations, such as the 4 pawns attack or the samisch against the King's Indian. Maybe I should have played a King's Indian, with g6, Bg7, 0-0 and d6, but I played something else, which I have been playing in some Gameknot games."
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,Heading for either the Queen's Indian or Nimzo-Indian.
5,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,Keeping his choices of how he will develop his Bf1
6,b6,b7b6,rnbqkb1r/p1pp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,So I go into the Queen's Indian
7,g3,g2g3,rnbqkb1r/p1pp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,This is a common reply by white
8,Bb7,c8b7,rn1qkb1r/pbpp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,I develop
9,Bg2,f1g2,rn1qkb1r/pbpp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 5,So does he
10,Bb4+,f8b4,rn1qk2r/pbpp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/1bPP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 3 6,"I throw in a check, rather expecting Bd2 or Nbd2 transposing into The Bogoljubow Defence or Bogo-Indian."
11,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qk2r/pbpp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/1bPP4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 4 6,"But he played this. I would now call this the Nimzo/Queen's Indian hybrid, but Gameknot calls it Queen's pawn (A46), Torre attack, although that normally means playing 3. Bg5 by white."
12,O-O,e8g8,rn1q1rk1/pbpp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/1bPP4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 5 7,So I castle

14,d6,d7d6,rn1q1rk1/pbp2ppp/1p1ppn2/8/1bPP4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 8,"My plan is to exchange off my Bb4 and put my pawns on black squares. Not a bad plan, but it is better to play BxNc3 immediately, rather than give white a chance to avoid doubled pawns."
15,Qc2,d1c2,rn1q1rk1/pbp2ppp/1p1ppn2/8/1bPP4/2N2NP1/PPQ1PPBP/R1B2RK1 b - - 1 8,Now I can't double his pawns.
16,Nbd7,b8d7,r2q1rk1/pbpn1ppp/1p1ppn2/8/1bPP4/2N2NP1/PPQ1PPBP/R1B2RK1 w - - 2 9,I continue to develop.

19,Nb5,c3b5,r2q1rk1/pb1n1ppp/1p1ppn2/1Np5/1bPP4/5NP1/PPQ1PPBP/R1BR2K1 b - - 1 10,"Now I have problems, defending d6 and there is also risks to my Bb4."
20,Qe7,d8e7,r4rk1/pb1nqppp/1p1ppn2/1Np5/1bPP4/5NP1/PPQ1PPBP/R1BR2K1 w - - 2 11,So I defend d6
