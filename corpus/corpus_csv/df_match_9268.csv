8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/2p1p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 4 5,ultimately to allow a fight for d5

10,d6,d7d6,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2np1n2/2p1p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 6,stop knight advance ???
11,a3,a2a3,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2np1n2/2p1p3/2B1P3/P1N2N2/1PPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 6,stop knight advance ???
12,a6,a7a6,r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1np1n2/2p1p3/2B1P3/P1N2N2/1PPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,ok then 2 can play at that game !! but seriously this'll allow me to force his bishop out of the way
13,d3,d2d3,r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1np1n2/2p1p3/2B1P3/P1NP1N2/1PP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,to allow bishop room to manoeuvre?
14,Rb8,a8b8,1rbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1np1n2/2p1p3/2B1P3/P1NP1N2/1PP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w k - 1 8,mmmm all this to protect b7 pawn when i advance it. Don't know whether it's worth it but want to start pushing up the board now.
15,Bg5,c1g5,1rbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1np1n2/2p1p1B1/2B1P3/P1NP1N2/1PP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b k - 2 8,aah yes bishop out.. Will he really do knight for bishop ?? probably not i think just prevent me moving knight for a bit.. why ??
16,Be7,f8e7,1rbqk2r/1p2bppp/p1np1n2/2p1p1B1/2B1P3/P1NP1N2/1PP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w k - 3 9,don't like it so give added protection for queen
17,Bxf6,g5f6,1rbqk2r/1p2bppp/p1np1B2/2p1p3/2B1P3/P1NP1N2/1PP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b k - 0 9,oh didn't think he'd do that really can't see what this achieves. can't move knight to g5 as he must know i'll take bishop with my bishop which protects g5 ?? am i missing something here ??
18,Bxf6,e7f6,1rbqk2r/1p3ppp/p1np1b2/2p1p3/2B1P3/P1NP1N2/1PP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w k - 0 10,got to do this need pawn for defense only move that makes sense... feel a little bit vulnerable here he's chosing my moves for me
19,Bd5,c4d5,1rbqk2r/1p3ppp/p1np1b2/2pBp3/4P3/P1NP1N2/1PP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b k - 1 10,stop b7 pawn advance ??
20,Qb6,d8b6,1rb1k2r/1p3ppp/pqnp1b2/2pBp3/4P3/P1NP1N2/1PP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w k - 2 11,thought about move to c7 here but just thought i'd test the water and see what happens if i attack pawn.....he must move rook or perhaps pawn but maybe he'll move his queen allowing me to attack his f3 knight with bishop !! yeah right !
21,Rb1,a1b1,1rb1k2r/1p3ppp/pqnp1b2/2pBp3/4P3/P1NP1N2/1PP2PPP/1R1Q1RK1 b k - 3 11,as predicted foolish of me really...though you never know.  wasted move though.
22,Qc7,b6c7,1rb1k2r/1pq2ppp/p1np1b2/2pBp3/4P3/P1NP1N2/1PP2PPP/1R1Q1RK1 w k - 4 12,back to original plan queen c7 gonna advance pawn
23,h3,h2h3,1rb1k2r/1pq2ppp/p1np1b2/2pBp3/4P3/P1NP1N1P/1PP2PP1/1R1Q1RK1 b k - 0 12,well that stops a move to g4 with bishop
24,Bxh3,c8h3,1r2k2r/1pq2ppp/p1np1b2/2pBp3/4P3/P1NP1N1b/1PP2PP1/1R1Q1RK1 w k - 0 13,gave this move a lot of thought as it puts me at quite a bit of a piece disadvantage but this will open his king up
25,gxh3,g2h3,1r2k2r/1pq2ppp/p1np1b2/2pBp3/4P3/P1NP1N1P/1PP2P2/1R1Q1RK1 b k - 0 13,ok
