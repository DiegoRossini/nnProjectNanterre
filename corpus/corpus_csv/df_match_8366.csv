1,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/2N5/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 1,"Hi everyone!

After I lost another game to Freddy (yes, you've guessed it - I got Freddied again!), I will be annotating that one soon - I thought I would do some homework on him - he is dubbed the Master Mater among some of us U1900 players.  Freddy's unfortunate opponent here who had a starting rating of 1860 was a fellow Sneaky Knight member.  I thought I would annotate this because it included a successful queen sac and mating attack from Freddy, always worth annotating that.

Freddy kicks off with his favourite opening, the Dunst with 1. Nc3."

6,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/1b1PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"4. e5 - a bit of a cross-breed this position, like an Advanced Winawer French Defense."
7,e5,e4e5,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3pP3/1b1P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"4. e5 - a bit of a cross-breed this position, like an Advanced Winawer French Defense."
8,Qd7,d8d7,rnb1k1nr/pppq1ppp/4p3/3pP3/1b1P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"4. ....... Qd7 - mmm, shuts in black's dsb."
9,Qg4,d1g4,rnb1k1nr/pppq1ppp/4p3/3pP3/1b1P2Q1/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 2 5,5. ...... Bf8 - black's development goes into reverse.
10,Bf8,b4f8,rnb1kbnr/pppq1ppp/4p3/3pP3/3P2Q1/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 3 6,5. ...... Bf8 - black's development goes into reverse.
11,Nh3,g1h3,rnb1kbnr/pppq1ppp/4p3/3pP3/3P2Q1/2N4N/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 4 6,6. Nh3 - Freddy has developed his knight to this square in some of my games before.  Although the knight is on the rim it can go to f4 or g5.
12,Ne7,g8e7,rnb1kb1r/pppqnppp/4p3/3pP3/3P2Q1/2N4N/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 5 7,6. ...... Ne7 - development but it hems in black's dsb.
13,Nf4,h3f4,rnb1kb1r/pppqnppp/4p3/3pP3/3P1NQ1/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 6 7,7. ...... g6 - black plans to fianchetto his dsb.
14,g6,g7g6,rnb1kb1r/pppqnp1p/4p1p1/3pP3/3P1NQ1/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 0 8,7. ...... g6 - black plans to fianchetto his dsb.
15,Be3,c1e3,rnb1kb1r/pppqnp1p/4p1p1/3pP3/3P1NQ1/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 1 8,"8. Be3 - Freddy clears the decks, he is now ready to castle queenside.  This bishop move also supports the d4 pawn and points at h6 with possibilities of exchanging off black's dsb and exploiting the holes should black choose to castle there."
16,Nf5,e7f5,rnb1kb1r/pppq1p1p/4p1p1/3pPn2/3P1NQ1/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 2 9,"8. ...... Nf5 - good move - puts knight on a more active square and black has the option of moving his bishop back to b4 or to put it on g7.  On balance, despite my previous note I think g7 is the better choice.  Black now starts a pawn roll, hoping that white will castle kingside with 9. h5."
17,Bd3,f1d3,rnb1kb1r/pppq1p1p/4p1p1/3pPn2/3P1NQ1/2NBB3/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 3 9,11. ...... Nf5 - strange knight manoeuvres over the last two moves.  Maybe Nc6 may have been a better plan here - clear the decks I say!
18,h5,h7h5,rnb1kb1r/pppq1p2/4p1p1/3pPn1p/3P1NQ1/2NBB3/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 10,11. ...... Nf5 - strange knight manoeuvres over the last two moves.  Maybe Nc6 may have been a better plan here - clear the decks I say!

Black no doubt would have liked to have put a rook on g8 but unfortunately for him the h pawn is hanging.  It would be very dangerous for black to castle kingside here and his queenside is clogged up.  The centre is very solid so the BK looks safe, but white is Master Freddy!"
24,gxf5,g6f5,rnb1kb1r/pppq1p2/4p3/3pPp1p/3P1N2/2N1BQ2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 13,"12. ....... gxf5 - leaves the g file wide open for Freddy, but how can he exploit it?

27,h4,h2h4,rnb1k2r/pppqbp2/4p3/3pPp1N/3P3P/2N1BQ2/PPP2PP1/R3K2R b KQkq - 0 14,"14. ....... Rg8 - I think I would have played that move, but Freddy now weighs in with 15. Bg5! which threatens and exchange of dsb's followed by that knight fork in my previous note."
28,Rg8,h8g8,rnb1k1r1/pppqbp2/4p3/3pPp1N/3P3P/2N1BQ2/PPP2PP1/R3K2R w KQq - 1 15,"14. ....... Rg8 - I think I would have played that move, but Freddy now weighs in with 15. Bg5! which threatens and exchange of dsb's followed by that knight fork in my previous note."

33,Bxf6,g5f6,rnb1k3/pppq1p2/4pBr1/3pPp2/3P3P/2N2Q2/PPP2PP1/R3K2R b KQq - 0 17,"17. ....... Nc6 - the queen knight develops at last, but black cannot castle queenside as Freddy's dsb is nicely anchored on f6 - that is even if black manages to get that lsb out!"

Nxd4 - this seems a reasonable try, grab a pawn and attack the enemy queen and make way for his own queen to come out, but with that passed h pawn I am not sure that was a good idea.  Maybe Rh6 and if Bg5 then Rh7, blocking the h file followed by Ne7, blocking out the white dsb and adding a defense to g8, this would enable black to play a move like b6 then Bb7 then 0-0-0.  Black never gets the chance to do this however.  Freddy now does something absolutely surprising ........ wait for it ........"
