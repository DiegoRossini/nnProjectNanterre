1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Solohawk and I have played many times, and although I do play d4 sometimes, I prefer e4 most of the time. I like to open the position and get rid of the major pieces. My feeling is that I can outplay my opponent if we both just have minor pieces. I usually am content to win a pawn in the opening and then just grind out a winning endgame."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Solohawk almost always answers e4 with ...e5. If he ever played a Sicilian, French, or Caro-Kann, I would probably die of a heart attack. I believe he has played the Scandinavian, but it is rare for him to vary from ...e5."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Considered the best move as it develops a piece with an attack.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"A standard reply that defends the e-pawn with a developing move. Other replies are playable, but this is by far the most popular."
5,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"This move initiates the Scotch Game. It is an attempt by white to continue the attack on black's central pawn. Although black can achieve equality in most lines, the Scotch Game has experienced a resurgence since Kasparov started playing it."
6,exd4,e5d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Refusing this capture leads to an advantage for white, so this move is almost forced."
7,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"The main line, although white can enter the Scotch Gambit with Bc4."
8,Nxd4,c6d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3nP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,Black varies from theory and lets white have a central space advantage. Main line moves are ...Nf6 and ...Bc5. Also playable is Steinitz's ...Qh4.
9,Qxd4,d1d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"Forced to maintain material equality. This is an optimal pawn structure for white in an e4 opening. Black's remaining central pawn will be on the third rank, while white's is on the fourth."
10,Ne7,g8e7,r1bqkb1r/ppppnppp/8/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 1 6,"A somewhat awkward development for a piece that belongs on f6, but black was afraid of e5, when the knight has no where to go. By blocking the a3-f8 diagonal, it will be hard for the dark bishop to develop."
11,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkb1r/ppppnppp/8/8/2BQP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 2 6,"White simply develops a piece that prepares castling on the next move. Both sides are also fighting for control of the d5 square. If black could play ...d5 and trade off white's central pawn, white's space advantage would disappear."
12,c6,c7c6,r1bqkb1r/pp1pnppp/2p5/8/2BQP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 7,"Helping to prepare ...d5, and maybe creating a diagonal for the queen to use."
13,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkb1r/pp1pnppp/2p5/8/2BQP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 1 7,"White takes care of king safety, which is one of the main goals in the opening."
14,d5,d7d5,r1bqkb1r/pp2nppp/2p5/3p4/2BQP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB2RK1 w kq - 0 8,And black has achieved the pawn break that will free his position.
15,exd5,e4d5,r1bqkb1r/pp2nppp/2p5/3P4/2BQ4/8/PPP2PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 0 8,"I played this move automatically, but looking back, I should have given some thought to:
8. Bd3 dxe4
9. Qxd8  Kxd8
10. Bxe4
This would achieve my goal of getting the queens off. Maybe next time..."
16,cxd5,c6d5,r1bqkb1r/pp2nppp/8/3p4/2BQ4/8/PPP2PPP/RNB2RK1 w kq - 0 9,"It is clear that black will end up with an isolated d-pawn at the end of the exchanges on d5. The only question is how many pairs of pieces will leave the board before the pawn recaptures. With this move, black keeps as much material as possible on the board. If he had played ...Nxd5, I would have replied 9. Bxd5. And if he then captured with the queen, I would have traded queens as well."
17,Bb3,c4b3,r1bqkb1r/pp2nppp/8/3p4/3Q4/1B6/PPP2PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 1 9,"Solohawk told me he expected Bd3, but I wanted to keep the isolated d-pawn under attack. Also, it is pretty clear that black can't castle long, so this keeps the bishop trained on the square the black king will end up on."
18,Be6,c8e6,r2qkb1r/pp2nppp/4b3/3p4/3Q4/1B6/PPP2PPP/RNB2RK1 w kq - 2 10,"Overprotecting the d-pawn with a developing move, but on this square, the bishop is little more than a glorified pawn."
19,Nc3,b1c3,r2qkb1r/pp2nppp/4b3/3p4/3Q4/1BN5/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 3 10,"Developing, and continuing to pressure black's d-pawn."
20,h6,h7h6,r2qkb1r/pp2npp1/4b2p/3p4/3Q4/1BN5/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 0 11,"Apparently to preclude Bg5, but black needs to figure out what to do with his dark bishop. Perhaps he should play ...Nf5 to let the bishop out, but white's development is more harmonious than black's in any event."
