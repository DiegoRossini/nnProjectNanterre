1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Sometimes it's the minor things that set up the attack. In this French Defense mini-tournament game white uses a rather passive move (7.h3) to block black's attack against his dark square bishop. Black later takes aim at exactly that square. Let's see where this leads.

11,Be3,c1e3,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2nb4/3p4/3P4/2PBB3/PP3PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 4 6,One of black's plans would be to eliminate the e3 bishop with Ng4. This move is in response to that threat. However a direct 7.Nf3 is better. The line 7.Nf3 Ng4 8.0-0 Nxe3 9.Re1 with recapture poses no problems for white.
