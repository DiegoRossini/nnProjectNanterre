1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"just a quick game here, but interesting nonetheless. In this game, an early sacrifice from White leads to an immediate advantage, but Black fights back. White needs to complete the attack - but how can he do that?"
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,A King's Pawn opening
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"This isn't the best move in this position, as White has a counter that immediately breaks up Black's defence..."
4,f6,f7f6,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"This isn't the best move in this position, as White has a counter that immediately breaks up Black's defence..."
5,Nxe5,f3e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"not unheard of, but it is the first time I have been able to do this :)"
6,fxe5,f6e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"recommended in the DB here is Qe7, which at least relieves Black from the pressure of White's next move..."
7,Qh5+,d1h5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4p2Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 1 4,! Both paths lead to imminent danger from Black!
8,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pppp3p/6p1/4p2Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"While this move loses the rook for Black, the alternative isn't really that much better positionally; 4...Ke7 5.Qxe5+ Kf7 6.Bf4+ d5 [to stop Qf5+ after the King moves to g6] 7.Bxd5+ Kg6 8.d4 and White already has a formidable attack"
9,Qxe5+,h5e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp3p/6p1/4Q3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"here, Black now has the ability to counter-attack..."
10,Qe7,d8e7,rnb1kbnr/ppppq2p/6p1/4Q3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 1 6,"here, Black now has the ability to counter-attack..."
11,Qxh8,e5h8,rnb1kbnQ/ppppq2p/6p1/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQq - 0 6,"...as shown. Though Black has to deal with a dangerous queen, his own queen provides the making of a counter-attack"
12,Qxe4+,e7e4,rnb1kbnQ/pppp3p/6p1/8/4q3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQq - 0 7,"...as shown. Though Black has to deal with a dangerous queen, his own queen provides the making of a counter-attack"
13,Be2,f1e2,rnb1kbnQ/pppp3p/6p1/8/4q3/8/PPPPBPPP/RNB1K2R b KQq - 1 7,"? drops the pawn on g2, and now Black's queen may be a thorn in White's side as well..."
14,Qxg2,e4g2,rnb1kbnQ/pppp3p/6p1/8/8/8/PPPPBPqP/RNB1K2R w KQq - 0 8,"such as stopping White from castling (ironically, I played Be2 to keep kingside castling a possibility for White)"
15,Rf1,h1f1,rnb1kbnQ/pppp3p/6p1/8/8/8/PPPPBPqP/RNB1KR2 b Qq - 1 8,"getting his knight out of harm's way, and protecting the g6 pawn, as it's defender will be gone very soon...."
16,Ne7,g8e7,rnb1kb1Q/ppppn2p/6p1/8/8/8/PPPPBPqP/RNB1KR2 w Qq - 2 9,"getting his knight out of harm's way, and protecting the g6 pawn, as it's defender will be gone very soon...."
17,Qxh7,h8h7,rnb1kb2/ppppn2Q/6p1/8/8/8/PPPPBPqP/RNB1KR2 b Qq - 0 9,"?! perhaps a developing move would have been better here, such as 9...d5 (striking a claim to the centre and opening up a path for the bishop) or 9...Nc6"
18,Qe4,g2e4,rnb1kb2/ppppn2Q/6p1/8/4q3/8/PPPPBP1P/RNB1KR2 w Qq - 1 10,"?! perhaps a developing move would have been better here, such as 9...d5 (striking a claim to the centre and opening up a path for the bishop) or 9...Nc6"
19,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1kb2/ppppn2Q/6p1/8/4q3/2N5/PPPPBP1P/R1B1KR2 b Qq - 2 10,"I end up losing the c-pawn here as well, but that knight has its uses here (though I haven't seen it yet at this point)"
20,Qxc2,e4c2,rnb1kb2/ppppn2Q/6p1/8/8/2N5/PPqPBP1P/R1B1KR2 w Qq - 0 11,"fortunately for White, the rest of White's pieces are well protected, so the reign of terror from the enemy Queen is now over (though she is in a strong position)"
21,Rg1,f1g1,rnb1kb2/ppppn2Q/6p1/8/8/2N5/PPqPBP1P/R1B1K1R1 b Qq - 1 11,"I guess I could have driven the Queen away with Bd1, but like I've said I'm not worried about the Queen at this point - I look to exploit Black's weakened kingside"
22,d6,d7d6,rnb1kb2/ppp1n2Q/3p2p1/8/8/2N5/PPqPBP1P/R1B1K1R1 w Qq - 0 12,"opens up room for the White bishop, but it never does come out to play. I now see a way to relieve Black's control over g6..."
23,d3,d2d3,rnb1kb2/ppp1n2Q/3p2p1/8/8/2NP4/PPq1BP1P/R1B1K1R1 b Qq - 0 12,"step #1 - cut off the Black queen. If Black could see what I was planning, he'd play c6."
24,Nbc6,b8c6,r1b1kb2/ppp1n2Q/2np2p1/8/8/2NP4/PPq1BP1P/R1B1K1R1 w Qq - 1 13,"nope, Black doesn't see it, and now White delivers the killer blow..."
25,Nd5,c3d5,r1b1kb2/ppp1n2Q/2np2p1/3N4/8/3P4/PPq1BP1P/R1B1K1R1 b Qq - 2 13,"! one way or another, the knight defender will have to go, and as far as I can see there is no way to save the g-pawn - alt. variation [should Black see the importance of the g-pawn] 13...Ne5 14.Nxe7 Bxe7 15.Rxg6 Nxg6 16.Qxg6+ Kd8 17.Qg8+ Bf8 18.Bg7+ Kd7 19.Bg4# ((tell me if I made a mistake on this, it's the longest analysis I've ever done))"
