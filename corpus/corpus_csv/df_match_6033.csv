1,b4,b2b4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/1P6/8/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"A modern chess master, with encyclopedic knowledge of every opening [even the unusual ones], would have no problem with this move. But Gerlach is caught off guard."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/1P6/8/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Gerlach responds by placing a Pawn in the center.
3,Bb2,c1b2,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/1P6/8/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,The logical follow-up.
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/1P6/8/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Guarding his advanced Pawn and opening a line for his KB.
5,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/1P6/4P3/PBPP1PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,Hoping to sucker Gerlach into his pitfall.
6,Bxb4,f8b4,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/1b6/4P3/PBPP1PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Winning a Pawn is a good move....
7,Bxg7,b2g7,rnbqk1nr/ppp2pBp/4p3/3p4/1b6/4P3/P1PP1PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,...but winning a Rook is a better one! Gerlach of course resigned.
