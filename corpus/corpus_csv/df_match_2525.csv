17,Bd2,c1d2,r1bq1rk1/pp3pbp/2nppnp1/2p5/2B1P3/P1NP1N1P/1PPB1PP1/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 9,A better place for the bishop is on g5 where it pins the black knight.
18,d5,d6d5,r1bq1rk1/pp3pbp/2n1pnp1/2pp4/2B1P3/P1NP1N1P/1PPB1PP1/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 10,I played this instead of exd5 because the only way for white to safely dispose of the knight is to take with the bishop which gives me the bishop pair. Taking with the knight fails to exd5 B moves Bxb2 winning a pawn. If white doesn't take then I can double his pawns.
