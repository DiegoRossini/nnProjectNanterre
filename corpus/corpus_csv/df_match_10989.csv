1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Black built up a series of small advantages to break through and win a pawn on move 20.  The game continued with a rook on the 2nd rank that confined white's king, allowed black to advance up the board, and mate.

Please feel free to message me if you have comments, questions, or find any mistakes."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The Sicilian defence breaks symmetry by contesting the d4 square with the c pawn rather than the e pawn.  White often attacks the kingside while black obtains a queenside advantage.

Grandmaster John Nunn noted that the reason for the Sicilian Defence’s popularity “is its combative nature; in many lines Black is playing not just for equality, but for the advantage. The drawback is that White often obtains an early initiative, so Black has to take care not to fall victim to a quick attack.”"

2. Nf3 is most common."

Better is Nc3, contesting the center d6 square."

Better is Nc3."
