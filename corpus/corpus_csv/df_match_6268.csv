1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hello, today I will annotate a game between two 1300s players. This game was a long one, but black came out much better in the end. Beginner players should look at this annotation, because it highlights some of the most important mistakes and misconceptions made by them. 

White begins d4, the queen pawn game."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"double d pawn opening. One important rule in these double d pawn opening is:

Don't block the c pawn with a knight unless necessary. Why? Because the c pawn's advance to c4(c5 for black) will ensure a breakdown of the opponent's d pawn, and thus breaking down or at least pressuring the pawn. Also, if it is possible in dd openings, the knight behind the c pawn will give that side more space and an easier game. The c-pawn gains central space."
3,h3,h2h3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/7P/PPP1PPP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"a waste of time. Inexperienced players do not know when to play this move. a3,a6,h3,h6 should only be played when there is a reason to play it.Reasons include:

1.A piece may go there with a THREAT 
2.The king needs an escape square.
3.it may be necessary to support other moves in some positions.
4.it restricts a piece's only good square

here, none of these apply. One more thing is, don't play that just to stop a bishop from pinning a knight. If the bishop has no more good squares,  or the pin is a threat, then the move may be necessary."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3p4/3P4/7P/PPP1PPP1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"Playable, but black may have a space shortage if white plays well."
5,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3p4/3P4/5N1P/PPP1PPP1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 3,perfectly ok.
6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3p4/3P4/5N1P/PPP1PPP1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 3 4,"white's setup can be something like  e3,c4,Nc3.. with good play"

If black had just guarded his position, he would still be winning."
