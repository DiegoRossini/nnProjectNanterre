2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"this is the beginning point of the tournament. Nowadays white does not play 8. Qc2 as this tournament bares out white has difficulty getting any real advantage from it. Matter of fact I feel that black has the better chances. Black has strong play on the queenside and sometimes along the c-file if it ever opens up.

16,b5,b7b5,r1bq1rk1/p2nbppp/2p1pn2/1p1p4/2PP4/5NP1/PPQNPPBP/R1B2RK1 w - - 0 9,Black has other alternatives but this one is by far the most active. I like it because the follow up a5-a4 can create some serious problems for white if he does not meet it correctly.
17,c5,c4c5,r1bq1rk1/p2nbppp/2p1pn2/1pPp4/3P4/5NP1/PPQNPPBP/R1B2RK1 b - - 0 9,Cxb5 is also playable for white but 9. C5 has the advantage of a slight plus in space and making black feel cramped in this position white enjoys a slight plus. With 9. Cxb5 cxb5 chances are equal.
18,h6,h7h6,r1bq1rk1/p2nbpp1/2p1pn1p/1pPp4/3P4/5NP1/PPQNPPBP/R1B2RK1 w - - 0 10,!? a bit off tempo and not provoked. Better is 9. ...A5 with a double edged game.
19,a3,a2a3,r1bq1rk1/p2nbpp1/2p1pn1p/1pPp4/3P4/P4NP1/1PQNPPBP/R1B2RK1 b - - 0 10,this is kind of a preventive move that discourages a b5-b4 thrust that is a typical black sorte.
20,a5,a7a5,r1bq1rk1/3nbpp1/2p1pn1p/ppPp4/3P4/P4NP1/1PQNPPBP/R1B2RK1 w - - 0 11,supporting a e4 thrust.
21,Re1,f1e1,r1bq1rk1/3nbpp1/2p1pn1p/ppPp4/3P4/P4NP1/1PQNPPBP/R1B1R1K1 b - - 1 11,supporting a e4 thrust.
22,Re8,f8e8,r1bqr1k1/3nbpp1/2p1pn1p/ppPp4/3P4/P4NP1/1PQNPPBP/R1B1R1K1 w - - 2 12,? not the best move for me as it deprives me of blacks main manouver against e4-e5 which is Ne8-Nc7. the best way to keep the whtie e4 thrust in check was 11...Bb7.
23,e4,e2e4,r1bqr1k1/3nbpp1/2p1pn1p/ppPp4/3PP3/P4NP1/1PQN1PBP/R1B1R1K1 b - - 0 12,I am running into a bit of a space issue. my problem is that I do not have any good developing squares for my peices. So the up coming 13. E5 is very good for white and sets me on my heels a bit. In such positions where you are cramped it is easy to go array. The best way to handle the cramping feeling is to exchange peices without creating pawn weaknesses.
24,Qc7,d8c7,r1b1r1k1/2qnbpp1/2p1pn1p/ppPp4/3PP3/P4NP1/1PQN1PBP/R1B1R1K1 w - - 1 13,eek black is in a bit of trouble as white is going to have a huge central wedge. But having said that there is no open lines for white to exploit. The key is that if your opponent has a space advantage keep things closed because his pieces will not be able to make use of the space.
25,e5,e4e5,r1b1r1k1/2qnbpp1/2p1pn1p/ppPpP3/3P4/P4NP1/1PQN1PBP/R1B1R1K1 b - - 0 13,looking for the exchange of pieces on g5
26,Nh7,f6h7,r1b1r1k1/2qnbppn/2p1p2p/ppPpP3/3P4/P4NP1/1PQN1PBP/R1B1R1K1 w - - 1 14,looking for the exchange of pieces on g5
27,Nf1,d2f1,r1b1r1k1/2qnbppn/2p1p2p/ppPpP3/3P4/P4NP1/1PQ2PBP/R1B1RNK1 b - - 2 14,this knight is going to e3 and also adds influence on g5
28,Ng5,h7g5,r1b1r1k1/2qnbpp1/2p1p2p/ppPpP1n1/3P4/P4NP1/1PQ2PBP/R1B1RNK1 w - - 3 15,I decide to go ahead with the plan to create some breathing room for my pieces at the cost of a minor pawn weakness. This has the plus of exchanging a weak knight for a stronger one.
29,Nxg5,f3g5,r1b1r1k1/2qnbpp1/2p1p2p/ppPpP1N1/3P4/P5P1/1PQ2PBP/R1B1RNK1 b - - 0 15,"The pawn capture is a most because 
15. ...Bxg5 is met with 

16.Bxg5 hxg5 17.h3 f5 18.Nh2 Qd8 19.Qd2 Nf8 20.Bf1 Nh7 21.Bd3 
with a clear advantage for white."
30,hxg5,h6g5,r1b1r1k1/2qnbpp1/2p1p3/ppPpP1p1/3P4/P5P1/1PQ2PBP/R1B1RNK1 w - - 0 16,"The pawn capture is a most because

an overly aggressive move that gives white winning chances.  Perhaps the quieter 16. ...Qd8 is in order."

This causes me to loss my nerve and abandon my orgrinal idea of 16. ...f6 17. ...fxe5 with white's centre showing signs of fatigue. However, if I follow through with this plan it must work or I am dead. In the end, I decided to go for a draw and see if I can clog up the kingside so white can not mate me."
34,Qd8,c7d8,r1bqr1k1/3nb1p1/2p1pp2/ppPpP1p1/3P4/P3B1P1/1PQN1PBP/R3R1K1 w - - 2 18,"I played 16. ...f6 more out of instinct than looking at it.

36,Nf8,d7f8,r1bqrnk1/4b1p1/2p1ppQ1/ppPpP1p1/3P4/P3B1P1/1P1N1PBP/R3R1K1 w - - 4 19,This shores up some of the light square weaknesses around the king
37,Qh5,g6h5,r1bqrnk1/4b1p1/2p1pp2/ppPpP1pQ/3P4/P3B1P1/1P1N1PBP/R3R1K1 b - - 5 19,this is the most stiff defence because it is easier for black to fight on the light squares of g6 and h7. Rather on the dark squares of g7 and h6.
38,f5,f6f5,r1bqrnk1/4b1p1/2p1p3/ppPpPppQ/3P4/P3B1P1/1P1N1PBP/R3R1K1 w - - 0 20,this is the most stiff defence because it is easier for black to fight on the light squares of g6 and h7. Rather on the dark squares of g7 and h6.
