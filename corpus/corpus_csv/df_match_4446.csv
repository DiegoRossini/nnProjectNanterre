8,Qh4,d8h4,r1b1kbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3NP2q/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,This is the most aggressive move.
9,Nc3,b1c3,r1b1kbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3NP2q/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,Nb5 is also possible which is the Horwitz attack but I think it just loses a pawn.
10,Bc5,f8c5,r1b1k1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b5/3NP2q/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 3 6,I think black forgot some theory about this line. I play
11,Be3,c1e3,r1b1k1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b5/3NP2q/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 4 6,Develops a piece and protects d4.
12,d6,d7d6,r1b1k1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/2b5/3NP2q/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,A rather passive move. Defends c5. I didn't want to capture on c6 as it would give him an open b file. Also it loses after Bxe3.
13,Bc4,f1c4,r1b1k1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/2b5/2BNP2q/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 7,Challenges my central control and if 8. Exf5 then Nxd4 wins. I'm in a pretty tricky positino and I probably have already blundered.

15,Ncb5,c3b5,r1b1k1nr/ppp3pp/2np4/1Nb2p2/2BNP2q/4B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 8,Going for some counterplay. Attacks c7 and threatens a rather uselss fork since black won't be using that rook for a while.
16,Qxe4,h4e4,r1b1k1nr/ppp3pp/2np4/1Nb2p2/2BNq3/4B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 9,The wrong move. Better was Qe2.
