4,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3pPb2/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"Threatens to exchange my lsb. I assume I will eventually lose this good bishop, but I can save it playing a3 to leave the a2 square for it. It is not necessarily a good plan, both are playable for black (IMO). In such positions, black has to think about defending carefully and try to untangle armoniously his pieces, but in my experience black can succeed on this task."

9,Be2,f1e2,rn1qkbnr/ppp2pp1/4p2p/3pPb2/3P4/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,"Another try, more aggressive, is c4, hitting the centre. If black goes (say) c6, c5 blocks black, who is squeezed. Or black can go for a Tartakower-like system, replaying c5 to c4 by white. 
The played move indicates my opponent is not willing to attack very quickly."

Not that this would be a terrible thing: black can perfectly hold against it, if he plays the correct moves for defence."

Another idea would have been Qa5, threatening BxN and Qxa8. Doubtful..."

Now, the lsb IS valuable, and I can play this (instead of developing my dead kingside) because I can save it. White didn't play f4!, that is a ""must"" in this kind of positions for white to attack."

I had to keep my bishop, even if it meant to leave the knight trapped on his home square. I didn't like it at all, so I realized my previous plan was pure crap. Ok.
