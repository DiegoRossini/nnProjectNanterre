1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"White drags the queen out early, threatening black's e pawn while setting himself up for a four move checkmate.  Black feels obligated to protect the pawn before spending time chasing the white queen.  The nice thing about coming out with the queen (for black) is that white may end up moving the queen many time while black develops his position.

White, however, is far too smart for that.  Despite the early queen gambit he plays very well."
