1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is the 8th of my long running series of how not to play chess. In this particular game I felt as though I successfully managed to grasp defeat from the jaws of victory.

This is a genuine case of a game of two halves. It was a ladder game which resulted from a challenge from armorpawn. I find it's common in ladders to get challenges from much higher rated players, my challenge in these cases is to give them something to think about. The action starts with the English opening."
