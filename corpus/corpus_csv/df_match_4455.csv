1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I start with the usual
2,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,He plays the Dutch
3,g3,g2g3,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/3P4/6P1/PPP1PP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,I play with the recommended
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppppp1pp/5n2/5p2/3P4/6P1/PPP1PP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,Stil main line
5,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqkb1r/ppppp1pp/5n2/5p2/3P4/6P1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 3,Natural follow-up
6,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/ppppp2p/5np1/5p2/3P4/6P1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 4,He opts for the Lenningrad variation - or should we be calling it the St Peter's Burg now?
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/ppppp2p/5np1/5p2/3P4/2N3P1/PPP1PPBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 4,"I thought, now that there is no danger of him playing Bf8-b4, why not threaten an early e4"
8,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppppp1bp/5np1/5p2/3P4/2N3P1/PPP1PPBP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 2 5,He develops
9,e4,e2e4,rnbqk2r/ppppp1bp/5np1/5p2/3PP3/2N3P1/PPP2PBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,So why not advance in the centre?
10,d6,d7d6,rnbqk2r/ppp1p1bp/3p1np1/5p2/3PP3/2N3P1/PPP2PBP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,"He doesn't play what is normally played in this position, which is 5....fxe4. Now here Santos, Carlos P (2379) vs. Dias, Paulo (2267) continued with 6. e5 Nh5 7. f4 with advantage to white, but I didn't like the look of 6. e5 dxe5 7. dxe5 Qxd1ch, so I played something different"
11,Nge2,g1e2,rnbqk2r/ppp1p1bp/3p1np1/5p2/3PP3/2N3P1/PPP1NPBP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,And I continued with my development.
12,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1p1bp/3p1np1/5p2/3PP3/2N3P1/PPP1NPBP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 2 7,"and so does he. I decided it was time to develop my Bc1. But where to put it? Be3, Bf4 and Bg5 can be hit by Ng4, Nh5 or h6 respectively. So why not send it out the other way? aqeel (1770) vs. invincible1 (1790) continued 7. O-O fxe4 8. Nxe4 c6 9. a4 Nbd7 10. Bf4 here."
13,b3,b2b3,rnbq1rk1/ppp1p1bp/3p1np1/5p2/3PP3/1PN3P1/P1P1NPBP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 7,So I prepare to play it to b2 or a3
14,c6,c7c6,rnbq1rk1/pp2p1bp/2pp1np1/5p2/3PP3/1PN3P1/P1P1NPBP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 8,"c6 is a typical move in this variation, although exchanging on e4 is better"
15,O-O,e1g1,rnbq1rk1/pp2p1bp/2pp1np1/5p2/3PP3/1PN3P1/P1P1NPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 8,I castle
16,Qe8,d8e8,rnb1qrk1/pp2p1bp/2pp1np1/5p2/3PP3/1PN3P1/P1P1NPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 2 9,This is another mistake
17,e5,e4e5,rnb1qrk1/pp2p1bp/2pp1np1/4Pp2/3P4/1PN3P1/P1P1NPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 9,Because this is now very powerful
18,Nfd7,f6d7,rnb1qrk1/pp1np1bp/2pp2p1/4Pp2/3P4/1PN3P1/P1P1NPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 10,A sad treat
19,f4,f2f4,rnb1qrk1/pp1np1bp/2pp2p1/4Pp2/3P1P2/1PN3P1/P1P1N1BP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 10,Must re-enforce the centre
20,d5,d6d5,rnb1qrk1/pp1np1bp/2p3p1/3pPp2/3P1P2/1PN3P1/P1P1N1BP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 11,"He stabilises the centre, but maybe c5 hitting the centre was better"
