1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I opted to annotate this game as a training discussion for my team, The Burninators.  It starts off easily enough as a three knights game."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The development thus far is pretty standard stuff that I have played as white a time or two.  I decided to spice things up a bit and start a charge to see how white would react.  One of the things that discomfits people is the unexpected play.  My guess is that white has not played against this variation before, when I played my next move."

8,Nxe4,f6e4,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1n3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,This is a very aggressive early play by black.  On the surface it is a positional play to exchange material early and often for a more open game.
9,Nxe4,c3e4,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1N3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"Takes the pawn, allowing the pawn pin."
10,d5,d7d5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/3pp3/2B1N3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"There are a lot of potential responses.  My favorite is Bd3, keeping pressure on the king's bishop pawn and doubling up the e-file pawn.  Another popular play is Bxd5."
11,Neg5,e4g5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/3pp1N1/2B5/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"I did not, however, ever expect white to play this move, which is a mistake.  It allows me to gain the e pawn for free, only at the expense of a doubled c pawn."
12,dxc4,d5c4,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/4p1N1/2p5/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"I wasn't certain what white was attempting to accomplish here.  Much stronger would be a castle, to protect the king and start using those knights to your advantage.  Once the king is safe, then you can consider bringing your b or d pawn into the game to get rid of that pesky c4 pawn.  Pawns that are allowed to sit around sometimes end up becoming permanent."

Besides, it was an easy choice.  His knights would run away and I could still do the queen move later."
15,Ne4,g5e4,r1bqkb1r/ppp3pp/2n2p2/4p3/2p1N3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 8,Any other move by white allowed either direct capture or ripping apart his kingside pawn structure.
16,Qd3,d8d3,r1b1kb1r/ppp3pp/2n2p2/4p3/2p1N3/2Pq1N2/PP1P1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 9,"Now we bring the queen up to trap his king.  White has a few choices here, and none of them are good.  He can't move either knight to directly threaten my queen, because of my black bishop or placement of his other pieces.  He can either move his queen up to e2 or move his f3 knight, followed by his f2 pawn, to put his e4 knight to shoo me away.  Three moves at this stage while I get to continue to develop is a bad choice, so I think white made the best decision here.  However, none of this discussion would be taking place if white had castled instead.  Wasted moves early in a match can spell big trouble very quickly."

21,Neg5,e4g5,r1b1kb1r/ppp3pp/2n5/4ppN1/2p5/2P2N2/PP1PKPPP/R1B4R b kq - 1 11,"The move to g3 would have been a better play, and is the move I was expecting white to make.  Now, however, I can do some more pawn marching."

26,e4,e5e4,r1b1kb1r/ppp5/2n4p/5pp1/2p1p3/2P2N2/PP1PKPPP/R1B3NR w kq - 0 14,This move forces white to either retreat yet again or to double up and isolate some pawns.
27,Nd4,f3d4,r1b1kb1r/ppp5/2n4p/5pp1/2pNp3/2P5/PP1PKPPP/R1B3NR b kq - 1 14,"Double and isolated pawns in the middle of the board are no one's friend.  White has one developed pawn, lost his ability to castle and has all of his remaining power pieces in their starting gates.  How did we come to this place?  White overextended his pieces and allowed me to mercilessly pawn march them back into their holes.  You have to move your pieces out smartly.  I honestly think that the 6th and 7th moves by white are what got us here.  Instead of doing proper development, white took a more haphazard approach to development and now he is down a staggering amount of development.  The game isn't completely over yet, but it's about to get ugly quickly.  I can get all of my remaining pieces into play without any real constraints, and black still has a ways to go to try and catch up."

White is going to have a hell of a time getting his bishop into the game while the c4 pawn is in its location.  Perhaps Rb1 in preparation for a pawn push to get your bishop into the game?"

18. b3 Bg7
19. bxc4

giving lots of breathing room for his bishop to come out and play.  By moving the bishop up first instead I prevent that possibility and the d4 pawn is still there for the taking."
