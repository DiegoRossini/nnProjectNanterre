7,O-O,e1g1,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 5 4,The only way to keep the opening normal. Alternatives include 3. Bxf7+ Kxf7 4. Nxe5+ or 3. Nxe5. Castling consolidates the position and gives a cue that my opponent prefers development over deep calculations for an imbalanced position in the opening. Maybe that is reading too much into my opponent.
8,d6,d7d6,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 5,"A somewhat passive response, even though the bishop must be freed. Perhaps this also is reading too much into the developing position."

13,Qxb7,b3b7,rn1q1rk1/pQp2ppp/3p1n2/2b1p3/2B1P1b1/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNB2RK1 b - - 0 7,"In taking this pawn she is up a pawn but I have the potential of doubling up pawns, snagging the e pawn should her queen need to move, and threatening the good bishop with an eventual Nb6. None of these are truly solid but the main advantage that is solid is her development is now lacking."
