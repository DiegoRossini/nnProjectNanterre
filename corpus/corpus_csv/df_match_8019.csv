Way back in 1834, Louse-Charles Mahe de La Bourdonnais played his greatest match of his career, hailed by many as a world championship match (though there was no title back then) against Alexander McDonnell. In that match, La Bourdonnais demonstrated that this variation is not sound and allows black to equialize efficiently. Today it's better known as the Grand Prix Attack, or the McDonnell attack. Me, I really know nothing about this attack, so I let the DB guide me through my next few moves."
