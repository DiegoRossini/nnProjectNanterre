1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi Everybody, just for a change I thought I would comment on an old beginner game that I found in a buddy's profile.  Sometimes in these games, even when heavy material is lost it can be regained.  This was not the case here.  Thought it would be worth annotating because it would be interesting to see your thoughts on good and bad development in this game.  Cheers.  Joanne"
