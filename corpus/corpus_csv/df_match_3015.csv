13,Be3,c1e3,r2qk1nr/ppp3pp/2nb1p2/8/4P1b1/4BN2/PPP1BPPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 1 7,"White has to develop quickly. It's hard for black to castle short because the g knight cannot go to f6 and h6 is a bad place. Furthermore, the pawn f6 opens the diagonal a2-g8 for the white bishop. On the other hand, both white bishops aim at the black queen side and can be dangerous in case of long castle."
