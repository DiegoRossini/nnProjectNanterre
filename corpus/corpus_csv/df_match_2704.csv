1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is my favorite defense.  It isn't because I think it is better than other defenses, it's because for so many years people bashed it as being unsound.  Tell that to Karpov who got pounded by Larsen with it."

6,Qa5,d5a5,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/q7/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,This is Anderssen's Counter Attack.  It was discarded long ago as being trash but chess players can be snobs and reject things without deep examination.

9,Bc4,f1c4,rnb1kbnr/ppp2ppp/8/q3p3/2BP4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 5,I only know of seven lines in this position with 5. Nf3 being considered strongest.
10,Bb4,f8b4,rnb1k1nr/ppp2ppp/8/q3p3/1bBP4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 2 6,5...Nc6 is the most direct move and is playable here.
11,Qe2,d1e2,rnb1k1nr/ppp2ppp/8/q3p3/1bBP4/2N5/PPP1QPPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 3 6,"I thought White might consider 6. Nge2 here.  On 6. Qd3, Nc6  7. Nge2, Nge7  8. 0-0 Bf5 Black has a good game.  If 6. Bd2 then 6...Nc6 is good, e.g., 7. d5, Nd4  8. Nge2, Nf6  9. Nxd4, exd4  10 Ne2, Ne4! with excellent prospects for Black."
