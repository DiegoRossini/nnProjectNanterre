1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I invite any annotator to prove that my blindness was not correct in that Black should have been able to refute my guess work. thekingni, known as the Tigerofchess on some other chess sites, found a particular player able to guide me through a game while I was playing blindfolded!!!(Not literally!) As you sighted players can see clear enough, I, for one, most times stumble and fumble my way around the chess board, like a blind man seeking his cane! This game, given as an example of my style, or lack of style, as I bump along with only a feel to the ending. I gave up material, kinda sacrificed the queen and ended the game with not much material gain, but as for positional!, well,... see for yourself!!"
