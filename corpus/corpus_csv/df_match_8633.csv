Now white can answer 24. Nxe5*, in order to save the Knight and avoid Qxd4#. 24. ..., NxN.
It seems normal to play d4xe5, but: Qc5+
Unique: 25. Kd3, Qxc2+, 
If 26. Ke3, Nf5+, 26. Kd4 (unique), c5+ 27. KxN (unique), Qd3+, 28. Kxc5 (or mate), Rc2+, 29. Kb4 (unique), Qd4+ and mate the next one. 
If. 26. Kd4, c5+, 27. Kd3 (unique) and Nd5#. 

If I were able to see all this without the analyzer' help...

Anyway, not ALL white answers are forced, so this is mere speculation. Anyway, it's a real mate net. 
* If white takes the pawn with his one, the thematic mate is the same. Or, there is another very nice mate with this line: 

22. ..., e5, 
23.	d4-e5	,       Nxe5
24.	Bxe5, 	d5-c5+
25.	Kf4 (forced, since Kd3 leads to mate as in the other line), 	Nd5+
26.	Kg4 (forced, since Ke4, Qxc2+, then Rd2+. And if Kg5, Qe7+, Kg4, Qe6+, Kg5, Qf5#)	d5-e3+
27.	Kg5 (or exchanges the queen for a knight, in one of two ways)	Qe7+
28.	Kxg6 (not forced, but otherwise loses the queen for a knight...) Qe6+
29.	Kxg7 (not forced, but if Kg5, Qf5#...) Nf5+
30.	Kf8 (not forced, but Kg8, Qe8#...)	  Rh7
31.	Ng5 (not forced, but... can white save himself?)	  Qe7+
32.	Kg8	Nh6#
... but who will like such a position, even being 4 material points up?

So, nice position, isn't it? I like Lasker's scandinavian..."
