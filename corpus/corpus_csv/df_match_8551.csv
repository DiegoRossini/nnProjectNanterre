1,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/2N5/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 1,"Hi everyone - it's the same old story, Joanne manages to resist Freddy for about 30 moves or so, then she makes a slip up, Freddy takes full advantage and duly converts his win.  This time I resigned because I knew that Freddy would be able to stop my h pawn from crowning and he had plenty of queenside passers to promote so I decided to call it a day.  Anyhow back to the beginning.  Freddy kicks off with 1. Nc3 his favourite Dunst Opening and this time I choose e5 and hope to transpose it into a kind of 4 knights opening.  Freddy turns it into a kind of Centre Game."
