5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,I probably should have taken the pawn right away instead of waiting. Black could have simply taken on d4.
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,This was another error by Black that allows me to win the e pawn.
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 4,Play should have continued 4.dxe5 dxe5 5. Qxd8 Kxd8 6. Nxe5 Be6 7. Nc6 (or f3). This again allows for exd4
8,c6,c7c6,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2pp1n2/4p3/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,Luckily my opponent made a mistake again.
9,dxe5,d4e5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2pp1n2/4P3/4P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,Another mistake. It is pointless to threaten a piece away that has the intention of moving elsewhere next turn.
