1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Vote game taking place over 14 months, from October of 2012 through December of 2013, played entirely by messages and diagrams on the bigpeta students club forum.  A very close game overall with neither side ever gaining a significant edge, the game swung to white in the endgame, perhaps beginning around move 34, and certainly between 34 and 42."
