1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I wanted to try a different opening this time.  e5 is a pretty ""classical"" response and it leads to a more normal type of chess game.  c5 is called the Sicilian defense and it leads to a different type of game.

What happened in our game is pretty typical, I traded my c-pawn for your d-pawn which is generally good for me because I potentially have more center control.  On the other hand, you got a pretty big lead in development and had more space to work with.  In general, the Sicilian is a ""dynamic"" opening, which means that there are lots of imbalances in the position and different advantages for both sides.  It's also pretty double-edged and often leads to complicated positions (like in this game)."

You could follow it up with Rfe1, which would have given the e-pawn some solid protection (prophylaxis).  Bc3 is also an idea to shore up the e5 pawn.

After giving the e5 pawn some more protection, I think you should have tried to launch a kingside attack.  One difficult part of my position is that many of my pieces are on the queen side, and because you have more space, it's hard for me to transfer them to the kingside.  This gives you good chances to go on the offensive there.  I didn't see a good plan for you to get something going there though, maybe moving the N off of f3 then playing f4-f5."

The next couple moves are pretty big tactical mistakes, but I couldn't see a good way for you to press on.

Note how the 2 bishops are starting to look better to than the Ns.  Especially the b4 one.  It keeps your Rook on a1 tied to the a-pawn and stops you from putting a R on c1.  After a few more moves I think they would have been even better."

Now it seems like black has the center under control and is ready to start pressing his advantage.

This game was a much more complicated than the last one.  I think the main lesson is that asymmetrical pawn structures often result in a lot of imbalances in the position and it's really important to be aware of them.  I think the difficulties you felt as we approached the middlegame were caused by inaccurate moves in the opening.

In this game, the main thing you had going for you was a lead in development.  When you have that, it's critical to understand that it won't last forever, because eventually the other person will catch up.  Therefore you need a plan to convert that development into something else, often an attack on the king.  If you didn't want to play for an attack, I would recommend playing for c4 and trying to create a long-term space advantage by keeping my position cramped.

On the plus side, I think you did well trying to create counter-chances once I started to get an advantage.  It might have seemed like your f4 and d4 moves didn't get you much, but I think if you didn't play them then I would have taken over the game without any problems.

Good game, looking forward to our next one."
