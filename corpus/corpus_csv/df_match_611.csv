1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I love getting feedback from the community here and so I thought I'd share this game because I won it and only 1 exchange of pawns happened in it.
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Rare I that I face d5 when I play e4
3,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3pP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,So this affords to spare you guys another of my bishops opening games. I always like to reply with e5. As a nimso player as black I really hate the discomfort of this pawn and so I don't hold back to use it when I can as white hehe.
4,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2ppP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Opponent replies with c5. First time I face this.
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2ppP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,I still reply with d4.
6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Personally I think I would've done cxd4 to gain some time on queen retake with 4.Qxd4 Nc6. But he opted with e6.
7,c3,c2c3,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,I always love c3 as white and this will keep middle solid.
8,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/3pP3/3p4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,Opts for the exchange now.
9,cxd4,c3d4,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,Hmm blocks in dsb looks like my opponent is either cramping himself or looking for a Qside battle
10,Ne7,g8e7,rnbqkb1r/pp2nppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,Hmm blocks in dsb looks like my opponent is either cramping himself or looking for a Qside battle
11,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqkb1r/pp2nppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/3B4/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 6,I love this spot for lsb set to attack on his king side castle. Don't need to help him develop with a Bb5+
12,Nec6,e7c6,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1p3/3pP3/3P4/3B4/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 3 7,Hmm moves same knight again I guess my assumption of him wanting to fight qside was right.
13,Be3,c1e3,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1p3/3pP3/3P4/3BB3/PP3PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 4 7,Defend d pawn + development.
14,Bb4+,f8b4,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/2n1p3/3pP3/1b1P4/3BB3/PP3PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 5 8,My opponent likes the bishop check contrary to me.
15,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/2n1p3/3pP3/1b1P4/2NBB3/PP3PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 6 8,I often choose to block with knight in hopes of forcing a bishop for knight exchange in a near future
16,a6,a7a6,rnbqk2r/1p3ppp/p1n1p3/3pP3/1b1P4/2NBB3/PP3PPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 0 9,Passive move since my lsb is already developed and I plan on not budging my knight.
17,a3,a2a3,rnbqk2r/1p3ppp/p1n1p3/3pP3/1b1P4/P1NBB3/1P3PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 0 9,Sorta passive reply on my part but in the hopes of getting the wanted exchange.
