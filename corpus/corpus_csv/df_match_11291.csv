3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"The strong point of the French -- protect it, capture it, advance it -- but don't ignore it!"
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"The strong point of the French -- protect it, capture it, advance it -- but don't ignore it!"
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,White chooses to protect it.
6,dxe4,d5e4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/3Pp3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"The Rubenstein variation.  Not as common as Bb4 (the Winawer) or Nf6 (the Classical), but this move forces the knight to move twice in the opening."
7,Nxe4,c3e4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/3PN3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"?!  This move opens lines, but is black ready for this?"
8,Nd7,b8d7,r1bqkbnr/pppn1ppp/4p3/8/3PN3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"?!  This move opens lines, but is black ready for this?"

11,dxc5,d4c5,r1bqkbnr/pp1n1ppp/4p3/2P5/4N3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"Clearing the knight out of d7 has a consequence that black overlooked -- each of the next FOUR white moves helps his development, with check..."
12,Nxc5,d7c5,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2n5/4N3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"Unbelievably, this turns out to be the LOSING move.  Qc7, I believe, would have minimized white's advantage."

16,f6,f7f6,r1bk1bnr/pp4pp/4pp2/2n3B1/4N3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 0 9,"It may look like Be7 or Nf6 would have been a slightly better try, getting *something* developed, but Be7 leaves the c5 knight hanging, and Nf6 fails to 9. Nxf6 gxf6 10. Bxf6 , winning the rook!"
17,O-O-O+,e1c1,r1bk1bnr/pp4pp/4pp2/2n3B1/4N3/5N2/PPP2PPP/2KR1B1R b - - 1 9,"White develops even further, again with check..."
18,Ke8,d8e8,r1b1kbnr/pp4pp/4pp2/2n3B1/4N3/5N2/PPP2PPP/2KR1B1R w - - 2 10,"Again, not Ke7, which hangs the Nc5."
19,Bb5+,f1b5,r1b1kbnr/pp4pp/4pp2/1Bn3B1/4N3/5N2/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b - - 3 10,The *fourth* move in a row that develops with check.

22,Be7,f8e7,r1bR2nr/pp2bkpp/4pp2/1Bn3B1/4N3/5N2/PPP2PPP/2K4R w - - 6 12,"Better than Nxe4, where white plays Ne5  anyway, and fxe5 would be met with Be8#!"
23,Ne5+,f3e5,r1bR2nr/pp2bkpp/4pp2/1Bn1N1B1/4N3/8/PPP2PPP/2K4R b - - 7 12,"!  This knight sacrifice forces black to play fxe5, leaving his king with nowhere to hide."
24,fxe5,f6e5,r1bR2nr/pp2bkpp/4p3/1Bn1p1B1/4N3/8/PPP2PPP/2K4R w - - 0 13,!
