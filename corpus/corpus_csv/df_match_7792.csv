1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Was expecting 2.c4 for the Indian Defense, something which I've got quite good at since one of the players in Costa Coffee plays it almost every game! Nc3 confused me slightly, it blocks c-pawn early on."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"Was expecting 2.c4 for the Indian Defense, something which I've got quite good at since one of the players in Costa Coffee plays it almost every game! Nc3 confused me slightly, it blocks c-pawn early on."

4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"The internets tell me this is the Richter-Veresov Attack. So far my moves have been instinctual, it's not an opening I'm familiar with."
5,Bf4,c1f4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P1B2/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,Was expecting e4 here
6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3P1B2/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Opens up my ds-bishop, but closes off my ls-bishop. Probably not the best move, should perhaps have looked at Nc3, which would've allowed me to send the king's pawn to e5 which would've challenged white's ds-bishop. However, it's a position I'm familiar with so made me feel better about the game at the time."
7,a3,a2a3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3P1B2/P1N5/1PP1PPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"Unsure of the point to this move. With no ls-bishop developed, the a2 square is fairly weak for white."
8,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/3P1B2/P1N5/1PP1PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,Opening the way for an early king-side castle
9,h3,h2h3,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/3P1B2/P1N4P/1PP1PPP1/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"Seems white likes mirror-images! :)  Unlike a3, h3 is useful for white, allowing the ds-bishop to retreat here if needed."
10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/3P1B2/P1N4P/1PP1PPP1/R2QKBNR w KQ - 1 6,"Threaten's my knight to no-purpose. Easily defended by my ds-bishop and the g-pawn. I think e3 was better, opening up the ls-bishop squares. Decided to ignore it and continue developing."
11,Be5,f4e5,rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3pB3/3P4/P1N4P/1PP1PPP1/R2QKBNR b KQ - 2 6,"Threaten's my knight to no-purpose. Easily defended by my ds-bishop and the g-pawn. I think e3 was better, opening up the ls-bishop squares. Decided to ignore it and continue developing."

White's allows me to start my little running exchange of pieces and leaves me in a very good position. The thought behind it was slightly different to what occured, which was ""9.Bxd4 e5 10.Bxc6 exd4 11.Bxb7 Bxb7 12.Qxd4 Ne4 13.Nxe4 dxe4"". However, halway through this I spotted something that would possibly work better, so I changed the sequence at move 11. . ."

23,Bxa8,b7a8,B1bq1rk1/p3bppp/5n2/3p4/8/P1p1P2P/1PP2PP1/R2QK1NR b KQ - 0 12,"As promised. My pawn is strategically placed on the 2nd rank, allowing me to be a constant threat of gaining an extra queen. White is up in material, temporarily, but I think my position is much stronger. I've isolated white's pawns on a3 and c2 and left white with very little defense on the queenside."

25,Ra2,a1a2,B1bq1rk1/p3bppp/5n2/3p4/8/P3P2P/RpP2PP1/3QK1NR b K - 1 13,"White had two choices with this rook, Rb1 or Ra2. . . and picked the wrong one! Rb1, if my analysis is correct, would probably have cost me this game. So, all down to a 50/50 toss of the coin. Thankfully, it was heads this time :)"

In hindsight, this was a poor move. I think Qb5+ was better, allowing 15.Ne2 b1=Q 16.Ra1 Qxd1+ 17.Rxd1 Ba6"
