1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Random challenge game. I play white and open with my favorite king's pawn.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"The Alekhine's Defense. It's been 20 years since I played competitively or read a chess book. I seem to recall my understanding of this defense was to build my 4 center pawns up by chasing the black knight - this was considered strong for white. Maybe I am just remembering poorly; I've forgotten a lot in 20 years. In any case, 2. e5 is the main line."

4,Nd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/3nP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"The Two Pawns Variation. c4 is a good square for a pawn, threatening the center and relatively unassailable by black pieces. And the move gains a little tempo by chasing the knight off of d5."

(I think it earns a ?) because it let me exchange my precarious e5 pawn and when black recaptures, it will leave him with isolated f and h pawns. Maybe I'll end up with some decent compensation here with black's weak pawn structure. Even better, by capturing with 12. exd6, I expose a bishop attack on the long diagonal, so black cannot immediately recapture at d6."

Still, taking the knight gets his queen further into play, and I don't want him to take my knight on f3 and isolate some of my pawns. Also, he might just chase away that far-flung bishop and get his royal fork. So castling seems a good solution."
