7,Nge2,g1e2,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/4q3/8/2N5/PPPPNPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 4,"They don't play it anymore, normally. It is not bad, since it supports an early bishop outcome to f4, occupying the good diagonal for white's dsb."
8,c6,c7c6,rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/4q3/8/2N5/PPPPNPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"The normal white move is e4, then Qa5, and the games proceeds as usual. Black is uneasy, but holds. Now, the played move makes things quieter and easier for black."
9,d3,d2d3,rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/4q3/8/2NP4/PPP1NPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"The normal white move is e4, then Qa5, and the games proceeds as usual. Black is uneasy, but holds. Now, the played move makes things quieter and easier for black."
10,Bf5,c8f5,rn2kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/4qb2/8/2NP4/PPP1NPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,"g5 is an alternative, maybe better, just to fight against black's Bf4."
11,h3,h2h3,rn2kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/4qb2/8/2NP3P/PPP1NPP1/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"This is ugly. White could have taken at once Bf4. Maybe he is letting it for later, knowing that it will always be there."
12,e6,e7e6,rn2kbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/4qb2/8/2NP3P/PPP1NPP1/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,I have no choice but to go on developing. Now g5 is not possilble anymore.
13,a3,a2a3,rn2kbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/4qb2/8/P1NP3P/1PP1NPP1/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"Another loss of tempo, even if white is not in a hurry. Since I plan to castle queenside, Bb4 is not a wise move for me, and there is no need for white to prevent it."
14,Bd6,f8d6,rn2k1nr/pp3ppp/2pbp3/4qb2/8/P1NP3P/1PP1NPP1/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,"This is the right spot for the bishop. But in this moment, it is a huge mistake: Bf4 now, Qc5, b4, and I have to lose the bishop."
15,d4,d3d4,rn2k1nr/pp3ppp/2pbp3/4qb2/3P4/P1N4P/1PP1NPP1/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,Now it is bad: it could have been played before.
16,Qa5,e5a5,rn2k1nr/pp3ppp/2pbp3/q4b2/3P4/P1N4P/1PP1NPP1/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 9,Black loses tempoes relocating his queen. But this is now in the right square.
17,Bd2,c1d2,rn2k1nr/pp3ppp/2pbp3/q4b2/3P4/P1N4P/1PPBNPP1/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 2 9,Black loses tempoes relocating his queen. But this is now in the right square.

20,Bg6,f5g6,rn2k1nr/ppq2ppp/2pbp1b1/8/3P2P1/P1N4P/1PPBNP2/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 11,This time white's attack is ok.
21,f4,f2f4,rn2k1nr/ppq2ppp/2pbp1b1/8/3P1PP1/P1N4P/1PPBN3/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 11,This time white's attack is ok.
22,Ne7,g8e7,rn2k2r/ppq1nppp/2pbp1b1/8/3P1PP1/P1N4P/1PPBN3/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 12,"Not the best. I have to shield the king queenside ASAP, so Nd7 was indicated. This move doesn't prevent white to break the black center with f5. Now, if he does, black has countergame with Bg3+, NxB, QxN+, Ke7, exf56."
23,Bg2,f1g2,rn2k2r/ppq1nppp/2pbp1b1/8/3P1PP1/P1N4P/1PPBN1B1/R2QK2R b KQkq - 2 12,"This doesn't change too much the situation. By now, white's lsb bites granite."
24,Nd7,b8d7,r3k2r/ppqnnppp/2pbp1b1/8/3P1PP1/P1N4P/1PPBN1B1/R2QK2R w KQkq - 3 13,"Fixed: now I can castle wherever I want. But I'll delay castling the more I can, since white has ready-made pawns' storm on both sides."

27,g5,g4g5,r3k2r/ppqnnpp1/2pbp1b1/6Pp/3P1P1P/P1N5/1PPBN1B1/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 14,"As spine in my chest, but it blocks white's attack. I can even think about castling behind white's pawns."
28,Bf5,g6f5,r3k2r/ppqnnpp1/2pbp3/5bPp/3P1P1P/P1N5/1PPBN1B1/R2QK2R w KQkq - 1 15,"I considered Nf5, but I'm not in a hurry, and maybe Bg4 - Ng6 etc. provides me with better perspective. Note white's pieces are stuck to the defence of f4, and white can't use his queen at all, nor castling queenside."
