My idea was simply to put in contact my Queen with my Rook, in order to use the latter after a possible trade of Queens. In this way, my Rook would be keeping control of column d.""

After trading of Bishops, I would have expected him to move his Knight to e4, hence attacking my Rook, and having it in a good position. A Knight in e4 for White is very ennoying, because attacking it with f3 is not a good idea: it blocks Knight to f3, which is normal move, and it opens a diagonal (e1-h4) to attacks against the King.""
