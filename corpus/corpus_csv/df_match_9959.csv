7,a3,a2a3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/P1N5/1P2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"Queens pawn game - purely defensive at this stage as I wanted to keep my knight active and didnt want a pin from his bishop, I know this move is quite common on gameknot at this level of play, I see it as a slow move, but Im happy to play it at present. Maybe better was 4.Nf3 or even e3 clearing the diagonal to develop my bishop while also protecting d4."
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/3p4/2PP4/P1N5/1P2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,Developing his knights into the centre

Time to change my plan."
11,Bd2,f4d2,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2nbpn2/3p4/2PP4/P1N5/1P1BPPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 4 6,moving back to d2 instead of e3 was to prevent moving my bishop again if black advanced by knight to g4 and then being another move behind
12,Nxd4,c6d4,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/3bpn2/3p4/2Pn4/P1N5/1P1BPPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,"hmmm, now Im starting to feel my hold on the centre weakening and with three advanced pieces to my two, I need to start getting my pieces developed"

Maybe better for black would have been pushing to e5 starting to get a strong hold in the centre while opening up the diagonal for his bishop."
