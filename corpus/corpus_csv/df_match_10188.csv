He normally crushes me in online blitz games, or he'll flag me when I'm winning, but today I got the satisfaction of crushing him brilliantly, using only 11 seconds of my time."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Pre-move, I often pre-move c5 on the first move, but it is risky in case White plays b4 first move, but I knew my coach wouldn't do that, so I just pre-moved c5."
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"The opening moves were played very rapidly, I'm not even sure if either of us had used a second yet. This is the Grand Prix Attack, where White goes for a bunch of cheap attacks on the kingside, which can be dangerous against an unprepared player. I do not recommend playing Grand Prix against a player with book knowledge."

I didn't really want to go into complications in a 1-minute match, so I just played Nge7 almost instantly. In bullet games, you shouldn't go into complications when you're the one getting attacked, it makes you think more so that your opponent has a better chance of flagging you even if you're winning. I'll just make very quick solid moves."

Playing bullet chess can often screw up your chess and make you play bad in long time control games, but it can also improve your instincts and ability to think quick and move fast. But don't get addicted to 1-minute chess............. one time on a night before a tournament, I played over 100 bullet games in a row, and did very badly in the tournament because I made so many quick, ""unthoughtout"" moves."

Bf5 here is a tricky way to defend my f-file assault, but it takes away defense from the knight, which would allow a rook to come to the e-file to double-attack the knight that is stopping Bd4 ,"
