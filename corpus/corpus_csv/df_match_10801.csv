Black's early ...a6 suggests that he will continue ...b5  and attack along the b-file, a powerful plan both as a minority attack or simple mating attack. For a long time, however, top players considered this setup simply too slow to meet White's most aggressive option, the Yugoslav. In a sense it still is, but as we'll see Black has some concrete ideas that justify his play - at least for now!"

It's not so much that White's king is in danger (he is protected by considerable space, and Black cannot retaliate successfully with ..h5, though the a7-g1 diagonal is worrisome), but that White's rooks are horribly uncoordinated.

White sidesteps the a7-g1 diagonal and prepares to develop his rooks, but now he introduces tactics on e4 and g4 (note how powerful a knight fork on e4 would be).
