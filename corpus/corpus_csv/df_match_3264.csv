1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Standard fair, not going with any of my lesser practiced openings against a 2000+ player."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The Latvian Counter-Gambit.  If I ever played against this before, I have no recollection of doing so."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"The Latvian Counter-Gambit.  If I ever played against this before, I have no recollection of doing so."

5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,So I proceed cautiously in unknown territory.
6,fxe4,f5e4,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4p3/4p3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,A trade of pawns and I'm feeling a little more comfortable.

8,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/8/3pp3/4N3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,Bigpeta gaining central position with pawns early.
9,Nc3,e4c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/8/3pp3/8/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"Shuffling the knights, some space to play in is available, although my opponent controls the tempo."
10,e4,e5e4,rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/8/3p4/4p3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Shuffling the knights, some space to play in is available, although my opponent controls the tempo."

12,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp3pp/5n2/3p4/3Np3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 7,"I did this to open up the bishop for a possible Bg5, pinning the knight against the queen..."

14,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp4pp/5n2/2pp4/3Np3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,But that is disallowed by a further attack on one of my knights.  This is beginning to feel like the Alekhine defense.
15,Nb3,d4b3,rnbqkb1r/pp4pp/5n2/2pp4/4p3/1NNP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 8,"Not many other options here, still not a horrible position to be in..."
16,exd3,e4d3,rnbqkb1r/pp4pp/5n2/2pp4/8/1NNp4/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 9,"I recapture, not recapturing would have allowed 9 ... c4.  Not that he would have played that particular move, but it was on my mind and I felt the need to develop other pieces."

19,Qe2,d1e2,rnbqk2r/pp2b1pp/5n2/2pp4/8/1NNP4/PP2QPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 2 10,A mistake.

21,Qd2,e2d2,rnbq1rk1/pp2b1pp/5n2/2pp4/8/1NNP4/PP1Q1PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQ - 4 11,"Another mistake.  I am aiming my queen towards the kingside with this move, but I'm also pinning in a bishop that would probably be better off developed."

30,Bb4+,e7b4,r1bq1rk1/pp4pp/2n5/8/NbPpn3/1N6/PPQ1BPPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 3 16,"I should have placed the bishop I've been dying to develop there instead of the knight.  I can see why I thought to move the knight, there's room on the board and I would much rather give away a knight and win a bishop, the knights are stranded uselessly on the side of the board anyway.  I still prefer Bd2, however."
