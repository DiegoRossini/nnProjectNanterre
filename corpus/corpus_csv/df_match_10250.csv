1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,standard opening yet again
2,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,he prefers to avoid the center-board opening and just frees up his bishop and sets up f7-f5
3,d3,d2d3,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,i protect the free-floating and free up my black bishop to prevent his uncontested move to h6
4,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/8/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"he goes to g7 instead, bringing the bishop into play and avoiding a piece trade - he has a good attacking position if i forget myself and move that c1 bishop out anytime soon"
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/8/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 3,bringing out the knight
6,d6,d7d6,rnbqk1nr/ppp1ppbp/3p2p1/8/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,freeing the other bishop and protecting some more row 5 real estate
7,Be2,f1e2,rnbqk1nr/ppp1ppbp/3p2p1/8/4P3/3P1N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"setting up the castling, nothing more, though that bishop may be useful later"
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/4P3/3P1N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,"and he sets up the castle as well, though his position on that side is potentially a little flawed"
9,O-O,e1g1,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/4P3/3P1N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 3 5,i castle
10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/4P3/3P1N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 4 6,and he follows suit
11,c4,c2c4,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2P1P3/3P1N2/PP2BPPP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 0 6,"now that the king's tucked away, time to set up a bit more aggressive pawn structure"
12,b6,b7b6,rnbq1rk1/p1p1ppbp/1p1p1np1/8/2P1P3/3P1N2/PP2BPPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 0 7,he keeps staggering his pawns to prevent any further decisive advance
13,b4,b2b4,rnbq1rk1/p1p1ppbp/1p1p1np1/8/1PP1P3/3P1N2/P3BPPP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 0 7,and i keep moving forward for the attack - so far he's maintaining a defensive position while i try to set up an advance
14,Bb7,c8b7,rn1q1rk1/pbp1ppbp/1p1p1np1/8/1PP1P3/3P1N2/P3BPPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 1 8,"moving the bishop out, potentially to cut some holes in those forward ranks if he gets a chance"
15,Na3,b1a3,rn1q1rk1/pbp1ppbp/1p1p1np1/8/1PP1P3/N2P1N2/P3BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 2 8,the knight goes out to protect some pawn positions and free up that rook to set up shop on an open rank eventually
16,a6,a7a6,rn1q1rk1/1bp1ppbp/pp1p1np1/8/1PP1P3/N2P1N2/P3BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 9,"defending against the knight coming in, which i wouldn't have gained much from anyway"
17,b5,b4b5,rn1q1rk1/1bp1ppbp/pp1p1np1/1P6/2P1P3/N2P1N2/P3BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 9,offering the first piece trade
18,Nxe4,f6e4,rn1q1rk1/1bp1ppbp/pp1p2p1/1P6/2P1n3/N2P1N2/P3BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 10,"but he declines, sacrificing a knight in order to cut some holes in my pawn structure. he also gets a bonus that i missed at first, which is that his bishop at g7 attacks the rook, and if i moved it to b1, he'd have me forked with the queen and i'd lose the bishop anyway"
19,dxe4,d3e4,rn1q1rk1/1bp1ppbp/pp1p2p1/1P6/2P1P3/N4N2/P3BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 10,"sure enough, i take the knight"
20,Bxa1,g7a1,rn1q1rk1/1bp1pp1p/pp1p2p1/1P6/2P1P3/N4N2/P3BPPP/b1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 11,and he grabs my rook without a problem
