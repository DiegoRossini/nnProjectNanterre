1,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Trying to surprise the opponent. Although it may look like a king´s gambit, it does not allow for such development. White clearly opens against his rival king´s side, giving up the center, and can result in a weakened white´s position. And yes, I have no idea how to play this properly, and that is one of the fun things of blitz game. A challenge of ideas will develop from both sides. Hope you enjoy it."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Black prevents white from doing 2.e4 and therefore set a strong pawn on d4, gaining control of the center."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/5P2/5N2/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Choosing a financhetto defense. This may be giving white some time to regain control, but at the same time positions BSB on a very strong diagonal a1-h8."
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pp1p/6p1/3p4/5P2/5N2/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"Choosing a financhetto defense. This may be giving white some time to regain control, but at the same time positions BSB on a very strong diagonal a1-h8."
5,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pp1p/6p1/3p4/5P2/4PN2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"Allows for WSB to develo. White could have also played g3 with oppossing mirror defence set up, but thought to set his bishop on a far more active position later on (in spite of leaving his king side weakened)"
6,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk1nr/ppp1ppbp/6p1/3p4/5P2/4PN2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,"Blocks the pressure of the BSB on b2 and allows for a development there for white, trying to trade both bishops."
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk1nr/ppp1ppbp/6p1/3p4/5P2/2N1PN2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,"Blocks the pressure of the BSB on b2 and allows for a development there for white, trying to trade both bishops."
8,Nh6,g8h6,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/6pn/3p4/5P2/2N1PN2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 3 5,"Interesting. Black may be aiming to do f5 and therefore place a strong pressure on e4, although that would also weaken his ""e"" pawn."
9,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/6pn/3p4/5P2/2NBPN2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 4 5,"This seem to be a bad movement , since it blocks ""d"" advance. But BSB will go to b2 in the next moves, keeping with the idea of giving up the center while pressuring the side. See that in a potential situation, ""h"" advance will be a strong push there (in case white goes for a long castling)"
10,c6,c7c6,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/2p3pn/3p4/5P2/2NBPN2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"Now this seems to be too slow for black, and also doesn´t help Nb8 and Bc8 future development. Since d5 seems to be perfectly fine, Nc6 seems more natural."
11,b3,b2b3,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/2p3pn/3p4/5P2/1PNBPN2/P1PP2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"Again, not helping much to the cause of black, since it does have no control whatsoever of any strong square. Now, considering its activity on h6, black may be wanting to activate this N, but at the cost of several movements."
12,Nf5,h6f5,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/3p1n2/5P2/1PNBPN2/P1PP2PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 7,"Again, not helping much to the cause of black, since it does have no control whatsoever of any strong square. Now, considering its activity on h6, black may be wanting to activate this N, but at the cost of several movements."
13,Bb2,c1b2,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/3p1n2/5P2/1PNBPN2/PBPP2PP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 2 7,"So now white is facing an interesting dilema. I thought about going for a queen castling and the push on BK defences, or play safe and go for a short castling."
14,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/3p1n2/5P2/1PNBPN2/PBPP2PP/R2QK2R w KQ - 3 8,"So now white is facing an interesting dilema. I thought about going for a queen castling and the push on BK defences, or play safe and go for a short castling."
15,Na4,c3a4,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/3p1n2/N4P2/1P1BPN2/PBPP2PP/R2QK2R b KQ - 4 8,"Whit this, white is almost giving up on the long castling. Too many moves to go, allowing black to advance on a-b-c files. A race I wouldn´t like to run second. Now, I felt tempted to do this move since black almost has to go for the trade, or else, going weak on his castling."
16,Nd6,f5d6,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2pn2p1/3p4/N4P2/1P1BPN2/PBPP2PP/R2QK2R w KQ - 5 9,"Again, a slow move. Maybe white can still do the aforementioned attack idea."
17,Bxg7,b2g7,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppBp/2pn2p1/3p4/N4P2/1P1BPN2/P1PP2PP/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 9,"But I didn´t. I still have the feeling is a weak move. Now the push has to go with less firepower, going for something like h3-g4-f5...which can be clearly stopped with f5. Also, black has a very strong jump point on e4."
18,Kxg7,g8g7,rnbq1r2/pp2ppkp/2pn2p1/3p4/N4P2/1P1BPN2/P1PP2PP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 10,"But I didn´t. I still have the feeling is a weak move. Now the push has to go with less firepower, going for something like h3-g4-f5...which can be clearly stopped with f5. Also, black has a very strong jump point on e4."
19,O-O,e1g1,rnbq1r2/pp2ppkp/2pn2p1/3p4/N4P2/1P1BPN2/P1PP2PP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 10,"But I didn´t. I still have the feeling is a weak move.

20,Nd7,b8d7,r1bq1r2/pp1nppkp/2pn2p1/3p4/N4P2/1P1BPN2/P1PP2PP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 2 11,"Mobilizing his forces. Again, control of the centre is the order of the day for black. Maybe with ...f6, e5."
21,Nc3,a4c3,r1bq1r2/pp1nppkp/2pn2p1/3p4/5P2/1PNBPN2/P1PP2PP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 3 11,Calling back forces.
22,Nf6,d7f6,r1bq1r2/pp2ppkp/2pn1np1/3p4/5P2/1PNBPN2/P1PP2PP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 4 12,"This blocks the previously mentioned idea, but sets a very strong N on e4."
23,h3,h2h3,r1bq1r2/pp2ppkp/2pn1np1/3p4/5P2/1PNBPN1P/P1PP2P1/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 12,"Preparing the g4-f5 advance. White might have also thought about Qe2 and a future e4 advance, but I had this fixation on the pawn advance as the only chance to get something positive out of this situation."
24,h5,h7h5,r1bq1r2/pp2ppk1/2pn1np1/3p3p/5P2/1PNBPN1P/P1PP2P1/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 13,"It seems to weaken black´s defence. It kept me thinking about a potential sacrifice on h5, but is unclear. And black may also find attractive the possibility to mobilize forces on the ""h"" file with Rh8 and so on."
25,Ne2,c3e2,r1bq1r2/pp2ppk1/2pn1np1/3p3p/5P2/1P1BPN1P/P1PPN1P1/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 13,"Again, trying to stack forces on the attack. No real threat yet though."
26,Nfe4,f6e4,r1bq1r2/pp2ppk1/2pn2p1/3p3p/4nP2/1P1BPN1P/P1PPN1P1/R2Q1RK1 w - - 2 14,"See the strong point e4 offers black. But in case of ...f5, Ne5 will give white another one, and g6 (and maybe even the mentioned h5 sacrifice) would be weaken spots."
