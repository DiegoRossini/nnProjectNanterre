1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game was interesting because of the fact that it taught me that superior space & mobility were able to overcome a material defecit.  Well, technically a material defecit.  My opponent hemmed in his own rook, so I was actually playing up the exchange the whole game.  But in the end my opponent pretty much mated himself with his own pawns anyway, so it all came out in the wash.  :)"

This opening can turn into a King's Gambit after black plays the natural 2...Nf6, and white can push the f-pawn without having the bother of 2(or 3)...Qh4 .  None of this happens in this game, however."
