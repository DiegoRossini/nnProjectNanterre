1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The Sicilian has many variations, sharp with tactics and replete with positional strategies. It is important to be at least familiar with this opening, especially if you play 1. e4 One way of tackling the Sicilian is to play a closed variation, 1. e4 c5 2. Nc3 or 2. d6  These moves will not allow your opponent to play their ""pet"" Sicilian lines which they may know better than you. On the other hand the open variations have chances for White as well and can be more fun."

Nd4 would be an open game and allow black to chose his response."

7,Bg2,f1g2,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/2p5/4P3/5NP1/PPPP1PBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,The obvious moves.

9,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/2p5/4P3/5NP1/PPPP1PBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 3 5,Tucking the king away to safety. Time to finish development on the queenside.
10,d6,d7d6,r1bqk1nr/pp2ppbp/2np2p1/2p5/4P3/5NP1/PPPP1PBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 6,Strengthening the dark squares in the center and opening lines for the bishop.
11,a4,a2a4,r1bqk1nr/pp2ppbp/2np2p1/2p5/P3P3/5NP1/1PPP1PBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 6,"?! Possibly looking to bind the knight on the Queenside? Or start a queenside attack? Too early to try to force an attack, first the Queenside knight and bishop need to be developed."
12,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/2p5/P3P3/5NP1/1PPP1PBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 7,"Developing a piece, attacking e4, and preparing to castle."

14,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/2p3N1/P3P3/6P1/1PPP1PBP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 3 8,Black's position is safe and solid. He can now turn his mind to breaking down White's undeveloped position.

Making way for the knight on c3 but the pawn did have advantages there, controlling the center and prohibiting both the bishop on g7 and the knight on c6. A move like d3 would allow the bishop and knight to be developed while attacking the knight on e4."

Now however Black can exchange the knight which, while a powerful centralized piece, exchanges away one of the few developed white pieces and doubles up White's pawns. White's position is in trouble now."
