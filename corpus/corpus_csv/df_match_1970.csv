The rhythm of play gives me the chance to think the strategy and tactics (and analyze the position in boards). The game in question is very interesting, my opponent and me alternates the initiative in the game. I'm pleased if you (all levels, please) comment the game or criticized my (or my opponents) moves. I don't use pmca, if you see tactical errors, please, comment!."
