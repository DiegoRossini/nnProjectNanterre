6,f5,f7f5,r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/2n5/1B2pp2/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,"I have been exploring this move, known as the Schliemann Defense. Not seen much in top level games. but it seems to have some tactics. Much like a Kings gambit reversed perhaps. Other moves possible here are: Nd4 Bird's Defense, d6 Steinitz Defense, Bc5 Cordel Defense,  Nf6 Berlin Defense, a6 Morphy Defense. 
I am also fond of Gambit play, and this seems to gambit a pawn."
