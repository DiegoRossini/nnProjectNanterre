protecting knight on d4."

in trouble. If Nd5 moves then Nb5 is in trouble. But wait what about c7 and Bc5? Black's queen is protecting both. What if she couldn't do that?"

if [9. .. Qxc5 10. Nc7  Ke7 11. Nxa8 and white probably will keep his knight ]
if [9. .. axb5 10. Nxc5 has won pawn and white has a bit better position ]"

completely different on my mind."

11. Qd6  [11. .. Ke8 12. Qf8#] Kf6 13. Nd4  Kg5  14. h4  and eexpectingBe2ither king goes to h5 or g4 and 15. Be2#

Even better than Bxf2 might have been just to capture the knight now. 
10. .. dxe6 11. Bxc5 Qxc5 12. Nc7 Ke7 13. Nxa8 Qb4  and white at least loses one pawn..."

Now, giving up queen with:
11. .. dxe6 12. Qd6  Ke8 13. Nxb6 Bxb6 14. Rd1 and white has better position but I think not enough
to guarantee victory....

Even better would have been (see the comment, thanks Blake) 11. .. Qf4 and white is in serious trouble."
