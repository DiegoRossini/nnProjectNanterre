1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The King's Gambit. I was tempted to accept, but decided against it."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The King's Gambit. I was tempted to accept, but decided against it."
3,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"The King's Gambit. I was tempted to accept, but decided against it."
4,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,I was in a puckish mood and had never tried this move.
5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/2B1PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 3,"Luckily, he overlooked 3 Q-R5ch, or I could have been in trouble."
6,Qh4+,d8h4,rnb1kbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/2B1PP1q/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 4,I play it myself.
7,Kf1,e1f1,rnb1kbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/2B1PP1q/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1KNR b kq - 3 4,"Very poor play on J.B.'s part, in retrospect. He probably should have played 3 Q-R5 ch himself on the previous move. Even here 4 P-N3 wouldn't leave me with much to do except retreat my Queen."
8,Qxf4+,h4f4,rnb1kbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/2B1Pq2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1KNR w kq - 0 5,I go for the material grab.
9,Ke1,f1e1,rnb1kbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/2B1Pq2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR b kq - 1 5,"It's just amazing how bad both he and I were at strategy back then. 5 N-B3 develops a piece and breaks the ""attack""."
10,Bc5,f8c5,rnb1k1nr/pppp2pp/8/2b1pp2/2B1Pq2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR w kq - 2 6,"With an obvious threat... at least I thought it was obvious. I didn't think he'd actually fall into it, but I figured I'd better start developing."
11,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1k1nr/pppp2pp/8/2b1pp2/2B1Pq2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQK1NR b kq - 3 6,Development is always good. But you have to always make sure...
12,Qf2#,f4f2,rnb1k1nr/pppp2pp/8/2b1pp2/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1qPP/R1BQK1NR w kq - 4 7,...you guard against checkmates first!
