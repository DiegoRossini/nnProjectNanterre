1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I'm curious here. Was black's (ultimately winning) reply on move 22 really sound? - It worked out well for me but looks risky.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"As a regular Sicilian player, I see this a lot, even from players rated a little higher than me. It does not scare me. It used to, when I first started playing the Sicilian as white immediately threatens f7 but..."
