9,Bd3,f1d3,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4bn2/8/8/2NB4/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 5,"EH??? Well, this is one of those bad moves that create the inmediate challenge to prove they are bad. If you fail, you'll feel as the stupidest of men... :-)"
10,Bd6,f8d6,rn1qk2r/ppp2ppp/3bbn2/8/8/2NB4/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 2 6,"...and I wasn't able to find anything better, provided Qe7 is not such a threat now."

13,O-O,e1g1,rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/2pbbn2/8/8/2NB1N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 7,"Well, not quite so. For a start, white castled, and I didn't. White has no pawns in the center, but neither do I (thanks, c6!). Our pieces are passively developed, and my only possible break in is by pinning the Nf3 and threat Bxh2+. But I have clearly in mind that this will not lead to much more than that, and it won't suffice against white's counterattack in the center."

17,Bxe4,d3e4,rn2k2r/ppq2ppp/2pbb3/8/4B3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 9,"My weak point is e6. Can you see it? Against Ng5, I miss a tempo to defend the bishop with my rook, and I won't like to exchange it leaving a weak isolani in e6. I want it in g4, but not to be kicked with h3. The real unbalance in the position has still to be created, and the chance is, from my side, f5. But in order to play it, I have to castle and to defend e6. So I can't do it right now. Would it be possible to find another way to attack without playing f5? Maybe g5-g4..."

20,Bg4,e6g4,rn2k2r/ppq2pp1/2pb3p/8/3PB1b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 1 11,"The same reason that I didn't do it before hold still now. But I felt I must do something, or just slowly die. Nd7 was good, of course, but it is on the agenda anyway."
21,Qe2,d1e2,rn2k2r/ppq2pp1/2pb3p/8/3PB1b1/5N2/PPP1QPPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 2 11,"Uh oh. That shows that my previous one was a mistake. Because otherwise I could have confidently castled queenside now, without danger for my king. Now I have to prove it was not a mistake."

25,Bxh6,c1h6,r4rk1/ppqn1pp1/2pb3B/8/3PB1b1/5NP1/PPP1QP1P/R4RK1 b - - 0 13,"White throws the game away, but I can understand his loss of nerves (even if we are still at move 13.!). He thought that my open king would be punished by the bishop that was a prisioner. But a sac like that needs accurate calculation, and probably some preparation, like Be3, Qd2. But white doesn't have time for it, because f5 is coming. I didn't play it before because of Qc4+, with some risks I wasn't able to calculate, but ""smelled"" in a bad way (as an Italian would say). So that's the reason - I guess - white opted for the sac. In similar positions, where the knight check allows the white queen to take the bishop, it would work. But not now."

Not that it would have worked: I'm not sure that white can even try a perpetual, but surely not more. But the ""spirit"" was this. Now, if KxB, nothing happens, since after Qe4+, the ominous f5 prevents black from any kind of danger."
