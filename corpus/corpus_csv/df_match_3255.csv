1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,The most respectable move from white as far as I am concerned. So is d4. I pay attention now.
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I usually go this route, the Caro-Kann. I learned it from a blind man."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,The expected standard move on the Caro-Kann.
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,The move most natural to Caro-Kann.
5,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3P4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,Okay. Queen or pawn to take it out?
6,cxd5,c6d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,I chose the pawn.
7,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,Caro is flexible to development.
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,I develop pushing aside the nd2 until later.
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 5,Pressure. To make a good move. d5 is protected. The developed white knight is in a line of fire from a fianchetto I can create.
10,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/5np1/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,So I do the fianchetto.
11,Qb3,d1b3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/5np1/3p4/2PP4/1QN5/PP3PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 1 6,Out comes the white queen on the queen side. I can deal with it using the Caro.
12,dxc4,d5c4,rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/5np1/8/2pP4/1QN5/PP3PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 0 7,Attack and pressure on the white queen to do something like taking the pawn.
13,Bxc4,f1c4,rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/5np1/8/2BP4/1QN5/PP3PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 0 7,He uses the king's bishop instead. Now for the e6.
14,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pp3p1p/4pnp1/8/2BP4/1QN5/PP3PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 0 8,I do it. Caro is Flexible to all attack. That's why I like it.
15,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pp3p1p/4pnp1/8/2BP4/1QN2N2/PP3PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 1 8,Clearing house (white) to develop and 0-0. Rather understandable.
16,a6,a7a6,rnbqkb1r/1p3p1p/p3pnp1/8/2BP4/1QN2N2/PP3PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 0 9,"This ""foot pawn"" denies check by White. A simple one move forward of a pawn to make the game more complicated. In Caro the game WILL get complicated at the cost of the opponent."
17,O-O,e1g1,rnbqkb1r/1p3p1p/p3pnp1/8/2BP4/1QN2N2/PP3PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 1 9,Safety for the king for white.
18,b5,b7b5,rnbqkb1r/5p1p/p3pnp1/1p6/2BP4/1QN2N2/PP3PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 0 10,Pressure from the Caro formation here which started so indiscriminately. Caro-Kann is my favorite defense against e4. In a time clock face to face I will always choose Caro over Sicilian or any other defense against e4 open. Always. It works. It works most times. It has flexibility and power. It does not entrench like the entrenching French Defense (basically a blockade waiting for white to make a mistake--but I prefer attacking instead of hiding under a blockade. I hate the French defense because it is only a defense. The Caro is a counter attack.
19,Be2,c4e2,rnbqkb1r/5p1p/p3pnp1/1p6/3P4/1QN2N2/PP2BPPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 1 10,Retreat from White.
20,b4,b5b4,rnbqkb1r/5p1p/p3pnp1/8/1p1P4/1QN2N2/PP2BPPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 0 11,Caro is still attacking.
