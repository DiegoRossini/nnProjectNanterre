1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Standard opening move.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"I opted with leading with my Nf6. I have preferred opening with the N when playing black. At the same time, if my opponent had lead with e4, I would have been inclined to lead off with Nc6. Previous experience has shown that my opponents will attempt to chase my N if I play too close to their lead pawn. I dont like that."

So far, if I have the advantage early I like to trade if the situation presents itself and I determine it to be favorable. Either my opponent would lose tempo and capture with his N, which in turn I threaten on my next move with Bh6 or he can capture with his K removing the opportunity for castling later and again I threaten with Bh6. 

Computer analysis indicates I should have captured the B on a4 instead."
