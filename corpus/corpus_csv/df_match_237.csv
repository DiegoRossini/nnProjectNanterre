6,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/6b1/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 3 4,Bg4- pinning white knight. Perhaps a gambit.
7,Be2,f1e2,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/6b1/5N2/PPPPBPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 4 4,Queen captures white pawn. I considered capturing with Kf6 but opted for the Queen

11,Nc3,b1c3,rn2kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3q3b/8/2N2N1P/PPPPBPP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 6,White Nc3. Here is where it starts to get interesting. I thought about where to put the Queen. Could of pulled back or moved to lets say Qb6.  Actual move limited any development of Black Bishop. However actual position moved pins white bishop. If white moves Kf3 possible attack on white queen or check on white King. What would you have done?
