1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I sacrificed a pawn to set some structural defects on black's pawns, but he managed to remain dynamic enough and I was forced to regains the pawn... latter on the game I was able to get a small advantage by trapping black's remaining bishop but was ultimately unable to proceed to promotion without losing that advantage. Overall it was a nice dynamic draw against an higher rated opponent, that was never able to exert any pressure... I choose not to publish this analysis yet, because in this tournament my direct opponent has the chance of playing for 19.5 points maximum, and I'm able to get only 19 points maximum for that I need a win against him playing black... my most direct opponent withdraw from this tournament, so now he is playing for 17,5 points and I'm playing for 19 points (although I'm almost sure to lose one point so more realistically I'm playing for 18 points)"
