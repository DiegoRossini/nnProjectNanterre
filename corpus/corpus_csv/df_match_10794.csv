4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/8/1P6/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,"Black blocks his d-pawn. He should have either advanced the e-pawn or played d6. If black had played d5 on move 3, he would not have this trouble."

9,d4,d2d4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2nb1n2/4p3/3P4/1P2PN2/PBP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,I don't agree with this move. I feel that black should have advanced to e4 and retained at least some hold on the center. Now white can gain control of the center.
10,exd4,e5d4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2nb1n2/8/3p4/1P2PN2/PBP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,I don't agree with this move. I feel that black should have advanced to e4 and retained at least some hold on the center. Now white can gain control of the center.
11,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2nb1n2/8/3N4/1P2P3/PBP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,It would be foolish to take with the bishop instead of the knight first wouldn't it? We definately don't want to give up that bishop so easily; it is the star of the Nimzo-Larsen opening.
12,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2nb1n2/8/3N4/1P2P3/PBP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQ - 1 7,"Black has more pieces developed, but his pawn on d7 is cramping up his position and white has a stronger center."
13,Bd3,f1d3,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2nb1n2/8/3N4/1P1BP3/PBP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQ - 2 7,"Developing and getting ready to castle. It is more common to play Be2 or Bb5 in the Nimzo-Larsen, but this is a somewhat strange position for this opening. My light-squared bishop is now eyeing h7."
14,Nxd4,c6d4,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/3b1n2/8/3n4/1P1BP3/PBP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQ - 0 8,The pressure! The knights were just looking at each other waiting to see who would take first!
15,Bxd4,b2d4,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/3b1n2/8/3B4/1P1BP3/P1P2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQ - 0 8,The theme bishop of the nimzo-larsen.
16,Nd5,f6d5,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/3b4/3n4/3B4/1P1BP3/P1P2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQ - 1 9,"This move serves to block in the d-pawn even more. Of course the knight is also looking at a nice seat on b4. Right now, black's light-squared bishop is blocked in, so white's bishop is that much more dominant. This means that white's light-squared bishop is a good target!"
17,Bxh7+,d3h7,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppB/3b4/3n4/3B4/1P2P3/P1P2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQ - 0 9,"Wow! So much more attacking that bad boy. In this position, I was mainly looking at the variation Kh8 which wreaks havoc on black's position. For some reason, I thought that it was also really bad to take the bishop. One of those lapses of tactical vision."
18,Kxh7,g8h7,r1bq1r2/pppp1ppk/3b4/3n4/3B4/1P2P3/P1P2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQ - 0 10,"However, now I can win back the material. I think this was a good choice of moves though. Black's knight could really become a nuisance on b4 and now I've gained an extra pawn and loosened up the black King's position."
19,Qh5+,d1h5,r1bq1r2/pppp1ppk/3b4/3n3Q/3B4/1P2P3/P1P2PPP/RN2K2R b KQ - 1 10,"However, now I can win back the material. I think this was a good choice of moves though. Black's knight could really become a nuisance on b4 and now I've gained an extra pawn and loosened up the black King's position."
20,Kg8,h7g8,r1bq1rk1/pppp1pp1/3b4/3n3Q/3B4/1P2P3/P1P2PPP/RN2K2R w KQ - 2 11,Lining up with the bishop. The only thing obvious for black now is using his bishop on the a3-d6 diagonal. But then black needs to chase away the white Queen if he wants free up his light-squared bishop.
21,Qxd5,h5d5,r1bq1rk1/pppp1pp1/3b4/3Q4/3B4/1P2P3/P1P2PPP/RN2K2R b KQ - 0 11,Lining up with the bishop. The only thing obvious for black now is using his bishop on the a3-d6 diagonal. But then black needs to chase away the white Queen if he wants free up his light-squared bishop.

And it looked like black was aiming at my kingside. Maybe I should have developed my queen's-knight and castled queenside first, but I wasn't sure how I wanted to develop my knight."

However, I forgot about the move..."
