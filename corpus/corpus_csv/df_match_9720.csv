1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"This is the other game between tag1153 and me that I've been slow about annotating, but here it is.

Again, as always tell me about any logical errors or typos.

This is probably the most flexible way for White to start the game. It forces Black to choose what to do without wasting a tempo."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,Black decides to play for a Sicilian or English set up.
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,"White immediately challenges Black's center. It should be noted that White has so far done an excellent job of remaining flexible. This game could transition into QGD or QGA territory, or into Sicilian lines still. This game remains very open ended."
4,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3p4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"I try hard not to do this when I annotate, but I'm going to step into my personal feelings about the game from behind the Black pieces rather than be objective for just a second.

I am a fairly conservative player who likes to keep opening lines fairly fixed. The way White has played until now was driving me absolutely crazy because there was no guarantee as to which opening the game would move into.

So, Black decides to eliminate the QG lines and the English lines. Of course, White still has the option of guiding the game into tons of other openings, and things that resemble other openings. White is still very flexible."
5,Nxd4,f3d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3N4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,Recapturing with the Queen would have simply wasted a tempo after 3. ...Nc6.
6,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/8/3N4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,Black is trying to get rid of the flexibility of the position still.
7,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/8/2PN4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"Finally, White commits to something. Now that he's decided what he wants to play, Black can start to form a plan of attack (or defense)."
8,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk1nr/pp1pppbp/6p1/8/2PN4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,Black begins his development by giving his Bishop access to the long diagonal.
9,e4,e2e4,rnbqk1nr/pp1pppbp/6p1/8/2PNP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"Now White has really committed to an opening. This is called the Maroczy Bind for White. Black's specific line of the Sicilian here is the Accelerated Dragon.

White's control of the light squares will cause Black a lot of trouble trying to get his light-squared Bishop into an effective position. Normally, in the Accelerated Dragon, Black has enough trouble with that, but with a Maroczy Bind, it becomes and absolute nightmare."
10,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/8/2PNP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,This is now book Accelerated Dragon against the Maroczy Bind.
11,Nxc6,d4c6,r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2N3p1/8/2P1P3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"This however, is not. The capture of the Knight on c6 is normally characteristic of very sharp games. Normally, in the Maroczy Bind, White wants to keep Black's play to a minimum, but by doing this, he removes his Knight from its powerful post on d4 and releases tension in the center. He also increases the Bishop on g7's power tremendously."
12,bxc6,b7c6,r1bqk1nr/p2pppbp/2p3p1/8/2P1P3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"I would assume that this move stems from the pressure coming from the g7 Bishop.

However, it should also serve as a clue to Black that White could be planning to castle long. Of course, Black can't know absolutely yet, but this move hints at it."
13,Qc2,d1c2,r1bqk1nr/p2pppbp/2p3p1/8/2P1P3/8/PPQ2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 1 7,"I would assume that this move stems from the pressure coming from the g7 Bishop.

14,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/p2pppbp/2p2np1/8/2P1P3/8/PPQ2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 2 8,Black simply continues developing. He's ready to castle now and adding pressure to the center.
15,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqk2r/p2pppbp/2p2np1/8/2P1P3/2N5/PPQ2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 3 8,White has to develop too of course! This placement on his Knight relieves a bit of the pressure that Black is applying to the center.
16,Qa5,d8a5,r1b1k2r/p2pppbp/2p2np1/q7/2P1P3/2N5/PPQ2PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 4 9,This was a wasted move. The Black Queen ends up going straight back to c7.
17,Bd2,c1d2,r1b1k2r/p2pppbp/2p2np1/q7/2P1P3/2N5/PPQB1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 5 9,"Now there is a slight tension between the Queens. It's nothing large yet, but it affects both players' central plans. If Black ever tries to open the center with ...d5, the resulting trades would open the c-file for the Queens to have at each other.

This isn't to say that both players should try to put as much pressure on the c-file as possible yet, only that they should consider this small tension in their plans and calculations."
18,Qc7,a5c7,r1b1k2r/p1qpppbp/2p2np1/8/2P1P3/2N5/PPQB1PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 6 10,"Now there is a slight tension between the Queens. It's nothing large yet, but it affects both players' central plans.

19,Bd3,f1d3,r1b1k2r/p1qpppbp/2p2np1/8/2P1P3/2NB4/PPQB1PPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 7 10,"Both of White's Bishop's are activated and gunning for the kingside. If the Queen on c2 weren't a good enough hint, this is a clear indication that White plans to castle queenside. The only reason this can be so readily determined is that the light-squared Bishop has no entry into Black's position unless White launches a kingside pawn storm, and usually, you don't storm with pawns in front of the King."
20,d6,d7d6,r1b1k2r/p1q1ppbp/2pp1np1/8/2P1P3/2NB4/PPQB1PPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 11,"Black is now committing to playing with the Bind in place, meaning that he doesn't intend to challenge it. Black needs to be very careful when he does this because it commits him to carefully watching White's powerful attacking ideas for the duration of the Bind.

Black's idea here isn't to develop the Bishop (it's fairly useless everywhere, that's the nature of the Maroczy Bind), but to connect the Rooks in a couple of moves. He will put his Bishop on e6 (which blocks the pawn, but it's safe) so that it can apply the infinitesimal amount of pressure it's capable of applying. 

I think though, that Black would have been better off if he had just played ...Ba6 at some point and left his Queen's scope untouched."
21,O-O-O,e1c1,r1b1k2r/p1q1ppbp/2pp1np1/8/2P1P3/2NB4/PPQB1PPP/2KR3R b kq - 1 11,"There's the castle that White's been flagging since move 7! It's only too bad that Black hasn't done much to prepare for it.

Also, it should be noted that by placing his King on the c-file, White has created more tension (negative tension for him) there."
22,Be6,c8e6,r3k2r/p1q1ppbp/2ppbnp1/8/2P1P3/2NB4/PPQB1PPP/2KR3R w kq - 2 12,The Bishop adds its small bit of tension to the c-file.
