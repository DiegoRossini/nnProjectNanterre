Also, it can allow black to advance his pieces while pushing your queen back as is seen in the game, and finally it takes away the best square for the knight, inhibiting your own development."

8,d5,d7d5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3pp3/4P3/2PP1Q2/PP3PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"the only use of h3 is preventing Bg4, and white uses up a move to stop black from developing to that square even though Be6 is fine.  So white has not really inhibited black from developing, and this move highlights white's faulty opening setup, swinging at ghosts."
