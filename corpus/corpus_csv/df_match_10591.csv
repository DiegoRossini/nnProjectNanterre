1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,For many years my favorite: my stock opening move in OTB and CC.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"A good response.  It can lead to Reversed Sicilians, which is not especially desirable for White, but there are other possibilties..."
3,g3,g2g3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/6P1/PP1PPP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"The move order is flexible here.  I used to play 2.Nc3 then 3.g3, but there's nothing wrong with White's choice."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2P5/6P1/PP1PPP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"Possibly 4....Bb4 or 4...Be7 are better choices.  Sooner or later, White will want to expand on the Q-wing, and the c5-square for the bishop will tend to accelerate that expansion.  This indeed happens in the game, though not in the usual circumstances..."
5,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2P5/6P1/PP1PPPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 3,"Possibly 4....Bb4 or 4...Be7 are better choices.  Sooner or later, White will want to expand on the Q-wing, and the c5-square for the bishop will tend to accelerate that expansion.  This indeed happens in the game, though not in the usual circumstances..."
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2P5/6P1/PP1PPPBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 3 4,"Possibly 4....Bb4 or 4...Be7 are better choices.  Sooner or later, White will want to expand on the Q-wing, and the c5-square for the bishop will tend to accelerate that expansion.  This indeed happens in the game, though not in the usual circumstances..."
7,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2P5/2N3P1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 4 4,"Possibly 4....Bb4 or 4...Be7 are better choices.  Sooner or later, White will want to expand on the Q-wing, and the c5-square for the bishop will tend to accelerate that expansion.  This indeed happens in the game, though not in the usual circumstances..."
8,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/2P5/2N3P1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 5 5,"Possibly 4....Bb4 or 4...Be7 are better choices.

9,d3,d2d3,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/2P5/2NP2P1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,"I used to like 5.e3 here, but the text is OK."
10,Ng4,f6g4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2P3n1/2NP2P1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 1 6,"(?) Premature.  The sequel indicates that Black had more in mind than a cheap kight-fork threat, but miscalculated badly..."
11,e3,e2e3,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2P3n1/2NPP1P1/PP3PBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 6,Repulsing the attack at once.  Black remains unconvinced.
12,Qf6,d8f6,r1b1k2r/pppp1ppp/2n2q2/2b1p3/2P3n1/2NPP1P1/PP3PBP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 1 7,(??) Simply having overlooked the discovered attack on the g4-knight!
13,Qxg4,d1g4,r1b1k2r/pppp1ppp/2n2q2/2b1p3/2P3Q1/2NPP1P1/PP3PBP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 0 7,"(?!) A piece down, Black judges 2 tempi a reasonable price to induce White to recall the queen.  It's hard to say he's wrong in the circumstances, but ...d6 was probably a better choice."
14,Nb4,c6b4,r1b1k2r/pppp1ppp/5q2/2b1p3/1nP3Q1/2NPP1P1/PP3PBP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 1 8,"(?!) A piece down, Black judges 2 tempi a reasonable price to induce White to recall the queen.  It's hard to say he's wrong in the circumstances, but ...d6 was probably a better choice."

16,d6,d7d6,r1b1k2r/ppp2ppp/3p1q2/2b1p3/1nP5/2NPP1P1/PP3PBP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 9,"Presenting the bill.  White gets a very quick expansion on the Q-side, altogether desirable from his point of view."

24,O-O,e8g8,r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/1bnpq3/3Np3/1PP5/P2PP1P1/2Q2PBP/R1B1K1NR w KQ - 5 13,"(?!) White is starting to neglect his development.  There was nio need to be in such a hurry to exchange a well posted knight for a moribund bishop, however desirable exchanges usually are when a piece ahead.  Here, too, Black gets a useful file opened for his a-rook.  More in keeping were developing moves like 13.Nf3 or 13.Ne2 or 13.Bb2."
25,Nxb6,d5b6,r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/1Nnpq3/4p3/1PP5/P2PP1P1/2Q2PBP/R1B1K1NR b KQ - 0 13,"(?!) White is starting to neglect his development.

29,cxb6,c5b6,r1b1r1k1/1pp2ppp/1Pnpq3/4p3/1P6/P2PP1P1/2Q2PBP/R1B1K1NR b KQ - 0 15,15.b5!

31,Qxc7,c2c7,r1b1r1k1/1pQ2ppp/1P1pq3/4p3/1P1n4/P2PP1P1/5PBP/R1B1K1NR b KQ - 0 16,"(!?) This allows Black to save his d4-knight, though a piece and two pawns to the good ought to be enough to win!  16...Nb3 17.Rb1 Nxc1 18.Qxc1..."
