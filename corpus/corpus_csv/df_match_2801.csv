6,c6,c7c6,rnbqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2p3p1/8/2PPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Because of his aggressive pawn moves, I deviate from my plan to castle immediately."
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2p3p1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,"Not the most accurate move, as it pretty much cedes a pawn and white retains a good initiative too, if white chooses to go down that path. But rather than do this, white has ideas of gaining a space advantage, restricting black, and making that positional advantage pay off later."

9,e5,e4e5,rnbqk1nr/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/3pP3/2PP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"So white chooses e5. While less forcing initially, he hopes for a long term advantage while limiting the black counterplay. After a short think, I decide on a plan at this point."
10,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qk1nr/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/3pPb2/2PP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,"I will try to disrupt white's pawn structure where he intends to castle, or just trade off the 'bad' bishop, and then go from there. So it's a little plan, not a long one. Often I enjoy positions that are even not best just because it avoids known book lines."
11,c5,c4c5,rn1qk1nr/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/2PpPb2/3P4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,"Well it's a blitz game. The last white move, c5, was not the best move but it was in keeping with his overall strategy of trying to bottle up black before attacking on one of the wings. After another short think, I decide to allow my light-squared bishop to become trapped. Several moves from now you'll see why. But in evaluating this position, which by the way, is quite horrible for black, that bishop is not worth much. I have allowed White to reduce the value of this bishop, so I will trade it off, even if it's for a couple kingside pawns. But this isn't the evaluating part of the game I wish to speak about, just an incidental part of how the game went. Looks like very poor prospects for black here, doesn't it."
12,e6,e7e6,rn1qk1nr/pp3pbp/2p1p1p1/2PpPb2/3P4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,"Finally have a chess engine I can check accuracy of moves on, and according to Fritz, this is a very bad move. And Fritz is right. But stay tuned."

Learning from what the Grandmasters play is well and good of course; and I do that too. But sometimes I just like seeing the dynamics of positions that won't be found in theory.

But this is a Blitz 'for fun' game, and my opponent does not really think this position out, instead deciding to simply chase the queen with the h pawn.

What would you do in a blitz game here, where you aren't thinking the continuations all the way through? Perhaps develop a piece? That is what white chooses to do. He is thinking not incorrectly, that he wishes to get his king out of the pin. But he chooses a move that Fritz does not like much."

In accordance with that idea, Ne2 would be a very good move for white in this position. However, for some inexplicable reason, white decides he has to do more to take the pressure off of his king, even if it means giving a little something back. In actuality, his king is not in as much danger as he thinks, as black does not have much firepower compared to the available white defenders. As a result, he makes a very poor move here on move 14, essentially equalizing the game for black."

Here is where our evaluation of a chess position must be as dynamic as the position is. Do you see that Ng3 might look tempting? And in the game it was. Most of you would first trade the queens. And so as could be expected, I did that."

White has a minor piece and a great center for two pawns. Look how inviting that g3 square is for the black knight. This is one of those positions, however, that without a lot of calculating, the right move should instantly be apparent, and it isn't Ng3. Consider the position. How valuable is that knight right now? Wouldn't it be apparent that it is easily more valuable than a white rook right now? Both white rooks are doing nothing. No white pieces are doing anything after white's move. The black knight right now is worth far more than the rook. Despite the temptation of the fork, I instinctively dismiss it and instead choose Nxd4, without looking more than a very few moves ahead. Fritz very much agrees. Nxd4 is the best move, and a distinct advantage, rather than Ng3+, forking the rook and king."

Material is even now, but with this move, black's position is far superior to white's. Had I traded the knight for the rook, I would have obtained a material plus, but no real advantage in my eyes. So when we evaluate a game, the dynamics and relative piece-worth of a position really help us decide as we also calculate what's really important because such things affect the actual piece value for what's on the board... or, in other words, a knight is only worth three points and a rook  five, when there are no other considerations. Before this move, that black knight was worth more than any white rook, and this is why."
