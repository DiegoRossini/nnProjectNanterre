1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,hey hey all. i wanted to save this game because it is short and sweet. it is the story of the 2nd match against the host of a mini tournament i am in.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,currently im happy with my result in the tournament. its given me a nice annotation against the leader of the tournament and im placed second.  i can still win but i left my victory in the hands of the current leader. Where he has to lose his last two games and i must win my final 1 to win.  if he loses 1 and wins 1 we tie etc..
3,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,A little back story before this game which may make it more enjoyable as you read.  this is my second mini tournament on game knot where i won the first. and i was able to pull a game like this in each tournment.
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 3,this opponent lost to me in game 1 where i sacrificed all my material to leave him a knight up but have a fast passed pawn and successfully got him to promotion for the win.
5,d3,d2d3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 3,"so my plan this game was to look for an even faster pawn race from the get go, and just see what develops as i assumed my opponent was not well accustomed to defending a fast racing pawn."
6,c6,c7c6,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2p2n2/4p3/2B1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 4,opponent adopts a defensive development.
7,a3,a2a3,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2p2n2/4p3/2B1P3/P2P4/1PP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 4,i open this up in case he comes down with b5 instead of d5.  i was really hoping he was going to go d5
8,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p2n2/3pp3/2B1P3/P2P4/1PP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,yay!

10,cxd5,c6d5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/5n2/3pp3/2B5/P2P4/1PP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,check! more often then not black players will block with their LSB to get an easy trade off of LSB's maybe it is wiser to block with the knight in this instance with the hopes to reinforce the d5 pawn with the b7 pawn if white decides to trade his lsb for a knight.
11,Bb5+,c4b5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/5n2/1B1pp3/8/P2P4/1PP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 6,check! more often then not black players will block with their LSB to get an easy trade off of LSB's maybe it is wiser to block with the knight in this instance with the hopes to reinforce the d5 pawn with the b7 pawn if white decides to trade his lsb for a knight.

14,Bxb5,d7b5,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/5n2/1b1pp3/2P5/P2P4/1P3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 8,exchanges right away to conserve his middle. maybe exchanging the d pawn out first might be better for black opening more views to the white king
15,cxb5,c4b5,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/5n2/1P1pp3/8/P2P4/1P3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 8,and so recapture

17,Nc3,b1c3,rn2kb1r/pp3ppp/5n2/qP1pp3/8/P1NP4/1P3PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 2 9,the knight protects the pawn while being pinned
