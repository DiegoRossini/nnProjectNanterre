2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"So we will have a main line French defence, I'll be attacking the queen side"

8,dxe4,d5e4,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/1b1Pp3/2N2P2/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"As fxe4 leads to Qh4+, and as the knight is pinned the e4 pawn falls"

11,a3,a2a3,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/8/1b1Pp3/P1N1BP2/1PP3PP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,no point in playing Bb4 instead you are not prepared to exchange it for the bishop
