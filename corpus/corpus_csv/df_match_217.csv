Let's assess the situation: both black and white have major strengths and weaknesses in their favor. Black's queen side is completely developed, making attacks easier to launch onto white's very vulnerable king side. If white is planning to castle, white better consider building up a fortress over there especially before the remaining pieces of my arsenal get activated. However, black cannot be careless. The king side has not been fully developed and the bishop on f5 is hanging at the moment. if it is attacked again, the entire king side is in jeopardy. Is there a move that can possibly save black?"

I still maybe prefer something more developmental like castling or moving the bishop, but good reasons to support this are to prevent Bb4 or to advance the pawn later to disrupt the queen side of black."

Develop the queen and connect the rooks. Black's development is officially complete and I proceed with my plan to viciously go after the king. Komodo thinks the line: 12...a6 13. b5 Na5 14. Bd3 is better in the long haul. What do you think readers?

White may have saw the queen move and saw the unprotected bishop immediately and figured that's what I was going for. Sadly, this was not the case. g3 is the safest route out of this, but Komodo proposes yet another interesting line: 13.g4!? Ne7 14 Bb3 should lead to equality it's thinking. This is is why I rely on my own brain to determine the best moves at the time, but what do you think reader? Do you play it safe or do you try Komodo's precarious line and why?"
