1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,was a game I played against one of my best friends and it started like a regular game by me. I love to start with e4 since that it the most simple move that opens up 2 pieces and give you control of the center
2,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,as he went out with Nc6 its a opening I am not used too so I won't lie I used the Gameknot database to see which move fits best and what my choices are.
3,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 2,and that is yet a simple response and I wasn't even sure that it was the best move.
4,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppppppp/2n2n2/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 3 3,ok now he places his second knight on the best place on the board for it. and I need to protect my pawn
5,e5,e4e5,r1bqkb1r/pppppppp/2n2n2/4P3/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,so since he didn't move out his pawn yet I decided that it will be good to advance and keep it safe at the same time and getting into his territory is never a bad thing right?
6,Ng4,f6g4,r1bqkb1r/pppppppp/2n5/4P3/6n1/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,ok I am trying to think how will he benefit from it?
7,d4,d2d4,r1bqkb1r/pppppppp/2n5/4P3/3P2n1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,lets get more support and open up the black bishop and control more of the center!
