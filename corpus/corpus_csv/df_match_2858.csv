1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,E4 is always my preferred opening.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,This move is not very aggressive. I play it because there is no where else to really play it because of where I will put my pawns. I don't like fianchettoing the white bishop in this position at all.

6,g6,g7g6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPPBPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,"In my last annotated game, Blake78613 was kind enough to comment on some of it, and made the observation that black often fianchettoe's depending on if white moves c4 in the Sicilian. Here, I haven't moved my C pawn yet, and my opponent is already moving g6, probably because of my bishop move. Interesting. I am tempted to move c3 and d4 now, to see how play goes. But I need to explore that more fully against lower rated players first, to see how it feels. So I develop as I am wont to when I play against the Sicilian, and plan c4..."

But because black has fianchettoed, it would appear I have plenty of time for getting ready to assault the black king. He also said that black should really move e6, probably before attempting to open things up with d5. Perhaps my opponent did not realize this."

This gives me the option of advancing the f pawn without any tactics occuring on the g1-a7 diagonal; and also if the bishop comes to g4, it allows me to move Ng1, serving three purposes: getting out of the way of the f pawn, and threatening the bishop on g4 while protecting my own bishop, and if retaking, again keeping the d4 square somewhat contested."

Although d5 is a great place for my knight, I can get my other one there if I really wanted to, so I decide to use the knight rather than the h pawn, because with the f pawn advance, my king's defense is already a little loose. Besides, ...e6 would immediately kick my knight away anyways."
