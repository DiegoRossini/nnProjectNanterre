12,Nxg4,f6g4,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/8/2p3N1/2B1pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 7,"So here we are,  with the lovely set-up ..  me as white and down 7 points...  yeah,  against a player what...  500 or more points better rated...I should resign and open the bottle,  it would make for a better evening...  but the morning may be rough...so I play on..."

19,Ne6+,g5e6,rn2qb1r/ppk1p1pp/4N3/2p5/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 2 10,"The temptation is to take e4 and get material back,  but I am thinking the more I can keep his King from being in a happy place the better off I am.  then there is the deal with his knight getting down there and forking me at c2.  I have been killed by that.  where is the rum???"
20,Kb6,c7b6,rn2qb1r/pp2p1pp/1k2N3/2p5/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 3 11,MAN!  another conditional move triggered !  how many games of this has he played???!!!  I better check the mini tournament board....  and run to the liquor store...
