The queen -for the moment-- is safe from harrassment from Nc6, but interesting is 5...c5 attempting to transpose to play resembling the symmetrical variations because it gains black time.  At first glance, the problem with 5...c5 seems to be that it loses time on an opening when very few pieces are already developed by black, but the fact is that black can play the move with relative impunity because white is forced to move the queen.  (Grandmasters today use tranpositions as much as weapons as other techniques.)    Kosten doesn't mention the possibility, but it looks like an enterprising way to attempt to get someone out of their theoretical knowledge-base.  I think it's interesting also because it's uncharted territory.  It's the bane of the chess player: interesting games are novel; novel games are filled with flaws and tactical surprises that may cause a loss."

10,h6,h7h6,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1pp1/2p2n1p/8/2PQ4/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 0 6,"5...d5 is perfectly playable; it accepts the isolated pawn.  Kosten states that 5...d5 6.cxd5 Nxd5 attempting to avoid the isolated pawn is eronious because black will suffer serious problems in the endgame.  Black should not play c6 unless he is willing to accept the IQP play.  The question has been raised ""Why play 5...d5 when the IQP appears to only be a weakness?""  The answer isn't simple.  Part of the answer is unless white errs, it's unavoidable.  Second, after Be6 reinforcing the pawn, black's center can suddenly become strong if white captures on e6.  White will then have to play carefully.  Kosten's book emphasizes undermining the isolani as white, but he provides about a full page of typed analysis on the issue.  Schiller's book on the Tarrasch makes clear that there are tactical advantages from accepting the IQP."
11,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1pp1/2p2n1p/8/2PQ4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 1 6,"White could play Nc3, but the bishop move is forcing.  Black faces several poor choices now.  He can move the same piece twice retreating, or he can move the piece twice tempting white to do so as well.  Playing c5 forces the white queen to move, but white can force black to cede the gained tempo.
If black captures and the queen retakes, it might seem like it goes against the opening principle of getting pieces to their positions as quickly as possible, but white was eventually going to have to move the queen once more anyway, and black violates the principle first.  If 7...c5, then 8.Qe5  seems reasonable.  Both continuations allow white to deprive black of castling rights."

Second, the b pawn is vulnerable.  Expected 11...Nxc3.  It's usually considered good form to reinforce pieces with pawns. As such, if he's concerned about NxN, then f5 might have more merit than Bf5. Frankly Nxe4 allows black to escape the pawn island even if it will require f5 to defend it."

Since DS bishops are gone, the queen capturing on c3 faces no immediate, meaningful challenge.  So 12...Nxc3 13.Qxc3 Qxd5 does seem to escape the IQP, but white's connected rooks can seize her file.
