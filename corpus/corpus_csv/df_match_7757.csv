1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Yes! I always play d4 too!
2,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Black appears to have just wasted a move. I would play 3. e4 now
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,Black appears to have just wasted a move. I would play 3. e4 now

5,h3,h2h3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/2N4P/PPP1PPP1/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"This a non-developing move. As well as e4, I would say Bf4 or Nf3 were both better"
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/2N4P/PPP1PPP1/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,Good move!
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/2N2N1P/PPP1PPP1/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,Good move!
8,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3P4/2N2N1P/PPP1PPP1/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,I'm not sure why black blocks in the Bc8. I would prefer Bf5
9,a3,a2a3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3P4/P1N2N1P/1PP1PPP1/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"Now, in contrast to h3, this is part of a decent plan. White plans Qd3 and e4 and doesn't want this foiled by Bb4"
10,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/3P4/P1N2N1P/1PP1PPP1/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,The position in some ways looks a bit like a French defence now
11,Qd3,d1d3,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/3P4/P1NQ1N1P/1PP1PPP1/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 2 6,The position in some ways looks a bit like a French defence now
12,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/3P4/P1NQ1N1P/1PP1PPP1/R1B1KB1R w KQ - 3 7,The position in some ways looks a bit like a French defence now
13,e4,e2e4,rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/3PP3/P1NQ1N1P/1PP2PP1/R1B1KB1R b KQ - 0 7,The position in some ways looks a bit like a French defence now
14,b6,b7b6,rnbq1rk1/p1p1bppp/1p2pn2/3p4/3PP3/P1NQ1N1P/1PP2PP1/R1B1KB1R w KQ - 0 8,"I like this move, gaining space"
15,e5,e4e5,rnbq1rk1/p1p1bppp/1p2pn2/3pP3/3P4/P1NQ1N1P/1PP2PP1/R1B1KB1R b KQ - 0 8,"I like this move, gaining space"
16,Nfd7,f6d7,rnbq1rk1/p1pnbppp/1p2p3/3pP3/3P4/P1NQ1N1P/1PP2PP1/R1B1KB1R w KQ - 1 9,"and this move could be part of a king's side attack. White threatens Ng5 and Qxh7 mate and if black takes the knight on g5 white can recapture with the pawn, opening up the h file for her rook, so again threatening mate on h7."
17,h4,h3h4,rnbq1rk1/p1pnbppp/1p2p3/3pP3/3P3P/P1NQ1N2/1PP2PP1/R1B1KB1R b KQ - 0 9,"and this move could be part of a king's side attack.

19,Qe3,d3e3,rn1q1rk1/p1pnbppp/bp2p3/3pP3/3P3P/P1N1QN2/1PP2PP1/R1B1KB1R b KQ - 2 10,"white has to take with the king otherwise the h pawn falls. Although unable to castle, this shouldn't be too much of a problem with the centre blocked."

Although the correct plan is a king's side attack, as black hasn't advanced the f, g or h pawns, it will be hard to open a file there. I think best was to secure the d pawn with Ne2, may followed by B-d2-c3 and Rd1, and then use the Nf3 to go back to the old plan of attacking h7 with the Ng5 and queen on d3 or h5"
