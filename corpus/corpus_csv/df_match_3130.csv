1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Many years ago I played an OTB game for Cambridge City Chess Club against Brandon, King's Gambit Chess Club.  It was a home match.  I had played Kevin in a few previous matches, one where I was in an ending of opposite colour bishops and I lost because I overlooked a removal of the guard combo, another where I learned my lesson and did not fall for that trick twice and went on to draw.  Here the opposite bishop scenario did not occur and the position appeared to be even right to the endgame where he made one slip up and it cost him dear.  Here is how it all happened ...."
