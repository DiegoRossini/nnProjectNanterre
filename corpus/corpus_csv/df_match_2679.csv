1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The French Defense. Viewed by many to be dull(as in the exchange variation), it actually leads to sharp and tactical positions; the Winawer, for example."
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The French Defense. Viewed by many to be dull(as in the exchange variation), it actually leads to sharp and tactical positions; the Winawer, for example."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"2. d3 leads to a rather closed position: 2...d5 3. Nd2(3. Qe2 Nf6 4. Nf3 Be7 5. g3 0-0 6. Bg2 c5 when Black has a sturdy and dynamic position)3...Nf6 4. Ngf3 b6 5. c3 c5!? 6. Qa4+!? Qd7 7. Qc2 Qc7 8. Be2 Nc6. This move is probably the best move in the position, and the most natural."
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3pp3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,? 2...d5 is the best continuation. Now White has a strong sturdy center while Black has nothing to show for it.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3pp3/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"? Another bad move. 3...Nf6 should be tried, though after 4. Nf3 Nc6 5. Bd3 Be7 6. Qe2!? 0-0 7. e5 dxe5 8. dxe5 Nd5 9. h4 f5? 10. exf6 e.p gxf6 11. Ng5! fxg5 12. hxg5 Rf7 13. Qh5 Nxc3 14. bxc3 Qd5 15. Bxh7+ Kf8 16. Bg6 Black is going down in flames from Gampe-Kaulfuss, Bundesliga 2002."
6,a6,a7a6,rnbqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p2pp3/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"? Another bad move. 3...Nf6 should be tried, though after 4. Nf3 Nc6 5. Bd3 Be7 6. Qe2!? 0-0 7. e5 dxe5 8. dxe5 Nd5 9. h4 f5? 10. exf6 e.p gxf6 11. Ng5! fxg5 12. hxg5 Rf7 13. Qh5 Nxc3 14. bxc3 Qd5 15. Bxh7+ Kf8 16.

7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p2pp3/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"??! This is taking things too far. 4...b5 would have been the right choice, going for things on the queenside."
8,h6,h7h6,rnbqkbnr/1pp2pp1/p2pp2p/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"??! This is taking things too far. 4...b5 would have been the right choice, going for things on the queenside."
9,Be3,c1e3,rnbqkbnr/1pp2pp1/p2pp2p/8/3PP3/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"A reasonable developing move. Also good would have been 5. Bf4, though I didn't want my bishop to be too vulnerable on that square."
10,b5,b7b5,rnbqkbnr/2p2pp1/p2pp2p/1p6/3PP3/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Only now does Black get things going for him on the queenside. In effect, he has not developed any pieces at all, while White has the pawn center and three pieces developed vs none.

Development and center vs moving pawns all around= White has a advantage."
11,Qd2,d1d2,rnbqkbnr/2p2pp1/p2pp2p/1p6/3PP3/2N1BN2/PPPQ1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 1 6,Another interesting move would have been 6. a4!? cracking the Black pawn structure on the queenside: 6...b4 7. Nb1 Nf6 8. Bd3 then Qd2 looks attractive. I was aware of this but first wanted to castle.
12,Nd7,b8d7,r1bqkbnr/2pn1pp1/p2pp2p/1p6/3PP3/2N1BN2/PPPQ1PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 2 7,Better than 6...Nc6 when his bishop would be blocked when it came to b7.
13,d5,d4d5,r1bqkbnr/2pn1pp1/p2pp2p/1p1P4/4P3/2N1BN2/PPPQ1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"One of my first spatial gains: FIRST: White locks the center, and claims c6 and d5. Black will likely respond e5, when White can try for a pawn break like f2-f4."
14,e5,e6e5,r1bqkbnr/2pn1pp1/p2p3p/1p1Pp3/4P3/2N1BN2/PPPQ1PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 8,And now I want more space on the queenside. Also possible was 0-0-0.

17,Nxa4,c3a4,r1bqkbnr/2pn1pp1/p2p3p/3Pp3/N3P3/4BN2/1PPQ1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 9,"This move is more flexible than Rxa4, because it prepares the advances: b4, c4, and then c5. After White makes these advances and solidifies it, it will be clear that he dominates the center and the queenside."
18,Ngf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/2pn1pp1/p2p1n1p/3Pp3/N3P3/4BN2/1PPQ1PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 1 10,"He wants his knight for the bishop, though the knights are stronger than bishops in this kind of position. Still, this trades off a supporter of the c5 square, the one where White desperately wants a white pawn on."
19,Bd3,f1d3,r1bqkb1r/2pn1pp1/p2p1n1p/3Pp3/N3P3/3BBN2/1PPQ1PPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 2 10,"He wants his knight for the bishop, though the knights are stronger than bishops in this kind of position. Still, this trades off a supporter of the c5 square, the one where White desperately wants a white pawn on."

22,Nxe3,g4e3,r1bqkb1r/2pn1pp1/p2p3p/3Pp3/N3P3/3BnN2/1PPQKPPP/R6R w kq - 0 12,"Black obviously wants to trade pieces and go into a endgame. This would be bad for White to trade pieces, because trading pieces in a cramped position is good for the defender. So I avoid Nxb6, also because the c3-c4-c5 advance would be much harder to make."
23,Qxe3,d2e3,r1bqkb1r/2pn1pp1/p2p3p/3Pp3/N3P3/3BQN2/1PP1KPPP/R6R b kq - 0 12,"Black obviously wants to trade pieces and go into a endgame.

I was impressed by this move; Black attempts to get active pieces for some material; the question is whether this is enough or not. In my opinion it is not, though it takes some good play by White. Anyway, this is a good pyschological decision; he's not going to sit hopelessly and get squashed!"
