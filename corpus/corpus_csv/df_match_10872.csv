1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The following game in the Dragon Sicilian (with 10..Rb8!?) is full of flavor, but at the expense of objective and practical inaccuracies on both sides. Nevertheless, it is an enjoyable game and certainly instructive in how the creation of tactical maelstroms often favors the attacking player (e.g. the one with the most options)."

In any case, White now weakens his f3 pawn. when ideas like ..b5 and ..Ne5 are more dangerous for the first player. Much better is simply 11.h4 or 11.Bb3."

Black overlooked this move somehow. Instead, Black needed to play 13..a4 himself."

Objectively the text move is fine (and certainly more in the spirit of things), but Black really should have locked up the point via ..Nh5 and queenside play."
35,h3,h2h3,1rr3k1/3bppbp/3p2p1/qN2n1P1/B2Nn3/1P2BP1P/P1P1Q3/2KR3R b - - 0 18,"'??' - Black's bravado apparently intimidates White into backing away from the sacrifice. Now, Black is completely winning via ..Nc5 or ..Bxb5 and ..Ng3.  After fxe4 Black intended ..Nc4!? with a wild and unclear game. According to post game analysis, White needs to defend a minefield of threats (and Black must play accurately in attack) to reach a drawn position. Over the board, Black was simply looking to ""spice things up,"" and indeed in that line Black has many mating chances."
36,Ng3,e4g3,1rr3k1/3bppbp/3p2p1/qN2n1P1/B2N4/1P2BPnP/P1P1Q3/2KR3R w - - 1 19,"One path to victory. More decisive was the intermezzo 18..Bxb5 Nxb5, when the White Queen's retreat to e1 after ..Ng3 allows ..Rxb5 and Black is up an entire piece with attack. The text move also wins, but not as easily."
37,Qe1,e2e1,1rr3k1/3bppbp/3p2p1/qN2n1P1/B2N4/1P2BPnP/P1P5/2KRQ2R b - - 2 19,"White enters this move and promptly resigns, allegedly in view of ..Nd3  threats (which do not exist with accurate defense). In fact, Black overwhelms instead after  the thematic 19...Rxb5! 20.Nxb5 Qa6!, as the Ba4 cannot move in any scenario because of ..Qxa2 and dire threats to the White king, e.g. 21. Qxg3 Nxb5 and Bxb5? is impossible and Black is a piece up with a winning attack to boot.

Nonetheless, White should have forced Black to find this continuation in real play. If Black slips up, White has real chances to save the game."
