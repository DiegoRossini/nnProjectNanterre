1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Master Chrisobee kindly invited me to attend his team's chessic New Year's Party tournament.  Yours truly somehow manages to join in the fun by making an absolute meal of a victory against my Class C opponent, Ed.  Ed did play very well all the way through to ensure that I did make heavy weather of such a victory.  In fact I think he was very unfortunate to lose this game but his speculative piece sac in the middlegame to try and checkmate Henry did not pay off.  So, how did I manage to do this?  Well, here is the Gameknot Analysis as follows:- http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17135473&fb=1&rnd=0.3426624133135317.  As you can see from the analysis, there is plenty of yellow my side of the board!!  In response to my opponent's e4 I decided to play the French Defense.  Since being absolutely canned by my master buddy Lighttotheright in this opening in a training game I have not played this opening very much in a rated game, particularly with 18 or 19 rating points at stake if I mess up here!  But I take my courage in both hands and thankfully I was eventually rewarded, but not until the Wicked Witch of the West gave Henry a few scares!  So, here we go ......"
