1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was a long tough game for me. Over the period of our game both our ratings fluctuated, mine quite wildly. For me this makes the game more intriguiing. I hope you enjoy it It was one of the most enjoyable games I've played for a while."

5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 3,"I don't often play this, my intention was to temporarily pin the e pawn"

7,f3,f2f3,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP2b1/2N2P2/PP2P1PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,slightly weakens the king side defence should he castle there. This also severely limits the possibilities for his knight
8,Bh5,g4h5,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p3b/2PP4/2N2P2/PP2P1PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,Again not a move I would normally play but this was intended to keep some pressure applied.
9,Qc2,d1c2,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p3b/2PP4/2N2P2/PPQ1P1PP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 2 5,"Looking for e4

This takes us out of the Gameknot database"
10,Bg6,h5g6,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5nb1/3p4/2PP4/2N2P2/PPQ1P1PP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 3 6,This is a poor move that loses me a tempo
11,e4,e2e4,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5nb1/3p4/2PPP3/2N2P2/PPQ3PP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 0 6,White merely continues as planned
12,e6,e7e6,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pnb1/3p4/2PPP3/2N2P2/PPQ3PP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 0 7,Supporting the d pawn and opening a line for the dsb
13,a3,a2a3,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pnb1/3p4/2PPP3/P1N2P2/1PQ3PP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 0 7,"I'm not sure this move is necessary, though it does support a potential b4. It also suggests that white is thinking of king side castling, however none of his peices on that side are developed"
14,c6,c7c6,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pnb1/3p4/2PPP3/P1N2P2/1PQ3PP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 0 8,Further supporting my d pawn. I am not concerned about restricting my knight as I am looking to move the knight on b8 to d7. The pawn move also opens a line to a5 for my queen. If the queen is on a5 then Bb4 is a threat to white who can't take the bishop with his pawn or he will lose his rook. If white was better developed on the king side this would not be so much of a threat
15,Bd3,f1d3,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pnb1/3p4/2PPP3/P1NB1P2/1PQ3PP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 1 8,White is probably looking at e5 but I didn't see that at the time
16,Bd6,f8d6,rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/2pbpnb1/3p4/2PPP3/P1NB1P2/1PQ3PP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 2 9,This is a blunder
17,e5,e4e5,rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/2pbpnb1/3pP3/2PP4/P1NB1P2/1PQ3PP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 0 9,"White continues with his plan but now has a bonus, not only the fork but the lsb is under pressure too"
18,Bc7,d6c7,rn1qk2r/ppb2ppp/2p1pnb1/3pP3/2PP4/P1NB1P2/1PQ3PP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 1 10,This was about the best move I could see under the circumstances. It means that if I castle queen's side I have a little more protection for my king
19,Bxg6,d3g6,rn1qk2r/ppb2ppp/2p1pnB1/3pP3/2PP4/P1N2P2/1PQ3PP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 0 10,On the bright side my h rook gets a half open file.
20,hxg6,h7g6,rn1qk2r/ppb2pp1/2p1pnp1/3pP3/2PP4/P1N2P2/1PQ3PP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 0 11,On the bright side my h rook gets a half open file.

22,Qxf6,d8f6,rn2k2r/ppb2pp1/2p1pqp1/3p4/2PP4/P1N2P2/1PQ3PP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 0 12,I'm still not sure if this a mistake as gxf6 would give me a strong cluster of pawns near the centre.
23,Be3,c1e3,rn2k2r/ppb2pp1/2p1pqp1/3p4/2PP4/P1N1BP2/1PQ3PP/R3K1NR b KQkq - 1 12,Looking to castle
24,Nd7,b8d7,r3k2r/ppbn1pp1/2p1pqp1/3p4/2PP4/P1N1BP2/1PQ3PP/R3K1NR w KQkq - 2 13,Looking to castle
