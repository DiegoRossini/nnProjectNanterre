CHECKMATE

Now this attack was - it is true - speculative. But down a pawn, I looked forward to slow death if I played it safe. 

But while I thought I had a mating net, I think black can find safety on the a4 and b4 squares, shuttling back and forth.  The problem is that white needs to bring the rook into the final mating step, and if black plays carefully, I don't see how white can weave the mating net. 

Instead, it is a draw."
