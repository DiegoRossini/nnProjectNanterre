1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"A little interlude to the Grand Tour match of fatcat2 vs Computers. Having played 4 games so far against various computers, I am beginning to feel that I'm missing something. What I need is a good example of how to beat my silicon opponents - and what better one to look at than the 1st game of the 1997 match of Garry Kasparov vs the updated Deep Blue?

We start with the Reti Opening. Quite a recent one, and a flexible opening as it offers opportunities to transpose into King Pawn, Queen Pawn or English setups."
