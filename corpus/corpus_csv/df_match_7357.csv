1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I've long had a dislike for the English, enjoying tactics more than positional play I've found this opening to cater almost exclusively to the latter. However lately, after much pressure from my friends, I've started examining and playing it, finding some interest in its dynamic positions and large transpositional value."

16,Nbd7,b8d7,r2qk2r/pbpnbppp/1p1ppn2/8/2PPP3/P1NB1N2/1PQ2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 2 9,Of course. Black seems to be postponing castling until they can determine White's motives and then can pick a wing accordingly.
17,e5,e4e5,r2qk2r/pbpnbppp/1p1ppn2/4P3/2PP4/P1NB1N2/1PQ2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 0 9,"Now we're in a single game in the database, the other contained 9. O-O c5 when Black castled short, produced lots of pressure after some logical seeming moves by White and won in 41 moves. That being said, castling is probably the stronger move, getting the king to safety and holding the advantage in the center. But this game will probably be more fun :)"

More protection cannot be added to e5 but this move helps that goal indirectly. After 13...Ndxe5 either 14. Bg3 or 14. Kb1 removes the threat of Nd3+ getting out of the pin and winning the hanging bishop after which Black feels the power of the two bishops. 13...Nfxe5 fails faster to the strong sacrifice 14. Rxd7! Qxd7 15.Rd1
