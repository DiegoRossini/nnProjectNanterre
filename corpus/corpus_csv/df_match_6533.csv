1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I liked open games at the time.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,So did J. B.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Always. I was anticipating a Ruy Lopez.
4,f6,f7f6,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"Looking back with 20 years of hindsight, not the best move J. B. could have played."
5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 3,Continuing to develop...
6,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1p2pp/2p2p2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,"I'm guessing he intended 4...P-Q4, shutting off the Bishop."
7,Nxe5,f3e5,rnbqkbnr/pp1p2pp/2p2p2/4N3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,"What the hell, may as well be adventurous."
8,fxe5,f6e5,rnbqkbnr/pp1p2pp/2p5/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"Of course, he retakes."
9,Qh5+,d1h5,rnbqkbnr/pp1p2pp/2p5/4p2Q/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 1 5,"That infamous lightning-stroke, Q-R5 ch, shows up again."
10,Ke7,e8e7,rnbq1bnr/pp1pk1pp/2p5/4p2Q/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 2 6,5...P-N3 wouldn't help much... though it would have stopped the immediate checkmate. [5...P-N3 6 QxKP ch followed by 7 QxR would have supplied me with a winning material advantage.]
11,Qxe5#,h5e5,rnbq1bnr/pp1pk1pp/2p5/4Q3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 0 6,"We barely sat down, and the game is over."
