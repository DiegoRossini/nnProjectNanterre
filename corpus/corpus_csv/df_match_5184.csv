1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"An exciting game from Gameknot's 80th tournament. After Black launches an assault on White very early on, White is able to storm back after a couple of errors in Black's attack gives White the advantage in position and material... though he soon gives up that material advantage in favour of what he hoped to be a winning positional strike. It doesn't quite work out that way... well, it shouldn't have worked out that way, but it did!"

17,g4,g2g4,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2nppn2/8/2BNPPP1/2N1B3/PPP4P/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 9,"? It will most definitely not be a move that I'll play again, though! White goes for a kingside pawn storm that comes way too early, and Black is quick to exploit that!"
18,Nxd4,c6d4,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/3ppn2/8/2BnPPP1/2N1B3/PPP4P/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 10,"But first, the exchange!"
19,Bxd4,e3d4,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/3ppn2/8/2BBPPP1/2N5/PPP4P/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 10,"! The key move - as well as hitting the d4 bishop, it discovers a second attacker on the pawn that I have just pushed forward."
20,e5,e6e5,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/3p1n2/4p3/2BBPPP1/2N5/PPP4P/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 11,"! The key move - as well as hitting the d4 bishop, it discovers a second attacker on the pawn that I have just pushed forward."

22,dxe5,d6e5,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/5n2/4p3/2BBP1P1/2N5/PPP4P/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 12,...but it seriously exposes White's position!

24,Nxg4,f6g4,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/8/4B3/2B1P1n1/2N5/PPP4P/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 13,...but it seriously exposes White's position!
25,Qxd8,d1d8,r1bQ1rk1/pp2bppp/8/4B3/2B1P1n1/2N5/PPP4P/R3K2R b KQ - 0 13,"White recognises that he's exposed and exchanges queens - I wonder whether Bg3 was better, followed by Qd3 and 0-0-0 - probably not, since that isn't taking into account what Black's moves would be!"
26,Rxd8,f8d8,r1br2k1/pp2bppp/8/4B3/2B1P1n1/2N5/PPP4P/R3K2R w KQ - 0 14,"Since the king would move over a checked square, castling seems even more unlikely now!"
27,Bf4,e5f4,r1br2k1/pp2bppp/8/8/2B1PBn1/2N5/PPP4P/R3K2R b KQ - 1 14,"The bishop was threatened, but as I mentioned earlier, it might have been better to move it back to the g3 square..."
28,Bh4+,e7h4,r1br2k1/pp3ppp/8/8/2B1PBnb/2N5/PPP4P/R3K2R w KQ - 2 15,...because of this check!
29,Ke2,e1e2,r1br2k1/pp3ppp/8/8/2B1PBnb/2N5/PPP1K2P/R6R b - - 3 15,"I don't really know why I didn't block the check now, but GK analysis didn't see anything wrong with this move!"
30,Nf2,g4f2,r1br2k1/pp3ppp/8/8/2B1PB1b/2N5/PPP1Kn1P/R6R w - - 4 16,Attacking the rook...
31,Rhg1,h1g1,r1br2k1/pp3ppp/8/8/2B1PB1b/2N5/PPP1Kn1P/R5R1 b - - 5 16,?! ...and moving away from the danger - but to the wrong square? Rf1 was preferred with analysis due to Nh3 - a double attack on the rook and bishop - and Black keeps up the pressure!
32,Bg4+,c8g4,r2r2k1/pp3ppp/8/8/2B1PBbb/2N5/PPP1Kn1P/R5R1 w - - 6 17,"Black plays this check instead, and though it looks perfectly natural apparently it threw away the advantage that Black had..."
33,Ke3,e2e3,r2r2k1/pp3ppp/8/8/2B1PBbb/2N1K3/PPP2n1P/R5R1 b - - 7 17,"...leading to GK analysis judging this position to have equal chances for both sides! (well, 0.08 to White but that's negligible!) That's pretty crazy given the Black pieces invading kingside!"
34,Bh5,g4h5,r2r2k1/pp3ppp/8/7b/2B1PB1b/2N1K3/PPP2n1P/R5R1 w - - 8 18,"Not really sure what this was actually meant to do, but it provides White with a great opportunity to rid my weak kingside of invading pieces..."
