1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"After four years, I have gone back to playing 1. e4, and am rediscovering the beauty of attacking play rather than the positional play of my beloved Reti/English.  This game features a Four Knights Sicilian with a direct kingside attack."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"FYI for the novices, other 2nd moves for Black are 2...e6, 2...d6, and my personal favorite, 2...g6."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"FYI for the novices, other 2nd moves for Black are 2...e6, 2...d6, and my personal favorite, 2...g6."

5,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"I was toying with the idea of 3 Bb5, however, the reason I switched back to 1. e4 was to more fully explore the open positions in order to further my development as an attacking player."
6,cxd4,c5d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"3...g6 is the Accelerated Dragon, my main line in the Sicilian."
7,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"3...g6 is the Accelerated Dragon, my main line in the Sicilian."
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"3...g6 is the Accelerated Dragon, my main line in the Sicilian."
9,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,"A conservative positional approach by Black.  5...e5 is the sharp Shveshnikov variation, where, as an English player, exploiting the weak d5-square is second nature."
10,e6,e7e6,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"A conservative positional approach by Black.  5...e5 is the sharp Shveshnikov variation, where, as an English player, exploiting the weak d5-square is second nature."
11,a3,a2a3,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/8/3NP3/P1N5/1PP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"This position is similar to the Symmetrical English where White plays an early d4, although White would have a pawn on c4.  In the English lines, White doesnt waste time with a3, as the weak doubled pawns on c4 and c3 are compensated by control over d5 and d4.  Here the doubled pawns would be on c2 and b3, so I don't want to allow that."
12,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/pp1pbppp/2n1pn2/8/3NP3/P1N5/1PP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,"6...Bc5 might slow the White kingside pawn storm, as after 0-0, I would have to take time out for Kh1 before playing f4."
13,Be2,f1e2,r1bqk2r/pp1pbppp/2n1pn2/8/3NP3/P1N5/1PP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 7,"I decide to adopt the classical setup, no need to try to blow Black off the board.  He is playing solidly and I decide to show a healthy respect for his solid position."
14,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp1pbppp/2n1pn2/8/3NP3/P1N5/1PP1BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 3 8,Prophylaxis!  Keeping the d-knight out of b5 where it forces Black's hand in the center.

Another reminder, the best defense is a good offense.  Black needs to break with b5 or start preparing d5 for some much needed counterplay."

21,Qe1,d1e1,r1bqr1k1/1p2bppp/p1nppn2/8/3NPP2/P1N1B3/1PP1B1PP/R3QRK1 b - - 1 11,A standard plan to transfer my queen to the kingside to start the direct assault.
