e4.  Standard opening usually met with e5 or c5.  I always take the other route."
2,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,The Nimzovitch!  Grabs control of the center and developes a minor piece.  Sound opening principles.
3,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 2,Nf3.  The best defense.  Covering the attacking squares and moving one step closer to castling.
4,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppppppp/2n2n2/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 3 3,Nf6.  Attacking the pawn and covering the remaining two center squares.  Note: if e5 is played then Ng4 is fun but Nf5 is more sound.  Moving into an Alekhine line.
5,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/pppppppp/2n2n2/8/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 4 3,"Nc3.  Developing a piece, controlling key squares, and protecting the e4 pawn.  This game could transpose into many lines, more often to the 4 knights.  4 Knights is too common and boring.  So I move to..."
6,d5,d7d5,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3p4/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"d5!.  Immediate pressure in the center. e5 is met with Nd7 and then to a standard Alekhine line.  exd5,Nxd5 is playable but then leads to equally developed pieces.  This is one of my goals as black.  Usually a piece behind in the opening, it feels good to have my stallions out against his."
7,d3,d2d3,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3p4/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"d3.  Too safe for me.  Protecting the e pawn and opening lines for the dark squared bishop.  I think I'll add more pressure to the center, as d4 is weak."
8,e5,e7e5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3pp3/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"e5.  More pressure on d4.  I'd like to put a knight there one day.  I could have played more aggressive though with ..dxe4, dxe4 Qxd1, Nxd1 Nxe4.  That would be ideal, disrupting his castling ability and gaining a pawn."
9,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3pp1B1/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,There goes that plan. Bg5.  This helps with my development but makes d5 EXTREMELY weak.  I have to protect that square.
10,Be6,c8e6,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1bn2/3pp1B1/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,Brings out a piece and covers the weak square.  The first idea of Be7 develops and helps castling but loses to exd5.
11,exd5,e4d5,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1bn2/3Pp1B1/8/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,I'll take it!  Development may have been better since everything was covered for him.  Let the exchanges begin!
12,Bxd5,e6d5,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3bp1B1/8/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,I'll take it!  Development may have been better since everything was covered for him.  Let the exchanges begin!
13,Nxd5,c3d5,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3Np1B1/8/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,Take.
14,Qxd5,d8d5,r3kb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3qp1B1/8/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,Take.  Oh no! My Knight!
15,Bxf6,g5f6,r3kb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2B2/3qp3/8/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,Ouch.  There goes my kingside developement.
16,gxf6,g7f6,r3kb1r/ppp2p1p/2n2p2/3qp3/8/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 9,Always take inwards with the pawns.   Funny enough this strengthens my pawn on e5 and opens a file for my rook.  I wouldn't castle king side if I were him.  Also my King is now ready to castle queen side.
17,Be2,f1e2,r3kb1r/ppp2p1p/2n2p2/3qp3/8/3P1N2/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 9,Developes a piece and looks like he is gonna castle.
18,h5,h7h5,r3kb1r/ppp2p2/2n2p2/3qp2p/8/3P1N2/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 10,Starts a Kingside attack.  Probably a bit too early but it does allow me to move my bishop to h6 whenever I please since the rook will cover it.
19,c4,c2c4,r3kb1r/ppp2p2/2n2p2/3qp2p/2P5/3P1N2/PP2BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 10,The attack begins!  I need to move the Queen.  f6 is weak as well as b7.  His weaknesses are b2 and g2.  Time to devise a plan.  The king is opened now with only one defender.  See the tactic?  Here it comes.
20,Bb4+,f8b4,r3k2r/ppp2p2/2n2p2/3qp2p/1bP5/3P1N2/PP2BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 1 11,Bb4!.  forcing the Knight to defend or else he loses the ability to castle or sacs his Queen.
21,Nd2,f3d2,r3k2r/ppp2p2/2n2p2/3qp2p/1bP5/3P4/PP1NBPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 2 11,Kf1 was better.
