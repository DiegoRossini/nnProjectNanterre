1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"My favored opening. My friend rt4sm claims this is not an exciting way to start. He may very well be right, but I have played it so many times, it feels like an old flannel shirt or your favorite shotgun;comfortable and warm.....It's won me a fair amount of games too, and in my opinion seems to favor white more than e4. (keep in mind my opinions are pretty laughable most of the time)"
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,A pretty standard response.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,1.d4 seems to commonly followed by 2. c4. The Queen's Gambit. Will he accept or decline?
4,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p1b2/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"Decline!  D06: QGD, Grau (Sahovic) defense. I've played this twice as white, one win, one draw. Seems like I have a chance if I don't make a blunder, but all of my previous games with yodean have gone _his_ way, so I know I have to play perfectly to have a chance."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p1b2/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 3,"This seems pretty standard so far, both sides are getting pieces in place for the coming battles. QGD games allow for development for both sides and don't seem to have huge attack potential for black right away."
6,e6,e7e6,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p1b2/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"This seems pretty standard so far, both sides are getting pieces in place for the coming battles. QGD games allow for development for both sides and don't seem to have huge attack potential for black right away."

9,Bg5,c1g5,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p1bB1/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 3 5,"I normally don't use queen pins like this as they are so easily counteracted, but I thought I'd give it a whirl this game. Worst case is a pawn attack on the bishop and having to skulk back to g3. Really not a bad spot for a bishop anyhow."
10,Be7,f8e7,rn1qk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p1bB1/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 4 6,Black frees the knight from the pin and leaves potential for a discovered attack on the  bishop.
11,e3,e2e3,rn1qk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p1bB1/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,protecting the c pawn and preparing for a kingside castle.
12,h6,h7h6,rn1qk2r/ppp1bpp1/4pn1p/3p1bB1/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,Now he's out to dislodge the bishop.
13,Bh4,g5h4,rn1qk2r/ppp1bpp1/4pn1p/3p1b2/2PP3B/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 7,"Now MY knight is pinned. This happens so often in Queen Pawn games I hardly give it a second thought, I'm normally happy to trade Knight for Bishop."
14,Bb4,e7b4,rn1qk2r/ppp2pp1/4pn1p/3p1b2/1bPP3B/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 8,"Now MY knight is pinned. This happens so often in Queen Pawn games I hardly give it a second thought, I'm normally happy to trade Knight for Bishop."

16,Be4,f5e4,rn1qk2r/ppp2pp1/4pn1p/3p4/1bPPb2B/2N1PN2/PP2BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 4 9,Still not concerned. I'd love to have both his bishops off the table!

18,Bxc3,b4c3,rn1qk2r/ppp2pp1/4pn1p/3p4/2PPb2B/2b1PN2/PP2BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 10,This is fine with me. Only downside is the lone pawn on the a file. I rather like the doubled pawns in this case.

21,cxd5,c4d5,rn2k2r/ppp1qpp1/4pn1p/3P4/3Pb2B/2P1PN2/P3BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 11,"the pawn is a dead duck, but has  another one right behind him to complicate matters."

I am trying to get him to move the b pawn. It seems SO smart to move here. If he advances the b pawn I can move my Bishop to b5 and cause all sorts of mischief."

I'm doomed and I know it, down 2 points and minus a rook to dean is certain death. I should just quit. This sucks, I loathe myself and all of chess. The squares are leering at me. I'll take the Bishop before I quit at least......"
