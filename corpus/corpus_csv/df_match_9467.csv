Unfortunately, it didn't take me long to realize that against theoretically prepared strong players (most strong MKs, FIDE masters and above) Benoni is very sensitive and I got crushed repeatedly. Since I was always slightly lazy when it comes to learning theory, I gradually switched to Queen's Gambit Declined as my primary defense to 1.d4."

At the first glance it seems that the most natural move is 6.Nf3, but actually 6.e3 is better because it is slightly more flexible regarding later development.

Since before this game I have never played against or analyzed 10.Nge2 and my opponent played first 10 moves instantly (always a reason to be careful!), I decided to employ my favourite method in such cases - play something that is positionally sound but is likely out of theoretical mainlines. This move is a good choice because: 1) it stops any ideas of minority attack on the queenside (a major strategic plan in Exchange variation) 2) in unlikely event White castles on the queenside, the attack is already on the way (11.0-0-0, Na6! and Black has a slight edge) 3) it gives Black an option to play Na6 without fear of Ba6 (with doubled isolated pawns on a file) *** It turned out I was correct - this move is not recorded in my databases at all, I only found 10...Ne4 and 10...b6 (with the same idea of allowing Na6 -> Nc7 without fear of Ba6)."
21,O-O,e1g1,rnbqr1k1/1p2bpp1/2p2n1p/p2p4/3P3B/2NBP3/PPQ1NPPP/R4RK1 b - - 1 11,"After 10 minutes of thinking (which made me pretty happy, since I knew that now we are both in uncharted waters) White decided to play principally and follow the main plan in the position."

After 11...Na6; 12.a3, Nc7 the Knight blocks the a5-d8 diagonal for the Queen while it practically must go to e6 next. That is not a bad plan but I wanted to have more flexibility and in any case forcing White to play a useful move (12.a3) is not really beneficial - it is much better to let him find a good move on his own."

Black has enough time to set up a good defensive position with a lot of pressure against the d4-e4 pawn center, so White should be patient and manoeuvre for a while before trying to open the game (h3, Rfe1, Bg3 etc.)"

Interesting psychological moment - this move is almost 'mandatory' here (otherwise White would have to admit that 12.f3 was premature), but I have to note that calm moves like 13.Rae1, 13.Bg3 or 13.Na4 are objectively a better choice. *** While I was first annotating this game a few months ago, I happened to find myself in this exact position here on GameKnot! So I decided to postpone publishing the annotation until the relevant game is finished. In that game miljac played 13.Na4, which after 13...Ne6; 14.Rac1, b5 eventually ended in a 58-move draw."
26,dxe4,d5e4,r1bqrnk1/1p2bpp1/2p2n1p/p7/3Pp2B/2NB1P2/PPQ1N1PP/R4RK1 w - - 0 14,"This move marks the end of the opening. Both players have executed their respective plans and now it is time to evaluate the results. *** At the first glance, White's pawn center together with the open f file looks really threatening, but a closer look reveals that it is in fact very vulnerable to pressure. The Knight on e2 is misplaced and should ideally be on f3, where it has greater control of the center and does not block e file for the Rooks. Another problem is that (if White advances the e pawn) the center might get permanently blockaded and later turned into a liability requiring constant defense. Objective assessment of the position (verified by analysis) is surprising - Black has slight advantage if he plays accurately!"

The idea is to maximize pressure on the pawn center before forcing things with future Ne6. Although 14...Bg4 is practically not a bad move, much better alternative is direct 14...Ne6! when 15.d5 (15.Bf2, Ng4 with advantage for Black), Nc5; 16.Rad1 is slightly better for Black."

Unfortunate side-effect of this move is that the f file is now blocked. Solid alternative is 15.e5, Nd5; 16.Be7, Re7; 17.Nd5, Qd5; 18.Rf4 with approximate equality."

The plan was to pile up even more pressure on the center with Rad8 before finally playing Ne6, but this is a huge waste of time. Correct move is simple 15...Ne6, which gives comfortable equality after 16.Rad1, Qd7; 17.e5, Nd5="
31,Nf4,e2f4,r3rnk1/1p1qbpp1/2p2n1p/p7/3PPNb1/2NB4/PPQ2BPP/R4RK1 b - - 4 16,"? White had 2 great choices here: 1) direct 16.e5, Nd5; 17.Nd5, Qd5; 18.Be3 with advantage (due to a wasted move by Black) or 2) simple and calm 16. Be3, also with slight edge. It is worth noting that 16.d5 is tempting but I correctly calculated that it doesn't give any advantage after 16...Ng6 (even 16...cd5!?; 17.Bb5, Qc7 is playable). This is probably the reason White played 16.Nf4. --- lighttotheright suggested 16.h3, which after correct 16...Be2; 17.Be2, Ne6 also results in a small advantage for White, but if Black makes a mistake with 16...Bh5?; 17.e5, Nd5? (17...Be2; 18.Be2, Nd5 and White has just a small edge); 18.Nxd5, cxd5; 19.Nf4, Bg6; 20.Nxg6, Nxg6; 21. Bf5!, Qb5; 22.e6! White has the pair of Bishops and initiative against the Black King - probably a best case scenario in this variation"
32,Nh5,f6h5,r3rnk1/1p1qbpp1/2p4p/p6n/3PPNb1/2NB4/PPQ2BPP/R4RK1 w - - 5 17,White now threatens 17.d5 so Black needs to exchange Nf4 immediately with one of his Knights. Since Nf8 is safe and has a good future on e6 while Nf6 is constantly threatened by e5 the choice is simple. It is important to note that White doesn't have a good alternative to 17.Nh5 so there is no risk in playing Knight to the edge of the board.
