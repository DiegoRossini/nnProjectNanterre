Still, it makes me nervous to have my king on a half-open file when a queen is on the other side of it."

21,Re1,f1e1,rn2k2r/pp1bq1pp/2pbpp2/8/3PB3/2P1BN2/PP3PPP/R2QR1K1 b kq - 4 11,"Developing my queen probably should have been a priority, but I blame Nimzovich (I've seen this spelled 4 different ways, and I'm not sure this is one of them) for stressing over and over how important it is to put rooks on open or half open files.  In this case, we have the added bonus that the rook is in front of black's queen."

Fritz says I should take with my d pawn and eventually move my knight and play Qh5 .  However, after 12. Bd3, I was hoping for 12.... exd4 13.Bxd4 and the queen would be directly pinned to the king.  One can hope, right?"
