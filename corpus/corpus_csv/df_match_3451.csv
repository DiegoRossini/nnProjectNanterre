1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

This is Round 4 against The Great One, GM Cyrano.  At the moment he is 4th seeded on Gameknot with his rating north of 2600!  Well, guys, I lose this one but at least I make Afro do a little work for it, albeit, I did tend to have a recurrence of passivitis which I cannot afford when playing the elite.  So, how did this game unravel.  Here is gameknot analysis as follows:- http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17807983&fb=1&rnd=0.181263129796375"
