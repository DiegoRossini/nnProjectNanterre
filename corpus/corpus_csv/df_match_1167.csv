White has grabbed a bit more space, which constricts the movement of the black pieces, but the centre pawns of white are also easily contested, which is what black will try to exploit in order to get to a middle game in which his e- and d-pawn will be free to march onward and create a lot of danger in the white position.

While black's position was not particularly easy to defend, there seems to be a solution to it. Since the lines are not forced, there are a lot of options, so I guess we might first consider the less reasonable ones before coming to the one that appears the strongest and was suggested by the GK computer. The knight on g6 can not move, because of Nf6 xf6, Qh7#For this reason neither Bxf4 nor Nxf4 is an option. Removing the pin on the knight by playing 17....Re8 seems to be too slow because of 18. f5 leading to for example A) 18....Nxf5 19. g4 Nh6 20. Rxf7 Nxf7 21. Qxg6 Bd6 22. Nxd6 Nxd6 23. Qh7 Kf7 24. Rf1 Nf5 25. xf5  Qg5 26. Kh1 with a very vulnerable king for black, B) 18....Nf4 19. Rxf4 Bxf4 20. Nf6 xf6 21. xe6 xe6 22. Qh7 Kf8 23. Bg6, or C) 18....xf5 19. Bc4 Be6 20. Bxe6 xe6 21. Ng5 Nf8 22. Qf7 Kh8 23. Rf3 Ng8 24. Qh5 Nh6 25. Nh7. While none of these lines are forced and I may have missed something, it seems like it is very hard to defend after 17....Re8. The correct defense is therefore to immediately move the knight on e7 to a better defensive position. From the GK computer: 17....Nd5 18. Ng5 Nf6 19. Qh3 Bd6 20. Bxg6 fxg6 21. Bxd6 Qxd6 and white basically simply stays a full piece behind. I may myself have opted for 17....Nd5 18. Bxf8, but at that point the attack will also mostly have died down and two pieces for a rook is generally not a very favourable trade."
