1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,A Walking The Walk game. Played versus bigpeta with some rules; 10 days per move and unrated game. Although it was at times a good thing to have so much time to think I must admit that it was really too much. I have to thank bigpeta for being so patient with me.

I saw to possibilities: exchange my bishop for his knight (I lose a bishop against a knight, something quite normal in this opening but only when you keep the initiative. In this case I had lost the initiative and could end up in an endgame with an open position with knight-bishop against two bishops) or protect my bishop either with Bb3 or Nc3, and here is where I had problems. Fortunately, bigpeta took this game as a masterclass and helped me to take a decision with some useful tips. Thanks bigpeta."

Keeps the bishop pinning the d7 pawn and develope a piece. The draback, in my oppinion is that disallow the c3 move, just in case the white bishop need the c2 square, and also could helped for a posible d4 in the future."

Two possible moves came to my mind: Be3 offering the bishop exchange and Bg5 to put pressure over the black king side. Black doesn't necessarily have to accept the exchange and, thinking that the black king will probably castle short, I thought Bg5 would work better."

I was preparing f4 and I didn't want my bishop pinned just in case exf4 happens and I decided to take with that bishop. My idea was to start an attack with the rooks opening the f column, bring the bishop on a4 back to the game moving it to b3 putting pressure over the a2-g8 diagonal (taking advantage of the problem in developing the black LSB)."
