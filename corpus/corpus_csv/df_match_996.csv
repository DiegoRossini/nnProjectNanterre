8,dxc4,d5c4,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/8/2pP1B2/5N2/PP2PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,I guess I wanted to leave an escape route for my DSB.

It's hard to look at mistakes like this next move and figure out what I was thinking when I did it. I blame a combination of moving too fast, playing at work, and playing too many games."
