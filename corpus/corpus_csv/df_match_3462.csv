1,b3,b2b3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The Larson opening, not extremely common but at the same time nothing too out there. My opponent is a club mate of mine so I know his style reasonably well, and sometimes he switches to this, one of his old favourites"
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"!? I quite like the idea behind this move, it seeks to prevent whites usual play which tends to involve e3, f4 ect and this leaves white with an interesting situation where the 'normal' sort of moves aren't going to past muster"
3,Bb2,c1b2,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/1P6/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"!? I quite like the idea behind this move, it seeks to prevent whites usual play which tends to involve e3, f4 ect and this leaves white with an interesting situation where the 'normal' sort of moves aren't going to past muster"
4,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/6b1/1P6/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,"!? I quite like the idea behind this move, it seeks to prevent whites usual play which tends to involve e3, f4 ect and this leaves white with an interesting situation where the 'normal' sort of moves aren't going to past muster"
5,f3,f2f3,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/6b1/1P3P2/PBPPP1PP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"!? And in fact this is likely the best response, f3 with the idea of following up with e4, actually my opponent told me an amusing anecdote about a postal game he played where without looking at the position properly he chucked out e3?? And promptly resigned when the post returned with his opponents move"
6,Bh5,g4h5,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p3b/8/1P3P2/PBPPP1PP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,Bf5!? Was another option but I didn't want to have to waste a move retreating my bishop after 4.e4 dxe4 5.Qe2 c6 6.fxe4 Bb6 where I think white is slightly better
7,e4,e2e4,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p3b/4P3/1P3P2/PBPP2PP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,Natural and obvious anything else would make f3 a meaningless move
8,dxe4,d5e4,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/7b/4p3/1P3P2/PBPP2PP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"Solid and best, Qb5+ was threatened which would have won the bishop and other replies like a6 allow white to freely capture on e4 with an extra threat on b7"
9,Qe2,d1e2,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/7b/4p3/1P3P2/PBPPQ1PP/RN2KBNR b KQkq - 1 5,"Solid and best, Qb5+ was threatened which would have won the bishop and other replies like a6 allow white to freely capture on e4 with an extra threat on b7"
10,c6,c7c6,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/7b/4p3/1P3P2/PBPPQ1PP/RN2KBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"Solid and best, Qb5+ was threatened which would have won the bishop and other replies like a6 allow white to freely capture on e4 with an extra threat on b7"
11,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/7b/4p3/1PN2P2/PBPPQ1PP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 1 6,Qxe4 is a little awkward for white since black responds with ...Bg6 and then the queen is forced to play to c4 where she is misplaced and the pawn on f3 is taking the most natural developing square away from the g1 knight. Instead the text is a developing move that threatens to win back the pawn
12,exf3,e4f3,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/7b/8/1PN2p2/PBPPQ1PP/R3KBNR w KQkq - 0 7,"6...Nf6 was also possible with a similar idea as before trying to show that the pawn on f3 and queen on c4 would be unfavourable for white but I don't think it's really that bad, especially with a pair of knights having been exchanged. So instead I decide to cash in my extra pawn, and I'm left with a caro kann like structure but white has a good lead in development. I can't remember what the name of this gambit is but it seems perfectly playable to me"
