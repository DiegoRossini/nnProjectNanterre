When there is not a certain perspective sometimes we prefer moves like 8.h6 to stay straight the path of the plan and wait for a psicological result. I don�t say that 8.hxg6 it�s not a good move, in fact it�s a good one, but as I said is a perspective view."

Changing plans in middle of the battle would be incongruent with the soul of chess, but with the human spirit. It seems like 9.d5 is a move with a few more chances, obviously you give the e5 point, but retain e6 and e7 and can try with f4, Nh3 and Qd3 to exploit the king side, and at last the f column is blocked before 0-0-0"
17,Nf3,g1f3,r1bq1rk1/pp1np1bp/3p1np1/2p5/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPP1/R1BQK2R b KQ - 1 9,"Oh my gosh.

I would like 10...Nc5 against e4 and try to make a free world to the beasts living in g7 and c8. At last the white can�t move the b pawn without hazardous results.

For Jesus! Did not see that after 11...Ne4 12.Ne4 Rf4 there is no a doubt about the more posible winner"

The best of the best of the best move is 17.c5! o even the magnificent 17.f4! and the Nomad Queen would go to 17...Qa4, and after 18.c5! there is no time to cry for black. 17.Nd5 is not bad, only close our beloved a2-g8 diagonal"
