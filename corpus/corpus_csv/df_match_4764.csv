1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

After a two week holiday in sunny Weymouth (including a day trip to Jersey) I have now returned back to Cambridge and Gameknotland.  Time to catch up on some annotating.  I have a series of victories to annotate and this is the first of them.  Gameknot analysis is provided here. http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=16113581&fb=1&rnd=0.44279073601021224.  The game starts as a Sicilian Defense and comes to a sudden, violent, end."

It still develops a piece and Fou Leblanc cannot immediately be assailed from the a2-f7 diagonal which bears down on the BK while he is uncastled."

Please note that if black now plays BxP then Rd1 pins the bishop against the Wicked Witch of the West on d8.  The bishop will then be removed by my e5 knight on the next turn and black will be a whole piece down.  My opponent spots this, however, and decided to harass Glenda with b6."
