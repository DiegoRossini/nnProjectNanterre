1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I'm annotating this because in a previous annotation of mine concerning the shortest game possible a comment said that this mating pattern could only happen to a beginner. That's not true. It can happen to the best of us when we least expect it.  My opponent has played over 1400 games here on GK.  He could hardly be classified as a beginner.  Besides, 1423 rating is still fairly respectable.

Most players would not think to be careful about allowing 'fools mate' when starting off with queen-side play. That's what makes this game somewhat unique and interesting. You must always think about what your opponent can do to you, not just what you can do to him."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Simple normal play.
3,c3,c2c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/2P5/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,...a bit unusual queen pawn game. But it is in the world database with player's ratings between 2350 and 2400.
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/2P5/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"Simple development.... If your not sure, play on principle and instinct. That's what I did here and it usually works well."
5,Nd2,b1d2,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/2P5/PP1NPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 3,"hmm! ...not too bad, but effectively contesting e4 is probably not possible. This also blocks in the c1 bishop."
6,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p1b2/3P4/2P5/PP1NPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 3 4,"Since e6 was planned, I needed to make sure the bishop didn't get blocked behind my pawn structure.  Weak bishops belong in front of pawns whenever possible."
7,f3,f2f3,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p1b2/3P4/2P2P2/PP1NP1PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,Perhaps he was going to contest e4 after all. I was not worried about it. The count was 3 to 2 in my favor.
8,e6,e7e6,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p1b2/3P4/2P2P2/PP1NP1PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"This opens up lines of development for my dark squared bishop. Of course, I planned to castle king-side. This is just normal but principled development by Black."
9,b4,b2b4,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p1b2/1P1P4/2P2P2/P2NP1PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"This was not the best of moves. It creates serious weaknesses in White's pawn structure and does not really do anything new...except perhaps allow the queen move Qa4+.  It's a little premature to attack queen-side with the pawns, especially since he played 2.c3 instead of c4."
10,Bd6,f8d6,rn1qk2r/ppp2ppp/3bpn2/3p1b2/1P1P4/2P2P2/P2NP1PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,"My only serious choices were Bd6, Be7, Nbd7, a5, or c6.  Be7 and c6 were too passive while Nc6 blocks the pawn action.  The move a5 was a little bit too aggressive to be made before castling. For me, Bd6 was an obvious choice given my plan to castle as soon as possible. I only needed about 2 seconds to make this decision. 

Again, I'm only playing by principles in this position."
11,Ba3,c1a3,rn1qk2r/ppp2ppp/3bpn2/3p1b2/1P1P4/B1P2P2/P2NP1PP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 2 6,"This move makes no sense to me. The advance of the b pawn would leave it in take. I expected 6.Qa4+ instead. There were lots of better moves than this one. In retrospect, Nb3 was probably one of the better ones."
12,O-O,e8g8,rn1q1rk1/ppp2ppp/3bpn2/3p1b2/1P1P4/B1P2P2/P2NP1PP/R2QKBNR w KQ - 3 7,Development is almost complete for Black.  White is terribly behind in that respect.
13,g4,g2g4,rn1q1rk1/ppp2ppp/3bpn2/3p1b2/1P1P2P1/B1P2P2/P2NP2P/R2QKBNR b KQ - 0 7,This was a severe mistake.  Again it weakens White's pawn structure. It also severely weakens the e1-h4 diagonal.  The 3.Nd2 is now made into a bad move too; it blocks in the King.  I had to think a little bit here...to make sure I was not missing anything.  This position looked too good to be true for Black.
14,Nxg4,f6g4,rn1q1rk1/ppp2ppp/3bp3/3p1b2/1P1P2n1/B1P2P2/P2NP2P/R2QKBNR w KQ - 0 8,I predicted 8.fxg4.  The sacrifice is too tempting for most.  Best was probably 8.e4 Qh4+ 9.Ke2 forced. dxe4 10.Nxe4 Bxe4 11.fxe4 Qf2+ 12.Kd3 Qe3+ 13.Kc2 Qxe4+ and White is in deep serious trouble.
15,fxg4,f3g4,rn1q1rk1/ppp2ppp/3bp3/3p1b2/1P1P2P1/B1P5/P2NP2P/R2QKBNR b KQ - 0 8,"Instead, he takes the piece as predicted."
16,Qh4#,d8h4,rn3rk1/ppp2ppp/3bp3/3p1b2/1P1P2Pq/B1P5/P2NP2P/R2QKBNR w KQ - 1 9,"The King is completely blocked in and can not move out of check. No piece can intercede. And no piece can capture the Queen.  

Yes, games really can end this quickly."
