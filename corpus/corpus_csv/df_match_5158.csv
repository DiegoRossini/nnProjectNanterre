1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"Hi everyone!

In a MT commemorating the victims of the Christchurch Earthquake I got to play my buddy, Steve who is an up and coming Class B 1600+ player.  He is a serious threat to me because I have lost to him in a Traxler MT and playing black in the Japanese Earthquake MT I ended up conceding a Low Draw to him.  So I got my revenge in kind with a humble pawn.  How did this happen?  Well, if you follow the annotation and the following gameknot analysis link you will see just how it happened.  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15655565&fb=1&rnd=0.37816544131776747.  Steve kicks off with 1. Nf3, the Reti Opening."
