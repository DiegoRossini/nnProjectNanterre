I want to show some of sample games on both sides of the Dragon that illustrate key ideas in the opening. This is instructive for me as well as anyone interested in the Dragon. I will restrict my notes to key concepts and ideas, with a tilt towards those I have not yet discussed. Hope you enjoy!"

It transpires that Black's central   b-file pressure is too great. White's immediate problem is the b2 pawn - how will he defend it after the obvious ..Rb8? If 0-0-0, Black will play ..Rb8, ..Be6, and ..Qa5(-b4) with intolerable pressure. White must counter with the immediate Bc4-b3 maneuver (covering b2), or with the Classical plan Be2 and Rb1 (planning 0-0). I encourage the reader to consider just how crucial it is to protect the b2 square (indeed the whole a3-b2-c3 dark-square complex) when facing the Dragon.
