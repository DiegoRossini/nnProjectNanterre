1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is my first annotated game, so I would welcome any feedback. I am a fan of the Torre attack* and in this game I hope to bring out some of its general principles as well as a few of my own touches. Although wikipedia suggests that the Torre is not particularly advantageous for White, Nigel Short** categorises it as a good opening, describing it as a very handy and easy-to-learn system and says that White can play the first three moves no matter what Blacks set-up.

* Late Edit: Because of the move order, strictly speaking, this is the Trompovsky attack (Ruth, Opovcensky opening) (A45) rather than the Torre.

** Nigel Short on Chess. Hamlyn 1989."
