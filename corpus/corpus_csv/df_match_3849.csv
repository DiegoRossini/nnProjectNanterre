5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 3,"As I have mentioned, it is very easy to transpose into the Four Knights."

8,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 6 5,Of course.

12,g6,g7g6,r1bqk2r/pppp1p1p/2n3p1/2b1N2n/2B1P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"That one option is obviously Castling. Despite the fact that it loses more material, it prevents the Kingside disaster that I do in this game."

15,Bg5+,c1g5,r1bq3r/ppppkB1p/2n3p1/2b1N1Bn/4P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 2 8,"This isn't very very bad for Black yet, but it is very bad for him."
16,Kd6,e7d6,r1bq3r/pppp1B1p/2nk2p1/2b1N1Bn/4P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 3 9,"THIS is the bad move although no matter what Black does, he loses. 8...Nf6 is met by 9.Qf3."
17,Bxd8,g5d8,r1bB3r/pppp1B1p/2nk2p1/2b1N2n/4P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 9,I am not missing out on taking the Queen.

21,Qf3,d1f3,r1bn3r/ppppkB1p/6p1/2b4n/2N1P3/2NP1Q2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQ - 3 11,"I cannot save the Bishop unless I retreat it, but in exchange, this move offers 12.g4."
22,Nxf7,d8f7,r1b4r/ppppkn1p/6p1/2b4n/2N1P3/2NP1Q2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 12,What other choice does Black have?
23,Nd5+,c3d5,r1b4r/ppppkn1p/6p1/2bN3n/2N1P3/3P1Q2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQ - 1 12,"12.g4 was better, but this move is still okay. 12.g4 Ng7 13.Nd5+ Kf8 14.Ne5 wins."
24,Kf8,e7f8,r1b2k1r/pppp1n1p/6p1/2bN3n/2N1P3/3P1Q2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 2 13,"Here, 13.Ne5 is a good idea."
