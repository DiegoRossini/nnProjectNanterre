1,b3,b2b3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Larsen's opening, also called Queen's fianchetto opening. The idea is to prepare for a fianchetto of the queen's bishop which will attack throught the long diagonal b2-f6, This was the first time I've encountered such a strange opening."
