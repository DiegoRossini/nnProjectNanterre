1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

After my missed opportunity against the 1950+ player, Paolo, I did manage to win this one, although this time it was against a fellow Class B player.  He played the Kiezeritzky Variation of the King's Gambit accepted and fell into an inferior line.  My pieces just overwhelmed him and that did result in me winning a rook.  My opponent made me prove the win right out till he copped Old Matey.  Here is an analysis of the game:- http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15157320&fb=1&rnd=0.2663012340368604"
