1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"After beeing absent for a couple of months, I decided to start playing at gameknot again. Since my opponent had a low rating, I opened with e4-e5, although the scandinavian (e4-d5) is my favourite opening. I played quickly in the beginning, and due to that had nothing from the opening.  The crucial point of the game was at move 22. when white should have taken on c6 with his queen. But... see for yourself what happened."
