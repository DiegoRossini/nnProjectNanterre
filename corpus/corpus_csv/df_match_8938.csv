5,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3P4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"The Exchange Variation of the French Defence. This leads to a symmetrical, drawish position, and White's only advantage is to have the first move. The Exchange French is often played by weaker players trying to get a draw against a stronger player, not the other way round!"

7,c3,c2c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"?! The Svenonius Variation. Not popular in GK's database, and statistics give Black an edge. This is a solid move, but removes the best developing square for White's queenside knight. If I were going to move that pawn, I would play 4.c4, forming a quasi-Queen's Gambit position, but obviously no longer a gambit as it is defended by the bishop. At any rate, I would probably favour a quiet, developing move such as 4.Nf3 or 4.Bd3."
8,Bd6,f8d6,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3b4/3p4/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,The most popular database option.
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3b4/3p4/3P4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,Following the database.

11,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/3b1n2/3p4/3P4/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 4 6,"Very interesting and unusual. White opts to move his king and lose castling rights, instead of more naturally blocking with Qe2 or Be3, both of which the DB suggests. I suppose that after 7.Qd2 Qxd2 8.Bxd2 White's light-squared bishop is not on such a good square, while White's dark-squared bishop is probably not very well placed on e3. At any rate, White's king is now blocking any development of White's dark-squared bishop, and preventing White's knight from developing onto any square other than a3, so I would definitely go for blocking the check in White's position."
12,Qe7+,d8e7,rnb1k2r/ppp1qppp/3b1n2/3p4/3P4/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 5 7,"Very interesting and unusual.

14,O-O,e8g8,rnb2rk1/ppp1qppp/3b1n2/3p4/3P4/2PB1N2/PP1K1PPP/RNBQ3R w - - 7 8,"Part of me - the adventurous, attacking part - wanted to play 7...Bf4 , forcing the White's king onto c2. But after 7.Kc2, (1) I have no more attack; (2) my dark-squared bishop is under attack by his dark-squared bishop and I have to either waste a move fleeing or exchange a developed for an undeveloped bishop; (3) his king is blocking his own development on d2 so I have no reason to want to force it off. Three good reasons for not playing that move. I decided against it, and went for the more flexible and calm 7...O-O."
