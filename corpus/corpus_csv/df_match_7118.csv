23,Re1,f1e1,r3kb1r/2qn1ppp/p1p1p3/2ppP3/8/3PQN2/PPP2PPP/R1B1R1K1 b kq - 2 12,That won't do it. The only way to support the e5 pawn is from f4.

He has to defend it with two figures - one is the queen but the other is either the knight or the rook. The black control of the center and the white pawns position does not allow the knight to get to any better square and the rook can not come to the third row in order to assist the white's attack and with the neutralization of the g4 possibility the white's King side attack came to a stop.
