I actually think playing c5 on this turn is better than the next turn, since I haven't  castled yet and there is no knight obstructing Black's queen."

Black can now exchange on c3, reinforcing my centre, or take my pawn on d4, agreeing to a pawn structure with my pawns on c3 and b4. Retreating to a5 is also a good option, not yet agreeing on anything and leaving me to figure out how to hold the centre."
16,cxd4,c5d4,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/8/1bBp4/P1N1PN2/1P3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 9,"I thought long about this move. As I said before, I believe this position is more common with the moves 0-0 and Nd7 included. Now, if I play 10. bxc3, he'll probably play 10 ... Qxd1 and I lose castling rights as well as hopes of an attack. Loss of castling rights might not be that bad with the queens off, but I rather have my king out of the centre. (Although, in the game, my king never leaves e1!) I could initiate an exchange of queens myself, but I didn't feel comfortable that way. So, I decided on this move, sacrificing a pawn but letting my dark-squared bishop into play via b2. Note that both my bishops and queen are aiming at the Black's king castled position."

Black is probably trying to achieve counterplay along the c-file, but that takes to much time. Black is acting like his king is perfectly safe. Or he thought that after 14. Bxf6 Qxf6 25. Bxh7+ loses, because my rook on a1 is attacked and that I therefore do not have the time to retreat my bishop, leaving it vulnerable to entrapment."
