1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was another interesting game that I lost... well, a potentially interesting game, which pretty much becomes one-sided after move 11, where I make two horrible mistakes!"
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,a King's pawn game...
3,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Which turns into a King's Gambit. I had played the Queen's Gambit a lot in my mini-tournament, so I was hoping for Black to accept the gambit."
4,Bc5,f8c5,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"Black declines, and decides to move his bishop instead. This is something new for me here,"
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/4PP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 3,"I go ahead with development... there was another reason why I played this move as well - it was White's opening moves to the Annotation Project games. That opening was just incredible the first time I saw it. I left a comment on the 'Speculate to accumulate' annotation about this, and got a message from Freddy with all the Annotation Project annotations, so I've had a lot of information about that opening (ionadowman also commented a reply on the annotation, but that came after... anyway, thanks to both! :) ) but I didn't have high hopes for trying that, as Black's moves were already different"
6,d6,d7d6,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3p4/2b1p3/4PP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"opens up the c8-h3 diagonal for Black's bishop, perhaps going for Bf4"
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3p4/2b1p3/4PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,maybe better would have been 4.h3?
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/2b1p3/4PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,"so that I could castle, if need be, though the kingside isn't as strong as it could be (Bb5+ may have been better to gain tempo, or maybe forgetting the bishop altogether and weakening Black's center control with fxe5)"
9,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/2b1p3/2B1PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 5,"so that I could castle, if need be, though the kingside isn't as strong as it could be (Bb5+ may have been better to gain tempo, or maybe forgetting the bishop altogether and weakening Black's center control with fxe5)"
10,a6,a7a6,rnbqk2r/1pp2ppp/p2p1n2/2b1p3/2B1PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,to stop the knight and bishop occupying the b5 square
11,Ng5,f3g5,rnbqk2r/1pp2ppp/p2p1n2/2b1p1N1/2B1PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,increasing the pressure on that f7 pawn...
12,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qk2r/1pp2ppp/p2p1n2/2b1p1N1/2B1PPb1/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 7,you can probably guess what I'm about to do here...
13,Qxg4,d1g4,rn1qk2r/1pp2ppp/p2p1n2/2b1p1N1/2B1PPQ1/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 0 7,"but I'm going to admit, I probably dove headfirst into this move - I also realise that I probably shouldn't have attempted this given my rating. The positions are completely different from those in the Annotation Project, and the obvious drawback to this is that 8. Bxf7+ will no longer work (Ke7). This doesn't make this move a complete blunder though... (though it's not as effective)"
14,Nxg4,f6g4,rn1qk2r/1pp2ppp/p2p4/2b1p1N1/2B1PPn1/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 0 8,"forking pieces and reaching material equality, but again there's supposed to be something wrong with playing this move... well, either that or Bf7+ was better...."
15,Nxf7,g5f7,rn1qk2r/1pp2Npp/p2p4/2b1p3/2B1PPn1/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 0 8,"forking pieces and reaching material equality, but again there's supposed to be something wrong with playing this move... well, either that or Bf7+ was better...."
16,Qe7,d8e7,rn2k2r/1pp1qNpp/p2p4/2b1p3/2B1PPn1/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 1 9,"a Queen for a rook, a bishop and pawn - that's material equality, but Black probably has an advantage here (which is why I wonder whether I should have tried this at all) The knight at h8 is also in a very dangerous spot right now"
17,Nxh8,f7h8,rn2k2N/1pp1q1pp/p2p4/2b1p3/2B1PPn1/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R b KQq - 0 9,"a Queen for a rook, a bishop and pawn - that's material equality, but Black probably has an advantage here (which is why I wonder whether I should have tried this at all) The knight at h8 is also in a very dangerous spot right now"
18,Bf2+,c5f2,rn2k2N/1pp1q1pp/p2p4/4p3/2B1PPn1/2N5/PPPP1bPP/R1B1K2R w KQq - 1 10,"this is what I mean i Black has a pretty strong attack going on here, and has just ruined my chances for castling"
19,Ke2,e1e2,rn2k2N/1pp1q1pp/p2p4/4p3/2B1PPn1/2N5/PPPPKbPP/R1B4R b q - 2 10,? my first mistake - that definitely is not the best place for the king (I think I was thinking of Rf1 to chase the bishop away)
20,exf4,e5f4,rn2k2N/1pp1q1pp/p2p4/8/2B1Ppn1/2N5/PPPPKbPP/R1B4R w q - 0 11,"and now the pawn is pinned to my king. Something to watch out for, but not urgent as of yet. As long as my knight stays to protect that pawn...."
21,Nd5,c3d5,rn2k2N/1pp1q1pp/p2p4/3N4/2B1Ppn1/8/PPPPKbPP/R1B4R b q - 1 11,"?? All I saw when I played this was a threat of the king/rook fork, an attack on the queen and an attack on the pawn at the same time. If it weren't for my king, this move would have been good (it nets White at least the f4 pawn)"
22,Qxe4+,e7e4,rn2k2N/1pp3pp/p2p4/3N4/2B1qpn1/8/PPPPKbPP/R1B4R w q - 0 12,(!)
23,Kd1,e2d1,rn2k2N/1pp3pp/p2p4/3N4/2B1qpn1/8/PPPP1bPP/R1BK3R b q - 1 12,"now, If I'd played the king here to begin with..."
