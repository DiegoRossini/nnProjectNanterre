1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Here's a mini in from the fast ladder just finished this morning.  There is quite a disparity in ratings, and White deviates pretty early, but starts off with a line that Kasparov has used against the Accelerated Dragon."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Having played 1...e5 for about 10 years and 1...e6 for 3 years, I have become a lifelong devotee of the Sicilian."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Most lower rated players will try and keep the position closed, kudos to my opponent for the fighting spirit."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"Most lower rated players will try and keep the position closed, kudos to my opponent for the fighting spirit."

7,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,My beloved accelerated dragon.
8,g6,g7g6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,My beloved accelerated dragon.
9,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"This is the move which I love to see as it most often is followed by the Yugoslav attack setup.  Again, Kudos to my opponent for this."
10,Bg7,f8g7,r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,"The moment of truth!  White typically plays 6. Be3 Nf6; 7. Bc4, with the standard Yugo setup.  This move gives Black extra control over d5, but Kasparov has used it on occasion."
11,Nxc6,d4c6,r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2N3p1/8/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"The moment of truth!  White typically plays 6. Be3 Nf6; 7. Bc4, with the standard Yugo setup.  This move gives Black extra control over d5, but Kasparov has used it on occasion."
12,bxc6,b7c6,r1bqk1nr/p2pppbp/2p3p1/8/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"6...dc, allowing the queen trade is playable, but I prefer to open the b-file to utilize by dark-squared bishop to the max."
13,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqk1nr/p2pppbp/2p3p1/8/2B1P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,"White is still playing quite aggressively, luckily, I am still in my preparation."
14,Qc7,d8c7,r1b1k1nr/p1qpppbp/2p3p1/8/2B1P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 8,7...Bxc3+ is also possible and good!
15,Be3,c1e3,r1b1k1nr/p1qpppbp/2p3p1/8/2B1P3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 3 8,White never does get castled in this game and so I like 8. 0-0 here.  This removes any potential rook sac ideas on b2 should white play Rb1 to defend his queenside.
16,Rb8,a8b8,1rb1k1nr/p1qpppbp/2p3p1/8/2B1P3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQk - 4 9,Now Rb1 is silly.
17,Qf3,d1f3,1rb1k1nr/p1qpppbp/2p3p1/8/2B1P3/2N1BQ2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQk - 5 9,"I expected 9. Bd4, as most players are keen to swap the black fianchetto bishop.  As most one move threats, it is easily dealt with as I kick off my queenside advantage."
18,d5,d7d5,1rb1k1nr/p1q1ppbp/2p3p1/3p4/2B1P3/2N1BQ2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQk - 0 10,"Anticipating 10. Bb3 Rxb3; 11. axb3 d4, with a slight advantage to black.  Instead White cedes the initiative to me and unnecessarily, a piece."
19,exd5,e4d5,1rb1k1nr/p1q1ppbp/2p3p1/3P4/2B5/2N1BQ2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQk - 0 10,The open b-file and uncastled king are not good positional factors for white.
20,Rxb2,b8b2,2b1k1nr/p1q1ppbp/2p3p1/3P4/2B5/2N1BQ2/PrP2PPP/R3K2R w KQk - 0 11,Hanging the knight and creating a whole series of problems for white.
21,dxc6,d5c6,2b1k1nr/p1q1ppbp/2P3p1/8/2B5/2N1BQ2/PrP2PPP/R3K2R b KQk - 0 11,"I saw a way to limit Blacks advantage with 11. 0-0 as 11...Bxc3 is a blunder after 12. d6, handing the initiative to white.  So after 11. 0-0 Rb4; 12. d6 ed, the f7-pawn is protected twice, but it looks like White's best chance."
22,Bxc3+,g7c3,2b1k1nr/p1q1pp1p/2P3p1/8/2B5/2b1BQ2/PrP2PPP/R3K2R w KQk - 0 12,Now there is no hope for the White monarch.
23,Kf1,e1f1,2b1k1nr/p1q1pp1p/2P3p1/8/2B5/2b1BQ2/PrP2PPP/R4K1R b k - 1 12,All other moves keep the White king close to the center.
24,Nf6,g8f6,2b1k2r/p1q1pp1p/2P2np1/8/2B5/2b1BQ2/PrP2PPP/R4K1R w k - 2 13,Blocking the White attack on f7 and developing.
25,Bg5,e3g5,2b1k2r/p1q1pp1p/2P2np1/6B1/2B5/2b2Q2/PrP2PPP/R4K1R b k - 3 13,Uncovering an attack on the c3-bishop.
