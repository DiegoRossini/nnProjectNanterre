1,b3,b2b3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Nimzovich-Larsen attack (A01). 

Jim West once wrote about 1.b3 and the idea of using systems playable for Black that, with colors reversed and extra tempo, become favorable to White. This is the first such game in which I explored this theme since reading about it on Mr. West's blog sometime last year.

The e-pawn would be pinned should Black play Kh8 or Kg8 and with my Queen sitting on the c1-h6 diagonal I would be able to take Black's Knight because of the pin and threaten Black's Rook should g4 be pushed. I felt at the time that this threat would be sufficient to deter Black from following his plan.
