1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Quite dubious. Ali chose to be more ambitious in place of the normal continuation 5.Nf3. Equal would have been 5...Bd7 6.Be3 Qb6 7.Qd2 cxd4 8.cxd4 Bb4 9.Nc3.

8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2ppP3/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,Quite dubious. Ali chose to be more ambitious in place of the normal continuation 5.Nf3. Equal would have been 5...Bd7 6.Be3 Qb6 7.Qd2 cxd4 8.cxd4 Bb4 9.Nc3.
9,f4,f2f4,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2ppP3/3P1P2/2P5/PP4PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,Quite dubious. Ali chose to be more ambitious in place of the normal continuation 5.Nf3. Equal would have been 5...Bd7 6.Be3 Qb6 7.Qd2 cxd4 8.cxd4 Bb4 9.Nc3.
10,Qb6,d8b6,r1b1kbnr/pp3ppp/1qn1p3/2ppP3/3P1P2/2P5/PP4PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,"I quickly equalise now; pressure on the d4, and the bishop on c1 should not have much to say."
11,Nf3,g1f3,r1b1kbnr/pp3ppp/1qn1p3/2ppP3/3P1P2/2P2N2/PP4PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 6,Quite strange. The move appeared sensible though.

15,Nc3,b1c3,r1b1kb1r/pp3ppp/1qn1p2n/3pP3/3P1P2/2N2N2/PP4PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 8,Otherwise Black picks the infant on e5.

It was surprising that my opponent was helping to bring it out in the open.
21,O-O,e1g1,r3kb1r/pp3ppp/1qb1p3/3pPn2/3P1P2/2N2N2/PP4PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 11,11.g4 Nh6 12.h3 Rd8 13.Qb3 Qxb3 14.axb3 Nc8 would not improve Ali's game.

Meanwhile, 13.Re1 Bd7 (also 13...O-O 14.a3 Qa3 15.Qb3 Be7) 14.Qd3 O-O 15.a3 Wa5 16.Bd2 was not likely to dampen my spirits. It appeared that we were in for along game."
25,Rf2,f1f2,2r1k2r/pp3ppp/1qb1p3/3pPn2/1b1P1P2/2N2N2/PP3RPP/R1BQ3K b k - 5 13,"(!) Aimed against 13...Bxc3 and the death of the infant on c3. Meanwhile, 13.Re1 Bd7 (also 13...O-O 14.a3 Qa3 15.Qb3 Be7) 14.Qd3 O-O 15.a3 Wa5 16.Bd2 was not likely to dampen my spirits. It appeared that we were in for along game."
26,h5,h7h5,2r1k2r/pp3pp1/1qb1p3/3pPn1p/1b1P1P2/2N2N2/PP3RPP/R1BQ3K w k - 0 14,"There was no need to castle now as my mornarch was safe, thanks to Ali for having no likely attack and for freeing my queen's bishop."
27,a3,a2a3,2r1k2r/pp3pp1/1qb1p3/3pPn1p/1b1P1P2/P1N2N2/1P3RPP/R1BQ3K b k - 0 14,"I was smiling. The scope of Ali's queen's bishop is further limited. However, both 14.Rc2 O-O 15.a3 Be7 (or 15...Wa5 16.Rd2 Be7=) 16.b4 f6 17.exf6 gxf6 and 14.Qd3 f6 15.Rc2 fxe5 16.fxe5 Rf8 17.Bg5 f6 appears to be equal. My idea was to limit Ali's options as I sat there waiting for a revealation! Not that I had no sneaky ideas though."
28,Bxc3,b4c3,2r1k2r/pp3pp1/1qb1p3/3pPn1p/3P1P2/P1b2N2/1P3RPP/R1BQ3K w k - 0 15,The game was equal now.

31,Rb2,f2b2,2r1k2r/pp3pp1/1qb1p3/3pPn2/3P1P1p/P1P2N2/1R4PP/R1BQ3K b k - 1 16,16.Qc2 Wa5 17.c4 h3 was slightly better.
32,Qa6,b6a6,2r1k2r/pp3pp1/q1b1p3/3pPn2/3P1P1p/P1P2N2/1R4PP/R1BQ3K w k - 2 17,Interesting times indeed.
33,Bd2,c1d2,2r1k2r/pp3pp1/q1b1p3/3pPn2/3P1P1p/P1P2N2/1R1B2PP/R2Q3K b k - 3 17,The following variations also maintain equality: 17.Qe1 Qd3 18.Ng5 O-O 19.Rab1 Rfd8 20.Nf3; 17.Rab1 Ba4 18.Qe1 Bc6 19.Ng5 Rg8 20.Rb3 Qd3; and 17.Rb4 Bb5 18.Qb3 Bc6 19.Bb2 Ne3 20.Re1 Qd3. At this point it is worth noting that Ali was under considerable pressure to keep the balance.
34,Qd3,a6d3,2r1k2r/pp3pp1/2b1p3/3pPn2/3P1P1p/P1Pq1N2/1R1B2PP/R2Q3K w k - 4 18,17...O-O and 17...Rc7 appear equal.

Lines starting with 18.Qb1, 18.Ng5, 18.Rc1 and 18.Rb4 would also lead to equality. Chess continues to be an obscure game though."
