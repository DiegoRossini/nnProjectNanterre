1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I kind of lost my way confronted to a modern defence to the King pawn opening
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Intriguing move from Black. Preparing for d7-d5? Is a better response a pawn centre or e4-e5? Or even better would be Nf3 to prepare for a pawn centre?
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,I choose the pawn centre. Probably not the best move in hindsight. Nf3 better?
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Black responds by attacking my e pawn. White must decide whether to capture, defend or ignore. Even at this stage, I start not liking how the game is developing. Look at my pieces all still hemmed in the starting squares..."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,I decide to defend. The main motivation being development. I normally do not like castling queen side due to the large field that is difficult to defend that emerges on the bottom left of the board. But I had to begin factoring a queen side castle in my strategy
6,dxe4,d5e4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/3Pp3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Black is really not making it easy. I have to move my knight twice now during the opening.
7,Nxe4,c3e4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/3PN3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,re-capture. Was a better move 4.Be3 in order to keep developing and winning the pawn back later?
8,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/5b2/3PN3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,Black attacks again my knight. He is having a very strong opening as he is developing by attacking my piece which had to move again (3rd time in first 5 move). Should I have played 5.Qf3 and put the question back to Black? Or 5.Bd3 to keep developing and defending at the same time? I did not choose 5.Qf3 because I did not want to get my queen out too early and 5.Bd3 as I did not want to have to destroy my pawn structure later if I had to castle queen side.
9,Ng3,e4g3,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/5b2/3P4/6N1/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 5,I therefore flee and attack the bishop at the same time
10,Bg6,f5g6,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p3b1/8/3P4/6N1/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 3 6,"Mission half accomplished, Black had to retreat but still maintains pressure on my position (c2 pawn). But at least I had a chance to get the initiative back"
11,Be3,c1e3,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p3b1/8/3P4/4B1N1/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 4 6,"Start developing queen side to 1) fight for the centre and 2) prepare my for a queen side castle. Was that the right strategy? In hindsight, I took me the same moves to castle king side, which is more comfortable in the middle game. Any thoughts?"
12,e6,e7e6,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p1b1/8/3P4/4B1N1/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,"Black liberates his f bishop. By now, it is clear to me that Black will not fight for the centre pawn for pawn. What should my strategy have been at that case?"
13,Nf3,g1f3,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p1b1/8/3P4/4BNN1/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 7,May be I still had time to castle king side?
14,Nf6,g8f6,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pnb1/8/3P4/4BNN1/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 8,Black also developing. He controlled now the e4 square (attacking it twice).
15,h4,h2h4,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pnb1/8/3P3P/4BNN1/PPP2PP1/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,I decide to go for the bishop. I did not want the game to get too comfortable for my opponent. Black had either to play 8..h6 or accept doubled up pawns. The game was starting to go better for me
16,h6,h7h6,rn1qkb1r/pp3pp1/2p1pnbp/8/3P3P/4BNN1/PPP2PP1/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 9,The best move for Black. Was there a better move for him?
17,Bd3,f1d3,rn1qkb1r/pp3pp1/2p1pnbp/8/3P3P/3BBNN1/PPP2PP1/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 9,Still threatening the doubled up pawns
18,Bxd3,g6d3,rn1qkb1r/pp3pp1/2p1pn1p/8/3P3P/3bBNN1/PPP2PP1/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 10,Which Black declines but initiating the exchange
19,Qxd3,d1d3,rn1qkb1r/pp3pp1/2p1pn1p/8/3P3P/3QBNN1/PPP2PP1/R3K2R b KQkq - 0 10,"I re-capture. Even though I did not like having 4 of my pieces on the same rank, it was just temporary and I did not see any medium term threat that Black could initiate. Was I wrong?"
20,Nbd7,b8d7,r2qkb1r/pp1n1pp1/2p1pn1p/8/3P3P/3QBNN1/PPP2PP1/R3K2R w KQkq - 1 11,"I am not sure what was going on in Black's head, but I would have been happy if I was him"
