1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,".I played C20 Portuguese opening, as a surprise weapon, it allows black to easily equalize the game, but he has to know how to do it, also allows some dangerous tactics to the unaware... black mishandled it, and overextended his queen side pawns, postpone the castle and underdeveloped his pieces... all this means certain loss, in a short game."
