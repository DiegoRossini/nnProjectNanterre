1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

And now is the second of the two successful mating attacks.  Funnily enough, Joe did not make any obvious errors in this game such as leaving pieces en prise.  He, did, however, leave himself on for a decisive bishop for pawn sac from Fou Lenoir which created a denouement and a denuding!  This led to resignation on the grounds of unavoidable mate. So, how did this happen?  Well, let's start with a Sicilian Naijdorf/Byrne Attack!"
