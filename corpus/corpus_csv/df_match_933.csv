1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I am currently a fan of the Dutch Stonewall against 1. d4, but I've found many anti-Dutch variations annoying, for example the Staunton gambit, so now I transpose via QGD - Semi Slav - Stonewall."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I am currently a fan of the Dutch Stonewall against 1. d4, but I've found many anti-Dutch variations annoying, for example the Staunton gambit, so now I transpose via QGD - Semi Slav - Stonewall."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Should White have proceeded with 3. cxd5!? Black can simply recapture with a nice Rubenstein pawn structure.
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Should White have proceeded with 3. cxd5!? Black can simply recapture with a nice Rubenstein pawn structure.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,Should White have proceeded with 3. cxd5!? Black can simply recapture with a nice Rubenstein pawn structure.
6,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"This was White's only chance to keep Black out of the Dutch (should they know I want to play it or just should they play the variation themselves). 4. e4 keeps the game a Semi-Slav, but is perfectly fine for Black after 4...dxc4."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3p4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"This was White's only chance to keep Black out of the Dutch (should they know I want to play it or just should they play the variation themselves). 4. e4 keeps the game a Semi-Slav, but is perfectly fine for Black after 4...dxc4."
8,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/pp4pp/2p1p3/3p1p2/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,And finally my Stonewall is constructed. Now against cxd5 I respond with cxd5 (or exd5!? if I'm looking for a risky game for a fast win). White's next moves demonstrate a complete lack of understanding of the Stonewall position.
9,Qc2,d1c2,rnbqkbnr/pp4pp/2p1p3/3p1p2/2PP4/2N2N2/PPQ1PPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"Perhaps 5. Bg5, 5. Bf4, or 5. g3 are superior. It is unclear where the queen belongs at the moment and White is still two steps away from castling."
10,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp4pp/2p1pn2/3p1p2/2PP4/2N2N2/PPQ1PPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 2 6,"A slight bit dubious. Hemming in the DSB is only thematic when the queenside knight is still on b1 and the queen is on d1, that way Ba3 can be organized with b3 and if Qe7 then Bb2 and Qc1. Here it just seems like White's DSB is simply inferior."
11,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/pp4pp/2p1pn2/3p1p2/2PP4/2N1PN2/PPQ2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"A slight bit dubious.

12,Bd6,f8d6,rnbqk2r/pp4pp/2pbpn2/3p1p2/2PP4/2N1PN2/PPQ2PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 1 7,And I have finished my obvious developing moves. Next I must decide whether I want to continue to develop towards the center or towards one of the sides of the board.
13,b3,b2b3,rnbqk2r/pp4pp/2pbpn2/3p1p2/2PP4/1PN1PN2/P1Q2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 7,And I have finished my obvious developing moves. Next I must decide whether I want to continue to develop towards the center or towards one of the sides of the board.
14,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp4pp/2pbpn2/3p1p2/2PP4/1PN1PN2/P1Q2PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ - 1 8,And I have finished my obvious developing moves. Next I must decide whether I want to continue to develop towards the center or towards one of the sides of the board.
15,Bb2,c1b2,rnbq1rk1/pp4pp/2pbpn2/3p1p2/2PP4/1PN1PN2/PBQ2PPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 2 8,"The only decent square for the DSB, but once again White should consider trying to castle with 8. Bd3 or 8. Be2. Castling queenside is risky since all 3 B to D pawns have moved and Black can exploit the king rather quickly."
16,a6,a7a6,rnbq1rk1/1p4pp/p1pbpn2/3p1p2/2PP4/1PN1PN2/PBQ2PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 0 9,"Playing for 9...b5, a thematic attack to open the c-file, which is better since it is where the queen currently lies (as well as a pin-able knight). Also discourages cxd5 as Nb5 is no longer an option afterwards."
17,a4,a2a4,rnbq1rk1/1p4pp/p1pbpn2/3p1p2/P1PP4/1PN1PN2/1BQ2PPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 0 9,"Stopping b5 but I think White is overstretching. The b4 hole is hard to deal with, and the multitude of pawn breaks makes castling queenside impossible (or at least poorly advised)."
18,Qe7,d8e7,rnb2rk1/1p2q1pp/p1pbpn2/3p1p2/P1PP4/1PN1PN2/1BQ2PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 1 10,"Developing the queen to a natural location as well as preventing 10. Ba3. Although the 2-Tempo bishop would be technically a good trade for the 1-Tempo bishop, I want to keep my DSB with my pawn structure as it is, especially since his structure is weak on the queenside dark squares. Stockfish recommends 9...a5, but as it doesn't threaten anything immediately and makes a future b5 push harder, I opted against it. I already have plenty of control of b4, and want to respond to cxd5 with cxd5."
19,Ne5,f3e5,rnb2rk1/1p2q1pp/p1pbpn2/3pNp2/P1PP4/1PN1P3/1BQ2PPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 2 10,"First technical mistake of the game. White loses his opening advantage with this dubious move. The knight move is a prime example of over-stretching: White should be focused on castling and finishing his development. This move makes the knight a weakness, and even if he should retreat the knight later I will have gained a few tempos on his knight moves and have a better grip on future e5 maneuvers."
20,Nbd7,b8d7,r1b2rk1/1p1nq1pp/p1pbpn2/3pNp2/P1PP4/1PN1P3/1BQ2PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 3 11,The obvious reply. Putting scrutiny on the knight on e5 while developing to a completely natural square.
21,Ne2,c3e2,r1b2rk1/1p1nq1pp/p1pbpn2/3pNp2/P1PP4/1P2P3/1BQ1NPPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 4 11,"Horribly dubious. White neglects all opening principles with this (and the last) move: don't move a piece twice in the opening, don't retreat unless there is a clear advantage, etc. White once again has left his king 2 moves from castling to safety, and this time it's too late."
22,Bb4+,d6b4,r1b2rk1/1p1nq1pp/p1p1pn2/3pNp2/PbPP4/1P2P3/1BQ1NPPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 5 12,"When your opponent plays odd moves or passively, you must find a swift tactical blow. In this case, Black's development is complete aside from the LSB and the a8 rook, so it is here where you must calculate how to punish White's play. This is the critical position where you must spend time to calculate: I spent about 10-15 minutes ensuring that I had found the best move. In this case, the weakness on b4, specifically the a5-e1 diagonal comes back to haunt White. Now he must tread carefully in order to not be crushed quickly. Stockfish eval (-1.1) Depth 23"
23,Bc3,b2c3,r1b2rk1/1p1nq1pp/p1p1pn2/3pNp2/PbPP4/1PB1P3/2Q1NPPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 6 12,"White should have considered 12. Nc3, allowing the pawn to drop on e5 with hopes that the DSB will become active on the diagonal after Bd3 and 0-0. 12. Bc3 is equally bad, but leaves Black with some nice positional trump cards even with correct play."
24,Nxe5,d7e5,r1b2rk1/1p2q1pp/p1p1pn2/3pnp2/PbPP4/1PB1P3/2Q1NPPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 0 13,"Here White needed to avoid creating more weaknesses, and although this move does so it is still difficult to recommend anything better. If White does not force the knight to move it is unclear how he will finish his development, let alone save the e5 pawn."
25,dxe5,d4e5,r1b2rk1/1p2q1pp/p1p1pn2/3pPp2/PbP5/1PB1P3/2Q1NPPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 0 13,"Here White needed to avoid creating more weaknesses, and although this move does so it is still difficult to recommend anything better.

29,Nxc3,e2c3,r1b2rk1/1p2q1pp/p1p1p3/3pPp2/PbP5/1PN1PP2/2Q3PP/R3KB1R b KQ - 0 15,"The punishing move. Here I target all 3 of White's weaknesses: the e5 pawn, the e3 pawn (thanks to 14. f3), and the c3 knight (indirectly). As they say, loose pieces drop off, and one of those will drop off on the next move."
30,Qc5,e7c5,r1b2rk1/1p4pp/p1p1p3/2qpPp2/PbP5/1PN1PP2/2Q3PP/R3KB1R w KQ - 1 16,"The punishing move.
