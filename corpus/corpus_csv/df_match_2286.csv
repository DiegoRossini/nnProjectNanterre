1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Back again!  This time I am gonna write about Welcome MT Part 9, in which in nearly every game, bar my two with Freddy, Glenda has had something to say.  I mean, she even made Itchy scratch his head (if any of you have read that annotation by Coach Ion while I was away on my vacation).  Anyhow, in this game, Porcho gave me a bit of a headache and for a little while, I was even fearing for Henry's safety as he was stuck in the centre.  Meanwhile, I was also being tied down by his g pawn which was only one square away from queening.  Yup, Porcho certainly showed me why his rating had soared into the 1300s before falling away again - shades of The Dentist methinks!  Things were going swimmingly for Porcho until, after giving him a bone in the throat, he was hit by a thunderbolt from Fou Lenoir.  He also found himself having to reckon with Glenda.  So, how did all this happen?  Well, read on......."
