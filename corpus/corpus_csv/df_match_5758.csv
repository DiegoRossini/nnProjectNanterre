1.  Is Whites king safe ... Is blacks king safe?
2.  Is material even?
3.  Are there any checks
4.  Are there any unprotected pieces
5.  Is my opponnt threatening something?
6.  Can I threaten something...threat counter threat, threat greater threat!

These 6 question all we do is identify these conditions!

White king safe No  Black king Yes
Material ... No whites ahead 1 point
No Checks
White threatens BxBc6... with threatens b4xc5 white threatens to 0-0!
Black threats QxNg5... Bc5xBe4 c5xb4 ...

OK lets use the last 6 questions, these are Evaluators so with these we answer to what extent w can do these things!

7.  Can I increase activity of my pieces?
8.  Can I restrict the activity of my opponents pieces?
9.  If I capture material is it consistent with my plan?
10. If my opponent captures material is it consistent with their plan?
11. What is my opponents strategic plan short & long term?
12. What is my strateic plan short & long term?

Well ... black has done a great job so far, lets see what the last 6 question tell us to do!

7. Can I increase the activity of my pieces ... Yes ...Qxg5! my Qg5 will have more work ethic
8. Can I restrict the activity of my opponents pieces ... 
look at Qa7 she cannot get back to help her king!
9.  If I capture material is it consistent with my plan?    Yes 
10. If my opponent capture material is it consistent with their plan?  No
11. What is my opponents strategic plan short & long term?  
Get his king safe & free his queen from limbo!!
12. What is my strategic plan short & long term? To prevent my opponent from doing their plan by... getting in their house & messing with thier stuff!!

So...lets see how this works out!  14. ...Qxg5!  15. Bxc6 forced ...otherwise material advantage to black. 1
10. If my opponent capture material is it con sistent with their plan"
