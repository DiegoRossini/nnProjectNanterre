1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"English Opening.  I would be delighted to receive any comments or feedback on this game.
I use the English a lot because sub-1700 players aren't very familiar with it."
2,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"This is an unusual counter.  The Game DB calls this the Anglo-Dutch defense.  Interestingly, this was the move with the highest average rating."
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,I prefer 2.g3 in many ways but it can leave you just too weak in the centre against a determined counter-attack.
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppppp1pp/5n2/5p2/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,"Mirror, mirror on the wall..."
5,g3,g2g3,rnbqkb1r/ppppp1pp/5n2/5p2/2P5/2N3P1/PP1PPP1P/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,Following the classical line
6,e5,e7e5,rnbqkb1r/pppp2pp/5n2/4pp2/2P5/2N3P1/PP1PPP1P/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Black says ""OK, if you don't want the centre then I'll have it!"""
7,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqkb1r/pppp2pp/5n2/4pp2/2P5/2N3P1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 4,Fiancetto
8,c6,c7c6,rnbqkb1r/pp1p2pp/2p2n2/4pp2/2P5/2N3P1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,"Doubtless with a view to d5.  The Game DB suggests that this move is a mistake, with White winning 66% of 56 games.  Presumably Black needs c6 for his knight."
9,d3,d2d3,rnbqkb1r/pp1p2pp/2p2n2/4pp2/2P5/2NP2P1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,The DB is virtually screaming at me to play 5.d4.  Just so show my independence of spirit I stick with the classical formation - which happens to be the only losing move in the DB!
10,Bc5,f8c5,rnbqk2r/pp1p2pp/2p2n2/2b1pp2/2P5/2NP2P1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 1 6,"Piling pressure on the centre, yes, but not where the real action is.  I think 5...d5 would have been better."
11,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk2r/pp1p2pp/2p2n2/2b1pp2/2P5/2NP1NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 6,I want to castle to get my king out of the way
12,a5,a7a5,rnbqk2r/1p1p2pp/2p2n2/p1b1pp2/2P5/2NP1NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"I can't really explain the thinking behind this move.  An advance to a4 is interdicted by the white N & Q.  Black already owns b4, which is covered by his bishop and unchallenged by White"
13,O-O,e1g1,rnbqk2r/1p1p2pp/2p2n2/p1b1pp2/2P5/2NP1NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 7,Castle
14,d6,d7d6,rnbqk2r/1p4pp/2pp1n2/p1b1pp2/2P5/2NP1NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,Now I'm really stumped.  I could understand d5 but d6 seems a bit half-hearted.  It does support e5 though.
15,Na4,c3a4,rnbqk2r/1p4pp/2pp1n2/p1b1pp2/N1P5/3P1NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 8,One thing it does do is cut off his B retreat line.  So let's pull his jacket...
16,Ba7,c5a7,rnbqk2r/bp4pp/2pp1n2/p3pp2/N1P5/3P1NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 9,The only place he can go to avoid an exchange.
17,Bd2,c1d2,rnbqk2r/bp4pp/2pp1n2/p3pp2/N1P5/3P1NP1/PP1BPPBP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 3 9,Let's put a bit of pressure on his pawn.
18,h6,h7h6,rnbqk2r/bp4p1/2pp1n1p/p3pp2/N1P5/3P1NP1/PP1BPPBP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 10,This stops Ng5 but surely now is the time to develop some pieces?  Be3? 0-0?
19,Qe1,d1e1,rnbqk2r/bp4p1/2pp1n1p/p3pp2/N1P5/3P1NP1/PP1BPPBP/R3QRK1 b kq - 1 10,Now there's 2 attackers and only 1 defender for the blockaded a-pawn
20,b6,b7b6,rnbqk2r/b5p1/1ppp1n1p/p3pp2/N1P5/3P1NP1/PP1BPPBP/R3QRK1 w kq - 0 11,That's supported the a-pawn but totally cut off the black B in the process
