13,Bh4,g5h4,r1bqk2r/ppp2pp1/2np1n1p/2b1p3/2B1P2B/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 1 7,Maintaining the pin against the black queen.
14,g5,g7g5,r1bqk2r/ppp2p2/2np1n1p/2b1p1p1/2B1P2B/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 0 8,Black makes the first truly aggressive move of the game. It is apparent that he aims for an assault on the kingside.
15,Bg3,h4g3,r1bqk2r/ppp2p2/2np1n1p/2b1p1p1/2B1P3/3P1NB1/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 1 8,"! I give this move an exclamation point simply because I am jealous of the calculating ability of Steinitz. By making it, black is willing to sacrifice his g pawn in exchange for the chance to further harrass white's dark squared bishop."
16,h5,h6h5,r1bqk2r/ppp2p2/2np1n2/2b1p1pp/2B1P3/3P1NB1/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 0 9,"! I give this move an exclamation point simply because I am jealous of the calculating ability of Steinitz.

19,Nxf7,g5f7,r1bqk2r/ppp2N2/2np1n2/2b1p3/2B1P2p/3P2B1/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 0 10,?! Bxf7  was better. White gets too cute trying to show off with this fork against black's queen and Rh8. Surely Steinitz will play Qe7 (or possibly Qd7) to save his queen...................right?
20,hxg3,h4g3,r1bqk2r/ppp2N2/2np1n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/3P2p1/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 0 11,Wrong! Steinitz sacrifices his queen!  What in the world could he possibly be planning?????

24,Nd4,c6d4,r2Nk2r/ppp5/3p1n2/2b1p3/2BnP1b1/3P2p1/PPPQ1PPP/RN3RK1 w kq - 3 13,"Keeping his attack going full throttle, black gets more firepower closer to the prize. Notice the latent danger posed by black's dark squared bishop."
25,Nc3,b1c3,r2Nk2r/ppp5/3p1n2/2b1p3/2BnP1b1/2NP2p1/PPPQ1PPP/R4RK1 b kq - 4 13,White completes development.

30,Rh1#,h8h1,r2Nk3/ppp5/3p1n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/2NP1bP1/PPPQ1P2/R4RKr w q - 1 16,A brilliant gem of sacrificial chess. I've never seen so much accomplished with so little against such a strong enemy position. I hope you enjoyed it:) - Thomas
