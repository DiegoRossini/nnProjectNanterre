Still, I did not like the idea of giving my opponent a tempo with Nxe4 with my king in the center and my queen's bishop undeveloped. I decided to continue on f2."

Also, my threat of e3 is now available because there can be a discovered check now with a pawn a square away from promotion."
25,exf7+,e6f7,r1b1k2r/2p2Ppp/p1n5/1pb3N1/8/2P1p3/PP3nPP/RNBB1RK1 b kq - 0 13,"Stable. Pins the knight and rook and stops Nxd1. Do I really care about rooks, though?"

28,Ne5,c6e5,r1b2k1r/2p2Ppp/p7/1pb1n1N1/8/2P1pB2/PP3nPP/RNB2RK1 w - - 3 15,"I bring my other knight into the fray. If my opponent plays Bxa8, then 15. ...e2 16. Re1 and either knight to d3 depending on if you want to be safe or not."
29,Re1,f1e1,r1b2k1r/2p2Ppp/p7/1pb1n1N1/8/2P1pB2/PP3nPP/RNB1R1K1 b - - 4 15,Stops the whole plan. I can't get a good discovered check in and the pawn promotion plan is done.
