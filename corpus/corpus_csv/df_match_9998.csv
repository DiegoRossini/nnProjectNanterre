2,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,Nc6. I didn't really care for moving any of the center pawns just yet.
3,e3,e2e3,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/5P2/4P3/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"I don't like this move, and it's obvious why. White does control e5, but his white squares are weak and he creates a backward pawn on e3. For those of you who don't know what a backward pawn is, it's a pawn that cannot be guarded by another pawn. Thus, he has to commit one of his pieces to defending it if it gets attacked."
