1,g3,g2g3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/6P1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This game I enjoyed playing. I took my time and managed to keep my opponent busy while I improved my position and eventually won the game
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/6P1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I started with g3 in order to fianchetto.  Black went with e5 and taking the centre space.
3,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/6P1/PPPP1P1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Now I move e4 also taking centre space.
4,Qf6,d8f6,rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/5q2/4p3/4P3/6P1/PPPP1P1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,Black brings out his queen which is attacking my f2 pawn.
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/5q2/4p3/4P3/5NP1/PPPP1P1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 3,Now I moved my knight to f3 attacking black's centre pawn and blocking black queen's line to my f2 pawn.
6,Bc5,f8c5,rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/5q2/2b1p3/4P3/5NP1/PPPP1P1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 3 4,Black brings out his DB to e5 which is attacking my f2 pawn.  Sorry it is c5.  I do get lost with the files when I am black but as I am white it should be easier.
7,Qe2,d1e2,rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/5q2/2b1p3/4P3/5NP1/PPPPQP1P/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 4 4,I move my queen to e2 to avoid black's DB taking my f2 pawn and my king having to recapture.
8,d6,d7d6,rnb1k1nr/ppp2ppp/3p1q2/2b1p3/4P3/5NP1/PPPPQP1P/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 5,Black moves pawn to d6 which allows his LB to access the diagonal to h3 and form a pawn chain with e5.
9,d3,d2d3,rnb1k1nr/ppp2ppp/3p1q2/2b1p3/4P3/3P1NP1/PPP1QP1P/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 5,I reciprocate with d3 and this allows my DB access to the diagonal to h6 whilst also forming a pawn chain with e4.
10,Nc6,b8c6,r1b1k1nr/ppp2ppp/2np1q2/2b1p3/4P3/3P1NP1/PPP1QP1P/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 1 6,Black develops his b knight to c6 which also protects his e5 pawn.
11,Bg5,c1g5,r1b1k1nr/ppp2ppp/2np1q2/2b1p1B1/4P3/3P1NP1/PPP1QP1P/RN2KB1R b KQkq - 2 6,I move my DB to g5 attacking the queen on f6.  My DB is protected by f3 knight.
12,Qg6,f6g6,r1b1k1nr/ppp2ppp/2np2q1/2b1p1B1/4P3/3P1NP1/PPP1QP1P/RN2KB1R w KQkq - 3 7,Black moves his queen to g6 which leaves my DB full access to the diagonals from g5 to d8 and g5 to c1.
13,Nc3,b1c3,r1b1k1nr/ppp2ppp/2np2q1/2b1p1B1/4P3/2NP1NP1/PPP1QP1P/R3KB1R b KQkq - 4 7,I now develop my b knight to c3 which protects my e5 pawn.  My c3 knight has access to d5 and b5 which  gives me the ability to attack the 7th rank.  D5 also allows my knight to protect a lot more squares.
14,h6,h7h6,r1b1k1nr/ppp2pp1/2np2qp/2b1p1B1/4P3/2NP1NP1/PPP1QP1P/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 8,Black pushes a pawn to h6 attacking my DB at g5.
15,Bh4,g5h4,r1b1k1nr/ppp2pp1/2np2qp/2b1p3/4P2B/2NP1NP1/PPP1QP1P/R3KB1R b KQkq - 1 8,I move my DB to h4 and it still has control of the d8 diagonal.
16,Bg4,c8g4,r3k1nr/ppp2pp1/2np2qp/2b1p3/4P1bB/2NP1NP1/PPP1QP1P/R3KB1R w KQkq - 2 9,Now black moves his LB to g4 pinning my knight to my queen at e2.  Now the path is clear for his king to castle.  Except I have the DB pointing at the d8 square so black is unable to castle.
17,Bg2,f1g2,r3k1nr/ppp2pp1/2np2qp/2b1p3/4P1bB/2NP1NP1/PPP1QPBP/R3K2R b KQkq - 3 9,I move my LB to g2 at last!  Now I have the option to castle either long or short.
18,Nge7,g8e7,r3k2r/ppp1npp1/2np2qp/2b1p3/4P1bB/2NP1NP1/PPP1QPBP/R3K2R w KQkq - 4 10,"Black now develops his last piece, his knight to e7 which protects his queen at g6 and also brings the knight together.  It also prevents my DB from now attacking the d8 square and black could castle either side."
19,O-O,e1g1,r3k2r/ppp1npp1/2np2qp/2b1p3/4P1bB/2NP1NP1/PPP1QPBP/R4RK1 b kq - 5 10,I castle short.  I think this is the best side as it affords the king a good deal of protection from my pieces
20,Nd4,c6d4,r3k2r/ppp1npp1/3p2qp/2b1p3/3nP1bB/2NP1NP1/PPP1QPBP/R4RK1 w kq - 6 11,Black does not castle but moves his c6 knight to d4 attacking my queen at e2.  My queen is already in a pin from black's LB at g4.  I could recapture with my f3 knight but this leaves my queen en prise.
