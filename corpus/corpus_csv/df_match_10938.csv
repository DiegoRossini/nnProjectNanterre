1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"This is game features a Symmetrical English, where I play an early d4 to break the symmetry.  Black then adopts a light-squared strategy, rather than the more popular kingside fianchetto.  I offer a pawn on move 8, which Black declines.  I then offer a piece at move 11 which Black accepts and finds himself all tied up and unable to complete development."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 2,It must be noted that I cant take all of the credit for the ideas in this game.  I study the games of Vladimir Kramnik heavily and this idea comes from the 7th round of the Monte Carlo Amber Rapid -- Kramnik-Anand 1994.

Black is developing along the lines of the Grivas Sicilian, made popular by Greek GM Efstratios Grivas.  The biggest strategic difference is that there is no White pawn on e4, hence the white light-squared bishop will be a more active participant in pressuring Black's queenside."

I hadn't had any experience in these lines prior to this game, but protecting the c4-pawn seemed to hand Black the initiative, and this is most likely the case.  Gelfand-Topalov, Dortmund 2002, saw 7...a6, 8. Nd6  Bxd6, 9. Qxd6 Qb4 10. Qxb4 Nxb4, 11. Rb1 d5, 12.

Qa4 develops a piece, but also creates tactical possibilities if Black plays ...d6 or ...d5, as there is now a discovered check and possibly a double check lingering."

What really struck me at this point was that the Black light-squared bishop is entombed and so is the Black King's rook.  This leaves me essentially a piece up on the Queenside after Bf4 and Two pieces up with the participation of both rooks, which comes quickly.  Black's King is also stuck in the center.  Anand chose to limit the compensation by playing 12...d5, however, the advance of the queenside majority decided the issue before the two lame pieces got developed."
