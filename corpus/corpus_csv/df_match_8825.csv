1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,My most recent game against Raziel.  He's down 2-1 so has extra incentive to win
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,A departure from my usual reply of g3 - I thought i'd give the hypermodern opening a rest in favour of a more traditional position.
