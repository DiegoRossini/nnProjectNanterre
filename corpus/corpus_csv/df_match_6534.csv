I guess it really makes no difference as the move costs black time either way, and there is the advantage here that black really has not committed to any particular plan or formation."

32,Qe6,d6e6,r1bk1r2/ppp2pQp/4qN2/2b5/5B2/6P1/PP2PPBP/R4RK1 w - - 5 17,"Probably worried about harassment from the knight as well as the forthcoming rook pin.  Truth be told there are few decent squares for the queen.  e7 provides backup to the critical squares around the black queen but is exposed to the Nd5 assault.  Furthermore, Nd5 wins the c7 pawn."
33,Rfd1+,f1d1,r1bk1r2/ppp2pQp/4qN2/2b5/5B2/6P1/PP2PPBP/R2R2K1 b - - 6 17,"I believe white can force mate in a variety of ways some of which would satisfy the chess snob in most of us.
 
17. … Bd7 18. Rxd7+ Kc8 19. Rxc7+ Kb8 20. Rxc5+ Qd6 21. Bxd6# 
17. … Bd7 18. Rxd7+ Qxd7 19. Nxd7 Kxd7 20. Rd1+ Ke7 21. Qe5#
17. … Bd7 18. Rxd7+ Qxd7 19. Nxd7 Kxd7 20. Rd1+ Kc8 21. Bh3+ Kb8 22. Qxf8+ Bxf8 23. Rd8# 

Additionally, these pesky moves probably lead to a forced mate, but I did not continue the analysis that far:
17. … Bd6 18. Qxf8+ 
17. … Ke7 18. Nd5+ Ke8 19. Nxc7+ 
17. … Ke7 18. Nd5+ Kd7 19. Nxc7+ 
17. … Ke7 18. Nd5+ Kd8 19. Nxc7+ 

Apparently there is a limit of 7 active conditional moves on gameknot.  I do not know if this is a free account limitation or system-wide.  Either way, every continuation is very bad for black."
