1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"Hi everyone!

Here is yet another awesome performance from the Master Mater against the extremely unfortunate Master Bastalex who resigned on the grounds of unavoidable mate.  My own tactical play is very hit and miss at the moment and there is much room for improvement so I hope I can spot some tactics and hidden tactics in this one.  Freddy starts off with the Reti Opening where he brings his knight out to f3 straight away.  This move holds back 1. ..... e4 so black usually plays d5 in this position.  The Reti usually transposes into a QP opening or even occasionally a Sicilian should black respond c5.  In this game Master Bastalex responds with d5."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,"2. c4!? - interesting move - Freddy just lurves gambits!  The purpose of this move is to divert the d5 pawn on to c4 where it can be recaptured after playing 1. e4.  Master Bastalex, however, declines the gambit and responds with c6 which has shades of the Slav Defense in the Queen's Gambit Declined."

10,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,7. Bxc4 - pawn trade - note the d4 pawn prevents black from expanding by playing Nc5 or Ne5.
11,Bd3,f1d3,r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/2PP4/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 6,7. Bxc4 - pawn trade - note the d4 pawn prevents black from expanding by playing Nc5 or Ne5.
12,dxc4,d5c4,r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/8/2pP4/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,7. Bxc4 - pawn trade - note the d4 pawn prevents black from expanding by playing Nc5 or Ne5.
13,Bxc4,d3c4,r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/8/2BP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,7. Bxc4 - pawn trade - note the d4 pawn prevents black from expanding by playing Nc5 or Ne5.
14,b5,b7b5,r1bqkb1r/p2n1ppp/2p1pn2/1p6/2BP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,7. ........ b5 - attack from the flank and preparing a possible fianchetto of his light squared bishop.
15,Be2,c4e2,r1bqkb1r/p2n1ppp/2p1pn2/1p6/3P4/2N1PN2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 8,8. Be2 - a retreat but Freddy will think of something.  Indeed he acts on it by playing 9. e4 which gives him his desired pawn centre and opens a diagonal for his dark square bishop.
16,a6,a7a6,r1bqkb1r/3n1ppp/p1p1pn2/1p6/3P4/2N1PN2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,10. Na4 - on the rim but probably not for long!
17,e4,e3e4,r1bqkb1r/3n1ppp/p1p1pn2/1p6/3PP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 9,10. Na4 - on the rim but probably not for long!
18,b4,b5b4,r1bqkb1r/3n1ppp/p1p1pn2/8/1p1PP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 10,10. Na4 - on the rim but probably not for long!

20,Nxe4,f6e4,r1bqkb1r/3n1ppp/p1p1p3/8/Np1Pn3/5N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 11,"10. ...... Nxe4 - Master Bastalex grabs a pawn, but as grabbing pawns is not recommended in Bruce Pandolfini's Traps and Zaps, is that wise?  We shall see."
21,Qc2,d1c2,r1bqkb1r/3n1ppp/p1p1p3/8/Np1Pn3/5N2/PPQ1BPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 1 11,"11. ..... Ndf6 - Master Bastalex now supports his advanced steed with Nf6.  Hmm, wonder where his light square bishop is going?"
22,Ndf6,d7f6,r1bqkb1r/5ppp/p1p1pn2/8/Np1Pn3/5N2/PPQ1BPPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 2 12,"11. ..... Ndf6 - Master Bastalex now supports his advanced steed with Nf6.  Hmm, wonder where his light square bishop is going?"
23,Bd3,e2d3,r1bqkb1r/5ppp/p1p1pn2/8/Np1Pn3/3B1N2/PPQ2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 3 12,12. Bd3 - putting the question to that advanced knight.  Black answers with Nd6.  Note that there is a line up of WQ and white lsb on the b1-h7 diagonal.  That means a knight must remain on f6 to avoid some nasty checks on h7.
24,Nd6,e4d6,r1bqkb1r/5ppp/p1pnpn2/8/Np1P4/3B1N2/PPQ2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 4 13,"13. ..... Bb7 - black answers my question re this bishop, he places it on b7."
25,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkb1r/5ppp/p1pnpn2/8/Np1P4/3B1N2/PPQ2PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 5 13,"13. ..... Bb7 - black answers my question re this bishop, he places it on b7."
26,Bb7,c8b7,r2qkb1r/1b3ppp/p1pnpn2/8/Np1P4/3B1N2/PPQ2PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 6 14,"13. ..... Bb7 - black answers my question re this bishop, he places it on b7."

28,Qb6,d8b6,r3kb1r/1b3ppp/pqpnpn2/2N5/1p1P4/3B1N2/PPQ2PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 8 15,"15. Bf4 - Freddy clears the decks and develops his dark squared bishop.  I wonder where black is gonna castle?  With the queen side looking rather draughty I would hesitate to put Henry on that side, hmm, I know Freddy usually gets him in the end but why make it Easy for him!"
29,Bf4,c1f4,r3kb1r/1b3ppp/pqpnpn2/2N5/1p1P1B2/3B1N2/PPQ2PPP/R4RK1 b kq - 9 15,"15. Bf4 - Freddy clears the decks and develops his dark squared bishop.  I wonder where black is gonna castle?  With the queen side looking rather draughty I would hesitate to put Henry on that side, hmm, I know Freddy usually gets him in the end but why make it Easy for him!"
30,Nd5,f6d5,r3kb1r/1b3ppp/pqpnp3/2Nn4/1p1P1B2/3B1N2/PPQ2PPP/R4RK1 w kq - 10 16,"16. Bg3 - Freddy's dsb sidesteps the black knight.  Interestingly enough, white is in a position to play Bxh7 after black responds with Nb5 but it is not a good move, can you the jury see why?"
31,Bg3,f4g3,r3kb1r/1b3ppp/pqpnp3/2Nn4/1p1P4/3B1NB1/PPQ2PPP/R4RK1 b kq - 11 16,"16. Bg3 - Freddy's dsb sidesteps the black knight.  Interestingly enough, white is in a position to play Bxh7 after black responds with Nb5 but it is not a good move, can you the jury see why?"
32,Nb5,d6b5,r3kb1r/1b3ppp/pqp1p3/1nNn4/1p1P4/3B1NB1/PPQ2PPP/R4RK1 w kq - 12 17,"17. Be5 - Freddy's pieces take up more aggressive posts, although I suppose black could play f6 here (I wonder why not?), but it is his knight that goes to f6 and not the pawn."
33,Be5,g3e5,r3kb1r/1b3ppp/pqp1p3/1nNnB3/1p1P4/3B1N2/PPQ2PPP/R4RK1 b kq - 13 17,"17. Be5 - Freddy's pieces take up more aggressive posts, although I suppose black could play f6 here (I wonder why not?), but it is his knight that goes to f6 and not the pawn."

40,Nd6,b5d6,2r1kb1r/1b3ppp/pqpnp3/2NnB3/Pp1P4/1Q1B1N2/1P3PPP/R1R3K1 w k - 1 21,20. ....... Nd6 - I wonder why he did not play bxa3 e.p?

Black now loses the right to castle.  That e6 pawn looks really vulnerable to a move like Nxe6.
43,Ngxe6,g5e6,2r1kb1r/1b3pp1/pqpnN2p/2NnB3/Pp1P4/1Q1B4/1P3PPP/R1R3K1 b k - 0 22,22. .... fxe6 - black accepts the sacrifice but now Freddy shows the point of it by bringing his bishop over to g6 with check.
