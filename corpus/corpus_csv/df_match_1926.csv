1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,My dear friend Elena has asked me to annotate this game for her. So I do so!
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Black decides on the Sicilian Defence!
3,d3,d2d3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,White opts for a closed version of it. I think this move rather lacks bite.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,Black develops sensibly
5,Be3,c1e3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/3PB3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 2 3,As does white
6,e6,e7e6,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/4P3/3PB3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,This is quite sound too
7,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/4P3/3PBN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"Sound development, but again rather lacking bite. What is White's plan exactly here?"
8,d6,d7d6,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2npp3/2p5/4P3/3PBN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"After White's rather unambitious opening, I would have been tempted to try d7-d5 instead here."
9,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2npp3/2p5/4P3/2NPBN2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,White continues to develop.
10,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2nppn2/2p5/4P3/2NPBN2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,As does Black.
11,Be2,f1e2,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2nppn2/2p5/4P3/2NPBN2/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 3 6,Sensible development again!
12,d5,d6d5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2pp4/4P3/2NPBN2/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"This rather wastes a move. If Black wanted to play this, she could have played d7-d5 in one move rather than two. Still it threatens d5-d4, so White has to do something about this threat."
13,exd5,e4d5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2pP4/8/2NPBN2/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 7,So White takes.
14,exd5,e6d5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/2pp4/8/2NPBN2/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 8,Black takes back.
15,Bd2,e3d2,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/2pp4/8/2NP1N2/PPPBBPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 8,This again is very passive. Bg5 was far more active. Maybe d3-d4 could have been played too. This leaves Black with a comfortable space advantage.
16,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2n2n2/2pp4/8/2NP1N2/PPPBBPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 9,So Black develops
17,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2n2n2/2pp4/8/2NP1N2/PPPBBPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 3 9,White castles
18,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2n2n2/2pp4/8/2NP1N2/PPPBBPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 4 10,As does Black
19,Re1,f1e1,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2n2n2/2pp4/8/2NP1N2/PPPBBPPP/R2QR1K1 b - - 5 10,"Another sensible move, moving the rook to the open file."
20,a6,a7a6,r1bq1rk1/1p2bppp/p1n2n2/2pp4/8/2NP1N2/PPPBBPPP/R2QR1K1 w - - 0 11,Is she preparing b7-b5 taking space on the queen side?
