1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

I have just returned from a nice holiday in sunny Bognor Regis - the last 3 days have been lovely with the sea at West Wittering being like a Turkish Bath.  Well, after that relaxing break it is time to catch up on my moves and do a bit more annotating.  I have been giving considerable thought to the feedback I received after my last annotation.  I was so chuffed with the new toy Gameknot Analysis that I thought I would use it.  However, with the use of it it started to detract from useful comments, so much so that my previous annotation was as impressive as the United Kingdom's performance in the Eurovision Song Contest.  I will remedy this by posting the Gameknot Analysis Version here: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=13490591&rnd=0.09771577577484708 and give normal commentary from now on."
