1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Sadly I have to report on a second loss in my MT against the masters.  This is also the second time that I have castled kingside and my opponent has mounted a successful mating attack.  This attack did not result in me copping Old Matey but I lost ruinous amounts of material which was sufficient grounds for me to wave the white flag.  How did this happen?  Well, gameknot analysis is provided here: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15890363&fb=1&rnd=0.3149043367856525."
