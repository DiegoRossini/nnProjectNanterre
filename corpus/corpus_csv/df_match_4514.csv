1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I've entered better in the game I had more space and initiative util losing it with an untimely pawn sacrifice the game was dull until 56. d5 that was probably the decisive mistake... black now had two weaknesses on opposed wings and allowed the exchange of pieces... white took a while to solve all difficulties but the game went on to a technical won endgame for white... I've resigned soon
