10,Bg7,f8g7,r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/8/2PNP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,logically developing the bishop to the strong diagonal.
11,Be3,c1e3,r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/8/2PNP3/4B3/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 2 6,developing and defending d4
12,Qb6,d8b6,r1b1k1nr/pp1pppbp/1qn3p1/8/2PNP3/4B3/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 3 7,adding pressure to d4 and hitting at the abandoned b2. Black has many alternative options here such as ...d6 and ...Nf6.
13,Nb3,d4b3,r1b1k1nr/pp1pppbp/1qn3p1/8/2P1P3/1N2B3/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 4 7,"During the game I was reluctant to play ...Qc7+ because after 8. Qd2 Nf6 9. Nc3 d6 10. f3 the situation is almost ideal for white. However, 7. ...Qb4+!? 8. Bd2 Qb6 9. Nc3 Nf6 black should have no difficulties."
14,Qd8,b6d8,r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/8/2P1P3/1N2B3/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 5 8,"During the game I was reluctant to play ...Qc7+ because after 8. Qd2 Nf6 9. Nc3 d6 10. f3 the situation is almost ideal for white. However, 7. ...Qb4+!? 8. Bd2 Qb6 9. Nc3 Nf6 black should have no difficulties."
15,Qc2,d1c2,r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/8/2P1P3/1N2B3/PPQ2PPP/RN2KB1R b KQkq - 6 8,"?! slightly inaccurate as the queen to me looks awkward and passive on this square. Furthermore, it takes a key defender away from d4. Better in my opinion is 8. Qd2 d6 9. Nc3 Nf6 10. f3."
16,d6,d7d6,r1bqk1nr/pp2ppbp/2np2p1/8/2P1P3/1N2B3/PPQ2PPP/RN2KB1R w KQkq - 0 9,securing more control over the dark squares and releasing the LSB for active duty.
17,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqk1nr/pp2ppbp/2np2p1/8/2P1P3/1NN1B3/PPQ2PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 1 9,White continues to develop and increase his control over d5 and light squares
18,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/2P1P3/1NN1B3/PPQ2PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 2 10,"Developing the knight, countering white's pressure on d5 and creating typical Sicilian threats of ...Ng4 and ...Nh5."
19,h3,h2h3,r1bqk2r/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/2P1P3/1NN1B2P/PPQ2PP1/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 10,preventing any business of black harassing the DSB with ...Ng4
20,b6,b7b6,r1bqk2r/p3ppbp/1pnp1np1/8/2P1P3/1NN1B2P/PPQ2PP1/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 11,"At the moment white's e and c pawns are targets so the idea is to play Bb7 in combination of ...Nc5 to hit at e4. However, whie can simply play f3 and any hope of pressure on e4 ends. Looking back at it now it seems that the c-pawn is much weaker as the knight on b3 blocks white from playing b3. Which means white has to defend with pieces. So may a better alternative is 10. ...Be6 11. Be2 Rc8 12. 0-0 0-0 13. Rac1 Nb4 14. Qd1 Bxc4 15. Bxc4 Rxc4 and white's big pawn center is no more!"
21,Rd1,a1d1,r1bqk2r/p3ppbp/1pnp1np1/8/2P1P3/1NN1B2P/PPQ2PP1/3RKB1R b Kkq - 1 11,Nice file for the rook and again making sure white does not lose control of d5 or d4.
22,Nd7,f6d7,r1bqk2r/p2nppbp/1pnp2p1/8/2P1P3/1NN1B2P/PPQ2PP1/3RKB1R w Kkq - 2 12,following though with my plan to attack the e-pawn
23,Be2,f1e2,r1bqk2r/p2nppbp/1pnp2p1/8/2P1P3/1NN1B2P/PPQ1BPP1/3RK2R b Kkq - 3 12,Pressure on e4 is mounting. I also like the position of my knight as they are very flexible and can easily if needed jump to c5 and e5
24,Bb7,c8b7,r2qk2r/pb1nppbp/1pnp2p1/8/2P1P3/1NN1B2P/PPQ1BPP1/3RK2R w Kkq - 4 13,Pressure on e4 is mounting. I also like the position of my knight as they are very flexible and can easily if needed jump to c5 and e5
25,O-O,e1g1,r2qk2r/pb1nppbp/1pnp2p1/8/2P1P3/1NN1B2P/PPQ1BPP1/3R1RK1 b kq - 5 13,The advantage of castling is that the rook on f1 supports f2-f4 which is very common attacking move in the Sicilian
26,O-O,e8g8,r2q1rk1/pb1nppbp/1pnp2p1/8/2P1P3/1NN1B2P/PPQ1BPP1/3R1RK1 w - - 6 14,Stalhandske signals his intent to go for a quick win. Stalhandske also rightly assesses that the pressure on e4 is false.
27,f4,f2f4,r2q1rk1/pb1nppbp/1pnp2p1/8/2P1PP2/1NN1B2P/PPQ1B1P1/3R1RK1 b - - 0 14,Stalhandske signals his intent to go for a quick win. Stalhandske also rightly assesses that the pressure on e4 is false.
28,Rc8,a8c8,2rq1rk1/pb1nppbp/1pnp2p1/8/2P1PP2/1NN1B2P/PPQ1B1P1/3R1RK1 w - - 1 15,Hoping for 16. Nxc5 dxc5 with equality.
29,Qd2,c2d2,2rq1rk1/pb1nppbp/1pnp2p1/8/2P1PP2/1NN1B2P/PP1QB1P1/3R1RK1 b - - 2 15,Hoping for 16. Nxc5 dxc5 with equality.

31,Nd4,b3d4,2rq1rk1/pb2ppbp/1pnp2p1/2n5/2PNPP2/2N1B2P/PP1QB1P1/3R1RK1 b - - 4 16,But Stal does not bite. It wise to avoid equal exchanges unless absolutely forced too. The reason is because exchanges usually benefit the one with the lest amount of space. With the knight on d4 white creates possible threats of f4-f5.
32,Qc7,d8c7,2r2rk1/pbq1ppbp/1pnp2p1/2n5/2PNPP2/2N1B2P/PP1QB1P1/3R1RK1 w - - 5 17,?! not the best move as f5 looks strong for white in the long term. I really dont know what I was thinking to be honest but best was 16. ...Nxd4 17. Bxd4 Bxd4+ 18. Qxd4 e5 19. fxe5 dxe5 20. Qxe5 Qe8 21. Qxe8 Rcxe8 is likely a draw.
33,f5,f4f5,2r2rk1/pbq1ppbp/1pnp2p1/2n2P2/2PNP3/2N1B2P/PP1QB1P1/3R1RK1 b - - 0 17,! only move that neutralizes whites growing advantage. Besides don't the Knight look awesome!
34,Ne5,c6e5,2r2rk1/pbq1ppbp/1p1p2p1/2n1nP2/2PNP3/2N1B2P/PP1QB1P1/3R1RK1 w - - 1 18,! only move that neutralizes whites growing advantage. Besides don't the Knight look awesome!
