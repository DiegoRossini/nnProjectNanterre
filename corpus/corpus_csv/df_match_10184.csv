Ne2 - I did not anticipate this move in my conditional moves/analyse board set up - OMG the knight is going to manoeuvre itself to h5 after the rook moves to f3 winning the weak f6 pawn.  Here I decide to take a gamble.  For piece activity on the g file I sacrifice a couple of pawns.  The idea is that after the major pieces have been exchanged and perhaps the minor pieces too - I may be able to afford to go into a king and pawn ending one or two pawns down because his extra pawns are on the h file and not too far away from my king and his own king would have to make a journey to the pawns.  To ensure this would happen I decided to ensure that my remaining f pawn was backed up by my rook and would attack the hind h pawn with my bishop winning it back.  The foremost h pawn would be used as a screen against the black king on the h file and be picked off by the king later on - unfortunately because of a series of zwizchensugs (in between moves) Marin has other ideas.
