2,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I am not used to d6 defence, hence from here on, I did whatever seemed natural to me."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,A sort of KID set up? So i assume that my opponent is going to castle on king side. I commence my attack without delay.

7,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 4,The ideas behind my play in this game are very simple. Starting with this move - I simply place the bishop on a diagonal that may be useful in attacking the king later.
8,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 2 5,KID setup - ish...i was right!
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 5,Developing. Better than Nge2 because I can now use Ng5 square to attack the king.
10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 4 6,"This is not to stop Bg4, that pin is useless. Bg4 h3, Bxf3 Qxf3 etc and white has a more pieces out in the open. The idea behind this move is just pawn expansion on king side"
11,h3,h2h3,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2NB1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 6,"This is not to stop Bg4, that pin is useless. Bg4 h3, Bxf3 Qxf3 etc and white has a more pieces out in the open. The idea behind this move is just pawn expansion on king side"
12,c5,c7c5,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2p5/3PP3/2NB1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 7,The previous move allows me to do this move without worrying about Ng4
13,Be3,c1e3,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2p5/3PP3/2NBBN1P/PPP2PP1/R2QK2R b KQ - 1 7,The previous move allows me to do this move without worrying about Ng4
14,b6,b7b6,rnbq1rk1/p3ppbp/1p1p1np1/2p5/3PP3/2NBBN1P/PPP2PP1/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 8,"hmm, not sure how useful this move is. Black should focus more on developing pieces here."
15,Qd2,d1d2,rnbq1rk1/p3ppbp/1p1p1np1/2p5/3PP3/2NBBN1P/PPPQ1PP1/R3K2R b KQ - 1 8,idea is to castle queen side and launch a quick attack on black's king
16,Re8,f8e8,rnbqr1k1/p3ppbp/1p1p1np1/2p5/3PP3/2NBBN1P/PPPQ1PP1/R3K2R w KQ - 2 9,Don't know what black is doing. Nbd7 looks good here with idea of cxd4 and then Nc5...
17,O-O-O,e1c1,rnbqr1k1/p3ppbp/1p1p1np1/2p5/3PP3/2NBBN1P/PPPQ1PP1/2KR3R b - - 3 9,Natural...white is ready to launch an attack
18,a5,a7a5,rnbqr1k1/4ppbp/1p1p1np1/p1p5/3PP3/2NBBN1P/PPPQ1PP1/2KR3R w - - 0 10,black's counter attack. I see that the pawns are too far away to threaten my knight right away..hence i begin expanding making threats of my own.
19,g4,g2g4,rnbqr1k1/4ppbp/1p1p1np1/p1p5/3PP1P1/2NBBN1P/PPPQ1P2/2KR3R b - - 0 10,"This move is troublesome because if the black bishop takes my white bishop...my queen will be displaced from line of fire :P  (i.e. the c1 - h6 diagonal). Hence, i have to take the bishop first but I still have time to do some damage on the king side."
20,Ba6,c8a6,rn1qr1k1/4ppbp/bp1p1np1/p1p5/3PP1P1/2NBBN1P/PPPQ1P2/2KR3R w - - 1 11,"This move is troublesome because if the black bishop takes my white bishop...my queen will be displaced from line of fire :P  (i.e. the c1 - h6 diagonal).

22,Nfd7,f6d7,rn1qr1k1/3nppbp/bp1p2p1/p1p3P1/3PP3/2NBBN1P/PPPQ1P2/2KR3R w - - 1 12,the idea previously discussed
23,Bxa6,d3a6,rn1qr1k1/3nppbp/Bp1p2p1/p1p3P1/3PP3/2N1BN1P/PPPQ1P2/2KR3R b - - 0 12,the idea previously discussed

26,b5,b6b5,1n1qr1k1/3nppbp/r2p2p1/ppp3P1/3PP2P/2N1BN2/PPPQ1P2/2KR3R w - - 0 14,now this is troublesome...the pawns have closed in now...
27,h5,h4h5,1n1qr1k1/3nppbp/r2p2p1/ppp3PP/3PP3/2N1BN2/PPPQ1P2/2KR3R b - - 0 14,"I keep attacking. b4 here can be answered with Na4 or Ne2. In terms of pawn threats, white is still winning."
