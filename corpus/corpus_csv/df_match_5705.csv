1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This could have been one of one of my finer bloody attacking morsels, however, indigestion of the mind led it to being one of my vilest capitulations, as I snatched defeat from the jaws of victory."
2,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,This game was part of an English Opening theme tournament.  All of the tulip maidens Nosferatu drained in Holland has made him a Dutch Defense player so ...f5 usually factors into most of my systems against the d4/c4 web of openings.

I used to play it quite frequently before switching the Classical Dutch, because after 8. d5 I played too many games where I suffered on blindingly light squares (Nosferatu hates the light). It still leads to enterprising chess."

Ng5 black is embarrassed on the light squares, i.e. 9. Ng5 Nb6 10. c5.  The queen's bishop must remain unimpeded in this variation, and often remains on c8 for a long time."

It prepares e4 of course, but the downside is that black can now play ...b5 immediately, with counterplay, whereas the most critical test, 10.

Correct is 11. cb cb 12. Qd3 (12. ...b4? doesn't win a piece: 13. Bxb4 Nxb4 14. Qc4ch) Rb8 13. b4, though after 13. ...Bb7 black has a good prospects, and even a slight pull in the middlegame."

In the meanwhile, after shooing away the c3 knight, I've put the kibosh on white's own e4 break (many advantages in the opening rest on who breaks in the center first at the right moment, with initiative)."

Sacrificing a pawn for time and development, and considering it was a relatively unimportant wing pawn and crosses up white's lines temporarily I thought it was a good investment.  There's a long history of b-pawns being the first on the block for just such considerations, actually (in chess and war).  Look at the the Evan's, Benko, and Sicilian/French Wing Gambits."

Qc2 e5 15. de de 16. e4, but this is a very inhuman continuation.  I knew that psychologically the urge to immediately kill an enemy knight that's just landed on your third rank is a strong one, which is what he did."
