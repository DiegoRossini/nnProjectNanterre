1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Round 5 of the ASCC begins, and and I have the black pieces vs. a total stranger. I've had a good night's sleep, and am committed to playing for 2 wins today. This game begins with a simple tactical victory of a piece during the opening, and my opponent just went downhill after that. There were several instances of him not hitting his clock after making a move. I tried to be a sporting as I could without actually telling him, but I don't think it did much good. He just visibly fell apart after the last instance, toppled his king, then promptly withdrew from the tourney. I felt kind of bad for him, but obviously I took the point and ran. White starts off 1. d4."

17,Nf3,g1f3,rnb1k2r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/6q1/2PP4/2P2N2/P1Q2PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 1 9,"Obviously shaken by his last mental lapse, white spent about 25 minutes on this move (which is a good move IMHO). The problem is, he forgets to hit his clock. I spend a few minutes deciding on my move, and select Qa5. I stare at the clock for about 10 seconds. He sees me looking at it. I then get up and go smoke a cigarette. I'm gone for about 10 minutes. When I return, he still hasn't hit his clock. I glance at the board, then wander off to look at other games. From across the room, I see him finally realize what is going on, and he hits his clock with a look of utter disgust. I return to the board and play......"
