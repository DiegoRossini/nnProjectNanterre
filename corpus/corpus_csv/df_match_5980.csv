1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Some games just kind of 'spring to life' in the middle game after what seems to be a pretty routine opening. In this game it suddenly occurred to me that all my pieces were trained on a key square; I hadn't quite planned it like that. In fact, all I'd played were natural opening moves. I'm black, by the way. Can you guess the key square? (Clue: Traditionally the weakest square on white's side of the board)."

Of course, it can lead to the Colle System opening, but that brought terror to black 80 years ago. These days for white, if black knows what he is doing, it hardly offers any advantage."
