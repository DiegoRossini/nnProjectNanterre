1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I open with e4 because I have the most experience at that. but think I will come up with some slight variation early if i can figure one out.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"normal response from Rob.  on the board, we are taking the normal cursory stabs at each other to keep it interesting."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,I haven't figured out any little variation yet. so i play safe
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,We have all seen this before....
5,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,I decide to see if i can get him to stack pawns or do something early he won't like.
6,a6,a7a6,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,"he responds, and i think about this,  I can still get him to stack pawns, but not the ones I had hoped. So he is probably used to having stacked  b and c pawns  so I rethink that Idea"
7,Ba4,b5a4,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"first, that I can still stack his pawns and get a pawn at e5 with my knight,  but then i remember it is kind of poisoned.  So i just back up a little"
8,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk1nr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/2b1p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,I think i have seen this before.
9,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk1nr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/2b1p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 3 5,i go ahead and O-O while it is good.  Hopefully not premature
10,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/2b1p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 4 6,"he develops the knight, attacking e4,  my first impulse is d3,  but that is too standard,  then I remember if he does take it, I can get control back of the center easily since he hasn't castled yet  I am still thinking about BxN ...  but no..."
11,c3,c2c3,r1bqk2r/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/2b1p3/B3P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 6,I open up the Queen on white squares and give my bishop a place to go too (if I need it.)
12,b5,b7b5,r1bqk2r/2pp1ppp/p1n2n2/1pb1p3/B3P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,Guess what...  I need it...
13,Bc2,a4c2,r1bqk2r/2pp1ppp/p1n2n2/1pb1p3/4P3/2P2N2/PPBP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 7,so now i am back to protecting the pawn (center) and maybe set to attack his bishop at c5.
14,d6,d7d6,r1bqk2r/2p2ppp/p1np1n2/1pb1p3/4P3/2P2N2/PPBP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,he opens up his white bishop...  and probably other stuff i don't realize too.  My rating had been inflated from when before Christmas I had nothing to do at work and played with the analyzer for hours on each move.  It is back down to where it should be (  maybe 80 points at just under 1600)
15,d4,d2d4,r1bqk2r/2p2ppp/p1np1n2/1pb1p3/3PP3/2P2N2/PPB2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,"I thought about this move for about 2 days,  I really wanted to come up with some back breaker,  but I just didn't' see it.  So I went with pushing the center of the board. I thought about creating some havoc with a4, Qe2, or maybe even b4,  but none of those moves had a good 'feel' to me."
16,Bb6,c5b6,r1bqk2r/2p2ppp/pbnp1n2/1p2p3/3PP3/2P2N2/PPB2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 9,"He retreats with a comment about how much experience he has at this position.  I figure, maybe he has played one on gameknot so i think about trying to find it.  to see what he did.  (is that cheating???)  I think my odds are about as long at finding such a game as are his belief  (and possibly my own)  that I can pull off a win or even a draw."
17,a4,a2a4,r1bqk2r/2p2ppp/pbnp1n2/1p2p3/P2PP3/2P2N2/1PB2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 9,"I decided a4 wasn't such a bad move mostly because I figured i could keep more pressure on his pieces that are loaded on that side, also believing that if exd4,  I can still cxd4 and have the center of the board..
I decide to download his pgn files and see if i can do a search with notepad and find games he has played similar."
18,Bb7,c8b7,r2qk2r/1bp2ppp/pbnp1n2/1p2p3/P2PP3/2P2N2/1PB2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 10,"Ok  by this point I had downloaded his pgn files and done a search and found 5 games he played that were similar.  His record in those is 3-1-1 where he was black in each game...  
He moves Bb7,  kind of a surprise, since I had seen one of his opponents play h3 to cut off the Bg4 move ."
19,d5,d4d5,r2qk2r/1bp2ppp/pbnp1n2/1p1Pp3/P3P3/2P2N2/1PB2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 10,"Now all bets on past game history are off.  I play d5 to cut off his white bishop as much as anything else.  he is probably going to move the knight to e7 and keep it in the center, since a7 doesn't leave a retreat path for his black Bishop. I reveal to him on the message of the game I found he was 3-1-1 in games similar through move 6."
20,Ne7,c6e7,r2qk2r/1bp1nppp/pb1p1n2/1p1Pp3/P3P3/2P2N2/1PB2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 11,"He does the expected move  and now I wonder.  What next?  he is probably going to push c7 and break up my little party.  He also indicates that he is impressed that I found his similar games and wonders how I did it.  Noting the fact that he has 648 completed games, he figures i didn't scroll through each one.  I told him how I did it, well  basically  he is good at chess ,  I am good with software applications...."
