1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game is a training match with one of my junior teammates.  If you have any comments or suggestions for improved play, please post so that we can all learn together."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I distinctly prefer the King's pawn game (C50) to Ruy Lopez (C60), but that's just personal preference.  Regardless, these opening sequences are standard chess fare that every practitioner of the art will run into again and again."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"I distinctly prefer the King's pawn game (C50) to Ruy Lopez (C60), but that's just personal preference.  Regardless, these opening sequences are standard chess fare that every practitioner of the art will run into again and again."

6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,"Now we transition to a Two knights defense (C55), which is a very popular defense and my preference as well.  In this match, considering the difference in our ratings, I wanted to play very aggressively to see how my opponent would respond.  I feel that aggressive chess tends to open learning opportunities more quickly."
7,Ng5,f3g5,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p1N1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 5 4,"Again, very common play so far.  This attack can be precipitate some bad things on the f7 pawn if left unattended.  In addition to threatening a double attack on the f7 pawn, it also defends the e4 pawn from immediate capture."
8,d5,d7d5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3pp1N1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,Perfect response from Black.  It blocks the LSB on c4 and threatens the center.
9,exd5,e4d5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3Pp1N1/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,preserving the momentum of the attack.
10,Nxd5,f6d5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/3np1N1/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"Recapturing the pawn and threatening my knight on g5 at the same time.  Although my preference as Black is to play Na5 here, this line is perfectly playable and a strong response."
11,d4,d2d4,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/3np1N1/2BP4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"This move seeks to protect the knight on g5, and keep the pressure on Black.  Another sequence I sometimes play is 6. Nxf7 Kxf7 7. Qf3+, which makes Black's king move around the board."
12,Nxd4,c6d4,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3np1N1/2Bn4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"I expected either exd4 or Be7.  Another strong option is Bb4+.  Although this play isn't bad, whether it's good or not depends upon the follow through.  It does provide possibilities if I can't counter punch.  Although I still have two attack pieces on the board, Black has better development and more center control."
13,c3,c2c3,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3np1N1/2Bn4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,"This move will normally cause Black to retreat and allow me a tempo move.  A strong response, however, is b5, offering some tantalizing counterplay."
14,Ne6,d4e6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4n3/3np1N1/2B5/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 8,Black decides on a 2-1 play against my knight on g5.  Not a bad play at all.  So far my opponent is doing well in keeping up with my attacks and has shown good positional play.
15,Qxd5,d1d5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4n3/3Qp1N1/2B5/2P5/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 8,"Now I have some firepower downrange and am about to seriously start threatening Black's position.  Black has a few choices worth considering, but I think the best move is to trade queens."
16,Nxg5,e6g5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3Qp1n1/2B5/2P5/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 9,"And with this move Black has lost on the exchange.  While trading a piece for a pawn early isn't the end of the world, without a clear tactical or positional advantage to press as a result, the exchange would appear unwise."
17,Qxd8+,d5d8,r1bQkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/4p1n1/2B5/2P5/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 9,Forcing Black to lose castle and removing the defender from the knight on g5
18,Kxd8,e8d8,r1bk1b1r/ppp2ppp/8/4p1n1/2B5/2P5/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 0 10,"A good response, forcing away my bishop and causing me to regroup."
19,Bxg5+,c1g5,r1bk1b1r/ppp2ppp/8/4p1B1/2B5/2P5/PP3PPP/RN2K2R b KQ - 0 10,"A good response, forcing away my bishop and causing me to regroup."
20,f6,f7f6,r1bk1b1r/ppp3pp/5p2/4p1B1/2B5/2P5/PP3PPP/RN2K2R w KQ - 0 11,"A good response, forcing away my bishop and causing me to regroup."
21,Be3,g5e3,r1bk1b1r/ppp3pp/5p2/4p3/2B5/2P1B3/PP3PPP/RN2K2R b KQ - 1 11,"Black's priority should now be to get his remaining two pieces in play and connect his rooks.  So far so good.  I toyed around with f4 here for a while, but ultimately decided to castle and complete my development."
22,Bf5,c8f5,r2k1b1r/ppp3pp/5p2/4pb2/2B5/2P1B3/PP3PPP/RN2K2R w KQ - 2 12,"Black's priority should now be to get his remaining two pieces in play and connect his rooks.  So far so good.  I toyed around with f4 here for a while, but ultimately decided to castle and complete my development."
23,O-O,e1g1,r2k1b1r/ppp3pp/5p2/4pb2/2B5/2P1B3/PP3PPP/RN3RK1 b - - 3 12,Protecting his King and allowing the possibility for a manual castle or at least connecting his rooks.
24,Bd6,f8d6,r2k3r/ppp3pp/3b1p2/4pb2/2B5/2P1B3/PP3PPP/RN3RK1 w - - 4 13,Protecting his King and allowing the possibility for a manual castle or at least connecting his rooks.

26,a6,a7a6,r2k3r/1pp3pp/p2b1p2/4pb2/2B5/2P1B3/PP1N1PPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 14,"Denying me access to the b5 square with my Bishop.  Not necessarily a high priority.  I might have moved my king to either d7 or e7 to link my rooks, or played c6."
27,a4,a2a4,r2k3r/1pp3pp/p2b1p2/4pb2/P1B5/2P1B3/1P1N1PPP/R4RK1 b - - 0 14,Looking to explore the queenside pawns for trading and opening a hole for my rooks.
