13,Be2,f1e2,rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 7,After e6 I wanted to play Be2 cause i wouldnt like my Bishop on b4 anymore.
14,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/1p2bppp/p2ppn2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 8,"I thought my opponent would like to play b5 followed by Bb7, So i wanted to prevent it."

16,Bd7,c8d7,rn1qk2r/1p1bbppp/p2ppn2/6B1/P2NP3/2N5/1PP1BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 1 9,I was trying to gain more space and have a strong center with my pawns on the 4th rank. .
17,f4,f2f4,rn1qk2r/1p1bbppp/p2ppn2/6B1/P2NPP2/2N5/1PP1B1PP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 9,I was trying to gain more space and have a strong center with my pawns on the 4th rank. .
18,Nc6,b8c6,r2qk2r/1p1bbppp/p1nppn2/6B1/P2NPP2/2N5/1PP1B1PP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 1 10,He s developing his Knight.That controls central dark squares and attacks my Knight on d4. So far it s not a problem for me But things might get worse.
19,O-O,e1g1,r2qk2r/1p1bbppp/p1nppn2/6B1/P2NPP2/2N5/1PP1B1PP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 2 10,I thought it s time to castle. I am sure you all can see why s it bad move cause my knight on d4 s hanging after Qb6.. I just couldnt concentrate on the game at the moment i made this move.
20,Qb6,d8b6,r3k2r/1p1bbppp/pqnppn2/6B1/P2NPP2/2N5/1PP1B1PP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 3 11,and my opponent didnt miss the chance of having my knight as a morsel.
21,e5,e4e5,r3k2r/1p1bbppp/pqnppn2/4P1B1/P2N1P2/2N5/1PP1B1PP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 11,"Here, It was clear that i am gonna  lose my Knight on d4.With that in mind, i thought I can  set up a counter attack while he s taking  his time  with my Knight on d4."
22,Nxd4,c6d4,r3k2r/1p1bbppp/pq1ppn2/4P1B1/P2n1P2/2N5/1PP1B1PP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 12,"I think Qxd4 was better. That way He could exchange Queens and when Queens are of the board and i am a piece down, I guess It would be all over already..But my opponent immediately takse my Knight and now he s threating double check next move. I cant let it happen."
23,Kh1,g1h1,r3k2r/1p1bbppp/pq1ppn2/4P1B1/P2n1P2/2N5/1PP1B1PP/R2Q1R1K b kq - 1 12,So my king ran away.
24,Ng8,f6g8,r3k1nr/1p1bbppp/pq1pp3/4P1B1/P2n1P2/2N5/1PP1B1PP/R2Q1R1K w kq - 2 13,Now lets look at the position. I am a piece down but I gained tempo with e5 move and forced his Knight back to g8 so i gained one more tempo.
25,a5,a4a5,r3k1nr/1p1bbppp/pq1pp3/P3P1B1/3n1P2/2N5/1PP1B1PP/R2Q1R1K b kq - 0 13,I am trying to have some positional advantage while i am down in material.
26,Qa7,b6a7,r3k1nr/qp1bbppp/p2pp3/P3P1B1/3n1P2/2N5/1PP1B1PP/R2Q1R1K w kq - 1 14,"His Queen went to a7 square, probably to get rid of my attacks to his Queen. Now I cant attack his Queen anymore and her majesty  protects his knight on d4. But Lets look at Black's position now. He s up a piece but his rook on h8 and Knight g8 has to be developed.He needs two moves to gather himself and build a killing attack But two moves are a lot in chess. He has to find a way."
27,exd6,e5d6,r3k1nr/qp1bbppp/p2Pp3/P5B1/3n1P2/2N5/1PP1B1PP/R2Q1R1K b kq - 0 14,Here I wanted to open position before he finds time to develop his Knight followed by Castling.
28,Bxd6,e7d6,r3k1nr/qp1b1ppp/p2bp3/P5B1/3n1P2/2N5/1PP1B1PP/R2Q1R1K w kq - 0 15,Improving my position with Qc3. I am threating Rd1 next.
29,Qd3,d1d3,r3k1nr/qp1b1ppp/p2bp3/P5B1/3n1P2/2NQ4/1PP1B1PP/R4R1K b kq - 1 15,Improving my position with Qc3. I am threating Rd1 next.
30,h6,h7h6,r3k1nr/qp1b1pp1/p2bp2p/P5B1/3n1P2/2NQ4/1PP1B1PP/R4R1K w kq - 0 16,Here I was expeting him to play some defensive move. But he wants to attack He has seen something.
31,Bh4,g5h4,r3k1nr/qp1b1pp1/p2bp2p/P7/3n1P1B/2NQ4/1PP1B1PP/R4R1K b kq - 1 16,My only move was Bh4.. Threating f2 next move now. That s my new plan.
32,g5,g7g5,r3k1nr/qp1b1p2/p2bp2p/P5p1/3n1P1B/2NQ4/1PP1B1PP/R4R1K w kq - 0 17,So my plan works here after Bf2 I will eventually win my piece backand will have a good positional advantage. But What happened why my opponent played this move?? He appearenty thought i would take the pawn fxg and then hxg!! threating my Bishop plus opening h file and if i take the pawn his rook takes on h2 and Kxe2 mate next move.if i dont take the pawn I cant go to g3 because my Bishop hangs and f2  cant save me anymore. I cant let that happen. So I went for my plan.
33,Bf2,h4f2,r3k1nr/qp1b1p2/p2bp2p/P5p1/3n1P2/2NQ4/1PP1BBPP/R4R1K b kq - 1 17,He has to protect his knight.
34,e5,e6e5,r3k1nr/qp1b1p2/p2b3p/P3p1p1/3n1P2/2NQ4/1PP1BBPP/R4R1K w kq - 0 18,He has to protect his knight.
