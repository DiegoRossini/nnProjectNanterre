1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"the game consisted on a Slav defence resulting in a queen side pawn majority for black in exchange for activity and more space for white, eventualy white managed to create a passed pawn but black remained with three pawns against one on the queen side, the exchange of queens and some more manoeuvring lead to two distant passed pawns for black against one blocked central passed pawn for white, the transition to pawns endgame would favour black, so white was forced to accept a technical drawn rooks endgame"
