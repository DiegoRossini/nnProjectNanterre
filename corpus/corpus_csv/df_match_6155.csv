Yet Black does have some long-term prospects based upon the long dark diagonal - White's centre is far from invulnerable placed as it is - and the open files on the distant Queen's flank.  There are some resemblances here to the Benko and Blumenfeld Counter-gambits that White has to bear in mind.  White should also beware  - or be aware - of the long white diagonal (a8-h1), as well.  Finally, there is that tension between e5 and d6 which neither is willing for the time being to resolve.  Having said all that, 10.Be2 might have been simpler..."
