1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"A very interesting NOT BLITZ game, specially the final position and its tactics. It would be interesting, I think, to share thoughts about the game."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The wisest answer, I almost never face. Now, taking the pawn is recommended, but I also tried Bf5, even if it not in the spirit of the opening."

6,Nxd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3n4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"A solw move, many would say. But it is true that Nb4 can be soon a threat. White is not at ease coping with this knight unless with some theory behind."
7,a3,a2a3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3n4/3P4/P7/1PP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"A solw move, many would say. But it is true that Nb4 can be soon a threat. White is not at ease coping with this knight unless with some theory behind."
8,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3n1b2/3P4/P7/1PP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"Uncommitting developement moves. Black is not in a hurry to play e5 and open the column, since it not any ahead in reaching castling."

12,Nf6,d5f6,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/5b2/2PP4/P4N2/1P3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,"...or Nb6. I can't decide which is better, but I am not too experienced with c5 and this ""can't be bad"". Even so, the game is pretty ""slow"" for our standards."
13,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/5b2/2PP4/P1N2N2/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 7,"This is a move I consider almost as a defeat, since it doesn't threaten anything. But I have to castle if I want some attacking chances."
14,Be7,f8e7,rn1qk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/5b2/2PP4/P1N2N2/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 3 8,"This is a move I consider almost as a defeat, since it doesn't threaten anything. But I have to castle if I want some attacking chances."

16,Nbd7,b8d7,r2qk2r/pppnbppp/4pn2/5b2/2PP4/P1N2N2/1P2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 5 9,"Now that I know I can castle whenever I want, I better take care of my complete developement. This knight goes here because I want to keep the c pawn free to defend (c6) or attack (c5) at any moment."
17,O-O,e1g1,r2qk2r/pppnbppp/4pn2/5b2/2PP4/P1N2N2/1P2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 6 9,"Well, now I feel really safe. White has some more space, but it is not clear how to take advantage of it right now."

20,Qc7,d8c7,r3k2r/ppqnbppp/2p1pn2/5b2/2PP4/P1N2N1P/1P2BPP1/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 1 11,"Of course, I go into the diag myself!"
