1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone - this was an unrated game between me and one of my buddies who has an optimum rating in the high 1600s.  He played very well until his last move, but that last move was fatal and allowed an incursion of Glenda onto the back rank.  My opponent resigned on the grounds of unavoidable mate in 3.  Please note.  I do NOT mind if my opponents wish to resign rather than be checkmated.  Nice just to get the points.  I decide to kick off with d4."
