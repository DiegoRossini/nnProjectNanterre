11,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"this is not quite as bad as it looks with the proper follow up.  Still e6 has to be the best move.  e6 takes the pressure off f7 for a while.  White often follows up with f2-f4-f5 and Black has to choose between ...exf5 or  ...e5 either of which opens things up for the Sozin bishop.  Also there are tactics based on Nd5 exd5, Bxd5 to look out for."

16,Bxg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/1p3pbp/p2p4/4p3/2B1n3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,"At this point Fischer actually took about 15 seconds to look something over.  All his prior moves had been made instantly.  It took him about 2 minutes to make the rounds.  Which was a fair amount of time to think about your move, but less than I thought I would have.   Now I had figure out how to defend my d-pawn."
