13,Bf4,c1f4,rnbqkb1r/pp3p1p/3p1np1/2pP4/4PB2/2N5/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 1 7,"perhaps white should wait a little to make this move, as the bishop could be harassed by Nh5 now. Bf4 is indeed a good move, though, and I didn't play Nh5."
14,Qe7,d8e7,rnb1kb1r/pp2qp1p/3p1np1/2pP4/4PB2/2N5/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 2 8,Developing the queen and hitting e4. Looking back I think Nh5 is better.
15,Nb5,c3b5,rnb1kb1r/pp2qp1p/3p1np1/1NpP4/4PB2/8/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 3 8,"A surprising move, indeed, but not a bad one. I think however, better for white is Nf3, or maybe Qc2. Both moves save e4 and give white good position. (If 8)Nf3 Nxe4 9)Qa5  wins a piece). Instead, the following moves leave black in an at least okay situation. I feel that white was better after my not so hot Qe7 move."
