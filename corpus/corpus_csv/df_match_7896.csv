The most popular reply for White is 15.dxc5, after which many pieces are exchanged and an endgame is reached where Black has more prospects than White, for a couple of reasons: h5 is weak, Black will have more center control and he will be more active on the Queenside than White.

No wonder 14.Ne4 is scoring pretty bad and Qe2 is the main move. That is, until I played my novelty."

This move wasn't played before on GK, at least it wasn't recorded in the database, and in my database, I could only find one game where Black accepted the sacrifice and subsequently won."

A nasty discovery is looming on the d-file, the Bishop and the g-file Rook are taking aim at Kg8 and to top it all, the Knight on f3 is poised to reach a nice snuggle position on g6.

White's position is much better and Black is only hanging by a thread."

It's really hard to find a move for Black here. Perhaps liquidating some material with 18...Rxf3 19.Qxf3 Ngf6 20.dxc5 Qc7, but after 21.Qg2, things look grim."

A premature resignation to say the least."
