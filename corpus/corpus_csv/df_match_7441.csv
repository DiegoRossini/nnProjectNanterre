7,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p2B1/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 3 4,"The Burn Variation (4...dxe5) is probably more popular.  Here, I played 4...Be7 simply to break the pin on Black's queen."
8,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p2B1/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 4 5,"The Burn Variation (4...dxe5) is probably more popular.  Here, I played 4...Be7 simply to break the pin on Black's queen."
9,e5,e4e5,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3pP1B1/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"Perhaps this is why the Burn Variation is more popular!  Here, this move leads to the exchange of Black's ""good"" bishop."
10,Nfd7,f6d7,rnbqk2r/pppnbppp/4p3/3pP1B1/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,"An unexpected move.  White tries to bolster his centre, but perhaps it would be better to develop his minor pieces."
11,Bxe7,g5e7,rnbqk2r/pppnBppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,"An unexpected move.  White tries to bolster his centre, but perhaps it would be better to develop his minor pieces."

13,f4,f2f4,rnb1k2r/pppnqppp/4p3/3pP3/3P1P2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 7,"An unexpected move.  White tries to bolster his centre, but perhaps it would be better to develop his minor pieces."
14,c5,c7c5,rnb1k2r/pp1nqppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P1P2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 8,"I played this move quickly, aiming to undermine e4. I was expecting the standard 8. Nf3  Nc6, which looks good for Black due to the pressure on the centre and the lack of a supporting pawn on c3.  However, 7...c5 is actually a bad positional blunder, which White quickly exploits."
15,Nb5,c3b5,rnb1k2r/pp1nqppp/4p3/1NppP3/3P1P2/8/PPP3PP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 1 8,"All of sudden, it's clear that Black is being embarrassed.  White now threatens either 9.Nc7+ (winning the rook on a8) or Nd6+ (preventing Black from castling and creating a monster of a knight).  A difficult choice and, even at this early stage, I thought about resigning."
16,O-O,e8g8,rnb2rk1/pp1nqppp/4p3/1NppP3/3P1P2/8/PPP3PP/R2QKBNR w KQ - 2 9,"Deciding to play on and accept the loss of material.  Although the rook is doomed, I hoped to compensate by generate counter-play in the centre.  At worst I thought that I would be the exchange down with a playable position."
17,Nc7,b5c7,rnb2rk1/ppNnqppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P1P2/8/PPP3PP/R2QKBNR b KQ - 3 9,"A rook down, but now Black has some initiative in the centre."

21,Nh3,g1h3,N1b2rk1/pp1nqppp/4p3/2ppP3/3n1P2/7N/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 1 11,"A strange move from White.  11. Nf3 seems more logical, challenging Black's knight on d4, and after 11...Nxf3 12. Qxf3 White is fine.  Perhaps my opponent had in mind the manoeuvre Nh3-f2, but, as they say, ""a knight on the rim is dim""."
22,f6,f7f6,N1b2rk1/pp1nq1pp/4pp2/2ppP3/3n1P2/7N/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 12,"Trying to open the f-file by playing for 12...fxe5, when the recapture 13. fxe5 allows Black's rook to blast down the f-file.  If 13. fxf6, then Black can play 13..Nxf6 followed by 14...d5."
23,c3,c2c3,N1b2rk1/pp1nq1pp/4pp2/2ppP3/3n1P2/2P4N/PP4PP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 12,First kicking the knight.

28,e5,e6e5,N1b2rk1/pp2q1pp/2n2n2/2ppp3/5P2/2PB3N/PP4PP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 15,"A key move for Black.  Now if 15. 0-0, then 15...Bxh3 leaves White with doubled h-pawns and an exposed king.   The alternative, 15. fxe5 is no better, since 15...Nxe5 threatens capturing the bishop on d3 with discovered check."
29,f5,f4f5,N1b2rk1/pp2q1pp/2n2n2/2pppP2/8/2PB3N/PP4PP/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 15,"White attempts to prevent an exchange on h3, but now allows Black's e-pawn to advance."
30,e4,e5e4,N1b2rk1/pp2q1pp/2n2n2/2pp1P2/4p3/2PB3N/PP4PP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 16,"I was starting to like my position.  Although a rook down, I had a good lead in development and a strong central attack.  After White's pawn on f5 dropped I could renew my threat of Bxh3 and perhaps have a go at White's king."
31,Bb5,d3b5,N1b2rk1/pp2q1pp/2n2n2/1Bpp1P2/4p3/2P4N/PP4PP/R2QK2R b KQ - 1 16,Preparing to castle queen-side.

34,Ne5,c6e5,N4rk1/pp2q1pp/5n2/1Bppnb2/Q3p3/2P4N/PP4PP/R3K2R w KQ - 2 18,"I thought a while before playing this move.  The simple 17...Rxa8 allows 18. Bxc6 bxc6 19. Qxc6, with no clear benefit to Black.  17...Ne5 allows 18. Qxa7, saving the Knight on a8, but risking 18...Nxd3+."
35,Qxa7,a4a7,N4rk1/Qp2q1pp/5n2/1Bppnb2/4p3/2P4N/PP4PP/R3K2R b KQ - 0 18,"In my view, a mistake.  White attempts to hold onto his knight at the expense of protecting his king.  18. 0-0-0 would have been better."
