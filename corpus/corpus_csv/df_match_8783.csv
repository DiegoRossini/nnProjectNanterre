1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi all. This game isn't very ""good"" in a sense that I managed to win a pawn in the first few moves of the game. However, it may be helpful in identifying what not to do, and it shows how to hold an extra pawn without generating other weaknesses among one's camp. It also shows a little tactical shot available to white when the king is centered, even in the endgame when queens are exchanged. I also need practice annotating. Any comments and suggestions would be great."
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The French Defense. A very solid system for black. Black usually concedes space early in the game, and also voluntarily blocks the c8 bishop. In many games this bishop becomes a problem to develop, but black's plan is usually to initiate a queenside attack, or to trade off into an endgame, when black's pawn structure would grant him an advantage. White opts to keep black cramped and avoid simplification (unless it favors him, of course)."

6,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2pp4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"? This move is statistically bad for black. As long as white doesn't make mistakes, it is a won game. Black chooses to undermine the center without realizing that he will lose material. It may possibly be used as a gambit, but it is one that doesn't offer black any sort of compensation. It could have been just a mistake on the player's part, but given that he must have played this system and has won some games, that may unlikely be the case."
