1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is my preferred opening move for White, since it opens up diagonals for my Queen and King's Bishop, while staking a claim on the centre with the pawn."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I haven't played many chess games yet, so I was surprised to see Black respond with d5."
3,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Not taking the d-pawn would allow Black to advance it further, reducing the space white has control of."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,Black is in no hurry to get the pawn back. He decides to further develop his pieces.
5,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/2P5/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"Since I hadn't seen this opening before, I had to think awhile before coming up with this answer. I was willing to give up the d5 pawn, but since it hasn't been taken yet, I decided to make use of it to grab as much space as possible. I initially thought of 3. Nc3, but after 3. ... Nxd6 4. Nxd6 Qxd6, Black's queen has control of the centre and White has no options left to chase it away."
6,c6,c7c6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3P4/2P5/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,I was later to learn that this opening is the Scandinavian gambit.
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3P4/2P5/2N5/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,"4. dxc6 was possible, but after 4. ... Nxc6, Black would have 2 knights developed and his queen has a semi-open file. I went with Nc3 to develop my knight instead of going for the material advantage."

9,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"I still wasn't prepared to exchange the pawns and knights yet, so I went with 5. d4 to prevent 5. ... d4."
10,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,"Bring his other knight into play and putting pressure on the d4 pawn, with possible Nb4 in the future."

12,e6,e7e6,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"Extra protection for his d5 pawn, and allows the bishop at f8 to come out."
13,cxd5,c4d5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/3P4/3P4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"I wanted to settle the situation in the centre before moving my bishops, so I was trying to decide between c5 or cxd5. However, I didn't try c5 because I didn't like the look of b6."
