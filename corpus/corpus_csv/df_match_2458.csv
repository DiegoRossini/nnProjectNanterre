Aron Niemzowitsch in the 1920's, Salo Flohr in the 1930's, World Champions Tigran Petrosyan and Vassili Smyslov in the 1950's and 1960's, and in the 1980's Kasparov's predecessor as champion, Anatoli Karpov, have all made use of it. The idea is to develop the KN at KB3 and be able to reply to NxN with... NxN, thus preserving the Black pawn structure."

(After-match analysis by Mr. Pandolfini) Why *did* Kasparov lose? Surely, he was enervated. Most authorities believe that Garri simply wore himself out. He got advantageous positions but exhausted himself in the process, working out the intricacies of unfamiliar lines. After five of these intense struggles, over a mere eight days, Kasparov had nothing left for the fateful sixth game. -- BP [My own hypothesis is that Kasparov's spirit was broken by game 5. He had what seemed a sure win stolen away when Deep Blue came up with an astonishing perpetual check after Kasparov queened a pawn in the endgame. Kasparov then had zero days rest in between Games 5 and 6, and was still in psychological shock. If he'd had a day off to regain his mental equilibrium, we might well have seen a much sharper Garri Kasparov in the decisive 6th game. -- LA]"
