1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"It's often nerve-wracking to play someone rated so much lower than you -- because you're expected to win; yet you both start off equal, and the higher-rated person is expected to make something happen!"
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Pretty much standard for me and many other gameknot players, although many people prefer the sicilian defense (1. ... c5), the french defense (1. ... e6 followed by 2. ... d5), the caro-kann (1. ... c6 followed by 2. ... d5), or the pirc defense (1. ... d6 followed by g6, Nf6 and Bg7).  All of these variants are sound, and choosing one is merely a matter of taste."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"The best move, in my opinion, as it develops a piece and threatens black's pawn on e5."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"The most logical response, defending the e5 pawn and also developing.  White has a lot of choices now, from 3. Nf3 to 3. Bc4 (the italian game) to 3. Bb5 (the ruy lopez).  What will he choose?"
5,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,The italian game it is.
6,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,"Solid, and daring white to play (his choice) of the evans gambit, the guioco piano, or a different variation. The alternative is for black to play Nf6, which usually leads to white playing 4. Ng5!?, which is the speculative fried liver attack."
7,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 5 4,"More common is either 4. b4 (the evans gambit) or 4. c3 (preparing d4, guioco piano, which means quiet game, although it's often anything but) -- either way, castling is okay, just not as aggressive as either of those."
8,d6,d7d6,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 5,"Opening the c8-h3 diagonal for the bishop to develop.  I didn't want to commit to Nf6 yet, as threatening the pin Bg4 may be more important right now."
9,d4,d2d4,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/2b1p3/2BPP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 5,"?  This opens lines for white, but does this really favor him?  Sure, his Bc1 is now free and his Bc4 isn't trapped outsite the pawn chain as it would be after 5. d3, but this just gives black the d-pawn for free."
10,Nxd4,c6d4,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3p4/2b1p3/2BnP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 6,"My preferred recapture, as I'd rather have undoubled pawns and a bishop instead of a knight here."
11,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3p4/2b1p3/2BNP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 6,White chooses to exchange pieces.
12,Bxd4,c5d4,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/2BbP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,"Again, keeping the pawns undoubled."
13,Bb5+,c4b5,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3p4/1B2p3/3bP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 7,"?  While a check is nice here, this is white's only developed piece -- why move it twice in the opening?  Furthermore, after black's most logical response (7. ... c6, which also supports an eventual d5 push), white must move the bishop a *third* time in the opening."
14,c6,c7c6,r1bqk1nr/pp3ppp/2pp4/1B2p3/3bP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,Forcing the bishop to move again.
15,Bd3,b5d3,r1bqk1nr/pp3ppp/2pp4/4p3/3bP3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 8,"This works out alright, as it anticipates 8. ... Nf6 and defends the e4 pawn.  White is down a pawn and now it's black's move -- black definitely has the edge now."
16,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2pp1n2/4p3/3bP3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 9,"Now that Bg4 is ineffective (there's no knight on f3 to pin) and f5 is a bad move (with the pawn on e4 in a battery with the Bd3), Nf6 is logical, simple development."
17,Qd2,d1d2,r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2pp1n2/4p3/3bP3/3B4/PPPQ1PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 3 9,"I had kind of hoped for Bg5 (allowing Bxb2), so I had to think about this move for white.  It ""develops"" the queen, but this is to a bad square, since it blocks the bishop in, and the queen doesn't do much more on d2 than it was doing on d1.  More reasonable would've been c3, which kicks the Bd4 back onto black's side of the board."
18,d5,d6d5,r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2p2n2/3pp3/3bP3/3B4/PPPQ1PPP/RNB2RK1 w kq - 0 10,"I decide that it's time to take over the center; after 10. exd5 cxd5, white has nothing in the center."
19,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2p2n2/3pp3/3bP3/2NB4/PPPQ1PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 1 10,"Consistent, but white has to be careful.  Black has much more central control than white, and although challenging the center is a good idea, it may be too late, as these pieces may just get rolled up.

A better plan for white, last move, might have been 9. c3 followed by Bg5 and Nd2.  Qd2 really wound up hampering white's development!"
20,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2p2n2/3pp3/3bP3/2NB4/PPPQ1PPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 2 11,"I was antsy to take over the center -- but had to secure my king first.  This also allows me to bring my rook over to the center, where the action's going to occur."
