1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

My brave opponent decided to try out the Allgaier Gambit against me.  This involved sacrificing a piece to get Henry out into the open and then get at him.  Unfortunately for him, Henry was able to run for cover and I was able to run away with my extra piece in the endgame.  My opponent thought this was too much and decided to wave the white flag.  So, how did this happen?  Firstly I will provide the link that Gameknot Analysis has given to help you through this game.  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17272114&fb=1&rnd=0.2644588537214342.  We start with a double KP opening 1.e4 and I respond with e5 and he gives me the KG with 2.f4 of which I accept."
