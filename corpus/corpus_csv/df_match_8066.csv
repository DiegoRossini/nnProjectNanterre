1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I chose this game to demonstrate that while many lines in the Philidor are equal, they contain quite a bit of tension, besides being pretty unbalanced."
2,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,One of two possible move orders to reach the Philidor Defence. This move order is known as the Philidor Hanham and I favour it over the classical move order with 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d6 because of the interesting and often fairly sharp lines with f4 or g4.
