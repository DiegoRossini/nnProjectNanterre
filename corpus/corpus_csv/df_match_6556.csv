1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Where did I go wrong? Here I am losing to a talented youngster. Black sacrifices a pawn soon after the opening. In a queen-less middle game it looks like black has not enough for the pawn. Yet gradually he out-plays white. The computer analysis by Gameknot also shows white having an advantage and it gradually slipping to black. Yet the computer makes no suggestions for improvements for white. So where did white go wrong? Is the claim that white was better faulty? Play it through with me dear reader, and see if you can solve my mystery, or, if you prefer, just enjoy a good game!"

The rook is coming from f8 to c8 and so if white plays Bh6, black is not forced to exchange the valuable black square bishop, which is a key defender of the black king. Furthermore the black queen on a5 and rook on c8 can start to pile up the pressure on the white king. Black can sometimes sacrifice on c3."

However the gameknot computer claims it is a mistake. It suggests Nc4 13. Bxc4, as equal, which is the main line, and gives b5 13. Ncxb5 Qxd2 14. Bxd2 Nc4 15. Nc3 Nxe4 16. Nxe4 Bxd4 17. Bg5 Be5 18. Bxc4 Rxc4 19. Bxe7 as leading to a better position for white. However I think it is quite sensible for black to sacrifice a pawn to distract white from the king side attack."
