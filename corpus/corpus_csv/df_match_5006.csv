1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,My favorite opening; the Sicilian Defence. I am rather disappointed that the next move does not comply with any variation of this opening.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,My favorite opening; the Sicilian Defence. I am rather disappointed that the next move does not comply with any variation of this opening.
3,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,"I am not sure what I was thinking with this move. Maybe I was trying to prevent 2...c4, which Black would never do. This is a critical mistake in an opening in my opinion."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 3,"Black was expecting 3.d4, a very sorrowful mistake. Better safe than sorry because as White, I would never think of playing that move."
5,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 3 3,"Black observed this move for a while, and he probably realized that I put a third attacker for d5. Black, apparently, had a mind of his own."
6,e5,e7e5,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n5/2p1p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 4,This game is really out of control. Both me and my opponent were trying to take over the middle d squares.

8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/2p1p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,Black looks like he is lagging in the opening a bit.
9,Bd5,c4d5,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/2pBp3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 5,"I am not sure whether I, if I wanted a piece on d5, should have done 5.Nd5, or this move. Maybe I should have forgotten about the d5 square and instead play 5.d3."
10,Nd4,c6d4,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/5n2/2pBp3/3nP3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 4 6,"Breakthrough for Black, but not accurate enough."
