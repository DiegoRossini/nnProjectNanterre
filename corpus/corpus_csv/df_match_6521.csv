16,Bb7,c8b7,r3kb1r/pbp2ppp/2q2n2/4p1N1/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 9,"Don't know if this theoretically the best move, but it sure looks dangerous for White!"

22,g4,g5g4,r3kb1r/pbp2p2/2q2n2/4p2p/3P2p1/5N1P/PPP2PP1/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 12,I had thought long about my next move. Capturing his knight with 12. ... gxf3 looks better for White on account of 13. exf6 gxf2 14. Te1+ and I have to give up my dark-squared-bishop to avoid mate. Then my king is in greater danger while my attack is blunted by my own pawn! I had to find a way to keep the e-file closed while also being able to remove my king from danger which is impossible at the moment because White's Queen guards the d-file. That's why I played the next move.

27,Ne1,f3e1,r3kb1r/pbpn1p2/2q5/4P3/6p1/8/PPP2PP1/RNBQNRK1 b kq - 1 14,Forced. Other moves lose the knight or the king.

33,Kxh1,g1h1,r3k3/pbpn1p2/2q5/2b1P3/8/6P1/PPP2RP1/RNBQN2K b q - 0 17,Threatening mate on g2 due  to the knight being attacked. The poor horse has to return to f3.

39,Nf3,h4f3,2kr4/pbpn1p2/2q5/4P3/8/5Nb1/PPP3P1/RNBQ3K b - - 1 20,The knight has to return.
40,Nxe5,d7e5,2kr4/pbp2p2/2q5/4n3/8/5Nb1/PPP3P1/RNBQ3K w - - 0 21,Attacking both the knight and the queen. Funny to see how White's queenside is still undeveloped.
