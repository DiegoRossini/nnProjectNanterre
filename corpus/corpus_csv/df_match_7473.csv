1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I've decided to try to actually learn something about the game through effort rather than osmosis, and the first step is going to be looking at my own games."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"After 2. ...e7-e6 I am still looking for the gambit rather than playing 3. e2-e3, so this allows for variation later."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"After 2. ...e7-e6 I am still looking for the gambit rather than playing 3. e2-e3, so this allows for variation later."

5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"After 2. ...e7-e6 I am still looking for the gambit rather than playing 3. e2-e3, so this allows for variation later."
6,h6,h7h6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/4p2p/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Premature; developing a Knight here instead of guarding a non-existent threat would be better.  Or at least if you're that worried about the Bishop on c1, then 3. ...f8-e7 is maybe better."
7,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/4p2p/3p4/2PP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,In retrospect I prefer 4. g1-f3 here as it develops the piece while Black was clearly playing to the King's-side and would leave the QBP alone.  However at the time I read the early h7-h6 as securing the King's-side in preparation for a Queen's-side game (which I still think was Black's better option).
8,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp3pp1/2p1p2p/3p4/2PP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"A rather hastily set-up Caro-Kann emerges, with no development to keep it alive.  I was expecting 4. ...f8-b4 first to put pressure on, although it wouldn't damage the position."
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp3pp1/2p1p2p/3p4/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"With one pawn already guarding g5, this is just superfluous (and again, f8-e7 makes more sense, as would 5. ...g8-f6 to develop pieces)."
10,f6,f7f6,rnbqkbnr/pp4p1/2p1pp1p/3p4/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"With one pawn already guarding g5, this is just superfluous (and again, f8-e7 makes more sense, as would 5. ...g8-f6 to develop pieces)."
11,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqkbnr/pp4p1/2p1pp1p/3p4/2PP4/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"Preparing to castle while developing.  Given that Black had put up absolutely no threats and was pawn-rolling, I expected to take this one into-the mid game and win easily."
12,Ne7,g8e7,rnbqkb1r/pp2n1p1/2p1pp1p/3p4/2PP4/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 7,"I'm not sure where this Knight was going.  Once again I prefer f8-e7 here, with possible continuation 7. 0-0 f6-f5 8. f3-e5 g8-f6.  As soon as the Knight on f3 moves h5 will be open to White's Queen."

I'm not sure if that's always true, but with the Queen threat present here thanks to Black's advanced pawns and no development, I was all for it."
