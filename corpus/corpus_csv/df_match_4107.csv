2,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"My opponent replies with the Nimzovich Defence, which is seldom seen compared to the king's pawn game, the sicilian or the french defence."

6,Rb8,a8b8,1rbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3pP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQk - 1 4,!? Black throws the opening book out of the window with this move. He either prepares a future b7-b5 push or places his rook on a open file in case I would play Bb5 followed by Bxc6 later I guess. It is not a bad move by any means. More commonly played is 3...Bf5.
7,Nf3,g1f3,1rbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3pP3/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQk - 2 4,"Black tries to expand to the kingside, I guess."

18,Nh6,g8h6,1rbq1b1r/ppp1p1p1/2nkP1Qn/3p2Np/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RN2KB1R w KQ - 1 10,"!! The position is very critical. Take a look at the position. Which black pieces can move? Which one can't? The kingside has been completely shut down; The h6 knight can't move or else I play 11.Nf7#, the f8 bishop is stuck behind two black which are themselves blocked by my pieces, The h8 rook CAN move! To g8 and h8 back and forth, accomplishing absolutely nothing. What about the queenside? The black queen can't move without being captured next turn, the c8 bishop can't go anywhere (10...Bxe6?? 11.Qxe6#), the b8 rook isn't doing much (but is better than his kingside counterpart) and the king is stuck on d6. The only available moves that help are moving the a pawn, the b pawn, or the knight. I didn't want the knight to capture on d4, thus it is why I played 10.c3. The main question here is: Can Black get out of trouble safely? What do you think, reader?"

Better here according to the engine was 11.Nd2 leading to 11...Na5 12. Ndf3 Kc6 13. Ne5+ Kb6 14. Ngf7 Nxf7 15. Nxf7 Qe8 16. Nxh8 Qxg6 17. Nxg6 Bxe6 18.
