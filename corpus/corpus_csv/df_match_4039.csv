Problem is Black has the option 6...e5 7. Nb3 Qb6 or simply 6....Qb6 Whites response 7.g4 Nc6 8.Nb3 e6 9.Qe2 Qc7 10.Be3 b5 11.0-0-0 Bb7 12 h4 Rc8 this variation follows the lines of a Najdorf defence versus English Attack"

a4 is recommended in some books, or with Q on d2 to ignore it and after Black b4 (if ever) Na4 if necessary."
