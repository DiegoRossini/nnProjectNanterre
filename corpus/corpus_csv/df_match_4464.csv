I have no theoretical knowledge of that opening, but I keep hearing it's drawish in the highest level. That has nothing to do with my games, though. Why should I play like my opponent wants me to and defend for a long time? Then he would be in his element and I would be struggling. 

So, from a psychological point of view, I deceided to sacrifice a pawn of my own for an attack or force a closed type of system, both of which seemed to take the attacking Marshall Attack player out of his comfort zone."
