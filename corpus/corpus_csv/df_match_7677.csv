1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Well, I never, when I played Expert Jim as black I found myself with a rook against 2 pieces and lost.  Here I played Expert Jim as white and again found myself with a rook against two pieces and again I lost.  Another piece of evidence for the jury that having the rook against two pieces loses, loses, loses!  It is an e4, e5 themed mini-tournament so that is how the game kicks off.  On my third move I deviate from the Lopez, last time I played the Exchange Lopez against Jim I lost so I try The Three Knights Opening with 3. Nc3."
