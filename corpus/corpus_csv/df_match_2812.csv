5,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/p2ppppp/2p5/1p6/3PPB2/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"Just waiting for Qa5+, c3, b4, Qc2, etc., being a ""naive"" attack I can handle."
6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/p2p1ppp/2p1p3/1p6/3PPB2/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"No pieces out for black at this point, and leaving the black squares so unprotected, is weird, but I cannot say I see how to take advantage from the weakness so promptly."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/p2p1ppp/2p1p3/1p6/3PPB2/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"Wonderful, black underestimates the dangers of retarded piece developement."

What would have been your choice? Black has to take material back (at least a pawn, but which and how?), he has to decide if he likes or not the queen's exchange..."

27,h5,h4h5,rn2kb1r/p4p2/2ppbq2/1p4pP/4P3/5PB1/PPPN4/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 14,"I didn't see it, but still I considered safe to avoid more complications, and solve once for all the h4 question. I decided I wouldn't care for qxb2. It just will distract the black queen from the action, and I would have started with Nb3, threatening Bxd6."
