1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,My Endgame pledges me once again after this game.  Something I need to work on.  Though this lead to a very complex endgame that only favored white slightly.  Feels nice competing on a equal level up till move 29. still wish this could have been a win.  Great game well played dilly. Those interested in the analysis of the game here it is http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15301496&rnd=0.0028041210025548935
