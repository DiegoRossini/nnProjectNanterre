9,h3,h2h3,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/3pp3/2PP2b1/4PN1P/PP3PP1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,5. ... Bf5 6. Nxe5 winning a pawn

11,Qxf3,d1f3,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/3pp3/2PP4/4PQ1P/PP3PP1/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 6,I'm not sure about this move. It does push my Queen back and locks up my pawns but I felt it weakened Black's middle. Perhaps I'm incorrect.
12,e4,e5e4,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/3p4/2PPp3/4PQ1P/PP3PP1/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 7,I'm not sure about this move. It does push my Queen back and locks up my pawns but I felt it weakened Black's middle. Perhaps I'm incorrect.
13,Qd1,f3d1,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/3p4/2PPp3/4P2P/PP3PP1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 7,Black has a slight developmental advantage now but has lost the light squared Bishop
14,Bb4+,f8b4,r2qk1nr/ppp2ppp/2n5/3p4/1bPPp3/4P2P/PP3PP1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 8,I wanted to keep open the possibility of the Bishop pair and did not play 8. Bd2 offering an exchange.

16,dxc4,d5c4,r2qk1nr/ppp2ppp/2n5/8/1bpPp3/2N1P2P/PP3PP1/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 9,Generally in the Queen's Gambit Declined it is best not to take this pawn before White moves the Bishop to d3. I gain back my Tempo lost by retreating the Queen and develop a piece into a strong position now that Black's only central pawn is pushed forward
17,Bxc4,f1c4,r2qk1nr/ppp2ppp/2n5/8/1bBPp3/2N1P2P/PP3PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 9,I'm again not sure about this move. It does setup a longside castle but Black eventually makes a kingside castle. The Queen does support the forward e-pawn in the case of 11. Qc2 but 10. ... 0-0 11. Qc2 Re8 does as well
18,Nf6,g8f6,r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/8/1bBPp3/2N1P2P/PP3PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 10,I'm again not sure about this move. It does setup a longside castle but Black eventually makes a kingside castle. The Queen does support the forward e-pawn in the case of 11. Qc2 but 10. ... 0-0 11. Qc2 Re8 does as well

20,Qe7,d8e7,r3k2r/ppp1qppp/2n2n2/8/1bBPp3/2N1P2P/PP3PP1/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 3 11,I'm again not sure about this move. It does setup a longside castle but Black eventually makes a kingside castle. The Queen does support the forward e-pawn in the case of 11. Qc2 but 10. ... 0-0 11. Qc2 Re8 does as well

22,Bxc3,b4c3,r3k2r/ppp1qppp/2n2n2/8/2BPp3/P1b1P2P/1P3PP1/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 12,This gives me the Bishop pair and further fortifies the d-pawn. I thought 11. ... Bd6 was probably better
23,bxc3,b2c3,r3k2r/ppp1qppp/2n2n2/8/2BPp3/P1P1P2P/5PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 12,Preventing my Bishop from getting to the b5 square and eventually taking the Knight and doubling Black's pawns. I wasn't particularly interested in such a minor gain for the loss of my Bishop pair and think this was a further waste of time.
