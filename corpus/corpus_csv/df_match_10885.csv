2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,My opponent chooses ...e6 before ...c6 in order to take back ...exd5 if I exchange.  However if he plans to play e6 and c6 this order gives him less flexibility with his c8 bishop.

5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"This move indicates my aggresive intent, more common is e3 which can be exciting but this move leads to much more interesting complications in my eyes.  The pin on f6 is the most important part of my position."
6,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"This move indicates my aggresive intent, more common is e3 which can be exciting but this move leads to much more interesting complications in my eyes.  The pin on f6 is the most important part of my position."

15,Bh4,g5h4,rnbqkb1r/p4pp1/2p1pn1p/1p2P3/2pP3B/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 8,"The pin is the key to my whole position and it's the reason I gave up the pawn on c4, if I exchange my bishop then I lose all my pressure, and thus I retreat and keep the pin alive."
16,g5,g7g5,rnbqkb1r/p4p2/2p1pn1p/1p2P1p1/2pP3B/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 9,Black tries to break the pin and save his knight.
17,Nxg5,f3g5,rnbqkb1r/p4p2/2p1pn1p/1p2P1N1/2pP3B/2N5/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 9,What's the most important part of my position?  It's the pin on the f6 knight.  I have to keep it alive and I'm willing to give up my f3 knight to keep the pin and eventually win his knight on f6.
18,Nd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/p4p2/2p1p2p/1p1nP1N1/2pP3B/2N5/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 10,"9... Nd5!?  While 9... hxg5 is the most common move in this position, this move is reasonable if black is willing to sacrifice.  Black tries to get rid of the pin by getting the knight out of there when he has the chance, however this puts the queen in the line of fire."
19,Nxf7,g5f7,rnbqkb1r/p4N2/2p1p2p/1p1nP3/2pP3B/2N5/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 10,"I, white, take up the challenge, 10.Nf3 defending the bishop is probably fine for white, black is active and has pressure after 10... Qa5 but is covered with weaknesses.  This move makes the black king look a lot weaker as he's lost his f and g pawns.  Oh yeah, and I also pick up the exchange."
20,Qxh4,d8h4,rnb1kb1r/p4N2/2p1p2p/1p1nP3/2pP3q/2N5/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 11,Forced

22,Bb4,f8b4,rnb1k2N/p7/2p1p2p/1p1nP3/1bpP3q/2N5/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQq - 1 12,"This move is the most active, and I think it's probably best as black must play actively.  He's down material and must create as much pressure as possible, either the lack of an f and g pawn gives him weaknesses OR he can use them as open files, also his advanced pawns will be weak OR they can be used to attack with.  In this game he tries to activate, but doesn't get enough.  Maybe black doesn't have enough for the rook?"
23,Rc1,a1c1,rnb1k2N/p7/2p1p2p/1p1nP3/1bpP3q/2N5/PP3PPP/2RQKB1R b Kq - 2 12,I cover knight before trying to exploit his problems.

26,Bb7,c8b7,r3k2N/pb1n4/2p1p2p/1p1nP3/1bpP3q/2N5/PP2BPPP/2RQK2R w Kq - 5 14,Black ignores the threats for the sake of finishing development and creating pressure.
27,Bh5+,e2h5,r3k2N/pb1n4/2p1p2p/1p1nP2B/1bpP3q/2N5/PP3PPP/2RQK2R b Kq - 6 14,"I go full tilt for my attack, as he goes full tilt for his."
28,Kd8,e8d8,r2k3N/pb1n4/2p1p2p/1p1nP2B/1bpP3q/2N5/PP3PPP/2RQK2R w K - 7 15,"Ke7 or Kf8 loses his his queen to Ng6 !  However, either way my knight is coming out and it's going to enter the attack."
29,Nf7+,h8f7,r2k4/pb1n1N2/2p1p2p/1p1nP2B/1bpP3q/2N5/PP3PPP/2RQK2R b K - 8 15,What else?
