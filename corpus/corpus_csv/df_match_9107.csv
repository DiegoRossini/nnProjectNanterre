Bd3, when the WB interferes with the Q's defence of d4, though at the moment I have enough defending d4 anyway.  One of the advantages of Nimzowitsch's theory of over-protection is that it provides mobility to each of the defenders: they can move without leaving their charge defenceless.  So, given the choice, I prefer not to interfere with the d pawn's defence.  Also, the Be2 protects the Nf3 in the event the f-pawns come off."

What I don't like about the move is that it condemns the B to a pawn's role for much of the game, its main duty being to blockade the potential monster on d5 and prevent discovered attacks by Black's Bb7.  What I like about the move s that is puts the B on the long black diagonal, pointing at the squares around Black's K, if I can free my e pawn by getting rid of Black's e pawn."
