1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"White mishandled the opening, which at some point I considered drawish, probably he wanted more from it and overreached, White's 11.Bxd4?! kept two permanent weak pawns on white's field, and allowed me to complete my development with tempo, also 13.Bxg7?! was also dubious as it opened the d column with his king still in the center uncastled... I profited from white's king misplacement and tried some tactics but only got to exchange B+R for Queen which eventually brought me the win because two pieces are easier to coordinate than three and white's pawn weaknesses offered several attack objectives, I just had to pick them one after another..."
