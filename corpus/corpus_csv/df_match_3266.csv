1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was definitely a game of two halves as they say. It all started reasonably well then after around 20 moves everything fell apart. I think I learnt a lot from this game but would still be interested to see comments and thoughts.

Analysis is also available at http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=18461988&rnd=0.7610093399416655"
