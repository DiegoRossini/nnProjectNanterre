2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,So does he.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,I do my usual.
4,e5,e7e5,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,And he plays the Budapest again.
5,dxe5,d4e5,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4P3/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,I take.
6,Ng4,f6g4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/2P3n1/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,He plays the same variation.
7,e4,e2e4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/2P1P1n1/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,I continue following our earlier game.

9,h3,h2h3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1pp1/8/4P2p/2P1P1n1/7P/PP3PP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,I continue with the note from my annotation.
10,Nxe5,g4e5,rnbqkb1r/pppp1pp1/8/4n2p/2P1P3/7P/PP3PP1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"This seems best for black. Now I was originally going to continue with 5. f2-f4, but I realised that in that position Qd8-h4 check is very strong for him. However I though so what? I can develop a little and then play it at a later stage."
11,Be3,c1e3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1pp1/8/4n2p/2P1P3/4B2P/PP3PP1/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 6,So I continue my development.
12,Bb4+,f8b4,rnbqk2r/pppp1pp1/8/4n2p/1bP1P3/4B2P/PP3PP1/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 2 7,He throws in a Bishop check.
13,Nd2,b1d2,rnbqk2r/pppp1pp1/8/4n2p/1bP1P3/4B2P/PP1N1PP1/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 3 7,"I block in such a way that he can't destroy my pawn formation with by taking my knight, which he could have done if I'd played Nc3."
14,Qe7,d8e7,rnb1k2r/ppppqpp1/8/4n2p/1bP1P3/4B2P/PP1N1PP1/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 4 8,I think this is wrong. I think the trust h7-h5 more or less means black has to castle on the queen side. As such he should be developing his queen side pieces and preparing to castle queen side.
15,a3,a2a3,rnb1k2r/ppppqpp1/8/4n2p/1bP1P3/P3B2P/1P1N1PP1/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 8,So I hit the bishop.
