1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

In this game my opponent transposes the Ruy Lopez into the Fried Liver Attack.  This type of attack will lure Henry onto e6 before he has time to tuck himself away on the kingside.  Somehow he manages it.  White proceeds with his attack but leaves a vital pawn undefended.  This ushers in our familiar Chessic Grim Reaper, Old Matey.  White had no escape.  So, how did it happen?  Well read on or look at the Gameknot Analysis below. http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=25632898&fb=1&rnd=0.5978942071417577"
