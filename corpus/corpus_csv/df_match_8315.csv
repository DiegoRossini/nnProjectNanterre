1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"After a good opening - followed by a silly mistake which cost me a pawn - I continued to push my opponents  pieces back until he had no room for maneuver. The end game is very interesting - because our forces are nearly equal and I barely managed to find a way to promote a pawn while preventing black from doing the same.    

This is still a flawed game - but is conducted in an interestingly aggressive way by white."
