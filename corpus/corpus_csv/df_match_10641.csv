1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"1.d4 is usually slower than 1.e4 but it gives white much more opportunity for a lasting initiative and it is suitable for players who like to play slow positional games with semi closed pawn structure in the center. If I play with white pieces I always play with 1.e4 and try to open up the center by pawn exchanges in order to make the game explode tactically. I usually avoid a closed center because it is boring to me and I don't feel quite comfortable 
with it. In this game I'll try to open up the center as soon as possible and seize the initiative in the right moment."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I usually prefer this move to 1...Nf6 which leads to Indian lines of defense. 1...d5 is the immediate challenge of the center which usually leads to the Queen's Gambit, Slav-defense or Catalan opening"
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"this move usually leads to the Colle system which is a slow and boring game, or a transposition to the queen's gambit. White is trying to develop his kingside as soon as possible and to castle on the kingside."
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"This is a very flexible move. It protects my very important d-pawn and opens a3-f8 diagonal for my dark square bishop. Although it shuts the h3-c8 diagonal for my light square bishop, but as you will see black usually doesn't need this diagonal for the bishop in this structure."
5,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p2B1/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"This move has been pioneered by Emanuel Lasker. White's idea is to play e3 and to have no problems with developing his dark square bishop. The bishop could be tickled immediately by playing f6, but f6 is not a very good idea because my knight will lose his best square and h4-d8 diagonal will be closed to my queen. Also after playing f6 white will be in a great lead in development and will maintain the initiative for a long time."
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p2B1/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,"This is the most preferred move by opening books. Although it is a self pin, but black's queen won't stay on d8 for long. The most important thing is that my knight cannot be attacked by any other white piece for a long time, so this is not a really painful pin."
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p2B1/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 3 4,"This move was a surprise to me. Obviously white's best move here was to play c4 and challenge my strong central pawn. If White had played 4.c4 then, after 4...c6 4.Nc3 dxc4!? 5.e4 b5 6.e5 h6 the game would be transposed to a form of queen's gambit called the Botvinnik System; which is one of the sharpest modern openings and leads to an unbalanced and very dynamic game."
8,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp2B1/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"A very important move! Now I can exchange my side pawn with white's central pawn. Also my queen now is free and can come into the game in the right moment. Now, I'm planning to put my queen on a5 and exploiting the pin by playing Ne4. This plan is similar to black's plan in the Cambridge Springs Variation of the Queenâ€™s Gambit Declined. If black can execute this plan, he will equalize in an early stage of the game and will seize the initiative from white very soon."
9,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp2B1/3P4/2N1PN2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,This is the most reasonable reply. White protects his d-pawn and opens a diagonal for his light square bishop.
10,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/3p2B1/3p4/2N1PN2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Black exchanges his flank pawn with white's central one, a good positional achievement!"
11,Bb5+,f1b5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/1B1p2B1/3p4/2N1PN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 6,An in-between move. I don't like this move for white because it forces exchange of light square bishops and this is completely favorable for black. So I can put a question mark to this move and consider it a strategic mistake. I think it was better for white to take on d4 with his e-pawn and develop his bishop on e2 or d3.
12,Bd7,c8d7,rn1qkb1r/pp1b1ppp/4pn2/1B1p2B1/3p4/2N1PN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 7,White is forced to exchange bishops. otherwise he will lose a knight.
13,exd4,e3d4,rn1qkb1r/pp1b1ppp/4pn2/1B1p2B1/3P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 7,"hmmm... Not the best move I think! When you play with white pieces it is very important to play actively and to retain the initiative. 
White's initiative is fading by this move and black is almost equalized. 
It was much better for white to first take the bishop on d7 and then 
take on d4. These slight differences may not look very important in the 
first view; but these differences in fact can play a huge role in the nature 
of the game's continuation. 
Now I am out of opening book and I should plan for the middlegame. My first objective is to seize white's initiative. If I take White's bishop he has to retake with the knight and then I consider playing Qa5  forcing white to play the reactive Nc3. Then I can put a huge pressure on e1-a5 diagonal by playing Bb4 and white is now has to make just a defensive moves. Also I want to bring my king into a safe home, then try to open up the center and deny white's king from castling. If I succeed in keeping my opponent's king in the center then I can attack him relentlessly!"

17,Nc3,b5c3,rn2kb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/q2p2B1/3P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 2 9,"Now I am attacking white. I could continue my attack aggressively by playing Ne4?!, but I first have to consider the fact that I have problems with my development. My king is still sitting in the middle of the board and my pieces haven't fully developed yet. If I had played 10...Ne4 then after 11.Nxe4 dxe4 12.Ne5! Bxd2  13.Qxd2 Qxd2  14.Kxd2 I can claim that white is much better. Black can't attack any longer and his pawn on e4 is so vulnerable. Also White has got a fantastic outpost for his knight on e5. So I had to play a little patiently!

20,O-O,e8g8,rn3rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/q2p4/1b1P4/2N2N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 5 11,This move proves that white is in a deep problem. I think this moment was white's best chance to castle and to improve his game a little.

23,Bxc3,d2c3,rn3rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/q2p4/3P4/P1B2N2/1PP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 12,Now white's king is denied from castling. My game is improving with every move and now I have to complete my development and to go after my opponent's king!

25,Ne5,f3e5,rn3rk1/pp3ppp/q3pn2/3pN3/3P4/P1B5/1PP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 2 13,I think white's best try was to play 13.Bd2 and then after 13...Nbd7 14.c3 Ne4 15.Qe2 Qb6 16.Bf4 white stands well. White may think of playing Nd3 in order to close a7-f1 diagonal to my queen but after 13...Rc8 14.Nd3 Ne4 15.Bd2 Qc4! 16.Rc1 Nxd2 17.Qxd2 Qxd4 black is up a pawn with a great position and will win the game very quickly.
