2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Vidmar's Opening, a quieter choice than the Queen's Gambit (2. c4). It is usually chosen by players aiming for the Stonewall system (the system played in this game, with the further moves Bd3, f4 and c3). White aims to set up a solid position from which to launch an attack, without directly challenging Black in the centre early in the game."

The hole on e4 is apparent, but for now is covered by the bishop on d3. Still, it is a long-term disadvantage, and one reason why the Stonewall is seldom seen in master-level games."

Better is 12... c5! and if White captures, Black regains a pawn on e5, and White must then choose between two evils -- if he plays b4, c3 is vulnerable, but if he does not, c5 is hard to defend. Black's earlier moves to a6 and b5 left the c-pawn backward, so it was inevitable that if Black's queenside counterattack was ever to come to anything, this pawn would have to cross the c5 square undefended. Moving it to c6 first wastes a tempo."

This looks like a developing move, but in fact this bishop's job is entirely centred around the c1-h6 diagonal, and it could have stayed on its home square.
