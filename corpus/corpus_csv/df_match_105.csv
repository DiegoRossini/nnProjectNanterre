2,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,Here's yet another nimso annotation hehe. This game gets quite hectic real fast. But the ending is worth keeping.
3,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Strongest reply
4,d5,d7d5,r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Preferred d5. We all got our playstyles :)
5,exd5,e4d5,r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3P4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"Ooooooo , takes and not advance, we are gonna have some exchanges this game it looks like"
6,Qxd5,d8d5,r1b1kbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3q4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Recapture
7,Nf3,g1f3,r1b1kbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3q4/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,Going nc3 right away can allow Queen takes pawn for a Wiley game or forces a queen retreat
8,Bg4,c8g4,r3kbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3q4/3P2b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,Pin+development
9,Nc3,b1c3,r3kbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3q4/3P2b1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 5,"Nc3 now forces a queen retreat, gaining some development tempo"
10,Qe6+,d5e6,r3kbnr/ppp1pppp/2n1q3/8/3P2b1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 4 6,But I'm a gambler at heart! queen check! For the players who don't like tangled positions or don't want to risk a queen trade here. Retreating the queen back to d8 is playable
11,Be3,c1e3,r3kbnr/ppp1pppp/2n1q3/8/3P2b1/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 5 6,It is best for white to block with queen here. Allowing him to develop lsb when black exchanges queens. As for me I love the games where opponent blocks with a piece.
12,Bxf3,g4f3,r3kbnr/ppp1pppp/2n1q3/8/3P4/2N1Bb2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,Exchange to double pawn him or gain the d4 pawn if he recaptures with queen.
13,gxf3,g2f3,r3kbnr/ppp1pppp/2n1q3/8/3P4/2N1BP2/PPP2P1P/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,Opponent chooses double pawn.
14,Qf5,e6f5,r3kbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/5q2/3P4/2N1BP2/PPP2P1P/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,I reposition my queen to allow my e pawn some movement room
15,Bd3,f1d3,r3kbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/5q2/3P4/2NBBP2/PPP2P1P/R2QK2R b KQkq - 2 8,Maybe I could've chosen a better square. His bishop develops with tempo on my queen.
16,Qh5,f5h5,r3kbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/7q/3P4/2NBBP2/PPP2P1P/R2QK2R w KQkq - 3 9,Maybe queen d7 was better. But I wanted my queen to be out still and have diagonals to the queen side. Was anticipating him to castle queen side.
17,Qe2,d1e2,r3kbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/7q/3P4/2NBBP2/PPP1QP1P/R3K2R b KQkq - 4 9,Opponent heads towards queen side castling. He's way more developed than me. But his structure makes it a bit easier to anticipate his moves.
18,e6,e7e6,r3kbnr/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/7q/3P4/2NBBP2/PPP1QP1P/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 10,Told myself I can wait until he plays his Knight to b5 to castle. Until then it's time to bring my other pieces out.
19,O-O-O,e1c1,r3kbnr/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/7q/3P4/2NBBP2/PPP1QP1P/2KR3R b kq - 1 10,And so after his castle my dsb development he plays the Knight to b5 and I go with my castle.
20,Bb4,f8b4,r3k1nr/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/7q/1b1P4/2NBBP2/PPP1QP1P/2KR3R w kq - 2 11,And so after his castle my dsb development he plays the Knight to b5 and I go with my castle.
21,Nb5,c3b5,r3k1nr/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/1N5q/1b1P4/3BBP2/PPP1QP1P/2KR3R b kq - 3 11,And so after his castle my dsb development he plays the Knight to b5 and I go with my castle.
22,O-O-O,e8c8,2kr2nr/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/1N5q/1b1P4/3BBP2/PPP1QP1P/2KR3R w - - 4 12,And so after his castle my dsb development he plays the Knight to b5 and I go with my castle.
23,Kb1,c1b1,2kr2nr/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/1N5q/1b1P4/3BBP2/PPP1QP1P/1K1R3R b - - 5 12,I'm thinking he played this because I don't have an lsb anymore.
