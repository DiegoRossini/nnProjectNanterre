13,Nd5,c3d5,r1b1k2r/1pppqppp/p1nb1n2/3Np3/2B1P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 7,My pieces are largely developed and I thought my opponent was in a cramped position so started moving forward with aggression
14,Qd8,e7d8,r1bqk2r/1ppp1ppp/p1nb1n2/3Np3/2B1P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 8,7. ... Nxd5 8. exd5 Nb4 9. a3 traps the Knight. 7. ... Nxd5 8. exd5 Na5 9. a3 b5 10. b4 Nb7 and the Knight escapes. White can also capture with the Bishop. 7. ... Nxd5 8. Bxd5 Nb4 is pretty good for black I think
15,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqk2r/1ppp1ppp/p1nb1n2/3Np1B1/2B1P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 3 8,Pinning the Knight so it can't capture and leaving my Knight on d5 in a very strong position. The black Queen is also in very cramped quarters
