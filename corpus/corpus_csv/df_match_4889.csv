4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,I attack White with an usual development move.
5,f3,f2f3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/2P2P2/PP1P2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"Because of this move, White cannot bring his knights out at full power. Knights going to a3 and h3 are limited in power. Best if White cleared out c3 and f3."
6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3pp3/4P3/2P2P2/PP1P2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"I attack the middle aggressively and usually. I normaly do the four knights, but since I'm not White, I have no control over the opening."
7,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3pp3/4P3/2PB1P2/PP1P2PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 4,"Good news and bad news. Good news: Developement of a minor piece (finally); Bad news: Blocks in his other bishop. Apparently, White's light-squared Bishop is his most powerful minor piece."
8,dxe4,d5e4,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/4p3/4p3/2PB1P2/PP1P2PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,I wonder if White can do Bxe4 instead of his next move that he does?
9,Be2,d3e2,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/4p3/4p3/2P2P2/PP1PB1PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 5,White wins an extra pawn 7...Bd7 8.Bxc6 Bxc6 9.Nxe5.
