2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Standard e5 response.The e5 response has caused me trouble in past,i have been victim of ""fools mate"".This is what i try to set up."
3,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,Rev to c4
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 3,Opponent counters with Nf6 maybe thinks i setting up for bishop and queen attack.Which i was going to do
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,Nf3 so i can castle next
6,d6,d7d6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,"Good move by opponent,nice chain"

8,Nxe4,f6e4,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/2B1n3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 5,Here is where my opponent  starts to lose game.Attacking to quickly with not enough development.Been guity of this mistake also.
9,Qe2,d1e2,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/2B1n3/5N2/PPPPQPPP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 1 5,Spooking cowboy(PLEASE FORGIVE HALLOWEEN  REFERANCE LOL) Looking back i also could have went d3 and started chain then he would have possibly went Ng3 sacficing Ng3 if i had went h2xNg3.If i had done this he would have hole in wall and he would have walked in withQ and Bc8.Or if for some reason i left Ng3 he could have Ng3xRf1
10,Nf6,e4f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/2B5/5N2/PPPPQPPP/RNB2RK1 w kq - 2 6,RETREAT!!!His development now in real trouble.If you notice i have a lot of pressure on center
11,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/2B5/2N2N2/PPPPQPPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 3 6,Bring out other cowboy.Riding hard toward victory
12,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/2B3b1/2N2N2/PPPPQPPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 4 7,Admit this  is a good pin.But notice what i do next
13,d3,d2d3,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/2B3b1/2NP1N2/PPP1QPPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 0 7,Opening door to release bishop
14,Bxf3,g4f3,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/2B5/2NP1b2/PPP1QPPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 0 8,Expected i am now 2 pieces down.But Bf3 has no backup.Some say this is piece for piece.But to what advantage?What was that old saying of a thousand cuts?
15,Qxf3,e2f3,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/2B5/2NP1Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 0 8,Cancel Bf3 like a stamp.I am now better developed and only 8 moves into game.
16,Be7,f8e7,rn1qk2r/ppp1bppp/3p1n2/4p3/2B5/2NP1Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 1 9,He moves Be7 backing up Nf6
17,Bg5,c1g5,rn1qk2r/ppp1bppp/3p1n2/4p1B1/2B5/2NP1Q2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b kq - 2 9,Pin.Also i am setting up for the kill with both bishops and Queen.Nf6 is in my way my only problem.
18,Nfd7,f6d7,rn1qk2r/pppnbppp/3p4/4p1B1/2B5/2NP1Q2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w kq - 3 10,Okay major blunder here.I believe he was thinking i would move  Bg5 because Be7 is backed up with queen and king.But he did not look at whole board.Been guilty of this myself.His king in my crosshairs.
19,Qxf7#,f3f7,rn1qk2r/pppnbQpp/3p4/4p1B1/2B5/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b kq - 0 10,"BANG!!!Qxf7 backed up by Bc4 and Bg5.Kinda like a arrowhead huh?Under development and fruitless unsupported early attack cost game for my opponent.I hope you have enjoyed this annotation and possibly learned something.As always postive feedback accepted,negative tolerated.Have a nice day!"
