1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi all! This is yet another game in the Latvian Gambit, where I fall far behind in material as Black due to some very clever tactics on White's part, and then scrap and stamp my way through the rest of the game. This game is, as the title suggests, a lesson in relentless, aggressive activity. I recommend reading in the interactive viewer, since there are a few long comments and the one-page scrolling layout doesn't show line breaks for whatever reason. Enjoy!"
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"?! The Latvian Gambit. I will not go over the opening lines in detail here; I annotated a series consisting of my first ten games with the opening here on GK, so take a look at those for detailed explanation and examples of the opening lines."

5,d3,d2d3,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"White declines (I don't think this is sound; better is accepting with 3.Nxe5, 3.exf5, or delaying/offering a countergambit with 3.d4 or 3.Bc4). Again, see my Latvian Gambit series for more detail."
6,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/3p4/4pp2/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"? I've come to think that this is too passive. I prefer 3...Nc6 or 3...Nf6 here, allowing ...d7-d5 in one move later on and not trapping the DSB."
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/3p4/4pp2/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"! This is an interesting thought. White prepares for a kingside attack with Be2 and Bh5+, while denying Black's QB a spot on e6 and refraining from capturing on f5 (which would also free Black's LSB)."
8,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk1nr/ppp1b1pp/3p4/4pp2/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,"! This is an interesting thought. White prepares for a kingside attack with Be2 and Bh5+, while denying Black's QB a spot on e6 and refraining from capturing on f5 (which would also free Black's LSB)."
9,Bd2,c1d2,rnbqk1nr/ppp1b1pp/3p4/4pp2/4P3/2NP1N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 3 5,"! This is an interesting thought. White prepares for a kingside attack with Be2 and Bh5+, while denying Black's QB a spot on e6 and refraining from capturing on f5 (which would also free Black's LSB)."
10,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqk2r/ppp1b1pp/3p1n2/4pp2/4P3/2NP1N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 4 6,"! This is an interesting thought. White prepares for a kingside attack with Be2 and Bh5+, while denying Black's QB a spot on e6 and refraining from capturing on f5 (which would also free Black's LSB)."
11,Ng5,f3g5,rnbqk2r/ppp1b1pp/3p1n2/4ppN1/4P3/2NP4/PPPB1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 5 6,"! This is an interesting thought. White prepares for a kingside attack with Be2 and Bh5+, while denying Black's QB a spot on e6 and refraining from capturing on f5 (which would also free Black's LSB)."
12,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk2r/ppp1b1pp/2np1n2/4ppN1/4P3/2NP4/PPPB1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 6 7,"A somewhat passive waiting move. I think 6...O-O was probably safe here, but Black wants to castle queenside if possible."
13,Be2,f1e2,r1bqk2r/ppp1b1pp/2np1n2/4ppN1/4P3/2NP4/PPPBBPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 7 7,"?! The number of variations suddenly skyrockets with this sacrifice. Black wants to make use of his superior kingside space and preempt any White aggression, so he breaks out this unlikely move. Let's take a look at some of the more likely variations:

First of all, take stock of what the move did. Black captured a pawn and threatens both of White's Knights, his DSB, and his f2 pawn. Moreover, he threatens to win the Ng5 outright. White has three ways to retake the Knight, or he can play Bh5+. 

(A) White can play 8.dxe4, to which Black will respond 8...Bxg5, with a net gain of a pawn for Black. No dice.

(B) White can play 8.Ncxe4 and defend his g5 Knight, to which the likely continuation is 8...fxe4 9.Nxe4 O-O, maintaining material equality and opening a lot of space on the kingside for both players. Alternately, Black may opt for 8...h6?!, in which case White has two options: 9.Nf3 fxe4 10.dxe4 O-O, with a similar situation  as above but with the Knight blocking in the Be2, or 9.Nxd6+?! followed by 10.Nf3, with an unclear position.

(C) White can play 8.Ngxe4, which maintains equality after 8...fxe4 9.Nxe4 (or 9.dxe4) ...O-O. This is similar to option B, except it guarantees that Black can occupy the center with a Knight if he wants to (at least until Black decides to play ...d5).

(D) White may also choose to postpone the issue of the Ne4 with an intermediate check via 8.Bh5+ g6, at which point White must choose which of his various pieces to sacrifice and how, noting that options A, B, and C remain on the table here, but with the added complications posed by the Bishop."

15,Bh5+,e2h5,r1bqk2r/ppp1b1pp/2np4/4ppNB/4n3/2NP4/PPPB1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 8,"Naturally, White chose option D, the most complex line by far. There is now a standing threat on every White minor piece, but as Mikhail Tal once said, ""They can only take them one at a time!"" Black has decent kingside space but also significant kingside weaknesses, and White's pieces are posed to attack. The only question is: where?"

White is now threatening 10.Bxg6+ Kd7 11.Bxf5+ Ke8 12.Qh5# if Black doesn't do something about it right away, so something like 9...Nxc3 is off the table. Black has to eliminate one of the White minor pieces, and as 9...gxh5 seems to lead logically into 10.Qxh5+ Kd7 11.Qxf5+ Ke8 12.Qxe4 and a loss for Black, it seems Black must accept the lager material sacrifice in exchange for more activity."

White apparently wants to head to the queenside, or at least avoid locking himself up on the kingside, but I think 15.Ne2 (with an eye to playing 16.f4 or 16.d4) was stronger here. On b3, this Knight has very few prospects."
