11,Nf5,d4f5,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/4pN2/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"I'm not sure of the point of this move, it doesn't really achieve much though the knight can prove an annoyance"
12,d6,d7d6,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2np1n2/4pN2/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,This is probably a mistake as it blocks the dsb in. though it does open a line for the lsb
13,Ng3,f5g3,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2np1n2/4p3/4P3/2N3N1/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 7,Further protection on the e pawn but this move seems uneccessary at this time
14,d5,d6d5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/3pp3/4P3/2N3N1/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,Loses a tempo
15,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/3pp1B1/4P3/2N3N1/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 8,This helps to protect white's e pawn by pinning my knight
16,Nd4,c6d4,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/5n2/3pp1B1/3nP3/2N3N1/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 9,This knight should be hard to shift and threatens c2 which means that for now the queen is on guard duty
17,exd5,e4d5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/5n2/3Pp1B1/3n4/2N3N1/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 9,gives white a passed pawn that could be useful later
18,g6,g7g6,r1bqkb1r/pp3p1p/5np1/3Pp1B1/3n4/2N3N1/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 10,preparing to fianchetto the bishop.
19,Nge4,g3e4,r1bqkb1r/pp3p1p/5np1/3Pp1B1/3nN3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 10,Pressuring the knight further but more importantly taking more control over the central area. Given that white still has an lsb to develop this move could probably have waited as it is forcing me to do what I wanted anyway
20,Bg7,f8g7,r1bqk2r/pp3pbp/5np1/3Pp1B1/3nN3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 11,Trying to prevent castling

22,Bd7,c8d7,r2qk2r/pp1b1pbp/5np1/1B1Pp1B1/3nN3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 4 12,This looks like a mistake as I could lose material here if not careful
23,Nd6+,e4d6,r2qk2r/pp1b1pbp/3N1np1/1B1Pp1B1/3n4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 5 12,Forces the king to move which will mean that my dsb and h8 rook will take some time to extricate
24,Kf8,e8f8,r2q1k1r/pp1b1pbp/3N1np1/1B1Pp1B1/3n4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 6 13,Trying to avoid  13 .. Bxb5 14. Nxb5 which gives white the potential for some string linked rooks and perhaps even pawn promotion
25,Nxb7,d6b7,r2q1k1r/pN1b1pbp/5np1/1B1Pp1B1/3n4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 13,Trying to avoid  13 .. Bxb5 14. Nxb5 which gives white the potential for some string linked rooks and perhaps even pawn promotion
26,Qb6,d8b6,r4k1r/pN1b1pbp/1q3np1/1B1Pp1B1/3n4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 1 14,Trying to avoid  13 .. Bxb5 14. Nxb5 which gives white the potential for some string linked rooks and perhaps even pawn promotion
27,Bxd7,b5d7,r4k1r/pN1B1pbp/1q3np1/3Pp1B1/3n4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 14,"That passed pawn is still a threat but for now not too much of one, I can regain material by taking the b7 knight first"
28,Nxd7,f6d7,r4k1r/pN1n1pbp/1q4p1/3Pp1B1/3n4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 15,"That passed pawn is still a threat but for now not too much of one, I can regain material by taking the b7 knight first"
29,Na4,c3a4,r4k1r/pN1n1pbp/1q4p1/3Pp1B1/N2n4/8/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 1 15,This is a mistake as it allows me to prevent him castling and perhaps start some threats of my own. The knight on a4 is poorly placed
30,Qb5,b6b5,r4k1r/pN1n1pbp/6p1/1q1Pp1B1/N2n4/8/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 2 16,Finally he can force that knight away...

33,cxd4,c3d4,4rk1r/pN1n1pbp/6p1/1q1Pp1B1/N2P4/8/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 17,"I can't help feeling that I could have made more of this position but can't see quite how. Forcing the black king into the open can't be bad. So in the end I went for possibly the most feeble move, though it did at least regain material"
34,exd4+,e5d4,4rk1r/pN1n1pbp/6p1/1q1P2B1/N2p4/8/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 18,"I can't help feeling that I could have made more of this position but can't see quite how.
