1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,1.e4 - The game starts with a very uncommon move by white.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Black is confused and decides to copy whites move.
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"White puts a quick end to blacks hopes of copying evey move and plays 2.d4, preventing the symmetric response, because in case black would play d5 now, white can simply take the pawn on e5 pinning black´s d5 pawn to black´s queen."
4,exd4,e5d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3pP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,So black simply decided to take the pawn here...
5,Qxd4,d1d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"But he missed, that white had the simple, still genious move Qxd4. In that way white succeded in tying down black´s bishop to the defense of his g7-pawn, black´s rook to the denfense of the a7-pawn and black´s bishop, queen and king !!! to the defense of the d7-pawn...an awesome move!!!!"
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 1 4,Black decided to move one of his view pieces which can still move and attacks the queen.
7,Qd5,d4d5,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/3Q4/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 2 4,But the white queen didn´t get intimidated by that. She simply approaches the black knight....and the black king!!
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/3Q4/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 3 5,Black tries to catch the queen again with his other knight.
9,Qf5,d5f5,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/5Q2/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 4 5,But it´s hopeless....
10,d6,d7d6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/5Q2/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"White´s queen just goes back and forth, back and forth provoking an over-extansion of black´s pieces. And black doesn´t see the trap!!!!"
11,Qb5,f5b5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/1Q6/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 1 6,"White´s queen just goes back and forth, back and forth provoking an over-extansion of black´s pieces. And black doesn´t see the trap!!!!"

14,h6,h7h6,r1bqkb1r/1pp2pp1/p1np1n1p/6Q1/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 0 8,"Here white missed something. He should have played 8.Qxg7, what would have resulted in the the trade of black´s pawn against white´s queen. Well, white would have lost the exchange, but would have had more than enough compensation, because of black´s weak pawn-structure. (isolated f and h pwans)"

27,Bxb5,f1b5,r2q1rk1/2pn1pb1/p1npb2p/1B4p1/Q3P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 0 14,"Black is in a bad psychological state. So he simply decides to take on b5 and sacrifice his rook. Or maybe he thought the queen is worth more than the rook. Lots of beginning players actually do think the so, but recent scientific research has proven, that this is nothing but a myth. The queen might be able to move diagonally, but that´s not really an advantage for a couple reasons:
1. If you don´t pay attention the queen is way more likely than the rook to stalemate your opponents king in the endgame.
2. The queen starts the game very close to the center of the field, where she can get under fire very easily. But the rooks start at the corner of the board where they can easily attack both flanks of your opponent´s army.
3. Last but not least the rook-pair has proven very strong in lots of chess games. Unfortunately it´s usually not possible to have a queen-pair early in the game."
