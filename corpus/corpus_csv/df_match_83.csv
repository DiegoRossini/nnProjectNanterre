1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The draw for the first round was done on the usual Swizz system. As I was rated 15 out of the 24 players in the tournament, I near the top of the bottom half, and knew I would get one of the best players in the tournament. Peter was rated 4th in the tournament - the number 2 seed took a bye in the first round, so I played Peter instead of the number 3 seed. As you will see, I was also drawn against the second and thrid seeds in later rounds."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,This was the first of my three loses in the tournament - all with the black side of the Sicilian Defence.

4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"I've recently changed my move order, to avoid 2....Nc6 3. Bb5"
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,So he plays the open variation.
