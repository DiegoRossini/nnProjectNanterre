1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone, this is the second of my great escapes involving pawn promotions from my opponent two moves before me.  This game was also drawn.  This game starts off as The Centre Counter or Scandinavian Defense.  An exchange of pawns now follow and black moves his queen to an unusual square after the standard 3. Nc3 - the normal move is 3.............. Qa5."
