1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!  This game was played in a themed MT with reference to Brigadecommander's (Janet's)  Stonewall Project which has thrown up some very interesting results.  For your's truly it was another milestone.  I actually defeated a former Expert who is a Runner in our Walking the Walk and Learning to Run group who resigned on the grounds of UNAVIOIDABLE MATE! Glen lost a lot of rating points partly due to form and timeout issues.  At the start of this game his rating was 1908 so I had to be content with only my third near-Expert Victory and retain my current username rather than an Expert Victory and the username ""The Black Queen"".  So, how did all this happen?  Well, read on ......."
