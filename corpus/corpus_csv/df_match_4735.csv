1. center control: Both players have equal control of the center. However, while the isolated e-pawn can be a future strong asset for white it is at present weaker than black's center pawn. no one has the advantage.
2. Piece development and position: Both players have the same amount of pieces developed and are well centralized. No one has the advantage
3. King Safety: Black is clearly better here because black is ready to castle while white still is two or three moves from castling to safety. Advantage for Black
4. Tactical threats and open lines: White has strong pressure on d5 but at present has no real way to exploit it. While black has more tangible pressure on e5 because Black can use of the f-file to gain tempo against the undefended bishop. Also at black's disposal is the possiblity of d5-d4 thrust creating a uncomfortable pinch on c3. In conclusion based on the fact tha black has more tangible tactical threats, better use of the open lines, and stronger initative black is clearly better."

22,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/ppp3pp/2n5/3pP3/1b3B2/2N5/PP4PP/R2QKBNR w KQ - 1 12,So based upon the for mentioned analysis I have deviced the following play. 1. Increase the safety of my king and gain tempo on the undefended bishop. 2. liquidate my only weakness(the d-pawn) by forcing the exchange on c3. 3. complete my development 4. fight for control of the centre by centralizing my remaining peices.

26,dxc3,d4c3,r1bq1rk1/ppp3pp/2n5/4P3/1b6/P1p3B1/1P4PP/R2QKBNR w KQ - 0 14,"This is good and bad for black. It is good because black will have superior endgame based upon pawn structure. However, the pawn moves have caused serious weakness to emerge in Black's position. With 15. Qb3+ white can take control of e6 which is important for advancing the e pawn. To compensate for this weakness black has direct threats against the rook on a8, 15. ...Be6 attacking the queen if 15. Qb3+ and finally the c6 knight is checking both of White's weak pawns. In conclusion, black now has a clear edge but is not winning. In order to clarify the position black must gain a material advantage, retain his superior pawn structure and exchange pieces to a king-pawn or king-bishop-pawn ending then black wins."
