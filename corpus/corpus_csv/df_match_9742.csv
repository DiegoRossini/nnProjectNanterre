1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"My first attempt at annotating! A friendly game in which an exchange sac brings about a position that I would play from either side. Here we go....

A computer will help out with analysis,but I will do most of the work,as I need the study time! I will not have many ""lines"" of analysis-I perfer to talk generally about my thoughts during the game. Comments are most welcome!"
