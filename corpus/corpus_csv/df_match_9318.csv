1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"Here I am playing as black, which I am still not very good at. This is probably the ugliest game I have played to date. Though, my awkward play on this game may have caused a bit of confusion for my opponent. At the time of this game his score was not 1555 due to his timeouts, but 1555 is his score at this time. Please feel free to comment. I know if I played him again he would probably do 1000 things different. I should have lost this one."
