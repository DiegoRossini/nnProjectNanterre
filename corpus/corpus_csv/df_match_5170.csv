1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,My usual opening
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"my opponent starts with sicilian defence...this is rare for me, because most players of my rating just go with simple  e5"
3,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Grand Prix attack, I remember as one grandmaster in TV said, that this is best option to go for tactically rich game...as my opponent is stronger than me I humbly thought that he will outplay me in quiet positinal game, so maybe this opening could give me some extra opportunity to win..."
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Don't have any opinion why this move (I would be grateful if someone leaves thoughts behind this move)...I was tempted to play Bb5+ but I decided to go with developing moves
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,another gun targeting b5

8,Bd7,c8d7,r2qkbnr/pp1bpppp/2np4/1Bp5/4PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 4 5,now defending knight and not allowing double pawns on c file
9,e5,e4e5,r2qkbnr/pp1bpppp/2np4/1Bp1P3/5P2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,"here I start, I'm not sure that this move is good, but I decided that isolated pawn on c file will be very weak later. also, I'm really waiting for some comments on this move by stronger players...thanks in advance"
10,dxe5,d6e5,r2qkbnr/pp1bpppp/2n5/1Bp1p3/5P2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,accepting my offer
