If dxe5, then Qxh5 threatens mate on F7 and attacks e5, leaving me with a pawn up if he plays Qd7, white being much better in development, 3 pieces to one you should be able to convert...

If I had played this on move 5 there would be no threat for mate, it would play out as Qxg4"

But the moral is if your oponent keeps his knights in, let it rip........

Please give some comment on any other variations you can spot?"
