1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Here's another exciting game in the Latvian Gambit, this time the Svedenborg Variation, characterized by 3.Bc4 and 4...d5, where White has a stronger-than-usual attack at the very beginning, and despite the line being heavily analyzed, the position is very sharp and frequently unclear. This game features a king hunt and a very strong attack, and showcases what happens in this opening when Black has trouble getting his light-square Bishop into play."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"?! The key move of the Latvian Gambit. Black gives up a pawn (and usually more), inviting White to trash the Black kingside in exchange for open files and a potential lead in development."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"?! The key move of the Latvian Gambit. Black gives up a pawn (and usually more), inviting White to trash the Black kingside in exchange for open files and a potential lead in development."
4,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"?! The key move of the Latvian Gambit. Black gives up a pawn (and usually more), inviting White to trash the Black kingside in exchange for open files and a potential lead in development."
5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 3,"This is a particularly aggressive line for White to take. Like most of the other lines in the Latvian besides 3. Nxe5, this move's merit has been heavily disputed (and extensively analyzed)."
6,fxe4,f5e4,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4p3/2B1p3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,"Kicking the Knight, inviting it to e5 for a threat on f7."
7,Nxe5,f3e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4N3/2B1p3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,"White accepts the generous offer, threatening a fork on f7. Black doesn't seem to have any compensation for his risky opening as yet."
8,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/8/3pN3/2B1p3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"The more common line is 4...Qg5 5. d4 Qxg2 6. Qh5+ g6 7. Bf7+ Kd8 8. Bxg6 Qxh1+ 9. Ke2 Qxc1 10. Nf7+, but I think 4...d5 is stronger for Black."
9,Qh5+,d1h5,rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/8/3pN2Q/2B1p3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 1 5,"6...hxg6 is a playable, but less common, alternative."
10,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/ppp4p/6p1/3pN2Q/2B1p3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 6,"6...hxg6 is a playable, but less common, alternative."
11,Nxg6,e5g6,rnbqkbnr/ppp4p/6N1/3p3Q/2B1p3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 6,"6...hxg6 is a playable, but less common, alternative."
12,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp4p/5nN1/3p3Q/2B1p3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 1 7,"6...hxg6 is a playable, but less common, alternative."
13,Qh4,h5h4,rnbqkb1r/ppp4p/5nN1/3p4/2B1p2Q/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 2 7,I can't find any literature for this move. More standard is 7. Qe5+ Be7 8. Bb5+ c6 9. Nxe7 Qxe7 10. Qxe7+ Kxe7 11. Be2 and White is a pawn up but will lag considerably in development.
14,Rg8,h8g8,rnbqkbr1/ppp4p/5nN1/3p4/2B1p2Q/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQq - 3 8,"Unpinning the h-pawn, but more importantly, moving the Rook to the half-open g-file."
15,Nxf8,g6f8,rnbqkNr1/ppp4p/5n2/3p4/2B1p2Q/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQq - 0 8,"This is probably the best play here, as White gobbles more material before his own pieces begin falling."
16,Rg4,g8g4,rnbqkN2/ppp4p/5n2/3p4/2B1p1rQ/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQq - 1 9,"?! Black continues to postpone taking White pieces, opting for a much more aggressive stance and in fact driving the White Queen forward to a defense of the f8 Knight. 8...Rxg2 is probably reasonable here as well, and perhaps better as it leaves g4 open for the Black Knight."
17,Qh6,h4h6,rnbqkN2/ppp4p/5n1Q/3p4/2B1p1r1/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQq - 2 9,"White defends f8, but he no longer pins the Black Knight to the Queen, allowing ...Rxg2 followed by ...Ng4, threatening a dangerous attack focused at f2."
18,Rxg2,g4g2,rnbqkN2/ppp4p/5n1Q/3p4/2B1p3/8/PPPP1PrP/RNB1K2R w KQq - 0 10,"?! Black is planning 10. Nxh7 Ng4 11. Qf4 Rxf2 12. Qxf2 Nxf2 13. Kxf2 Qh4+, winning back some material and drawing the WK into the open, or if White is feeling less cooperative, a few variations on a king hunt are possible, with White chasing the BK to his queenside but unable to quite finish him off (for example, 11. Qg6+ Ke7 12. Qg7+ Kd6 13. Qf8+ Qxf8 14. Nxf8 dxc4 or 14...Bf5 and Black has decent compensation for his material)."
19,Nxh7,f8h7,rnbqk3/ppp4N/5n1Q/3p4/2B1p3/8/PPPP1PrP/RNB1K2R b KQq - 0 10,"! Piling pressure on the indefensible d-pawn. 13...dxc4 would be ill-advised, as it exposes Black to 14. Qxc4+ Kd6 or 14...Kd7 and White can chase the BK back across the board and trap him in the corner with his Queen and Knights."
20,Ng4,f6g4,rnbqk3/ppp4N/7Q/3p4/2B1p1n1/8/PPPP1PrP/RNB1K2R w KQq - 1 11,"! Piling pressure on the indefensible d-pawn. 13...dxc4 would be ill-advised, as it exposes Black to 14. Qxc4+ Kd6 or 14...Kd7 and White can chase the BK back across the board and trap him in the corner with his Queen and Knights."
21,Qf8+,h6f8,rnbqkQ2/ppp4N/8/3p4/2B1p1n1/8/PPPP1PrP/RNB1K2R b KQq - 2 11,"! Piling pressure on the indefensible d-pawn. 13...dxc4 would be ill-advised, as it exposes Black to 14. Qxc4+ Kd6 or 14...Kd7 and White can chase the BK back across the board and trap him in the corner with his Queen and Knights."
22,Kd7,e8d7,rnbq1Q2/pppk3N/8/3p4/2B1p1n1/8/PPPP1PrP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 3 12,"! Piling pressure on the indefensible d-pawn. 13...dxc4 would be ill-advised, as it exposes Black to 14. Qxc4+ Kd6 or 14...Kd7 and White can chase the BK back across the board and trap him in the corner with his Queen and Knights."
23,Qf7+,f8f7,rnbq4/pppk1Q1N/8/3p4/2B1p1n1/8/PPPP1PrP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 4 12,"! Piling pressure on the indefensible d-pawn. 13...dxc4 would be ill-advised, as it exposes Black to 14. Qxc4+ Kd6 or 14...Kd7 and White can chase the BK back across the board and trap him in the corner with his Queen and Knights."
24,Kc6,d7c6,rnbq4/ppp2Q1N/2k5/3p4/2B1p1n1/8/PPPP1PrP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 5 13,"! Piling pressure on the indefensible d-pawn. 13...dxc4 would be ill-advised, as it exposes Black to 14. Qxc4+ Kd6 or 14...Kd7 and White can chase the BK back across the board and trap him in the corner with his Queen and Knights."
25,Nc3,b1c3,rnbq4/ppp2Q1N/2k5/3p4/2B1p1n1/2N5/PPPP1PrP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 6 13,"! Piling pressure on the indefensible d-pawn. 13...dxc4 would be ill-advised, as it exposes Black to 14. Qxc4+ Kd6 or 14...Kd7 and White can chase the BK back across the board and trap him in the corner with his Queen and Knights."
26,Na6,b8a6,r1bq4/ppp2Q1N/n1k5/3p4/2B1p1n1/2N5/PPPP1PrP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 7 14,"The only way Black is getting out of this is if he gets some more pieces available for combat. With this move Black invites 14. Bb5+ Kd6 15. Qxd5+ Ke7, hoping to get his Bishop into play with tempo as soon as he gets a spare move, and then allowing his Queen and Rook to enter the fight and return some pressure against the White King."
27,Bxd5+,c4d5,r1bq4/ppp2Q1N/n1k5/3B4/4p1n1/2N5/PPPP1PrP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 0 14,"Not quite as strong as 14.Bb5+, I think, but certainly still good. White seeks to corner Black's King using his Knight, Bishop, and a-pawn (eg 14...Kb6 15.a4 Rxf2 16.Qg6+ Ka5 17.b4+ Kxb4 18.Rb1+ Kc5 19.Rb5+ Kd4 20.Qxe4#)."
28,Kb6,c6b6,r1bq4/ppp2Q1N/nk6/3B4/4p1n1/2N5/PPPP1PrP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 1 15,"This blocks b2-b4, making a5 a ""safe"" hiding place, and opens space for the Black King on a6 in the event of 16.a5+."
29,a4,a2a4,r1bq4/ppp2Q1N/nk6/3B4/P3p1n1/2N5/1PPP1PrP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 0 15,"This blocks b2-b4, making a5 a ""safe"" hiding place, and opens space for the Black King on a6 in the event of 16.a5+."

33,Bxe4,d5e4,r1bq4/ppp2Q1N/k7/P7/1n2B1n1/2N5/1PPP1PrP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 0 17,Threatening Qc4+ and mate to follow.
