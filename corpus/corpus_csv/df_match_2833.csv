1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"The Reti generally is a quiet opening, but soon this will turn into something completely different..."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 2,White transposes this into a symmetrical English.
3,g3,g2g3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/8/5NP1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,White transposes this into a symmetrical English.
4,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/8/5NP1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,White transposes this into a symmetrical English.
5,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/2P5/5NP1/PP1PPP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,White transposes this into a symmetrical English.
6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2pp4/2P5/5NP1/PP1PPP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"This is already a step towards a somewhat more tactical game, the centre will be opened soon. I like to play this variation against the English."
7,Qb3,d1b3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2pp4/2P5/1Q3NP1/PP1PPP1P/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"?! At the time I thought this should still be theory, but in over 1,5 million games at 365chess.com, this position has never occurred before. Quite a rarity after only 4 White moves. I guess the aim is to attack the centre immediately and prevent Black's bishop from developing on the c8-h3 diagonal."
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/2pp4/2P5/1Q3NP1/PP1PPP1P/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 2 5,"Here Fritz (my computer program) prefers to play 5...Qxd5. I thought White could play 6.Qc2?? and then chase my queen with Nc3 or Bg2, but that fails to 6...Nd4! and if 7.Qd1? Qe4! the mate threat(!) on f3 and fork threat on c2 are just too much to handle for White (here we already see the game sharpening). So instead of 6.Qc2?? White has to retreat to d1 or exchange queens, which results in a slightly better queenless middlegame for Black due to his extra space. Of course I missed this, but my move is not bad."
9,cxd5,c4d5,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/2pP4/8/1Q3NP1/PP1PPP1P/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"Here Fritz (my computer program) prefers to play 5...Qxd5.

10,Nxd5,f6d5,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2n5/2pn4/8/1Q3NP1/PP1PPP1P/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Here Fritz (my computer program) prefers to play 5...Qxd5.

11,Bg2,f1g2,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2n5/2pn4/8/1Q3NP1/PP1PPPBP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 1 6,Black's knight was under pressure and I didn't like to block in my light-squared bishop with 6...e6.
12,Nb6,d5b6,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/1nn5/2p5/8/1Q3NP1/PP1PPPBP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 2 7,Black's knight was under pressure and I didn't like to block in my light-squared bishop with 6...e6.
13,Ng5,f3g5,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/1nn5/2p3N1/8/1Q4P1/PP1PPPBP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 3 7,"!? I had not expected this move. This is a flat-out mating threat on f7, like a scholar's mate. However, I don't like it very much. This knight will have to waste time retreating later on."
14,c4,c5c4,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/1nn5/6N1/2p5/1Q4P1/PP1PPPBP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 8,"Again, not wanting to play 7...e6."
15,Qf3,b3f3,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/1nn5/6N1/2p5/5QP1/PP1PPPBP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 1 8,? This is just a bad move. Black will surely not fall for this after he has seen it last move. The queen will be chased away easily from here.
16,Ne5,c6e5,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/1n6/4n1N1/2p5/5QP1/PP1PPPBP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 2 9,"?! Very natural, defending the mate and chasing the queen at the same time... But not quite best. After 8...f6 9.Ne4 Nd4 10.Qc3 e5 and ...f5 Black has an overwhelming centre."
17,Qc3,f3c3,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/1n6/4n1N1/2p5/2Q3P1/PP1PPPBP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 3 9,"?! Again not a very good move. I was not willing to weaken my light-squared diagonals, but 9...f6 defends my knight, solidifies my centre and chases White's knight at the same time, so that's the best move here."
18,Qc7,d8c7,r1b1kb1r/ppq1pppp/1n6/4n1N1/2p5/2Q3P1/PP1PPPBP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 4 10,"?! Again not a very good move. I was not willing to weaken my light-squared diagonals, but 9...f6 defends my knight, solidifies my centre and chases White's knight at the same time, so that's the best move here."
19,d4,d2d4,r1b1kb1r/ppq1pppp/1n6/4n1N1/2pP4/2Q3P1/PP2PPBP/RNB1K2R b KQkq d3 0 10,! I had missed that I couldn't take en passant due to my hanging queen.
20,Nc6,e5c6,r1b1kb1r/ppq1pppp/1nn5/6N1/2pP4/2Q3P1/PP2PPBP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 1 11,"I had rather expected (and feared) 11.d5!, which is indeed a very strong move, but White tucks his king away first."
21,O-O,e1g1,r1b1kb1r/ppq1pppp/1nn5/6N1/2pP4/2Q3P1/PP2PPBP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 2 11,"I had rather expected (and feared) 11.d5!, which is indeed a very strong move, but White tucks his king away first."
22,Bf5,c8f5,r3kb1r/ppq1pppp/1nn5/5bN1/2pP4/2Q3P1/PP2PPBP/RNB2RK1 w kq - 3 12,"?! Developing, but probably 11...f6 was still preferable."
23,Nd2,b1d2,r3kb1r/ppq1pppp/1nn5/5bN1/2pP4/2Q3P1/PP1NPPBP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 4 12,"And here again, 12.d5 could have been played."
24,Rd8,a8d8,3rkb1r/ppq1pppp/1nn5/5bN1/2pP4/2Q3P1/PP1NPPBP/R1B2RK1 w k - 5 13,"Unable to defend c4, I choose to counter-attack."
25,e4,e2e4,3rkb1r/ppq1pppp/1nn5/5bN1/2pPP3/2Q3P1/PP1N1PBP/R1B2RK1 b k - 0 13,? Loses a pawn due to a tactic.
26,Nxd4,c6d4,3rkb1r/ppq1pppp/1n6/5bN1/2pnP3/2Q3P1/PP1N1PBP/R1B2RK1 w k - 0 14,! White can't take my bishop due to the royal fork on e2.
27,Re1,f1e1,3rkb1r/ppq1pppp/1n6/5bN1/2pnP3/2Q3P1/PP1N1PBP/R1B1R1K1 b k - 1 14,"Fritz prefers 14...Bg4, but I liked this diagonal to keep pressuring White's centre."
28,Bg6,f5g6,3rkb1r/ppq1pppp/1n4b1/6N1/2pnP3/2Q3P1/PP1N1PBP/R1B1R1K1 w k - 2 15,"Fritz prefers 14...Bg4, but I liked this diagonal to keep pressuring White's centre."
29,b3,b2b3,3rkb1r/ppq1pppp/1n4b1/6N1/2pnP3/1PQ3P1/P2N1PBP/R1B1R1K1 b k - 0 15,"Attacking my strong pawn on c4. I'm still not able to take due to the undefended queens facing each other, of course."
