1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Not exactly the best choice of moves by me as black, but I have this idea..."
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Not exactly the best choice of moves by me as black, but I have this idea..."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,And white wants to control the center so moves c4; but e4 is probably better.
4,b6,b7b6,rnbqkbnr/p2ppppp/1pp5/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"I decide to give white some complications immediately, just to see how he'll handle them. So I moved b6. E6 or d5 would have been much better."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/p2ppppp/1pp5/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"A reasonable move, in keeping with controlling the center."
6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/p3pppp/1pp5/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,All of those other moves just so I can move d5 here. White still retains the advantage and tempo here.
7,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/p3pppp/1pp5/3p4/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,Now it is I who has a choice of what to do. I make the best move here.
8,dxe4,d5e4,rnbqkbnr/p3pppp/1pp5/8/2PPp3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"My opponent firmly in the center, now I take a minute to decide what it is I wish to do. And I have a plan; I will castle, and try to prevent white from gaining more space while keeping the board has complicated as I can, which is not what I usually do, and then I'll look for a way to wrest the initiative away from white by causing as many threats as I can, if he doesn't keep me on the defensive. Most games, for those who've seen my annotated games, I try to squeak out a small advantage and turn it into a winning endgame. Not so this one! Soon the position will become very fun."

10,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/p3pppp/1pp2n2/8/2PPN3/8/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,"This white choice is rather passive, and Fritz doesn't like it as much as developing the knight or moving the f pawn."
11,Nxf6+,e4f6,rnbqkb1r/p3pppp/1pp2N2/8/2PP4/8/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,"This white choice is rather passive, and Fritz doesn't like it as much as developing the knight or moving the f pawn."
12,exf6,e7f6,rnbqkb1r/p4ppp/1pp2p2/8/2PP4/8/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,"This white choice is rather passive, and Fritz doesn't like it as much as developing the knight or moving the f pawn."
13,Be3,c1e3,rnbqkb1r/p4ppp/1pp2p2/8/2PP4/4B3/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 1 7,"This white choice is rather passive, and Fritz doesn't like it as much as developing the knight or moving the f pawn."
14,Bb4+,f8b4,rnbqk2r/p4ppp/1pp2p2/8/1bPP4/4B3/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 2 8,"I make the best move here, that Fritz likes. It forces white to admit that his seventh move was a mistake."
15,Bd2,e3d2,rnbqk2r/p4ppp/1pp2p2/8/1bPP4/8/PP1B1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 3 8,"Which he does admit, rather than move his king. Rather than trade Bishops, I decide to have a little fun first..."
16,Qe7+,d8e7,rnb1k2r/p3qppp/1pp2p2/8/1bPP4/8/PP1B1PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 4 9,"Although not one of Fritz's top two choices, it is not a bad move to see how white will respond before trading bishops or castling. Plus, I don't absolutely have to trade bishops, although not doing so on my next turn may end up costing me a tempo."
17,Ne2,g1e2,rnb1k2r/p3qppp/1pp2p2/8/1bPP4/8/PP1BNPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 5 9,"This move is not one of Fritz's favorites either, but it's no blunder. Better was the bishop, so the knight would have the f3 space available."
18,Bg4,c8g4,rn2k2r/p3qppp/1pp2p2/8/1bPP2b1/8/PP1BNPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 6 10,"I did this rather intentionally, wanting the white f pawn on f3 instead of f4."
19,f3,f2f3,rn2k2r/p3qppp/1pp2p2/8/1bPP2b1/5P2/PP1BN1PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 10,White obliges.
20,Bh5,g4h5,rn2k2r/p3qppp/1pp2p2/7b/1bPP4/5P2/PP1BN1PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 11,"Better was Be6 or Bd7. But I wanted either of two things: to provoke pawn advances on the Kingside, where the white king protection will prove weaker later, or failing that, to keep some pressure indirectly on that diagonal. Now whether or not that is wise in this position is debateable, and probably not such a good choice, since the bishop won't be really that active until things change. I am assuming white will castle kingside. You know what they say about making assumptions... ;)"
21,d5,d4d5,rn2k2r/p3qppp/1pp2p2/3P3b/1bP5/5P2/PP1BN1PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 11,This is not the best choice by white either; better was trading bishops for white.
22,cxd5,c6d5,rn2k2r/p3qppp/1p3p2/3p3b/1bP5/5P2/PP1BN1PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 12,"Very bad move by me here, allowing Qa4+. But white chooses something different..."
23,cxd5,c4d5,rn2k2r/p3qppp/1p3p2/3P3b/1b6/5P2/PP1BN1PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 12,And of course I noticed Qa4 after we were already headed down that last sequence... so I wasted no time at all here...
24,Bd6,b4d6,rn2k2r/p3qppp/1p1b1p2/3P3b/8/5P2/PP1BN1PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 13,"Whew. Got away with one there. Not a good way to play, but in Blitz this happens. White still has a slight advantage here, but soon I hope to change that."
25,Qa4+,d1a4,rn2k2r/p3qppp/1p1b1p2/3P3b/Q7/5P2/PP1BN1PP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 2 13,"This comes too late. Perhaps white is subtly letting me know he saw this after he moved, and decided he'd do it anyways. But now Black has no issues defending one of various ways."
