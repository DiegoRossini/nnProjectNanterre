1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I tried diffrent variations against e4 but nothing has proven to be better than sicilian.

3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2P1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,White pushed the game into Gloria variation. I've rarely met this variation so I decided to follow the book strictky or at least as far as I could.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/2P1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"Until this move everything was usual. I don't know what the idea of ths move was but it didn't existed in the DB. I decided to castle early, because as I said I haven't played the Gloria variation so often."

10,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/pp1pppbp/2n2np1/2p3B1/2P1P3/2NP4/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 3 6,Well if Bg5 wasn't a complete mistake so that is a blunder. Why would you possibly play that ? Can someone answer me ? You lose a turn to bring your bishop ahead and then exchange it for a undeveloped knight. Additionaly he allows my black squared bishop to open his diagonal and threaten c3 and put pressure on b2 and a1
11,Bxf6,g5f6,r1bqk2r/pp1pppbp/2n2Bp1/2p5/2P1P3/2NP4/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,Well if Bg5 wasn't a complete mistake so that is a blunder. Why would you possibly play that ? Can someone answer me ?

13,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqk2r/pp1ppp1p/2n2bp1/2p5/2P1P3/2NP1N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 7,This move is obviously a mistake. He wants to have the possibility of Bc7 but doesn't see that Bxb2

15,Nd5,c3d5,r1bqk2r/pp2pp1p/2np1bp1/2pN4/2P1P3/3P1N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 8,This move is obviously a mistake. He wants to have the possibility of Bc7 but doesn't see that Bxb2

17,Rb1,a1b1,r1bqk2r/pp2pp1p/2np2p1/2pN4/2P1P3/3P1N2/Pb3PPP/1R1QKB1R b Kkq - 1 9,Of course I don't retreat immediately. White's mistakes give me a oppurtunity to attack the uncastled king.

19,Nd2,f3d2,r1b1k2r/pp2pp1p/2np2p1/q1pN4/2P1P3/3P4/Pb1N1PPP/1R1QKB1R b Kkq - 3 10,Only possible move if he wants to castle in the future.
20,Bd4,b2d4,r1b1k2r/pp2pp1p/2np2p1/q1pN4/2PbP3/3P4/P2N1PPP/1R1QKB1R w Kkq - 4 11,"I retreat but not fully. My bishop is still in a good position, but White's chances to castle and put an end to my attack are big."
21,f3,f2f3,r1b1k2r/pp2pp1p/2np2p1/q1pN4/2PbP3/3P1P2/P2N2PP/1R1QKB1R b Kkq - 0 11,Another mistake. I don't have an idea what's the purpose of this move. He opens my black squared and makes his castling very complicated.
22,e6,e7e6,r1b1k2r/pp3p1p/2npp1p1/q1pN4/2PbP3/3P1P2/P2N2PP/1R1QKB1R w Kkq - 0 12,I eliminate the danger of Bc7 i order to make my attack easier.
23,Nf4,d5f4,r1b1k2r/pp3p1p/2npp1p1/q1p5/2PbPN2/3P1P2/P2N2PP/1R1QKB1R b Kkq - 1 12,he retreats to the ony possible position and
24,Qxa2,a5a2,r1b1k2r/pp3p1p/2npp1p1/2p5/2PbPN2/3P1P2/q2N2PP/1R1QKB1R w Kkq - 0 13,I win another pawn.
25,Ne2,f4e2,r1b1k2r/pp3p1p/2npp1p1/2p5/2PbP3/3P1P2/q2NN1PP/1R1QKB1R b Kkq - 1 13,Well that is another move I don't like. He leaves the pawn on d3 without any support and tries without having enough power to force my bishop to retreat.
26,Be3,d4e3,r1b1k2r/pp3p1p/2npp1p1/2p5/2P1P3/3PbP2/q2NN1PP/1R1QKB1R w Kkq - 2 14,As I said - not enough support
27,Nb3,d2b3,r1b1k2r/pp3p1p/2npp1p1/2p5/2P1P3/1N1PbP2/q3N1PP/1R1QKB1R b Kkq - 3 14,I involve my kight in the attack in order to have more power and to push him for Bc7#
28,Nb4,c6b4,r1b1k2r/pp3p1p/3pp1p1/2p5/1nP1P3/1N1PbP2/q3N1PP/1R1QKB1R w Kkq - 4 15,I involve my kight in the attack in order to have more power and to push him for Bc7#

30,Bd2+,e3d2,r1b1k2r/pp3p1p/3pp1p1/2p5/1nP1P3/3P1P2/q2bN1PP/NR1QKB1R w Kkq - 6 16,I decide that is it time to attack and force the king to move from his hide place
31,Kf2,e1f2,r1b1k2r/pp3p1p/3pp1p1/2p5/1nP1P3/3P1P2/q2bNKPP/NR1Q1B1R b kq - 7 16,The unsupported d3 pawn helps me to continue my attack and bring the king further away.
32,Nxd3+,b4d3,r1b1k2r/pp3p1p/3pp1p1/2p5/2P1P3/3n1P2/q2bNKPP/NR1Q1B1R w kq - 0 17,The unsupported d3 pawn helps me to continue my attack and bring the king further away.
33,Kg3,f2g3,r1b1k2r/pp3p1p/3pp1p1/2p5/2P1P3/3n1PK1/q2bN1PP/NR1Q1B1R b kq - 1 17,only possible move because of Be3#
34,h5,h7h5,r1b1k2r/pp3p2/3pp1p1/2p4p/2P1P3/3n1PK1/q2bN1PP/NR1Q1B1R w kq - 0 18,Here I need to bring another figure in the attack and the h7 pawn is ideal for it.
35,Nc2,a1c2,r1b1k2r/pp3p2/3pp1p1/2p4p/2P1P3/3n1PK1/q1NbN1PP/1R1Q1B1R b kq - 1 18,White's last mistake. Not so bad as a move but only when the king isn't near mate. I mean the knight does nothing to help the king of escaping the dangoures situation. A possibly better move is h4 which would at least give the king a chance to survive.
