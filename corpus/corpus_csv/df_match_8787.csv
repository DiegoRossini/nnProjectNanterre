This one ends so badly that I'm embarrassed to make it public, but it would be bad form only only make the good games public. Note: my opponent chose the title of the game when he challenged me, and I've left it in his honor, though as you'll see at the end, there might be better names, such as ""Pointless Suicide""..."
