1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"E4, as everybody knows, is the very popular move to start out the chess game. I bet at least 60% of games start with e4. But the most questionable is how to respond to this. There are exactly 20 ways. Some people respond what I call traditionally; e5. But there are other ways that work better for some. He responded c6."
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"My guess already is that he will develop mostly on the Queenside. Rated 1822 on the game database, it looks like it will work quite fine."
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"That was very strong. He simply took over the center in a ""piece developing"" way."
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"That was very strong. He simply took over the center in a ""piece developing"" way."
5,d3,d2d3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"What I say, is that this is way too defensive for the 3rd move. It sets up a fairly good opening though."
6,dxe4,d5e4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/4p3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"""Some ways work better for some"" as I said on move 1. I Responded the way I would to it. I knew this position would come ever since I did the questionable move, d3."
7,Nxe4,c3e4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/4N3/3P4/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"This has one or two bad points to it, but I think it is better than the alternative, dxe4. That would sooner make an open file in the center and would leave me with either Nxd1 or Kxd1. Both I don't like. Kastling is a total option. But basically, I did a Caro-Kann opening. An average one."
8,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/5b2/4N3/3P4/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,This was not one common response. I just thought I could put some pressure through the hole. I was thinking of rather doing Qf3.

12,e6,e7e6,r2qkbnr/pp1n1ppp/2p1p3/5b2/4NB2/3P1P2/PPP3PP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,"There he goes, making room for his bishop and probably Qh4+ Actually 3 possoble ways. But perhaps e5 was better."
13,Bd6,f4d6,r2qkbnr/pp1n1ppp/2pBp3/5b2/4N3/3P1P2/PPP3PP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 1 7,"I was forcing a trade with our ""soon to be powerful"" bishops."
14,Bxe4,f5e4,r2qkbnr/pp1n1ppp/2pBp3/8/4b3/3P1P2/PPP3PP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 8,I lost three points by not doing Bxf8. Another blunder
15,dxe4,d3e4,r2qkbnr/pp1n1ppp/2pBp3/8/4P3/5P2/PPP3PP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 8,But What I descovered after move seven was that my queen could invade and it would be a good plan.

21,Qxe7+,d6e7,r3k2r/pp1nQppp/2p1pn2/8/4P3/5P2/PPP3PP/3RKBNR b Kkq - 0 11,I suppose that wasted a move. It gives my bishop some more options of developing though.

25,b3,b2b3,r6r/pp2kppp/2p1pn2/2n5/4P3/1P3PP1/P1P4P/3RKBNR b K - 0 13,Maybe to build up my pawns. But I shouldn't have waisted time doing that when my kingside hadn't been accelerated.
26,Rhd8,h8d8,r2r4/pp2kppp/2p1pn2/2n5/4P3/1P3PP1/P1P4P/3RKBNR w K - 1 14,M..hm
