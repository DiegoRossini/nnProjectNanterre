6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3p4/3P1B2/2P5/PP2PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Closing in his lsb without need. Openiing the way for his dark squared pieces, too. I'd played Bf5."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3p4/3P1B2/2P2N2/PP2PPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"Black goes for a ""reversed stonewall"". I'm just inventing the term. The issue here is that the f7 pawn was moved, and the white diagonal going from h5 to e8 can be attacked."
8,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/pp4pp/2p1p3/3p1p2/3P1B2/2P2N2/PP2PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Black goes for a ""reversed stonewall"". I'm just inventing the term. The issue here is that the f7 pawn was moved, and the white diagonal going from h5 to e8 can be attacked."

10,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp4pp/2p1pn2/3p1p2/3P1B2/2P1PN2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,This move prevents my Q's entry into g4 or h5. Black needs it.

12,Bd6,f8d6,rnbqk2r/pp4pp/2pbpn2/3pNp2/3P1B2/2P1P3/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 3 7,...and this doesn't bother me at all.
13,Be2,f1e2,rnbqk2r/pp4pp/2pbpn2/3pNp2/3P1B2/2P1P3/PP2BPPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 4 7,"Now, Nf6 can't go on g4 or h5, and I am ""threatening"" Bh5+, and if g6, Nxg6, hxN, Bxg6+. Not a winner right now, but black must be aware of it."
14,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp4pp/2pbpn2/3pNp2/3P1B2/2P1P3/PP2BPPP/RN1QK2R w KQ - 5 8,"This is an awful movement, and it is a clear demonstration of the fact that castling has to be done ONLY when appropriate... and not certainly into the enemy's fire!"
15,g4,g2g4,rnbq1rk1/pp4pp/2pbpn2/3pNp2/3P1BP1/2P1P3/PP2BP1P/RN1QK2R b KQ - 0 8,"Shot one. Nxg4 will lose a pawn and will bring my pieces out. Black has to play very carefully, here, since the g column is a strong attack point for me. He should have played Ne7, so to provoke Nc6, bxN, BxB, Rf7 and try to survive this position, or BxN, dxB, Ne4."
16,g6,g7g6,rnbq1rk1/pp5p/2pbpnp1/3pNp2/3P1BP1/2P1P3/PP2BP1P/RN1QK2R w KQ - 0 9,"? A typical novice error, like castling. The issue black should have taken care of was the g column opening. There was no need to defend f5, since gxf5, exf5 was not bad for black (except for the open g column). This move accomplishes nothing. Bd7 (heading for Be8) was ""something"", and if white goes NxB, be welcomed! Now: how to take care of this mistake? Which is the best move to finish black?"
17,Bh6,f4h6,rnbq1rk1/pp5p/2pbpnpB/3pNp2/3P2P1/2P1P3/PP2BP1P/RN1QK2R b KQ - 1 9,"No, it was not exactly this. But this move is not bad either..."
18,Re8,f8e8,rnbqr1k1/pp5p/2pbpnpB/3pNp2/3P2P1/2P1P3/PP2BP1P/RN1QK2R w KQ - 2 10,"Rf7 lost the exchange... but made black's live easier. Or BxN, dxB, Nxg4, BxR, QxB, and if BxNg4, fxB and white can't retake because f is protected by the Qf8. I'm not using the analyze board, so all this can be flawed. I'll review it later. Anyway: you don't see the move still?"
19,Nxg6,e5g6,rnbqr1k1/pp5p/2pbpnNB/3p1p2/3P2P1/2P1P3/PP2BP1P/RN1QK2R b KQ - 0 10,"Of course. But on real timed games, you always think you can be wrong, just lose a piece and... nothing more. Maybe this was premature. Maybe it was wiser 10. g5, closing in the dsb, but forcing Ng4 (and the subsequent BxN, Qxg4...), or 10... Nf6-d7 (but then black would have been completely underdeveloped) or 10... Ne4, f3, winning the N for a pawn (Qh4+ is not possible due to the g5 pawn). Then, a4, a5 will break black. So: was this sac necessary? Was it sound?"
20,hxg6,h7g6,rnbqr1k1/pp6/2pbpnpB/3p1p2/3P2P1/2P1P3/PP2BP1P/RN1QK2R w KQ - 0 11,Giving away the idea of g5 forever. Still not sure it was the right choice. But the closing-in of the dsb can't be played lightly.
21,gxf5,g4f5,rnbqr1k1/pp6/2pbpnpB/3p1P2/3P4/2P1P3/PP2BP1P/RN1QK2R b KQ - 0 11,Giving away the idea of g5 forever. Still not sure it was the right choice. But the closing-in of the dsb can't be played lightly.

24,Kh7,g8h7,rnbqr3/pp5k/2pb1npB/3p1p2/3P4/2P1P3/PP2BP1P/RN1QK1R1 w Q - 2 13,"Yes, I knew. No problem."
25,Bg5,h6g5,rnbqr3/pp5k/2pb1np1/3p1pB1/3P4/2P1P3/PP2BP1P/RN1QK1R1 b Q - 3 13,"Bf4?? BxB for free. Now, his N is pinned, and this will be the losing piece for him. But he was a novice, he didn't play the best. I'm also inviting Bxh2, which will mean he will end losing it for two pawns (Bxh2, Rh1, Qc7, Bf4, Ng4, BxN... but white can't just play f4 because of Rxe3, be aware...)"
26,Re6,e8e6,rnbq4/pp5k/2pbrnp1/3p1pB1/3P4/2P1P3/PP2BP1P/RN1QK1R1 w Q - 4 14,"Not the proper position for the proper piece. The R belongs to g8 or h8, the Q to f7, and the other N to d7. So this was the square for Bc8. Learn how to get your pieces coordinated, in its best squares. It's not always easy to see where they are, but this is an ""ugly-looking"" move, and for good reasons! Who knows which was the idea behind it!"
27,Bh5,e2h5,rnbq4/pp5k/2pbrnp1/3p1pBB/3P4/2P1P3/PP3P1P/RN1QK1R1 b Q - 5 14,"When attacking, be quick. I'm no Capablanca, I'm not able to ""slowly build""... nor this is the right position to do that. I'll go this way. NxB is impossible, and if gxh, I'm sure the action on the g column will give me enough compenbsation. It was ""hope chess""... :-)"
28,Qg8,d8g8,rnb3q1/pp5k/2pbrnp1/3p1pBB/3P4/2P1P3/PP3P1P/RN1QK1R1 w Q - 6 15,"I still think black could have taken the B, but this move has its point, since my Rg1 is not defended, and I can't castle. I looked to Kd2 (but Ne4+), or Ke2 (self-blocking my Q... doubtful!). I don't want to take back my lsb, if possible. I can pin the g pawn by moving my dsb, but if Bh4 I just give black a tempo, threatening Bxg6, but he can just play Ne4, defending it with the R (was it not all that bad? :-)"
