7,d5,d4d5,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2pP4/2P5/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,Much the usual move by White at this juncture.
8,exd5,e6d5,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/5n2/2pp4/2P5/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,Much the usual move by White at this juncture.

12,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pp3p1p/3p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,Black is very interested in the central dark squares (e5 and d4) and fianchettos his King's Bishop according.  In conjunction with a general advance of his Q-side majority this is a major plank of Black's strategy.
13,f4,f2f4,rnbqkb1r/pp3p1p/3p1np1/2pP4/4PP2/2N5/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 7,"The Pawn Storm Variation.  According to Bill Hartston, this is 'the most direct refutation attempt of the Modern Benoni. White prepares at once to set his central pawn roller in motion.'"
14,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4PP2/2N5/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 8,"Thematic and best.  Again, Bill Hartston: 'Attempts by Black to halt the advance are doomed to failure...'  E.g. 7...Qe7   8.Nf3 and now [A] 8... Nbd7?  9.e5 dxe5  10.fxe5 Nxe5   11.Bb5ch Nd7ch   12.Kf2 Ng4ch  13.Kg3! with a winning game for White.  [B] 8...Nxe4   9.Nxe4 Qxe4ch  10.Kf2 ... threatening 11.Bb5ch.  [C] Black's best is to continue as in normal lines, ...Bg7 and ...0-0, but even so White seems to come out with an edge."
15,Bb5+,f1b5,rnbqk2r/pp3pbp/3p1np1/1BpP4/4PP2/2N5/PP4PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 2 8,"This is the notorious, and dangerous, 'Flick-knife Attack.'  With the White pieces against 'caveman1960' I went for the Mikenas line 8.e5!?  According to a book I have on the Skopje Olympiad, it was there that were heard the last dying moans of Mikenas's version of the Pawn Storm Attack.  It seems, after these 40 years, it is still kicking... That will be the subject of a future annotated game."
16,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bqk2r/pp1n1pbp/3p1np1/1BpP4/4PP2/2N5/PP4PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 3 9,"(!?) This was the move that had long been discredited, on the grounds that it lost a piece after 9.e5, followed soon after by e6.  But there is more to this than meets the eye!"
17,e5,e4e5,r1bqk2r/pp1n1pbp/3p1np1/1BpPP3/5P2/2N5/PP4PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 9,"(!) The critical test, of course."
18,dxe5,d6e5,r1bqk2r/pp1n1pbp/5np1/1BpPp3/5P2/2N5/PP4PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 10,"A mighty looking centre!  Black seems to be about to lose a piece, and he does.  So what can Black do to save the situation?"
19,fxe5,f4e5,r1bqk2r/pp1n1pbp/5np1/1BpPP3/8/2N5/PP4PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 10,"A mighty looking centre!  Black seems to be about to lose a piece, and he does.  So what can Black do to save the situation?"
20,Nh5,f6h5,r1bqk2r/pp1n1pbp/6p1/1BpPP2n/8/2N5/PP4PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 1 11,"Opening up lines, in particular, a diagonal for his Queen."

22,Qh4+,d8h4,r1b1k2r/pp1n1pbp/4P1p1/1BpP3n/7q/2N5/PP4PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 1 12,"What follows seems to be something of a forcing line.  It turns out to have been played before, and neither of us saw any reason to deviate."
23,g3,g2g3,r1b1k2r/pp1n1pbp/4P1p1/1BpP3n/7q/2N3P1/PP5P/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 12,"Forcing Black's reply.  But this move was not itself forced, and seems not to be White's best option.  If instead 12.Kd2, Black has to strain every nerve to maintain his attack.  Here's a sample line: 12.Kd2 fxe6  13.dxe6 0-0  14.exd7 Bxd7  15.Bxd7 Bxc3ch!?  16.bxc3 Rf2ch  17.Ne2 Rd8  18.Qb3ch Rf7 with an unclear - not to say murky - position.  This line was played in the Club Forum between brigadecommander and elyhim though Black chose 18...c4 as an improvement over ...Rf7."
24,Nxg3,h5g3,r1b1k2r/pp1n1pbp/4P1p1/1BpP4/7q/2N3n1/PP5P/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 13,Now White just about has to take on g3 sooner or later or lose his rook at an even higher price.

28,Bxd7,c8d7,r3k2r/pp1b1pbp/6p1/1BpP4/8/2N3P1/PP6/R1BQK1Nq w Qkq - 0 15,"This latest flurry of exchanges have left an open board, most of the active pieces have been gunned down in the shoot out.  Black has rook and 2 pawns for 2 Knights - nominally a pawn's worth ahead, but in practice thought to be pretty much even.  At the moment the game is hard to call, as the two knights can be hard to break down.  However, Black has a majority on both wings, and White's central passed pawn is isolated and vulnerable.  Meanwhile, White has to do something about the pinned Knight at g1.  Could Black have improved in the meantime?  It seems that Queen checks at e2 or a4 or g4 might have to be examined in future games."

31,Kf1,e1f1,r6r/pp1k1pbp/6p1/2pP4/8/2N3P1/PP6/R1BQ1KNq b - - 1 16,Sensible: gets the King off the open e-file as well as protecting the Knight.
32,Bd4,g7d4,r6r/pp1k1p1p/6p1/2pP4/3b4/2N3P1/PP6/R1BQ1KNq w - - 2 17,"A dual purpose move.  It renews the attack upon the g1-Knight, and there is but one defence available.  At the same time it cuts off the White Queen's protection of the d-pawn, and deflects away the c3-knight from the same task.  White's d-pawn is doomed."
33,Nce2,c3e2,r6r/pp1k1p1p/6p1/2pP4/3b4/6P1/PP2N3/R1BQ1KNq b - - 3 17,Forced.
