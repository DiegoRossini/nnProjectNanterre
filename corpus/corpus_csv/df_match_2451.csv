It also forces black to mess up his pawn structure. Something he will have to resolve in order to fight for an advantage.
18,gxf6,g7f6,r1bqkb1r/5p1p/p1np1p2/1p2p3/4P3/N1N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 10,Black plays to unravel his pawns and get rid of the knight on d5. White can not stop the attack against his knight but he will try exact a even better concession from black
19,Nd5,c3d5,r1bqkb1r/5p1p/p1np1p2/1p1Np3/4P3/N7/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 10,Black plays to unravel his pawns and get rid of the knight on d5. White can not stop the attack against his knight but he will try exact a even better concession from black

In exchange black gives up his best bishop which he will sorely miss in a few moves. My pawn on d5 is not ideally but it keeps the centre closed so I can attack f5 with fury.
24,Bxd5,e6d5,r2qkb1r/5p1p/p1np4/1p1bpp2/4P3/N2B4/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 13,"Black has to be strategically better here due to his strong centre. However, he in cramped and has the problem sub par development. At this point I thought I had to start playing or I will be losing."

27,c3,c2c3,r2qkb1r/4np1p/p2p4/1p1Ppp2/8/N1PB4/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 14,! I give this an exclamation mark not because of it is brilliant but because of it achieves. It opens a super highway for the knight and gives the bishop on d3 an escape route.
28,Bg7,f8g7,r2qk2r/4npbp/p2p4/1p1Ppp2/8/N1PB4/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 1 15,Some would be tempted to play 14...e4?! But when you are behind in development it is very unwise to expand in the centre.
29,Qh5,d1h5,r2qk2r/4npbp/p2p4/1p1Ppp1Q/8/N1PB4/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b kq - 2 15,Puts the queen on a very active square and threatens too win a pawn
30,Qd7,d8d7,r3k2r/3qnpbp/p2p4/1p1Ppp1Q/8/N1PB4/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w kq - 3 16,Anticipating ...e4

32,O-O,e8g8,r4rk1/3qnpbp/p2p4/1p1Ppp1Q/8/N1PB4/PP3PPP/4RRK1 w - - 5 17,The bishop retreats for now
33,Bb1,d3b1,r4rk1/3qnpbp/p2p4/1p1Ppp1Q/8/N1P5/PP3PPP/1B2RRK1 b - - 6 17,The bishop retreats for now
34,h6,h7h6,r4rk1/3qnpb1/p2p3p/1p1Ppp1Q/8/N1P5/PP3PPP/1B2RRK1 w - - 0 18,Defending d5 which allows me to start a bold wing attack without fearing counter play against what is left of my centre.
35,Red1,e1d1,r4rk1/3qnpb1/p2p3p/1p1Ppp1Q/8/N1P5/PP3PPP/1B1R1RK1 b - - 1 18,Defending d5 which allows me to start a bold wing attack without fearing counter play against what is left of my centre.

37,Kh1,g1h1,r4rk1/3qnpb1/p2p3p/1p1Pp2Q/5p2/N1P5/PP3PPP/1B1R1R1K b - - 1 19,I find these types of moves very tough to play against. It kinda leaves you thinking as to what your opponent is doing. But here white's scheme is quite easy to see. He wants to play Rg1 followed by g3 to open the g-file with the white rook staring down the black king. Abitibipower will need nerves of steel!
38,f5,f7f5,r4rk1/3qn1b1/p2p3p/1p1Ppp1Q/5p2/N1P5/PP3PPP/1B1R1R1K w - - 0 20,Abitibipower tries to hold me back by attacking weak d5 pawn. But I am a dog with a bone nothing will stop me
39,Rfg1,f1g1,r4rk1/3qn1b1/p2p3p/1p1Ppp1Q/5p2/N1P5/PP3PPP/1B1R2RK b - - 1 20,Abitibipower tries to hold me back by attacking weak d5 pawn. But I am a dog with a bone nothing will stop me

42,a5,a6a5,r4rk1/1q2n1b1/3p3p/pp1Ppp1Q/5p2/2P5/PPN2PPP/1B1R2RK w - - 0 22,"hum, which is what I thought about this move. This may not seem that significant but it is because it signals the turning point of the game into whites favour. Up until now black has played actively quietly going about executing his own plan and ideas. Here ...a5 is reactionary, designed to keep the white knight out of b4. What black should have done is play 21...Rf6 followed by ...Nf6 and ...Qf7."
43,f3,f2f3,r4rk1/1q2n1b1/3p3p/pp1Ppp1Q/5p2/2P2P2/PPN3PP/1B1R2RK b - - 0 22,! I played this with an air of superiority knowing full well that black was going to be up to his knees in trouble.
