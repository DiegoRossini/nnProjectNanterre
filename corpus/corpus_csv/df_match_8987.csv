1,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/2N5/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 1,"1. Nc3 is a very odd opening, considered by the world of chess experts to be too passive and therefore a weak choice, virtually never played at serious levels. I had no idea what to do with it, so I winged it, and turns out, I picked just about the worst possible ""good"" response, giving white a decent opening and a strong attack."
