1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Black's most popular response to White's Ruy Lopez; it's popularity probably due to its proven soundness.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Black's most popular response to White's Ruy Lopez; it's popularity probably due to its proven soundness.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Black's most popular response to White's Ruy Lopez; it's popularity probably due to its proven soundness.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,Black's most popular response to White's Ruy Lopez; it's popularity probably due to its proven soundness.
5,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,Black's most popular response to White's Ruy Lopez; it's popularity probably due to its proven soundness.
6,a6,a7a6,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,Black's most popular response to White's Ruy Lopez; it's popularity probably due to its proven soundness.
7,Bxc6,b5c6,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1B5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,"A major parting of ways for White.  The exchange doubles a pair of Black's Q-side pawns, potentially laming his majority on that side of the board, but at the cost of ceding the bishop pair on a fairly open board.  The jury is still out on the value of this exchange."
8,dxc6,d7c6,r1bqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1p5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"By far the usual move, but by no means is the alternate capture unplayable.  After 4...bxc6 5.Nxe5 has its risks: 5...Qg5 6.d4 Qxg2 7.Qf3 Qxf3 8.Nxf3 d6 and Black has a reasonable game.  The reason for the popularity of the text move is that after 5.Nxe5 Qd4 more simply recovers the pawn."
9,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1p5/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,Also playable here are 5.d3 and 5.0-0.
10,f6,f7f6,r1bqkbnr/1pp3pp/p1p2p2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"Probably the ""Main"" line.  5...Qd6 gets played often, and I have played the highly aggressive but dubiously sound 5...Bg4 on GK."
11,Nxe5,f3e5,r1bqkbnr/1pp3pp/p1p2p2/4N3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"(?) Bold ... and bad.  But maybe there's more to it than meets the eye.  White gets a couple of pawns for the piece, but his immediate attack is swiftly repulsed..."
12,fxe5,f6e5,r1bqkbnr/1pp3pp/p1p5/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,(!) Obviously best.  The alternatives allow White to keep his attack going a little longer: 7...Ke7? 8.Qxe5 ; 7...g6?? 8.Qxe5 )
13,Qh5+,d1h5,r1bqkbnr/1pp3pp/p1p5/4p2Q/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 1 7,(!) Obviously best.  The alternatives allow White to keep his attack going a little longer: 7...Ke7? 8.Qxe5 ; 7...g6?? 8.Qxe5 )
14,Kd7,e8d7,r1bq1bnr/1ppk2pp/p1p5/4p2Q/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 2 8,(!) Obviously best.  The alternatives allow White to keep his attack going a little longer: 7...Ke7? 8.Qxe5 ; 7...g6?? 8.Qxe5 )
15,Qxe5,h5e5,r1bq1bnr/1ppk2pp/p1p5/4Q3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 0 8,"(!)  Just the right moment to offer to exchange queens.  White has only a narrow range of options.  Material down, he doesn't want to exchange and so diminish any attacking chances he might obtain."
16,Qf6,d8f6,r1b2bnr/1ppk2pp/p1p2q2/4Q3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 1 9,"(!)  Just the right moment to offer to exchange queens.  White has only a narrow range of options.  Material down, he doesn't want to exchange and so diminish any attacking chances he might obtain."
17,Qg3,e5g3,r1b2bnr/1ppk2pp/p1p2q2/8/4P3/2N3Q1/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 2 9,"The alternatives are no better, but this allows Black to develop a piece with tempo."
18,Bd6,f8d6,r1b3nr/1ppk2pp/p1pb1q2/8/4P3/2N3Q1/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 3 10,"(!)  Not bad: to free up the c8-B, but also leaving free the d-file for the a8-R."
19,Qd3,g3d3,r1b3nr/1ppk2pp/p1pb1q2/8/4P3/2NQ4/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 4 10,"(!)  Not bad: to free up the c8-B, but also leaving free the d-file for the a8-R."

22,Be6,c8e6,r3k1nr/1pp3pp/p1pbbq2/8/2Q1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 7 12,...Natch!

26,Rf8,h8f8,r3kr2/1pp1n1pp/p1pbbq2/8/4P3/2N5/PPPPQPPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 11 14,"(!?) This move is fine, but I might have been inclined to try 13...Kd7 with the view to swinging the a8-R over to the K-side - ...Rg8, say.  Along completely different lines, 13...b5 is another idea, threatening to dislocate the c3-N."
27,d3,d2d3,r3kr2/1pp1n1pp/p1pbbq2/8/4P3/2NP4/PPP1QPPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 0 14,(?) Takes from Black's DSB a square it doesn't want to reach.  Instead 15.Be3 seems to be called for.
28,Ng6,e7g6,r3kr2/1pp3pp/p1pbbqn1/8/4P3/2NP4/PPP1QPPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 1 15,(?) Takes from Black's DSB a square it doesn't want to reach.  Instead 15.Be3 seems to be called for.
29,a3,a2a3,r3kr2/1pp3pp/p1pbbqn1/8/4P3/P1NP4/1PP1QPPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 0 15,(?) Takes from Black's DSB a square it doesn't want to reach.  Instead 15.Be3 seems to be called for.
30,Qh4,f6h4,r3kr2/1pp3pp/p1pbb1n1/8/4P2q/P1NP4/1PP1QPPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 1 16,"(!?) Black launches her K-side attack with an immediate strike at h2.  Yet maybe she let her best chance slip right here.  I like the look of 15...Nf4(!) 16.Bxf4 Qxf4 17.g3 Qg4 18.Qxg4 (or 18.Qe3 Rf3; or 18.Qd2 Qf3) 18...Bxg4 19.f4 Bh3.  With the queens gone, White's array of pawns will be a very problematical match for Black's bishop pair (and extra piece)."
31,g3,g2g3,r3kr2/1pp3pp/p1pbb1n1/8/4P2q/P1NP2P1/1PP1QP1P/R1B2RK1 b - - 0 16,"(!?) Good, though 17.Be3 first might have been even better."

Black has several possible ways to attack, and it is not easy in such circumstances to find the likeliest to break through.  A better alternative seems 17...Bg4! 18.Qf2 (covers the g1-a7 diagonal) 18...Ne5! (exploits the momentary pin on the f-file to bring the N into action) 19.Be3 (say) 19...Nf3  20.Kh1 Rf6 with an attack.  After 21.Qg2 Black can go all out: 21...Rh6! 22.Qxh3 Rxh3 23.Rf2 g5 ... You don't often see such ferocious looking attacks with the queens absent!"
35,Be3,c1e3,r3kr2/1pp3pp/p1p1b1n1/2b5/4PP2/P1NPB1Pq/1PP1Q2P/R4RK1 b - - 2 18,"(?!) Still preferable seems 18...Bg4, hoping for 19.Qf2? Rxf4!  Of course, White will play 19.Qd2, whereat Black can no little better than retire the c5-B to e7.  Note that I mentioned Black (in this instance) ""hoping for"" this or that response.  This is fine if you have already planned a good followup to your opponent making a different and better move.  Where it becomes Heisman's ""Hope Chess"" is when you have no such followup planned ahead of time."
