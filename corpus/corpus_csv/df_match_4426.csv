2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,A very Laskerian reply~! Now Black need only Play Like Lasker would . . .
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Far ahead of his time, Ruy Lopez develops the ultimate Open-Game for Blitzing. Epawn, King-knight, Bishop, Bishop, O-O was the physically quickest Right-handed opening in existance until the advent of the Hyper-Modern-Reversed School created; Nf3, g3, Bg2, O-O, d3. (Of course one can squander several nano-seconds when blitzing by sundial). A very perceptive use of Space-time by the Father of Relativity."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,Laskerian & Steinitzian ... They obviously held no fear of Bobby's e4 opinion !!?
5,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,"A Ruy Lopez ... The critical point will be whether he is following Ruy, or following Bobby !?"
6,a6,a7a6,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,"a6! Still in good stead ... while Paul Morphy never played a6, he did get this variation named after him for playing ...P-QR3 all the time. Thus showing how far ahead of his time he was. Remember this was even before Steinitz created his own name bearing variations. Which bear the name Old Steinitz for ...P-Q3, and strangely ""New Steinitz"" for preceding that with Morphy's older 3...P-QR3 (!?). Apparently named by someone having real issues with Cause & Effect ?! Has Quantum Mechanics raised its ugly heads? Or just someguy in perpetual time trouble from believing The Arrow will flip, if he wait long enough ?!?  }8-0  
I suggest that instead we call That the Paul variation ..."
7,Ba4,b5a4,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,Still Fischer on Ruy
8,b5,b7b5,r1bqkbnr/2pp1ppp/p1n5/1p2p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"Angelschach, the way it Should have been spelled. Please note for all future annotations by those who'd ""love to change the world, but don't know what to do"" . . . This is step #1. 

[I note that the GK d-base has changed nomenclature to the simple ""Wing Attack"" for this line. Personally, I dislike it when Opening names become depersonalized. Particularly distressing is when the Rauser Attack vs the Sicilian Dragon became the less personal ""Yugoslav Attack"" and even moreso, the Ruy Lopez becoming called the ""Spanish Opening""??! Yech. One step in the correct direction, the ""Center-Counter Defense"" is now the Scandinavian. A major improvement~! ] 

How appro of Oppy; Father of the Atomic Bomb plays the Angels' game. As you might expect, attendant risk is somewhat higher than mainline Ruy, since Angels will tread where none but Fools or Physicists will follow. Let's see if Albert can defuse it?"

Clearly, under the circumstances, White can Not try to transpose to a RIGA VARIATION with 7...d4. And its too late. It would be more of a New New Angel's Berlin Riga Variation Deferred & Blown. Which is not to call it a BAD Move. Other ideas here: 7.Nxe5 as from the Berlin Variation (transposing to it thusly) Also 7.Bd5, 7.a4 or 7.Qe2 could be played. It would be relatively impossible for White to find any move sufficiently adverse to call it a game losing. He might even venture the strange looking 7.c4 , an idea borrowed from another line I believe to be called a Howell Attack, then if ...bxc?! 8.Ba4 [And here is a Secret for loyal forum readers ... The c4 idea is NOT in either the GK nor GK-World d-bases. So if you are looking to exit from the d-base by a side door, I don't believe the door will fall off from this move. You can trust me on That; as long as you run 4 or 5 computer trials before using it ;) ] ******* 
The 7.Re1 move actually an older approach (than d4 first) to an Open Lopez, quite playable, and may continue with 7...d5 8.d4 Be6 9.dxe5 which completes full transposition to mainline Open Lopez of the modern caste."

16,b4,b5b4,r1bqkb1r/2p2ppp/p1n5/3pp3/Pp2n3/1B3N2/1PPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq - 0 9,"b4 or Rb8 seem to be that ""Natural""s ... but the most interesting to my own sense of ""It-might-work-in-blitz"" is the idea is 8...Bc5 !? which appears complex & entertaining enough to make it my instant choice since f2 appears gaping. (Bearing in mind, appearances Can Be Deceiving, yet ... its the perfect blitz move since Black gets a free-think on WT's time, unless WT dives in instantly with 9.axb5 !?  Or with 9.d4 ... which Appears Safer (Bearing in mind ... )"

I looked at 11...Bf5, (thinking to retreat it Bg6 for further f7 defense) but it seems to get a bit silly after the obvious 12.Nc6 and the roof falls in no matter where the Queen runs to. Now the roof falls differently"
