1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Here is another quick win! Ended in 20 minutes! Anyways, as always, I play the e4 opening."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Standard response.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Sometimes I play the Ruy Lopez, but here I am aiming for a 4 knights game."
4,f6,f7f6,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,Huge mistake! This opens the floodgates.
5,Nxe5,f3e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"But first i need to get the knight out of the way. And not only did I manage to get it out of the way, but now I have made it possible to launch an attack. Now don't misinterprete, I never!!! attack early. But it was a game for fun, and I decided to try to attack his weakness."
6,fxe5,f6e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Now this move forces him to do one of two things. Either play g6, and Qxe5 claims the rook, or he can move his king forward. Personally, I would prefer to keep material where possible, and I would move ke7."
7,Qh5+,d1h5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4p2Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"Now this move forces him to do one of two things. Either play g6, and Qxe5 claims the rook, or he can move his king forward. Personally, I would prefer to keep material where possible, and I would move ke7."
8,Ke7,e8e7,rnbq1bnr/ppppk1pp/8/4p2Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQ - 2 5,"Now I am going to force him all over the board. This is similar to another one of my annotations, but this one requires more work."
9,Qxe5+,h5e5,rnbq1bnr/ppppk1pp/8/4Q3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQ - 0 5,"Now I am going to force him all over the board. This is similar to another one of my annotations, but this one requires more work."

11,Bc4+,f1c4,rnbq1bnr/pppp1kpp/8/4Q3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 2 6,"Now the bishop comes out, forcing him to move to g6, he is now defenseless, with no developed pieces."
12,Kg6,f7g6,rnbq1bnr/pppp2pp/6k1/4Q3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 3 7,...
13,Qf5+,e5f5,rnbq1bnr/pppp2pp/6k1/5Q2/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 4 7,"Now, had I played d4 before this it would be a checkmate. But I saw a semi-forced checkmate, and I didn't want to give him a free move to improve his position. So force him there, then put him in check again."
14,Kh6,g6h6,rnbq1bnr/pppp2pp/7k/5Q2/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 5 8,...
15,d4+,d2d4,rnbq1bnr/pppp2pp/7k/5Q2/2BPP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 0 8,"Take more centre control in case my attack fails, while putting him in a revealed check. He could always play Qg5, but then Qxg5 is a checkmate. His only viable option is g5."
16,g5,g7g5,rnbq1bnr/pppp3p/7k/5Qp1/2BPP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 0 9,"As I said, his only option..."
17,h4,h2h4,rnbq1bnr/pppp3p/7k/5Qp1/2BPP2P/8/PPP2PP1/RNB1K2R b KQ - 0 9,"Now I am challenging the pawn. Here I hope he tries to protect the pawn, so that the revealed check with the rook would send him into disarray, and a possible checkmate."
18,Be7,f8e7,rnbq2nr/ppppb2p/7k/5Qp1/2BPP2P/8/PPP2PP1/RNB1K2R w KQ - 1 10,"He falls for it, not seeing the revealed check. There is now a forced checkmate in 2."
19,hxg5+,h4g5,rnbq2nr/ppppb2p/7k/5QP1/2BPP3/8/PPP2PP1/RNB1K2R b KQ - 0 10,"His only legal option is kg7, and I can mate him in this position."
20,Kg7,h6g7,rnbq2nr/ppppb1kp/8/5QP1/2BPP3/8/PPP2PP1/RNB1K2R w KQ - 1 11,Here the bishop protects the king. Another fast checkmate. Let me know what you think.
