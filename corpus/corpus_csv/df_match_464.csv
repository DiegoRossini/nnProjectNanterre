1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Caro-Kann.  A fairly conservative, but solid defence by Black.  Truth to tell, my record against the Caro is not what you'd call stellar."
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Caro-Kann.  A fairly conservative, but solid defence by Black.  Truth to tell, my record against the Caro is not what you'd call stellar."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,The usual response.  But also playable is 2.Nc3.  +++++++  There can also emerge from this opening a 'Demolition Derby' Gambit arising from a Grand Prix line: 1.e4 c6 2.f4!? d5  3.Nf3 dxe4  4.Ng5 Nf6  5.Bc4 Bg4 6.Qxg4!? Nxg4 7.Bxf7ch Kd7 8.Be6ch Kc7 9.Bxg4 ... White gets two minor pieces and a strong initiative for the Queen.
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"The usual response.  Instead 2...d6 has been played, as in a famous game from the 1950s, M.Tal vs V. Simagin."
5,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"Advance Variation.  This was a favourite of Aron Nimzovitch, though it didn't go as well for him as the analogous line in the French Defence (1.e4 e6  2.d54 d5  3.e5 ...).  Mischa Tal tried it also in his matches against M. Botvinnik.  It is by no means my favourite. I prefer the Panov-Botvinnik Attack, 3.c4, but I thought I try something a bit more ... classical."
6,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pPb2/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"In my view, Black's best and most logical move.  In 1961 M. Botvinnik played 3...c5, in games 4, 6 and 8, vs M. Tal.  After draws in the first two games, Tal stomped all over him in the third outing.  Botvinnik thereafter switched to the bishop move."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pPb2/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,"The most often seen tries back in the day were the obvious looking 6.Bd3, and Tal's troglodyte attack by 6.h4.  The bishop exchange brought on by the former tended to leave White short of a valuable attacking asset; but 6...h5 was an apt response to the pawn thrust.  This move is a conservative development that keeps interest in the K-side, but retains White' s'good' bishop - the one operating on the light squares, whilst the centre pawns occupy the dark."
8,e6,e7e6,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3pPb2/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"The most often seen tries back in the day were the obvious looking 6.Bd3, and Tal's troglodyte attack by 6.h4.

9,Be2,f1e2,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3pPb2/3P4/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,"The most often seen tries back in the day were the obvious looking 6.Bd3, and Tal's troglodyte attack by 6.h4.

10,Nd7,b8d7,r2qkbnr/pp1n1ppp/2p1p3/3pPb2/3P4/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 6,"Still book.  Black is just a little bit cramped here, nothing serious - you'll see what she does about it anon - but it does mean some tight manoeuvring."
11,O-O,e1g1,r2qkbnr/pp1n1ppp/2p1p3/3pPb2/3P4/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 3 6,"Still book.  Black is just a little bit cramped here, nothing serious - you'll see what she does about it anon - but it does mean some tight manoeuvring."

13,Nh4,f3h4,r2qkb1r/pp1nnppp/2p1p3/3pPb2/3P3N/8/PPP1BPPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 5 7,Played with the intention of exchanging this knight for Black's light-square bishop.  I am quite prepared to accept the loss of time to compass this.
14,Bg6,f5g6,r2qkb1r/pp1nnppp/2p1p1b1/3pP3/3P3N/8/PPP1BPPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 6 8,"Black prefers to accept a slight loss of time as well to effect the exchange on g6 rather than f5, where the recapturing knight could become a target to, say, g2-g4."
15,c3,c2c3,r2qkb1r/pp1nnppp/2p1p1b1/3pP3/3P3N/2P5/PP2BPPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,"I could equally well have taken the g6-bishop at once.  But as the bishop is not going anywhere, I can devote my energies elsewhere for the nonce.  So I shore up my centre."
16,c5,c6c5,r2qkb1r/pp1nnppp/4p1b1/2ppP3/3P3N/2P5/PP2BPPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 9,"Thematic pawn break that is often a feature of the Advance French as well.  Black strikes at the base of the pawn chain at d4.  The motivation behind this is that after ...cxd4; cxd4, White is left with a weakness at d4 that has to be defended by pieces.  On the other hand, dxc5 by White leaves the e5-pawn wanting supports.  +++++++ It is just possible Black might also be considering pushing the pawn to c4, with a view to striking at c3.  But that is a more difficult target to hit, even if the first stage of the plan is successfully carried out."
17,Be3,c1e3,r2qkb1r/pp1nnppp/4p1b1/2ppP3/3P3N/2P1B3/PP2BPPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 1 9,"Overprotecting d4, whilst keeping the f-pawn free to advance."
18,Nc6,e7c6,r2qkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2n1p1b1/2ppP3/3P3N/2P1B3/PP2BPPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 2 10,"Continuing to develop.  At this stage the GK engine gives +0.76 to White - slightly the better game, but not a whole lot in it."
19,Nxg6,h4g6,r2qkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2n1p1N1/2ppP3/3P4/2P1B3/PP2BPPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 0 10,"White is not over-concerned about the opening of the h-file, feeling that any attack that Black can contrive will be contained easily enough."

22,cxd4,c5d4,r2qkb1r/pp1n1pp1/2n1p1p1/3pP3/3p4/2P1B3/PP1NBPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 12,The GK engine now calls this +1.08 an edge for White.  That seems a bit generous.  Black is doing quite well so far.  This exchange is quite in keeping with Black's aims in this opening.
23,cxd4,c3d4,r2qkb1r/pp1n1pp1/2n1p1p1/3pP3/3P4/4B3/PP1NBPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 12,"Immediately establishing a presence on the c-file.  There were other options.  Looking at it now, I might instead have considered 13.a3, with the idea 14.Qc2 and 15.Bd3, striking towards g6."
24,Be7,f8e7,r2qk2r/pp1nbpp1/2n1p1p1/3pP3/3P4/4B3/PP1NBPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 1 13,"Immediately establishing a presence on the c-file.  There were other options.  Looking at it now, I might instead have considered 13.a3, with the idea 14.Qc2 and 15.Bd3, striking towards g6."

27,Bb5,e2b5,r2q1rk1/pp1nbpp1/2n1p1p1/1B1pP3/3P4/4B3/PP1N1PPP/2RQ1RK1 b - - 4 14,"Threatening to win a pawn, or at least to leave Black with a backward pawn flapping in the wind of the half-open c-file (e.g. 14...Rc8 15.Bxc6 Rxc6  16.Rxc6 bxc6  17.Qc2 or Nb3."
28,Nb4,c6b4,r2q1rk1/pp1nbpp1/4p1p1/1B1pP3/1n1P4/4B3/PP1N1PPP/2RQ1RK1 w - - 5 15,"Answers that threat, but the knight becomes a target."
