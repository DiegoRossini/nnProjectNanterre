1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Just to let you know that I failed to get my first ever Expert Victory - by 90 rating points!  I had to settle for only my second ever victory against 1900+ oppo. in a non-timeout game.  With the black pieces I managed a High Draw against him.  Matt gave me a hard game from the Opening to Middlegame but in the latter part, a strong move from Glenda forced an exchange of queens that led to my advantage in the endgame in which I was a piece for a pawn up.
