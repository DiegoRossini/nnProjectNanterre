Although, it does not offer much in the way of counter chances, until the later stages of the middle game. Black plays this move so that he can develop his other Knight to F6 without fear of seriously weakening is king side pawn structure.

The point is that black can not tolerate the knight on g5 for long and is force to assist the manoeuvre Ng5-f3-e5. where it will be supported by the other Knight."
