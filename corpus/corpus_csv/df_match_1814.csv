22,Bxf4,d6f4,r2qk2r/1p3ppp/p1n1pn2/3p4/3P1b2/2NBPQ1P/PP3PP1/2R1K2R w Kkq - 0 12,First I capture the darksquared bishop.
23,Qxf4,f3f4,r2qk2r/1p3ppp/p1n1pn2/3p4/3P1Q2/2NBP2P/PP3PP1/2R1K2R b Kkq - 0 12,exf4 not only ruins white's pawn structure but also hangs the d-pawn.

Alternative variation: 13. Rb1 Nb4 14. Be2 Nc2+ 15. Kf1 Rc8 [ The uncoordination of white's pieces means a very comfortable position and advantage for black.]"

Even if white wins back both pawns on the queenside the position is equal and as this play is nearly 200 points higher than me a draw is a very respectable result.

Alternative variation: 17... Rfc8 18. Rfc1 (18. Rc7 Rxc7 19. Qxc7 Qa3 [Although black's rook is not ideally placed he should win the a2 pawn and would be doing just fine.] 20. Rc1 h6) 18... Rxc6 19. Rxc6 Qb1+ [And now black wins a free piece.]"
