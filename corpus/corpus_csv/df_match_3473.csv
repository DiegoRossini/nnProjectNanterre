2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,black opens. I would of chosen Sicilian defense but that is just my preference
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"Knights Developed White- Nc3, Black- Nc6"

5,Qf3,d1f3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/2N2Q2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 3 3,"White Queen advances to F3, black counters with Nf6. At this stage and now that my Queen is out, square C2 is really appealing to black."
6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/2N2Q2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 4 4,"White Queen advances to F3, black counters with Nf6. At this stage and now that my Queen is out, square C2 is really appealing to black."
7,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/2N2Q2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 5 4,"I advance my ""bobby fisher bishop"" :) to C4"
8,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/2N2Q2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 6 5,black counters with his bishop to C5- he obviously did not see the C2 square to fork my King and Rook.
9,d3,d2d3,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/2NP1Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 0 5,White responds with advancing a pond to D3. This does a couple of things. Supports my bishop and my other pawn which is hanging out on E4 but it also opens up a line for my bishop on C1.
10,Nb4,c6b4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/2b1p3/1nB1P3/2NP1Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 1 6,Black finally sees the C2 square and moves into position with NB4.
11,Qd1,f3d1,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/2b1p3/1nB1P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 2 6,"Now this whole play looks like a wasted move on my part. But I want to force black to drag down his other Knight, so I not only can capture up but get my Queen in a more strategic place on blacks King side."
12,Ng4,f6g4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/1nB1P1n1/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 3 7,"Black takes the bait and advances to Kg4. Now at this point white really has to be careful, otherwise there could be a lot valuable material lost very quickly. Not only is square F2 very challenged, black can attack it with either his bishop and checking the King or his Knight and forking my Queen and Rook, not to mention the forking that black can do my Queen side on C2."
13,Qxg4,d1g4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/1nB1P1Q1/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 0 7,"White gets what it wanted - not only did white capture material he now has a more strategic position for Queen on blacks King side. Now,  White is still going to loose material very soon but its ok, Black does not see what white is setting up, the lure of capturing my pawn on C2 and then forking my King and Rook is too great to pass up for Black."
14,Nxc2+,b4c2,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/2B1P1Q1/2NP4/PPn2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 0 8,black forks my King and Rook by capturing the pawn on C2. I move King to D1.

17,Qxg7,g4g7,r1bqk2r/pppp1pQp/8/2b1p3/2B1P3/2NP4/PP3PPP/n1BK2NR b kq - 0 9,"Here is white's trap with C2 really begins to become noticed. The game is over at this point. White advances Qxg4 can captures pawn. Black is really in a bad position right now. 
Not only is he at risk to loosing his rook, he is unable to castle either not to mention that he has no support from other pieces (One Knight is across the board and the other taken), the only piece not locked up behind other pieces is his bishop. 

He really only has two options  at this point and neither of them are good. The game is essentially lost at this point.  He can bring is bishop back to F8 to create a buffer for his King but sacrifice the rook or move his King to E7 (not a good square for a King) so that his Queen can support the rook"
18,Ke7,e8e7,r1bq3r/ppppkpQp/8/2b1p3/2B1P3/2NP4/PP3PPP/n1BK2NR w - - 1 10,"black runs to Ke7. White could capture F7 (supported by bishop on C4) and put the black king in check but to get the checkmate done in fewer moves, white needs to capture the black Queen."
