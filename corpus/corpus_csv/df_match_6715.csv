14,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/6p1/8/2BPP3/2P5/P4PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQ - 3 8,"The standard plan for Black is to create pressure against the White centre, especially the d-pawn."

He doesn't want to push either on of his central pawns and break the phalanx formation, otherwise Black's pieces will just use the central squares as outposts and play around White's pawns."

23,Bd3,c4d3,r2q1rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/n1p5/3PP1b1/2PBBP2/P3N1PP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 2 12,12. Bxf7+ is still very much played and can be quite dangerous.
24,cxd4,c5d4,r2q1rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/n7/3pP1b1/2PBBP2/P3N1PP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 13,"The point in delaying this move is very simple. Black wants to keep the c-file closed, as White won't be able to reply to 11...Na5 with 12. Rc1"
25,cxd4,c3d4,r2q1rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/n7/3PP1b1/3BBP2/P3N1PP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 13,"A very thematic position for the Gruenfeld but one that has slowly subsided from practice because of new discoveries in the Bronstein gambit, which starts with 14. d5. I'm not that concerned about it and I'm actually looking forward to playing against it, provided an opponents accommodates me, of course."

27,Rc1,a1c1,r2q1rk1/pp2ppbp/4b1p1/n7/3PP3/3BBP2/P3N1PP/2RQ1RK1 b - - 2 14,"An old idea, White sacrifices a pawn to hold the centre. The idea is to vacate the Rook from a1 so that White can play d5 and gain space."
28,Bxa2,e6a2,r2q1rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/n7/3PP3/3BBP2/b3N1PP/2RQ1RK1 w - - 0 15,"No need to be compliant, taking the pawn is relatively safe."
29,Qa4,d1a4,r2q1rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/n7/Q2PP3/3BBP2/b3N1PP/2R2RK1 b - - 1 15,The old variation starting with 15. d5 Bb3 16. Qd2 e6 17. Qb4 exd5 18. Rc5 Bc4 19. Rxa5 Bxd3 20. Rxd5 Bxe2 21. Rxd8 Rfxd8 has fallen out of favour since Black is the only one with real winning chances. This move tries to exploit the two Black pieces that are on the edge of the board. White definitely has pressure for the sacrificed pawn.

31,Qb4,a4b4,r2q1rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/n7/1Q1PP3/1b1BBP2/4N1PP/2R2RK1 b - - 3 16,White still keeps the Queen on the Q-side to pressurize Black's position.

33,Rc3,c1c3,r2q1rk1/p3ppbp/1p4p1/n7/1Q1PP3/1bRBBP2/4N1PP/5RK1 b - - 1 17,"A relatively new try and not a bad one at that. White's idea is to double Rooks and dominate the c-file. Note that because of weak white squares on the Q-side, Ba6 is possible in some lines, thus Black is forced to accept White's domination on the c-file."
34,Be6,b3e6,r2q1rk1/p3ppbp/1p2b1p1/n7/1Q1PP3/2RBBP2/4N1PP/5RK1 w - - 2 18,"Forced, since White was threatening to exchange a Rook for two pieces."
35,Rfc1,f1c1,r2q1rk1/p3ppbp/1p2b1p1/n7/1Q1PP3/2RBBP2/4N1PP/2R3K1 b - - 3 18,White managed to double with tempo and already has ideas of infiltrating Black's 7th rank.
36,Qd6,d8d6,r4rk1/p3ppbp/1p1qb1p1/n7/1Q1PP3/2RBBP2/4N1PP/2R3K1 w - - 4 19,The theoretical recommendation and it served me pretty well in this game. Trying to simplify the position with 18...Rc8 19. Nf4 Qd6 20. Qxd6 exd6 21. Nxe6 Rxc3 22. Rxc3 fxe6 23. Bb5 leaves White with enough compensation for the pawn thanks to his Bishop pair and Black's weak pawn structure and bad Knight on a5.
37,Qa4,b4a4,r4rk1/p3ppbp/1p1qb1p1/n7/Q2PP3/2RBBP2/4N1PP/2R3K1 b - - 5 19,"Avoiding the exchanges with good motive. After the Queen swap, Black can contest the c-file and reduce White's compensation to zero."
38,Bd7,e6d7,r4rk1/p2bppbp/1p1q2p1/n7/Q2PP3/2RBBP2/4N1PP/2R3K1 w - - 6 20,"No time to wait and the more pieces are exchanged, the more the extra pawn will be felt."
