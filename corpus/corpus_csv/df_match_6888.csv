1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The ""slow"" way to start the game. I'm rather partial to the other central pawn thrust, mainly because it can lead to an overwhelming position in a very short span of time if only one move isn't accurate."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"I guess the only reason to still play 1...d5 is to reach the QGA as Black, which isn't such a bad deal, provided you're willing to suffer through the middlegame."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"The other ""slow"" move. White seizes the d5 square but does nothing for his development."
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Black prepares to fianchetto the Bishop. If I'd had to chose between this and 2...e6 in terms of objective strength, I'd go with the the latter, but in matter of preference, I'm going to stick with this one."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,Finally White develops a piece. But he's still a long way from castling.
6,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"Relinquishing control of e4, Black speeds up development and postpones the central struggle."
7,e4,e2e4,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"The whole point behind White's move order, to control the center with pawns. Stenitz would have been appalled at Black's play but dogmas have a short lifespan in chess."
8,d6,d7d6,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,Preventing an early e5 and preparing for a central pawn push.
9,f4,f2f4,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPPP2/2N5/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"Not having chosen a specific line against the KID, I decided to go with the 4-pawn attack and see how it turns out."
10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPPP2/2N5/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR w KQ - 1 6,Black castles and is ready to hit the center.
11,Nf3,g1f3,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPPP2/2N2N2/PP4PP/R1BQKB1R b KQ - 2 6,White really needs to complete development and secure the King.
12,c5,c7c5,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2p5/2PPPP2/2N2N2/PP4PP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 0 7,The classic way to meet White's central pawn mass.
13,d5,d4d5,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2pP4/2P1PP2/2N2N2/PP4PP/R1BQKB1R b KQ - 0 7,"After this, the games moves towards a Benoni structure."
14,e6,e7e6,rnbq1rk1/pp3pbp/3ppnp1/2pP4/2P1PP2/2N2N2/PP4PP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 0 8,"Black wants to open the e-file to pressurize the e-pawn. This approach is highly risky, because if Black lets his guard down and allows White to play e5, he'll have a very hard time coordinating his pieces."
15,Be2,f1e2,rnbq1rk1/pp3pbp/3ppnp1/2pP4/2P1PP2/2N2N2/PP2B1PP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 1 8,Closing the e-file and preparing to castle.
16,exd5,e6d5,rnbq1rk1/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pp4/2P1PP2/2N2N2/PP2B1PP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 9,The typical pawn exchange. Black wants to use Q-side pawns to achieve counterplay and secure a balanced game.
17,cxd5,c4d5,rnbq1rk1/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4PP2/2N2N2/PP2B1PP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 9,The symmetrical recapture doesn't promise White anything.
18,Bg4,c8g4,rn1q1rk1/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4PPb1/2N2N2/PP2B1PP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 1 10,"I think 9...Re8 would have been stronger here, but this Bishop is notoriously bad in Benoni structures so I can't blame Black for wanting to exchange it ASAP."
19,O-O,e1g1,rn1q1rk1/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4PPb1/2N2N2/PP2B1PP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 2 10,"Finally, my King is safe. Somewhat... Black can still use tricks on the a7-g1 diagonal."
20,Nbd7,b8d7,r2q1rk1/pp1n1pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4PPb1/2N2N2/PP2B1PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 3 11,"This is why Black is happy to exchange the lsb early on, his pieces would have a bad case of claustrophobia."
