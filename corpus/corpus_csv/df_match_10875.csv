 but ideally with an eye on the center."

 would not get a good exchange by doing so."
11,e3,e2e3,r1bqk2r/pppnbppp/4pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"Allows the light squared bishop to see light of day and at the same time the 
 f1 bishop supports the c4 pawn."

 good diagonal that leads towards Black's King."

 free up some space in the Queen's Gambit Declined. Black is following the 
 strategic principle that the side with the least amount of territory should
 exchange some pieces to relieve the annoying cramp."

21,Ne4,c3e4,r1b2rk1/pp1nqppp/2p1p3/3n4/2BPN3/4PN2/PP3PPP/2RQK2R b K - 1 11,"This is Alexander Alekhine's invention. The rather mature Alexander Alekhine is
 very happy to go straight into 11. Qb4   12. Qd2  Qxd2  13. Kxd2, which leads
 to a slightly superior endgame for White."

23,Ng3,e4g3,r1b2rk1/pp1nqppp/2p1pn2/8/2BP4/4PNN1/PP3PPP/2RQK2R b K - 3 12,"Swapping is really not a very good idea because all Black does is he recaptures
 with the knight and that also allows the Bishop to come to d7, gives Black some
 more space and completing his development and connecting the rooks."

 less cramped but it allows the White knight to come to f5 where it may cause
 some problems for Black."

 a future Re1 and put the Rook on the same file as the Black Queen, which can
 be fairly dangerous for Black- Big time!"
