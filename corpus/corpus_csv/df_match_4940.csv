1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"An open challenge taken up by someone who at the start was exactly the same rating as me. After reading some other annotations I was more aggressive than usual at the start and it paid off for me, though I can't help but feel it could have ended sooner."

6,exd4,e5d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,I took with my queen partly to try to surprise my opponent.

8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/8/3QP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 1 5,A calm and logical response
9,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/1B6/3QP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 2 5,"This was where I had decided to be aggressive. Although I probably shouldn't have developed my queen so early, it can make life tricky for black."
10,Bd7,c8d7,r2qkbnr/pppb1ppp/2np4/1B6/3QP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 3 6,Protecting the bishop and tempting Nb4
11,Qd3,d4d3,r2qkbnr/pppb1ppp/2np4/1B6/4P3/3Q1N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 4 6,Protecting the bishop and tempting Nb4
12,Nb4,c6b4,r2qkbnr/pppb1ppp/3p4/1B6/1n2P3/3Q1N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 5 7,"My feeling is that this isn't the best move from black, firstly because he has now moved the knight twice, secondly because he still can't castle."
13,Bxd7+,b5d7,r2qkbnr/pppB1ppp/3p4/8/1n2P3/3Q1N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 7,Again possibly not the best move but this was in keeping with my plan to be aggressive.
14,Qxd7,d8d7,r3kbnr/pppq1ppp/3p4/8/1n2P3/3Q1N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 8,If black castles soon then my queen will be staring him down the c file.
15,Qc3,d3c3,r3kbnr/pppq1ppp/3p4/8/1n2P3/2Q2N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 1 8,If black castles soon then my queen will be staring him down the c file.
16,a5,a7a5,r3kbnr/1ppq1ppp/3p4/p7/1n2P3/2Q2N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 9,I don't like this move as it weakens the kings defence if he castles on the queen side. The knight is easy to shift with a simple a3
17,O-O,e1g1,r3kbnr/1ppq1ppp/3p4/p7/1n2P3/2Q2N2/PPP2PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 1 9,getting my king safe
18,O-O-O,e8c8,2kr1bnr/1ppq1ppp/3p4/p7/1n2P3/2Q2N2/PPP2PPP/RNB2RK1 w - - 2 10,"Black looks to me to have put his king at some risk, the question is can I take advantage"
19,a3,a2a3,2kr1bnr/1ppq1ppp/3p4/p7/1n2P3/P1Q2N2/1PP2PPP/RNB2RK1 b - - 0 10,"First lets shift that pesky knight, his options are limited and if he goes to c6 he is partially obstructing the black queens mobility"
20,Nc6,b4c6,2kr1bnr/1ppq1ppp/2np4/p7/4P3/P1Q2N2/1PP2PPP/RNB2RK1 w - - 1 11,I'm still not sure that something like Be3 may have been better here.

24,f6,f7f6,2kr1bnr/2pq2pp/1pnp1p2/p7/1P2P3/P1Q2N2/2PN1PPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 0 13,"I really don't understand blacks move here, this seems rather passive and it limits the moves his g8 knight can make"
25,Rb1,a1b1,2kr1bnr/2pq2pp/1pnp1p2/p7/1P2P3/P1Q2N2/2PN1PPP/1RB2RK1 b - - 1 13,My plan of action is to open a file to give me access to the black king
26,axb4,a5b4,2kr1bnr/2pq2pp/1pnp1p2/8/1p2P3/P1Q2N2/2PN1PPP/1RB2RK1 w - - 0 14,I would say black was better leaving my pawn alone.
27,axb4,a3b4,2kr1bnr/2pq2pp/1pnp1p2/8/1P2P3/2Q2N2/2PN1PPP/1RB2RK1 b - - 0 14,And now I have a lovely a file to play with
