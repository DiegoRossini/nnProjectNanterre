1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I recently annotated a game where I was white vs the pirc defense, and I found it a lot of fun to do. So I thought I would do another, as it was a different line of the same opening, one where mistakes were made and I had ideas at the time that I think were probably not so good as I look back on them. Also a fun game, which is good."

This move is second most popular here on the databases (about 34000 to 8000) but both are seen a lot, even at high level of play. g6 leads to a sharp game where a draw is not likely, but white has an edge they can push if they play precisely. e5 is a little more drawish, challenging the center immediately with the possibilities of mass trades later in the game."

Nf3 is by far the most popular move here but I want to leave f4 as a possible move later should my opponent castle kingside. I can go queenside and push f4, h4 and get a nice attack going. The problem with that is that the light squared bishop is trapped in if I don't push g3 myself, and if I do push g3 I weaken my light squares a little on the king side. Not the worst set up, but double-edged."
8,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/3p1n2/4p3/3PP3/2N5/PPP1NPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,"And then I do it immediately after being concerned about the weakening effect. Pretty clever of me. If I'm going to do it though right away is a good idea, playing Bg2 later to defend e4 in some lines. Might allow for a Nd5."

10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/3p1n2/4p3/3PP3/2N3P1/PPP1NP1P/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 1 6,"As far as I could tell this is a novelty on the databases. I had not considered this move. The light squared bishop is black's good bishop (his pawns are on dark squares so it is the one with all the threats) and so he doesn't really want to trade it off for a knight as that would mean my light squared bishop would become an unopposed monster should the center ever open up. It is also not clear whether or not the bishop should be here or on d7 or e6, so this might waste a tempo in some lines. Of course you could just take on e2, knight has to take back and maybe play d5 and try to open lines before the king is safely castled. Without a light squared bishop and the dark squared bishop passive, opening these lines holds little venom in my opinion, but it is a possibility."

13,h3,h2h3,rn1q1rk1/ppp1bppp/3p1n2/4p3/3PP1b1/2N3PP/PPP1NPB1/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 7,"I took a very long think before playing this move. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do with my bishop, e3 or g5, and playing Nd5 doesn't really work here because Bxe2 threatens to win a pawn with Qxe2 exd4. This pawn is probably not being kept long term, but black is close to equal if not better in this position so I that seemed bad. The pin makes f4 less enticing as pawn has to take, really weakening...everything basically. I still kind of wanted to play f4 at some point and attack on the kingside so castling wasn't super exciting to me. I generally don't like to play both g3 and h3 at the same time as it gives weaker points to try to attack. I assumed he would play Be6 and at some point Qd7 with pretty good pressure aimed at the h3 square. In the end I played h3 because if he retreats I just develop and castle queenside and h3 isn't so weak with the rook staying on the h-file. Maybe I could push g4 as well to start my attack. I'm still not sure about this move, but I don't mind it."
14,Bh5,g4h5,rn1q1rk1/ppp1bppp/3p1n2/4p2b/3PP3/2N3PP/PPP1NPB1/R1BQK2R w KQ - 1 8,"?! I did not expect this response. I does maintain the somewhat annoying pin of the e2 knight and maybe allow for Bg6 with pressure against e4 in some lines, but it is inviting g4 with tempo, which was a plan that I already had. I think Be6 or d7 here is probably better, or even taking on e2 (though this seems less good all around to me). In the end I think this sequence is why 6..Bg4 is not such a good move in the first place."

I don't want to go Bg5 because it is in the way of a potential pawn advance there, and really ties me up if I try to get an attack going. I've basically decided at this point that I would go Qd2 and O-O-O at some point."

I don't think it matter if I do this pawn move or the queen move first if I'm planning to play both, but in general moving pawns is the more forceful as they can't move back if you decide it's a mistake later on so unless I see a forcing continuation then keeping options open is generally better."

I get the bishop pair if I want it as well as pressure against g7 if pop my knight in there. I could castle queenside here before playing this move but (similarly to Sicilian lines) I will attack on the kingside and black will counter on the queenside. My attack looks stronger, but the king might be safer in the middle. Maybe. Or maybe I should just castle. Not sure."

The game right now is quite sharp with black having space and a potential attack on the queenside and white having space and a potential attack on the kingside. I think white is better here as their attack is faster and they might be able to tuck the king away on f1 or g1 and be somewhat away from harm.
26,Nh5,f6h5,r4rk1/p1qnbppp/2pp2b1/1p2p1Pn/3PP3/P1N1B1NP/1PPQ1PB1/R3K2R w KQ - 1 14,"? I think this is a blunder. Lets look at the knight's good squares. That's all of them. There are none. Nf4 loses a pawn right away and the rest are attacked by pawns. This move bascially buries the knight to make matters worse, the g6 bishop means pawn g7-g6 protecting the knight isn't possible. This knight is probably doomed."
