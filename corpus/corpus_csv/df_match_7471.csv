1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is a game from the 60th GameKnot Tournament, Expert section. I was black in this game. I played quite well overall, but the game was pretty messy and one slip could have proven fatal, which is indeed what happened. Once again, comments always welcome and thank you for taking the time of going through the game."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The Grand Prix attack. Not so popular nowadays as 2.Nf3 or 2.c3, I'm not sure how it compares to other possibilities like 2.d4 or 2.Nc3."

6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/2ppP3/5P2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"I'm not so sure about this trade, to be honest, though I guess white envisioned this becoming a more closed game, where knights would be better than bishops. Also, black's light-square bishop is technically a bad bishop, but so is white's dark-squared one."

This manoeuvre is actually more common on the opposite side of the board, as in certain King's Indian variations, where black will place his knight on c5 and solidify it with a5 to prevent b2-b4."

White was probably trying to avoid a pin on the a7-g1 diagonal after a possible Qb6 and cxd4."

I decided for a less direct approach."

So, 12.Qe1 protects the e3 square and prepares Nbd2. On the downside, the queen was also protecting d4, which might come under attack after something like cxd4, Qb6 etc. Of course, black has to be wary of opening the c-file after the intended queenside castling. White might have tried 12.Qd3, protecting both e3 and d4. Maybe white wasn't sure about placing the queen and the rook on the same diagonal."

Ng3+) Ng3+! 14.Kg1 Ne4 15.Rb2 (15.Rc2 Bd3) and white's position with the fianchettoed rook is really awkward, though he should eventually untangle. It's often inadvisable to venture into tactical skirmishes before completing one's development, so 12...O-O-O it is."
