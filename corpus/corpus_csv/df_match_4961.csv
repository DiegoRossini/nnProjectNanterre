1,b3,b2b3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Nimzowitsch-Larsen attack. It's rare but I do see it occasionally
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I don't like 1...e5 simply because I feel that it's best to not put a pawn in the line of fire so early after 2. Bb2
3,Ba3,c1a3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/BP6/P1PPPPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,?! This move caught me off-guard a little. Why bring the Bishop out to a3? It's an awkward place for it. 2. Bb2 is better.
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/8/BP6/P1PPPPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,Not really taking much thought into his move. I develop normally
5,g3,g2g3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/8/BP4P1/P1PPPP1P/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"Looking to fianchetto the other bishop? Or bring it to h3 perhaps? Perhaps too extreme of a hypermodern opening, especially playing as White"
6,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3p4/8/BP4P1/P1PPPP1P/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"I feel obligated to open up g7 for the Bishop because it will make some nasty discovered attacks, should White not close the diagonal. This is why the Bishop is better on b2."
7,Bh3,f1h3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3p4/8/BP4PB/P1PPPP1P/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 1 4,?! Bringing the other bishop out to h3?  Might as well go to g2.
8,Bxh3,c8h3,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3p4/8/BP4Pb/P1PPPP1P/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,"""Knights on the rim are dim."" The knight will do far less good on h3 than on f3,"
9,Nxh3,g1h3,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3p4/8/BP4PN/P1PPPP1P/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"""Knights on the rim are dim."" The knight will do far less good on h3 than on f3,"
10,Bg7,f8g7,rn1qk2r/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3p4/8/BP4PN/P1PPPP1P/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 1 6,Admitting that his 2nd move was a waste.
11,Bb2,a3b2,rn1qk2r/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3p4/8/1P4PN/PBPPPP1P/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 2 6,Admitting that his 2nd move was a waste.
12,O-O,e8g8,rn1q1rk1/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3p4/8/1P4PN/PBPPPP1P/RN1QK2R w KQ - 3 7,"Black already has a slight edge due to the weaknesses of the light squares on the kingside. So, like any good general, let's go directly for it"
13,O-O,e1g1,rn1q1rk1/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3p4/8/1P4PN/PBPPPP1P/RN1Q1RK1 b - - 4 7,"Black already has a slight edge due to the weaknesses of the light squares on the kingside. So, like any good general, let's go directly for it"
14,Nc6,b8c6,r2q1rk1/ppp1ppbp/2n2np1/3p4/8/1P4PN/PBPPPP1P/RN1Q1RK1 w - - 5 8,"But first, I must develop my final minor piece"
15,a3,a2a3,r2q1rk1/ppp1ppbp/2n2np1/3p4/8/PP4PN/1BPPPP1P/RN1Q1RK1 b - - 0 8,Another move that I did not quite understand. White needs to stake some claim in the center.
16,e5,e7e5,r2q1rk1/ppp2pbp/2n2np1/3pp3/8/PP4PN/1BPPPP1P/RN1Q1RK1 w - - 0 9,Black happily takes the other half of the center. This is exactly a position I'd like to be in. My position is flexible enough to do anything
17,e3,e2e3,r2q1rk1/ppp2pbp/2n2np1/3pp3/8/PP2P1PN/1BPP1P1P/RN1Q1RK1 b - - 0 9,Starting to shift toward the light squares on the Kingside.

19,Kg2,g1g2,r4rk1/pppq1pbp/2n2np1/3pp3/8/PP2P1PN/1BPP1PKP/RN1Q1R2 b - - 2 10,"White's king steps up to protect the Knight and the light squares around him. However, This is a job a bishop should do!"
20,Rfe8,f8e8,r3r1k1/pppq1pbp/2n2np1/3pp3/8/PP2P1PN/1BPP1PKP/RN1Q1R2 w - - 3 11,?! Another dubious move. White's position will slowly deteriorate into a positional nightmare
21,f4,f2f4,r3r1k1/pppq1pbp/2n2np1/3pp3/5P2/PP2P1PN/1BPP2KP/RN1Q1R2 b - - 0 11,?! Another dubious move. White's position will slowly deteriorate into a positional nightmare

23,Bxf6,b2f6,r3r1k1/pppq1pbp/2n2Bp1/3p4/4pP2/PP2P1PN/2PP2KP/RN1Q1R2 b - - 0 12,Now he gives up the long diagonal!
24,Bxf6,g7f6,r3r1k1/pppq1p1p/2n2bp1/3p4/4pP2/PP2P1PN/2PP2KP/RN1Q1R2 w - - 0 13,? Better was 13. Nc3
25,c3,c2c3,r3r1k1/pppq1p1p/2n2bp1/3p4/4pP2/PPP1P1PN/3P2KP/RN1Q1R2 b - - 0 13,? Better was 13. Nc3
26,Nb8,c6b8,rn2r1k1/pppq1p1p/5bp1/3p4/4pP2/PPP1P1PN/3P2KP/RN1Q1R2 w - - 1 14,I spy with my little eye...an outpost on d3!
