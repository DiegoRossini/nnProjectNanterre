1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"So I offered skitter a choice of an Alekhine, a Caro Kann, a French, a Modern, a Pirc or a Scandinavian, and he asked for a Nimzovich. 
There's nothing obviously wrong with Nc6, except that it's never going to help Black fight for the centre in the same way as other moves.  If Black is to play ...e5 or ...d5 in the first few moves, he would rather support that pawn with another pawn, as if white plays 2.d4 e5 3.dxe5 Nxe5 the knight is potentially vulnerable, whereas after 3.d5 the knight is going to have to move anyway."

3,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/1B6/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 2,"On the one hand, White starts his development and attacks the knight, with the possibility of doubling Black's pawns, but is this the best move?  Black's first move allows White to seize the centre if he's so minded with 2. d4, or control the e5 square with 2.Nf3 or 2.f4.  Given that I didn't offer 1. ...e5 as one of my regular openings, would I really want to put myself in a Ruy Lopez or Scotch game position?"
4,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppppppp/2n2n2/1B6/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 3 3,"Black puts some pressure on the White centre, and keeps his powder dry as to what he's going to do with his central pawns."
5,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/pppppppp/2n2n2/1B6/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 4 3,White defends the e4 pawn and develops a piece.  Black has to make a decision with his central pawns which will determine where we go from here.  3.Nc3 also inhibits ...d5.
6,Nd4,c6d4,r1bqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/1B6/3nP3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 5 4,"Black's choices aren't huge here.  White was threatening to play 4.Bxc6 and 5.e5, or just 4.d4.  3. ...d6 self-pins the Nc6, so 3. ...e5 (which takes us back, after 4.Nf3, to a Berlin Defence to the Ruy Lopez) or this move are the obvious candidates.  Black takes advantage of White not having played Nf3 to try to grab the bishop pair without damaging his pawn structure, but breaks the rule against moving the same piece twice in the opening."
7,d3,d2d3,r1bqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/1B6/3nP3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 4,"Whilst I don't like moving the knight a 3rd time, the threat is 5. e5 and the only alternative is to play 4. ...e5 myself. I'm heartened by the fact that the White knight on b5 isn't going to be staying there too long."

The answer is relatively straight-forward.  Black will play ...g6, Bg7 and 0-0 where White cannot easily challenge the Bg7, the Bc8 can come to d7, e6 or g4, he can expand on the Q-side with c6, b5 etc and Bf4 ceases to cause any problems on c7."

Black now has to make a decision about how he's going to play the position:
He can play 9... c5 with a Sicilian Dragon style set up, ever mindful that White might play d3-d4 and turn it into an Open Sicilian position. 
He can play 9... e5 with the plan of playing for f7-f5 with a K-side attack.
Finally, he can play 9... c6 with a b5/a5 Q-side attack."

19,Rb1,a1b1,r2q1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/4P1b1/P1NP1N2/1PP2PPP/1RBQ1RK1 b - - 6 10,"Is this the best square for the rook?  White has to decide on a plan in this position.  He'll struggle to whip up a K-side attack, although he could try something with Be3(g5) and Qd2, followed by Bh6.  His problem is that without any half open files, he cannot easily bring his rooks into the attack.
In those circumstances, he has to look at some sort of pawn break, made more difficult by the lack of a Black pawn to target.  The most obvious are d3-d4 and f2-f4-f5.  Rb1 suggests that b2-b4 is coming, but, from Black's point of view, so what?"
