1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"So, I chose e4 to kick off with."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"A common response, e5 was played."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"I developed my knight to f3 and was looking forward to Black's next move, which was..."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"...Nc6, that protects his e5 pawn and attacks the d4 square."
5,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,"And now I didn't choose Ruy Lopez, but King's pawn game (C50)"
6,h6,h7h6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1pp1/2n4p/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,"Black prevented my 4th Ng5 move, but Be7 would do the same, but also develop his DSB."

First I thought about that he would castle kingside, and I would have an easy game because of my 2 bishops aiming at Black's kingside, and I could play other moves, or rather a move combination attacking Black's kingside, for example Nh4, O-O, f4, Qf3, or sometime Nc3 and after Nd5 to make Black's knight on f6 deal with my knight on d5. Or the other option would be that he wanted to castle queenside in more moves, and this game would be quite dynamic."
