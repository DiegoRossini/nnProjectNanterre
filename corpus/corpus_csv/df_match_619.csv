1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Here's a lucky escape against a young schoolboy who outplayed me for most of the game.  It does show the importance of hanging on in there!

12,Qb6,d8b6,rnb1k1nr/pp3ppp/1q2p3/2ppP3/3P4/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 7,"! This caught me by surprise and provoked a poor response.  Normal moves at this stage include 6...Qc7, 6...Ne7, 6...Qa5, to which I usually respond 7. Qg4."
13,Be3,c1e3,rnb1k1nr/pp3ppp/1q2p3/2ppP3/3P4/P1P1B3/2P2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 2 7,"I still wanted to play Qg4 but felt that it would be safer if d4 was secured first.  While 6. Qg4 would have maintained defence of d4, it would only have done so if I didn't want to take g7.  Other means of over-defending d4, with Nf3 of Ne2 would, of course, have prevented Qg4. In retrospect, I think I should have played 6. Qg4 regardless."
14,Nd7,b8d7,r1b1k1nr/pp1n1ppp/1q2p3/2ppP3/3P4/P1P1B3/2P2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 3 8,"Black defends c5 with a developing move, though it does block in the Bc8."
15,f4,f2f4,r1b1k1nr/pp1n1ppp/1q2p3/2ppP3/3P1P2/P1P1B3/2P3PP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 8,"? A move borrowed from the Advance Variation that is inappropriate here, with the Queenside already so seriously compromised.  The White King will have nowhere safe to go.  I was losing faith in the planned Qg4 by now, and thinking more about bolstering the centre, with 9. Nf3 to follow."
16,Nh6,g8h6,r1b1k2r/pp1n1ppp/1q2p2n/2ppP3/3P1P2/P1P1B3/2P3PP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 1 9,"! Black spots the opportunity to occupy f5 and attack the misplaced, and now undefended, Be3.  He may also have hoped to provoke g4, which I baulked at as being one pawn advance too far.  I think it would have been preferable to the mess that followed, though."
17,Nf3,g1f3,r1b1k2r/pp1n1ppp/1q2p2n/2ppP3/3P1P2/P1P1BN2/2P3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 2 9,! This increases pressure on d4 and attacks the undefended B.  I didn't want to defend the B with my Q because that would have left the Ra1 undefended ...
18,Nf5,h6f5,r1b1k2r/pp1n1ppp/1q2p3/2ppPn2/3P1P2/P1P1BN2/2P3PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 3 10,! This increases pressure on d4 and attacks the undefended B.  I didn't want to defend the B with my Q because that would have left the Ra1 undefended ...
19,Bf2,e3f2,r1b1k2r/pp1n1ppp/1q2p3/2ppPn2/3P1P2/P1P2N2/2P2BPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 4 10,This retreat enables the B to cover all the squares attacked by the N and maintains defence of d4 but has a serious negative consequence ...
20,Qb2,b6b2,r1b1k2r/pp1n1ppp/4p3/2ppPn2/3P1P2/P1P2N2/1qP2BPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 5 11,!  This premature-looking foray exposes the dire weakness of White's Queenside.  The Q can't defend c3 because the Ra1 would be left undefended.  The Bf2 can no longer come to the rescue and a K move would give up hope of castling.  A rook move would not prevent the loss of c3 and would also leave a3 undefended.
21,dxc5,d4c5,r1b1k2r/pp1n1ppp/4p3/2PpPn2/5P2/P1P2N2/1qP2BPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 11,"?! I felt that this was my best hope of attaining some sort of equality, as at least the pawn wouldn't be a further worry after the fall of the c3 pawn.  In fact, it just invited the other N to the party.  Given the lack of attractive alternatives, I can't quite dismiss this as a total blunder, though.  Perhaps 11. Bd3 would have been best, preparing castling, but, after 11...Qxc3+ Nd2 12. Ne3 would have been embarrassing."
22,Qxc3+,b2c3,r1b1k2r/pp1n1ppp/4p3/2PpPn2/5P2/P1q2N2/2P2BPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 12,! Black really makes me squirm!

26,Qxe3+,c3e3,r1b1k2r/pp1n1ppp/4p3/2PpP3/5P2/P3q3/2PN2PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 14,"Now I'm in a complete mess: loose pawns all over the place, pieces huddled in front of my king, rooks isolated and no prospect of safe castling.  The only good news is that Black is under-developed."

29,Rf1,h1f1,r1b1k2r/pp3ppp/4p3/2npP3/5P2/P3q3/2PNB1PP/R2QKR2 b Qkq - 1 15,"I was determined to get some counter-play somehow.  With castling out of the question, I had to activate my rooks and defend my pawns if possible."
30,Na4,c5a4,r1b1k2r/pp3ppp/4p3/3pP3/n4P2/P3q3/2PNB1PP/R2QKR2 w Qkq - 2 16,"!  Black doesn't worry about his development yet as he can still exploit White's cramped position with the threat of ...Nc3, forking Q and B and thereby probably winning the B and mating."
31,Rf3,f1f3,r1b1k2r/pp3ppp/4p3/3pP3/n4P2/P3qR2/2PNB1PP/R2QK3 b Qkq - 3 16,"Fortunately, I can chase Black's Q away in the nick of time."
32,Qg1+,e3g1,r1b1k2r/pp3ppp/4p3/3pP3/n4P2/P4R2/2PNB1PP/R2QK1q1 w Qkq - 4 17,I had not overlooked this move but had decided it was preferable to the aforementioned scenario.  Now I had to decide which pawn to defend and how best to free up my cramped position.
33,Nf1,d2f1,r1b1k2r/pp3ppp/4p3/3pP3/n4P2/P4R2/2P1B1PP/R2QKNq1 b Qkq - 5 17,"Now, if ...Qxg2, I can counter-attack with Qd4, having lured Black's Q off the black squares."
34,Qc5,g1c5,r1b1k2r/pp3ppp/4p3/2qpP3/n4P2/P4R2/2P1B1PP/R2QKN2 w Qkq - 6 18,"Sensibly, Black retreats to a commanding square and renews the threat of ...Nc3."
