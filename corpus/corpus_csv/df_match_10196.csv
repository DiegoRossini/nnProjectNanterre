14,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/3p1n2/4n3/3NP3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 3 8,Now the point of the pirc's defense is of the hypermordern origin. Black concedes to the center. Allowing white to build up an ideal pawn center and controlling the central squares. While black develops his minor pieces so as to  later undermine whites pawn chain. Black waits and provokes white to attack premature. I prefer Be7 to g6; Bg7
