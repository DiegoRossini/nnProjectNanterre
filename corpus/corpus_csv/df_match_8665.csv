1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"GM Miguel Najdorf's favorite game, in which he sacrifices all of his minor pieces."
2,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"?! - A dubious move - White should develop the dark-squared bishop outside the pawn chain first, i.e. 5. Bf4 as in Schlechter-John, Barmen 1905 -- another masterpiece.
Note that black was not really threatening to capture the c4-pawn, as Qa4+ would recover the pawn and leave black's e6-pawn weak and exposed to attack on the a2-g8 diagonal."

10,c6,c7c6,rnbqkb1r/pp4pp/2p1pn2/3p1p2/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"This position could also be reached from a Semi-Slav move order: 1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 (or 2...e6) 3. Nc3 e6 (or 3...c6). Black is threatening to grab the c4-pawn. Now 4. Nf3 dxc4 5. e3 b5 6. a4 Bb4 is the Noteboom variation. Or 4. e4 dxe4 5. Nxe4 Bb4+ 6. Bd2 Qxd4 7. Bxb4 Qxe4+, which is one of several gambits named after Frank Marshall. If white, plays the naturally cautious 4. e3 to defend his c-pawn, then 4...f5 transposes back to the Stonewall Dutch. The advantage of this move order for Black is that Black avoids several anti-Dutch variations, and White's dark-squared bishop is not developed outside the pawn chain as in the main game. The disadvantage of this move order, since ...Nf6 has not yet been played, is that here White's best move is 5.g4!"

The f5-pawn is defended by the c8-bishop. Therefore, White should consider 7. Qc2 - by attacking the f5-pawn again White is now threatening 8. cxd5 which in turn would force the undesirable 8...cxd5.
