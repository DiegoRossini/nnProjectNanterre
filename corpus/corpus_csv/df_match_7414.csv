1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This is a standard opening for me. i normally play this to try and lead into a vienna and a quick attacking position. sometimes it works and sometimes it can totally back fire. Its normally either this or play it safe. personally I like the risk
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"standard, this leads into vienna or ruy lopez which ever I prefer."

6,Bc5,f8c5,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 4 4,?attack on f pawn. can't move Ng4 for attack. this is only a developing move that allows castling sooner.
