1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

This is the penultimate game of The Annotation Project Part 1.  Freddy has just started Part 2 and he is currently one of my opponents.  Can I redeem myself this time? Ah well, that is the future.  This game is the here and the now and this game pushed my rating back into the 1830s.  We pick up the action on move 9. where e6 seems the most popular choice in this opening now."
