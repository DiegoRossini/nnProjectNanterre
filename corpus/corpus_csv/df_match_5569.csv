5,Qf3,d1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4P3/2N2Q2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"White try to make a surprise for Black or just don't what to play many moves in a well-known opening.
In fact so early move by a Queen usually is bad, but in this position, where Black made a nonactive c6 it is possible not losing much (only the White's opening advantage).
Possible Black answers are:
a) 3. ... de (like it was in the game)
b) 3. ... e6?! after 4.d4! Nf6 5. Bg5 Be7 6.e5 Nfd7 7. Bxe7 Qxe7 8. Qg3 0-0 White are good. So do they after 4. ... Nd7 5.ed cd 6.Bd3
c) 3. ... d4!? very active move, was tried with success by Daniel Fridman, 1996 4.Bc4 e6 5.Nce2 Nf6 6.e5 Nfd7 7.Qe4 Nb6 8.Bb3 c5 9.c3 Bd7 10.Nf3 Bc6 11.Qg4 h5 12.Qg3 h4 13. Qh3 d3 14.Nf4 c4 and White has no space. But than 3. ... d4?! was punished by Nigel Short, 2006 4.Bc4 Nf6 5.e5 dc 6.ef ef 7.dc Nd7 8.Bf4 Bc5 9. 0-0-0 0-0 10.Qg3 Re8 11.Nf3 b5 12.Bd3 Qb6 13.Bh6... But this games where between players with 400 points rating difference, so won the strongest player, not a better opening.
d)3. ... Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. d4 e6 6. Nh3 Be7 7.Qg3 g6 8.Bd3 and White has space and Black has weakness.

The one thing that unite all this lines, starting 3.Qf3 that they are not used by the top rated players, only in the games with a weak opponents."

7. ... Be6 seems to be good if 8. Qb4?! Bd5 9. f3 Qc7 10. Qc3 f5 11. Ng3 f4 12. Ne4 e5 13. b3 Nf6 and Black have a better position, but if 8. Qe2! Nf6 9. d3 Nxe4 10. de Qa5+ 11.Bd2 Qc5 12. c3 Bc4 13. Qe3 e5 White should be careful, but nothing dangerous...

7. ... Qd5 exchanging Queens 8. Qxd4 cd leads to the Blacks advantage in development 9. Nc3 e6 10. Nf3 Bd7 11. d3 Bd6 12. 0-0 Ne7 13. Re1 Rc8 Black developed better, White should be careful.

9. Qb4 Bd5 10. Nf3 Bxf3 11. gf Qc7 - Black pawns are better
