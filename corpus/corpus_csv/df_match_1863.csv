1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"?
Sacrificing a tempo this early to play d5 seems strange - especially given that white is almost always able to play d5 later in the Dutch...perhaps my opponent doesn't know the typical lines?"

Another pawn move to reinforce d5, but why c4 instead of Nf3 or g3?"

Again this pattern of pawn moves aiming at the light squares, but f3 hinders the knight and allows me to develop as normal without trouble."

I'm not sure about this move - it's obvious that I was afraid of Ng5 (which has hurt me more than once in the Dutch) - and h6 definitely keeps the knight on an irrelevant square, but it also weakens my king and does not develop anything. Maybe Qe8, Bd7, or even Na6 would have been better? Tough call. This may have been a great move - it may have also just expressed undue terror."

Maybe I'm missing something, but why switch the focus from e6 to e5 - Nf4 brings back in the horse that this pawn kept out - why block it with the same pawn AND lose tempo?"
