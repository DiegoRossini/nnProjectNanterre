1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hello folks, in a deviation from my recent string of Benoni games, here comes a good old-fashioned Sicilian. As Fred Reinfeld writes, the game quickly becomes 'an all-out struggle' in a very complicated position. Enjoy!"
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I choose the Closed Sicilian, because I'm trying to learn the Grand Prix on the White side of the board."
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"I choose the Closed Sicilian, because I'm trying to learn the Grand Prix on the White side of the board."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,"It's more usual for Black to develop with ...g6 and ...Bg7, since White tends to get a very strong hold in the center. This is certainly fine, though."
5,f4,f2f4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"It's more usual for Black to develop with ...g6 and ...Bg7, since White tends to get a very strong hold in the center. This is certainly fine, though."

10,Ng8,f6g8,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p1P3/5P2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,The one game in the World DB with this line continues 6.Bb5 d5 7.exd6 e.p. Qxd6 8.Ne5 Bd7 9.Nxd7 Qxd7 10.O-O and Black managed to hold a draw through a very complex endgame.
11,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/1Bp1P3/5P2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 6,I like 6...d5 better. White is likely to trade this Bishop for the Nc6 anyway; there's no need to provoke it right away.
12,a6,a7a6,r1bqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p1n1p3/1Bp1P3/5P2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,I like 6...d5 better. White is likely to trade this Bishop for the Nc6 anyway; there's no need to provoke it right away.
13,Bxc6,b5c6,r1bqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p1B1p3/2p1P3/5P2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,White is castled and has two pieces on the field. Black is cramped and has nothing developed--I don't envy his position here.
14,dxc6,d7c6,r1bqkbnr/1p3ppp/p1p1p3/2p1P3/5P2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,White is castled and has two pieces on the field. Black is cramped and has nothing developed--I don't envy his position here.
15,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkbnr/1p3ppp/p1p1p3/2p1P3/5P2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 8,White is castled and has two pieces on the field. Black is cramped and has nothing developed--I don't envy his position here.
16,g6,g7g6,r1bqkbnr/1p3p1p/p1p1p1p1/2p1P3/5P2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 9,"?! Black opened up a spot on g7 for his Bishop, so he should place his Bishop there. The text allows White to activate his Knight with force:"
17,d3,d2d3,r1bqkbnr/1p3p1p/p1p1p1p1/2p1P3/5P2/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 9,"?! Black opened up a spot on g7 for his Bishop, so he should place his Bishop there. The text allows White to activate his Knight with force:"
18,Ne7,g8e7,r1bqkb1r/1p2np1p/p1p1p1p1/2p1P3/5P2/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 1 10,"?! Black opened up a spot on g7 for his Bishop, so he should place his Bishop there. The text allows White to activate his Knight with force:"
19,Ne4,c3e4,r1bqkb1r/1p2np1p/p1p1p1p1/2p1P3/4NP2/3P1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 2 10,Threatening both the pawn on c5 and (!!) instant mate with Nf6!
20,Ng8,e7g8,r1bqkbnr/1p3p1p/p1p1p1p1/2p1P3/4NP2/3P1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 3 11,The Knight retreats to guard f6; the only way to avert both threats.
21,Qe1,d1e1,r1bqkbnr/1p3p1p/p1p1p1p1/2p1P3/4NP2/3P1N2/PPP3PP/R1B1QRK1 b kq - 4 11,"This move is thematic in the GPA; White's Queen prepares to shift over to f2, g3, or h4 to aid in the kingside attack."
22,f5,f7f5,r1bqkbnr/1p5p/p1p1p1p1/2p1Pp2/4NP2/3P1N2/PPP3PP/R1B1QRK1 w kq f6 0 12,"! I like this move quite a lot. Black's kingside is very exposed, of course, and he still has zero developed pieces, but this move kicks the Ne4 as well as controlling g4, and if White takes en passant, 12.exf6 e.p. Nxf6 frees Black's position immensely, though at the cost of a weakened pawn structure."
23,Neg5,e4g5,r1bqkbnr/1p5p/p1p1p1p1/2p1PpN1/5P2/3P1N2/PPP3PP/R1B1QRK1 b kq - 1 12,"I think 12.exf6 e.p. was playable here, but I wanted to go for the invasion and keep Black as crammed as possible. Plus, I was having delusions of getting my other Knight to d4 and trying to win the e6 pawn."
24,h6,h7h6,r1bqkbnr/1p6/p1p1p1pp/2p1PpN1/5P2/3P1N2/PPP3PP/R1B1QRK1 w kq - 0 13,"Yet another pawn move, but it seems natural. Black's kingside is a prickly wall of just-barely-defended soldiers."
25,Nh3,g5h3,r1bqkbnr/1p6/p1p1p1pp/2p1Pp2/5P2/3P1N1N/PPP3PP/R1B1QRK1 b kq - 1 13,"An unfortunate place for the Knight, but perhaps a well-timed g2-g4 could break open Black's shell eventually."
26,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk1nr/1p2b3/p1p1p1pp/2p1Pp2/5P2/3P1N1N/PPP3PP/R1B1QRK1 w kq - 2 14,Black quickly puts a stop to White's idea of playing Nh4 to threaten the g-pawn.
27,Qg3,e1g3,r1bqk1nr/1p2b3/p1p1p1pp/2p1Pp2/5P2/3P1NQN/PPP3PP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 3 14,"I did a lot of thinking before this move, but eventually decided to go with it because it messes with Black's position even more. The only satisfactory way to defend the pawn is ...Kf7."
28,Kf7,e8f7,r1bq2nr/1p2bk2/p1p1p1pp/2p1Pp2/5P2/3P1NQN/PPP3PP/R1B2RK1 w - - 4 15,"Around here, my opponent declared that it would be a miracle if he survived at all! While I agree that Black's position certainly leaves a lot to be desired, I don't know if it's quite that bad yet. White needs reinforcements of some kind if he's going to break Black's resistance. As I have the spacial advantage, I look for a way to switch flanks to take advantage of my superior mobility."
29,Be3,c1e3,r1bq2nr/1p2bk2/p1p1p1pp/2p1Pp2/5P2/3PBNQN/PPP3PP/R4RK1 b - - 5 15,"This seems like the most reasonable choice to me. It blocks off the diagonal to my King (though I'd like to get him to h1 soon anyway), attacks c5 to overwork the Be7, and connects my Rooks."
30,Rh7,h8h7,r1bq2n1/1p2bk1r/p1p1p1pp/2p1Pp2/5P2/3PBNQN/PPP3PP/R4RK1 w - - 6 16,"Black's kingside is gnarly, but it's still a tough nut to crack. The Knight can't move, but the Rook can still be brought up to defend g6. Meanwhile, White needs to reorganize his own forces to make them useful again."
