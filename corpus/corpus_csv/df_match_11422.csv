1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The King's Pawn opening, my personal favorite.

2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,The French Defence.  The pawn on e6 will support a pawn on d5.
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Rather than threatening to win a pawn with 3) ... Bb4, black decides to solidify d4 further.  The potential downside to this opening is that black's light-square bishop will be very restricted if the center closes up."
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Rather than threatening to win a pawn with 3) ... Bb4, black decides to solidify d4 further.  The potential downside to this opening is that black's light-square bishop will be very restricted if the center closes up."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"Rather than threatening to win a pawn with 3) ... Bb4, black decides to solidify d4 further.  The potential downside to this opening is that black's light-square bishop will be very restricted if the center closes up."
6,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Rather than threatening to win a pawn with 3) ... Bb4, black decides to solidify d4 further.  The potential downside to this opening is that black's light-square bishop will be very restricted if the center closes up."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3p4/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,Developing the knight and possibly preparing an eventual Bg5.
8,Ne7,g8e7,rnbqkb1r/pp2nppp/2p1p3/3p4/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,"Although this move seems strange at first, it's the only real spot for the knight, since it could be kicked out of the f6 square after white plays e5.  The knight will soon move to g6, freeing up black's dark-square bishop."
9,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqkb1r/pp2nppp/2p1p3/3p4/3PP3/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 5,Developing the bishop to eye h7 after an eventual e5.
10,Ng6,e7g6,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1p1n1/3p4/3PP3/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 4 6,Completing the knight maneuver and freeing the dark-square bishop.
11,e5,e4e5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1p1n1/3pP3/3P4/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"Leaving the database and closing up the center, thus restricting the mobility of black's light-sqare bishop.  My own light-square bishop is now poised for an eventual kingside attack."
12,b5,b7b5,rnbqkb1r/p4ppp/2p1p1n1/1p1pP3/3P4/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"This move seemed a bit strange to me at first.  However, it does a couple of things for black.  First, it expands on the queenside.  Second, it gives black's light-square bishop room to develop.  Third, it has the possibility of attacking my knight on c3 with the move b4."
13,O-O,e1g1,rnbqkb1r/p4ppp/2p1p1n1/1p1pP3/3P4/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 7,"Black prepares to castle as well.  I think that b4 is the better square for the bishop, but the bishop on e7 is still a farily solid defensive structure."
14,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/p3bppp/2p1p1n1/1p1pP3/3P4/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 8,"Black prepares to castle as well.  I think that b4 is the better square for the bishop, but the bishop on e7 is still a farily solid defensive structure."
15,Be3,c1e3,rnbqk2r/p3bppp/2p1p1n1/1p1pP3/3P4/2NBBN2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 3 8,Developing the bishop and allowing me two options: Qd2 and Nd2.
16,Nd7,b8d7,r1bqk2r/p2nbppp/2p1p1n1/1p1pP3/3P4/2NBBN2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 4 9,"Rather than commit his king immediately by castling, black decides to develop his second knight."
17,Nd2,f3d2,r1bqk2r/p2nbppp/2p1p1n1/1p1pP3/3P4/2NBB3/PPPN1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 5 9,"This move prepares the pawn thrust f2-f4, and also potentially prepares the knight maneuver Nd2-b3-c5, taking advantage of the weak square in black's position.  Of course, this knight manuever is more of a potential threat than an immediate threat, since both his knight and his bisop currently guard c5."
18,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/p2nbppp/2p1p1n1/1p1pP3/3P4/2NBB3/PPPN1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 6 10,"Now that black's king is committed to the kingside, I can start my kingside attack."
19,f4,f2f4,r1bq1rk1/p2nbppp/2p1p1n1/1p1pP3/3P1P2/2NBB3/PPPN2PP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 10,"Now that black's king is committed to the kingside, I can start my kingside attack."
20,f5,f7f5,r1bq1rk1/p2nb1pp/2p1p1n1/1p1pPp2/3P1P2/2NBB3/PPPN2PP/R2Q1RK1 w - f6 0 11,"Closing the pawn structure and preventing f4-f5, as well as shutting off my light-square bishop from the attack."
21,Qh5,d1h5,r1bq1rk1/p2nb1pp/2p1p1n1/1p1pPp1Q/3P1P2/2NBB3/PPPN2PP/R4RK1 b - - 1 11,"Although this move looks aggressive, there aren't any immediate threats behind it.  The most immediate threat is that of Rf1-f3-h3, attacking h7.  I now no longer have the possibility of exf6 ep, but I had a different plan for dealing with the pawn on f5."
22,Bb4,e7b4,r1bq1rk1/p2n2pp/2p1p1n1/1p1pPp1Q/1b1P1P2/2NBB3/PPPN2PP/R4RK1 w - - 2 12,Threatening to double my pawns on the c-file.
23,Ne2,c3e2,r1bq1rk1/p2n2pp/2p1p1n1/1p1pPp1Q/1b1P1P2/3BB3/PPPNN1PP/R4RK1 b - - 3 12,This move both removes black's threat of doubling pawns and starts to bring my knight potentially into the attack.
24,Qh4,d8h4,r1b2rk1/p2n2pp/2p1p1n1/1p1pPp1Q/1b1P1P1q/3BB3/PPPNN1PP/R4RK1 w - - 4 13,"With the kingside pressure inevitably mounting, trading off queens to reduce pressure is a good idea for black."
25,Qxh4,h5h4,r1b2rk1/p2n2pp/2p1p1n1/1p1pPp2/1b1P1P1Q/3BB3/PPPNN1PP/R4RK1 b - - 0 13,"I considered a move like 13) Ng3 (which probably would have been better), but I decided that I would have enough pressure to form an attack even without the queens on the board."
