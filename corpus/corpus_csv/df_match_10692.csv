1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I realize neither this game nor I am particularly good. I just wanted to annotate something for my own benefit.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,The best response to e4 in my opinion. e5 tends to turn into an uninteresting game.
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"A bit unexpected, but playable. Better would be to stick to theory and play Nf3."
4,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3pP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Natural move.
5,Qxd4,d1d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 0 3,Develops with tempo.
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 1 4,Develops with tempo.
7,Qe3,d4e3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/4P3/4Q3/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 2 4,"Preparing to fianchetto the bishop, seems like a sound decision."
8,g6,g7g6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/8/4P3/4Q3/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"Preparing to fianchetto the bishop, seems like a sound decision."
9,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/1B6/4P3/4Q3/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 1 5,"? Not completely sure what this accomplishes, although it does develop a piece and applies pressure towards the king."
10,Bg7,f8g7,r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/1B6/4P3/4Q3/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 2 6,Following through.
11,Bxc6,b5c6,r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2B3p1/8/4P3/4Q3/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 0 6,Better to develop more pieces than to trade mindlessly.
12,dxc6,d7c6,r1bqk1nr/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/8/4P3/4Q3/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 0 7,"Opens up a file for the queen, and later the rook. As well, keeps the pawn islands."
13,e5,e4e5,r1bqk1nr/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/4P3/8/4Q3/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 0 7,"Slightly premature pushing of the pawn, although it does block off the bishop nicely."
14,Bf5,c8f5,r2qk1nr/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/4Pb2/8/4Q3/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 1 8,Develops other bishop while attacking at the same time.
15,Na3,b1a3,r2qk1nr/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/4Pb2/8/N3Q3/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 2 8,Awkward way of defending the pawn.
16,Qc7,d8c7,r3k1nr/ppq1ppbp/2p3p1/4Pb2/8/N3Q3/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 3 9,Threatening the e pawn as well as making way for the rook to come through.
17,Nf3,g1f3,r3k1nr/ppq1ppbp/2p3p1/4Pb2/8/N3QN2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 4 9,"Solid move, prepares to castle, defends the pawn, develops a piece."
18,O-O-O,e8c8,2kr2nr/ppq1ppbp/2p3p1/4Pb2/8/N3QN2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 5 10,"I decide the queenside is safe for castling, and since it activates the rook at the same time, it seemed like a good move."
19,Ng5,f3g5,2kr2nr/ppq1ppbp/2p3p1/4PbN1/8/N3Q3/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 6 10,Threatening a fork that is hard to defend against.
20,Nh6,g8h6,2kr3r/ppq1ppbp/2p3pn/4PbN1/8/N3Q3/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 7 11,"I debated playing Bg6 instead, but thought the bishop would have a strong diagonal once the e pawn is gone."
21,Nxf7,g5f7,2kr3r/ppq1pNbp/2p3pn/4Pb2/8/N3Q3/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 0 11,Blunder as far as I know.
22,Nxf7,h6f7,2kr3r/ppq1pnbp/2p3p1/4Pb2/8/N3Q3/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 0 12,Best way of defending the pawn.
