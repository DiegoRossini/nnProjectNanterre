18,Nxe7,c6e7,r1bq1rk1/ppp1nppp/3p4/8/4Q3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN2KB1R w KQ - 0 10,Easy take.
19,Ng5,f3g5,r1bq1rk1/ppp1nppp/3p4/6N1/4Q3/8/PPP2PPP/RN2KB1R b KQ - 1 10,At this point the plan is to get my queen to h7 for checkmate.

27,Kd1,e1d1,r4rk1/ppp1qpp1/2np3p/5BN1/7Q/8/PPP2PPP/RN1K3R b - - 2 14,I saw this as a better play because then my h1 rook could get into play faster than my a1 rook could.
28,Qf6,e7f6,r4rk1/ppp2pp1/2np1q1p/5BN1/7Q/8/PPP2PPP/RN1K3R w - - 3 15,This forces the king to h8 from there I could move my bishop and the pawn on h6 would be unable to take my knight on g5. And also protected by the knight it could stay there and keep the pressure on black.
