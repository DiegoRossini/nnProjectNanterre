1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,".The opening resulted in a very closed game, were both sides avoided exchanges, until black decide for a centre pawn break with 11...d5 and after white's move decided to precipitate the action by exchanging the pawns, then instead of dealing with white threats (black had a pawn hanging and a knight pinned), black decided for an unneeded move 13.h6 after which white took the initiative and due to a cramped camp by black with lack of connection between pieces, white went on to win the game."
