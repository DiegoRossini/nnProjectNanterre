2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"This is quite a complex endgame; indeed, it could almost be called a queenless middlegame, given the number of pieces on the board. The principal feature which grabs one's eye is the weakened black kingside pawns. Black has well-placed pieces, and the possibility of tying White down somewhat to the defence of the a3-pawn. The pawn on e3 could also come under attack. Overall, White is somewhat better, because the black kingside pawns are the most serious weakness on the board, but it requires great technique to show this. Carlsen, despite being aged just 14 when this game was played, handles the position as well as
any of the great endgame masters could have done, even in their prime."
