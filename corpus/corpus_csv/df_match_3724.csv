1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"?! The key move of the controversial Latvian Gambit. Very rarely seen at high levels, Black gives up a pawn (and usually much more) for a lead in space and development."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"?! The key move of the controversial Latvian Gambit. Very rarely seen at high levels, Black gives up a pawn (and usually much more) for a lead in space and development."

5,d3,d2d3,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"Personally, I don't think White can safely decline this gambit, especially with such a passive move. That said, I see this all the time. More widely accepted are 3.Nxe5, 3.Bc4 and 3.exf5."
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/2n5/4pp2/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,Essentially a waiting move. Black develops and waits for White to commit to an attack... or not.
7,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/2n5/4pp2/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,"White is playing passively, so Black goes immediately on the offensive."

10,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/pppp2pp/2n2n2/4pp2/1b2P3/2NP1N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 5 6,"Preparing to castle long. White should be looking for a way to develop his KB soon, probably to g2 or maybe h3 at this point."

16,Bc5,b4c5,r1b1k2r/ppp1q1pp/2np1n2/2b1pp2/4P3/P1NP1N2/1PPBQPPP/2KR1B1R w kq - 1 9,Black would have nothing to gain by trading off this Bishop on c3 right now.

This gives up the bishop-pair, opens the g-file for Black's Rook, and gives Black doubled f-pawns that are more of a strength than a weakness. I don't see any justification for this move--g2-g3 followed by Bh3 is stronger, I think."
21,Bxf6,g5f6,r3k2r/ppp2qpp/2npbB2/2bNpp2/4P3/P2P1N2/1PP1QPPP/2KR1B1R b kq - 0 11,"?

Perhaps White is trying to play Be2 and make some action on the kingside? Even if so, I think he would be better served by playing h3 and g4. His position is hopelessly disjointed right now."
25,Qc2,e2c2,2kr3r/ppp2q1p/2npbp2/2bNpp2/2P1P3/P2P1N2/1PQ2PPP/2KR1B1R b - - 2 13,"? I don't know what this is intended to accomplish.
