This is an English Opening (1.c4), and can turn into independent lines only found in the English, or can transpose into one of many different types of KID. If you play 1.c4, your opponent can play 1...c5, and in fact there is a ""Symmetrical English"" mainline that goes for about 10 moves with Black exactly copying White.
Here, if you play 3.e4 then I pretty much have to play 3...d6 (to prevent 4.e5) so this will commit me to some sort of KID setup. If you instead play the ""normal"" 3.d4 then I have another option in 4...d5, the Grunfeld Defense, which is extremely tactical. Playing 3.Nf3 keeps options open for both sides but also limits your choice of attacks against a possible KID setup (for instance, the Averback Attack would not then be possible for you, but plenty of other stuff would be). After this 3.Nf3 Black could then choose all sorts of other stuff based on 4...c5 (a Benoni or a delayed Benko Gambit for instance. I think Grandmasters like Reti and recent Soviet champion Gulko used to play stuff like 3.b3 here too, but I don't know much theory."

I'm weighing d4 versus Ng3. d4 feels good in that I can gain control over more of the center and in response to the impending e4, I have the flexibility of either guarding or pushing d5 to make it difficult for you to develop you queen knight. Also it opens up my bishop file which can lay the groundwork for an attempted exchange with your king-side bishop. I would be a little concerned about defending all those pawns, but not unduly so. Ng3 has the advantage that I can castle sooner, but I don't feel any pressure at all to castle yet, so I think it can wait. I'm not sure if there are other moves I should consider, or lines that I should be looking further down."

By the way, THIS is the absolutely critical stage where both players decide on their strategy for the next many moves. Don't just play any old move at this point. You have committed to Qside expansion with the great move b2-b4, and there are many ways to continue, just try to form the long term plan for your piece placement now.
I recall that Walter Korn in MCO13 didn't like my move Ne8 here, but I disagree. It has been played by Kasparov and it has many good points; the fact that it doesn't inhibit the c4-c5 advance (like it would on d7) is a weakness, but White can force c4-c5 in any case, so I'm not concerned about that.
One setup for White is Be3, Ne1, f3, Nd3 and c5. Another involves Ba3, Qb3, c5 and Nb5. Another is to play on the Kside after f7-f5 by Ng5 and if f5-f4 then Bg4. There are many more as well."

Okay. Let's start looking for tiny chinks in your armor. Your rook on f8 is terribly immobile. Possibly I could exert pressure on it through the a3-h8 diagonal if I could depose your d6 pawn. Your queenside pawns are a little backward, if I could gain control of the b file and again depose your d6 pawn, placing a pawn on c5 with R on b1, then I could constrict your queenside development (forcing B to guard b7). Your knights are backward. I do not know how to take advantage of this. A pawn on c4 would block all movement for your e7 knight, but not worth exposing my king..."

That reasoning all sounds good. I'm playing a safe move to keep the N (or B) out of g5, because my plan for playing f7-f5 is messed up by 10...f5 11.Ng5 f4 12.Ne6 BxN 13.dxe Rf6 14.c5 etc. My move ...h6 is very slow and gives you the initiative on the Qside, but it is the safest way to continue a clear plan without making the tactics too muddy. Comming up: Kh8 (getting the K off the White Q's curent diagonal), f7->f5->f4, Rg8, g6->g5->g4, Ne8->f6->h5, Ne7->g6->h4....attack!!!...um, if you don't kill me on the ignored Q-side first :)"

I've convinced myself that the crux of my attack must be against d6. If I can unlodge d6 and remount an attack against the center (e5) before your pawns come raining down then I feel I might have a chance. It feels like a race that is critically hinged on timing. I was looking for moves that might hinder your attack, but the best defense I can come up with is a quick counterattack.

I like the moves you are making. Your thinking corresponds to how I understand White's strategy in the KID. the things that are different that I see here are this: Normally, White's K knight moves immediately to allow for f2-f3 strengthening the center. I came very close to switching tactics here and taking in the center, but I want to prepare a little bit more for it. With Rf7 I can close the center (f5-f4) or open it (f5xe4), I block the diagonal between K and Q and I prepare to play the B to f8 where it will eventually help protect d6.
----------------------
Ok, so after your Bishop move I decided to take in the center for various reasons: 1) Because you left the Knight on f3 and didn't try to support the center with f2-f3, my ""normal"" KID attack of f5-f4 then a pawn storm doesn't really work. 2) Again, due to not moving the Knight from f3, yu have built up a very strong initiative on the Q-side and if I just go about ""business as usual"" then I am surely going to be behind when the attacks start to show their teeth. Lastly, quiet development by me could have tactical problems (ie, 13...Bf8? 14. Nxe! dxe 15.d6  -).

That threat is not going away and the tide of the game is returning to central control (e.g. the long black diagonal). Tactically, if dxN, I will fight for the pawn and threaten your bishop with Bb2. I think I'm okay with a knight exchange followed by fxN. If you do it immediately, then Ne6 _, fxe loses the knight? With no black pawn to block the e file, I can advance and with say Bd3 and Qc2 threaten g5 (which looks hard to defend). Does that seem reasonable?"

These kinds of positions where Grandmasters either resign because they can see it's clearly lost or they agree to a draw because they see it is clearly drawn. Guys like us duke it out just trying to find our way through the minefield of blunders.
Here are some things I know about this type of position: 1) If I can trade all the pawns off the board one for one, then I can sac my B for your last remaining ""extra"" pawn because R B vs R is a theoretical draw (unless my King position is exceptionally bad). 2) The ""same-colored"" Bishops make it harder for me to draw than ""opposite-colored Bishops"" would. 3) There are strange material-down endings that I can shoot for in some variations that are theoretical draws....one of these is trading everything off the board except for the 2 Rooks and your a and h pawns, as long as they aren't very advanced I can supposedly hold the draw 2 pawns down.
---------------------------->;I wrote all of that while you were playing 36.d6. This is definitely the move that was coming....I just didn't know when it would come. If you have calculated out a way to push the pawn through, then clearly it is the right move. If not, then it is a very committing move, as now the B cannot defend it anymore on a Black square. I expected Kh2 or Kf2 to be consistent with your h3 move. In one line it makes a big difference: 37.Rb5  Kf6 38.Rd5 Bd7 39.Ba4? at first looks very strong, except for now 39...Rc1  (because the K is still ""checkable"") 40.Kf2 BxB 41.d2 Bxd2 42.RxB and pawns are now equal."
