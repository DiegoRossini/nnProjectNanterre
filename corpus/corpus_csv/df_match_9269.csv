1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,basic opening
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,queens gambit ( played this a few times.... got a feeliong he'll take this )!!
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,queens gambit ( played this a few times.... got a feeliong he'll take this )!!
4,dxc4,d5c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2pP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,oh i'm surprised - not lol
5,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2pPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,thought of knight c3 but then thought try to gain control of the centre with king pawn
6,b5,b7b5,rnbqkbnr/p1p1pppp/8/1p6/2pPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,expected this move had it recently against other player.  not keen on it hence my previous thought knight c3 which i have played before. obvious he's defending his pawn
7,a3,a2a3,rnbqkbnr/p1p1pppp/8/1p6/2pPP3/P7/1P3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,did this to allow my knight out to c3 without him being able to force me to move it again by moving to b4
8,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/p1p1pp1p/6p1/1p6/2pPP3/P7/1P3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,wasn't expecting that - i think this is to attack a1 rook with bishop whilst defending h8 rook
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/p1p1pp1p/6p1/1p6/2pPP3/P1N5/1P3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 5,continue with my knight c3 move attack his pawn forcing a defensive move and protects king pawn as secondary measure
10,Bd7,c8d7,rn1qkbnr/p1pbpp1p/6p1/1p6/2pPP3/P1N5/1P3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 6,i suspect this is to protect pawn whilst keeping pawn defense intact
11,Qf3,d1f3,rn1qkbnr/p1pbpp1p/6p1/1p6/2pPP3/P1N2Q2/1P3PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 3 6,perhaps not the best move but bring this out for a cheeky attack on king via f7 pawn.  mproviding of course i can get some kind of back-up without him noticing
12,c6,c7c6,rn1qkbnr/p2bpp1p/2p3p1/1p6/2pPP3/P1N2Q2/1P3PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 0 7,mmmm think now that this was previously planned on bishop move---I think now he may have expeceted queen move. i think this is to protect an attack on his a8 rook with my queen
13,a4,a3a4,rn1qkbnr/p2bpp1p/2p3p1/1p6/P1pPP3/2N2Q2/1P3PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 0 7,maybe another ambitious move to attack pawn forcing either a take or bypass to allow me to capture c4 pawn with my bishop or if he leaves it i'll take it anyway pawn for pawn and expose my rook in process
14,Qa5,d8a5,rn2kbnr/p2bpp1p/2p3p1/qp6/P1pPP3/2N2Q2/1P3PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 1 8,not at all what i wanted traps my knight. This has put a bit of pressure on me now. I assume this is the intention. This will now also prevent me taking his pawn.
15,Be2,f1e2,rn2kbnr/p2bpp1p/2p3p1/qp6/P1pPP3/2N2Q2/1P2BPPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 2 8,Best bet now for me is to make room ready for castleing and try to see his intentions---
16,Bg7,f8g7,rn2k1nr/p2bppbp/2p3p1/qp6/P1pPP3/2N2Q2/1P2BPPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 3 9,expeceted this move soon
17,e5,e4e5,rn2k1nr/p2bppbp/2p3p1/qp2P3/P1pP4/2N2Q2/1P2BPPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 0 9,Needed to protect d4 pawn also c3 knight and a1 rook. I think this is best way as it also pushes me up the board sort of attack and defense in one
18,e6,e7e6,rn2k1nr/p2b1pbp/2p1p1p1/qp2P3/P1pP4/2N2Q2/1P2BPPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 0 10,Not sure on this move i think this is just to stop my pawn advancing any further
19,Nh3,g1h3,rn2k1nr/p2b1pbp/2p1p1p1/qp2P3/P1pP4/2N2Q1N/1P2BPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 1 10,speaks for itself allowing room for castling
20,Ne7,g8e7,rn2k2r/p2bnpbp/2p1p1p1/qp2P3/P1pP4/2N2Q1N/1P2BPPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 2 11,oh i see should have realised really allows knight out---is this to castle or attack c3 knight ?? I'll assume castle as i have queen to protect knight and can still move bishop to d2
21,O-O,e1g1,rn2k2r/p2bnpbp/2p1p1p1/qp2P3/P1pP4/2N2Q1N/1P2BPPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 3 11,alas i can castle !! will he ?
