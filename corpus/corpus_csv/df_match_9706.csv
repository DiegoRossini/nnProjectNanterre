1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,good response - get a foothold and open Q and B lines
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,good response - get a foothold and open Q and B lines
3,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,thats unusual but ok - N out first is better
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 3,good response - develop with a threat
5,d3,d2d3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 3,another good developing move
6,Bc5,f8c5,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 4,another good developing move
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 4,At best this is a wasted move. We have all made this move - once. The reasons why not - 1. it encourages white to develop while defending easily by 0-0  2.  N is vulnerable here and will have to spend another move to get back to f6 (two free moves for white) 3. it loses N and a pawn for B if white plays Bxf7  4. it neglects development  for an inconclusive attack
8,Ng4,f6g4,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/2B1P1n1/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 3 5,At best this is a wasted move. We have all made this move - once.

9,Bxf7+,c4f7,rnbqk2r/pppp1Bpp/8/2b1p3/4P1n1/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"there is no need for white to grab the pawn, he can continue with development and stay comfortably ahead. But anyway !"
10,Kxf7,e8f7,rnbq3r/pppp1kpp/8/2b1p3/4P1n1/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 0 6,This is a really bad idea. It makes no sense for K to go walking in open country especially with QxN coming next.
11,Ng5+,f3g5,rnbq3r/pppp1kpp/8/2b1p1N1/4P1n1/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQ - 1 6,This is a really bad idea. It makes no sense for K to go walking in open country especially with QxN coming next.

13,Qxg4,d1g4,rnbq3r/pppp2pp/6k1/2b1p1N1/4P1Q1/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 0 7,"The blunder that kills off black. Any other Q move works (sort of !) (except QxN) but the discovered check was obvious, so its a matter of looking at the possible damage a free N move can cause (really, white can cash-in his 2 free moves here). Kg6 lost at least a piece but Qf8 turned it into loss of Q."
14,Qf8,d8f8,rnb2q1r/pppp2pp/6k1/2b1p1N1/4P1Q1/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 1 8,"The blunder that kills off black. Any other Q move works (sort of !)
