The ones I had to decide between in the end were e5 and d5. Both look good for white, but e5 has various very tactical lines. d5 locks the position, and the game develops slower. i think that the advantage is more sure with d5, but would be slow to convert into anything tangible. it would most probably be followed by d6, and exchange of the bishop for knight by black on c3. With e5, black's best reply seems to be cxd4. Bxf3 is also good. After Bxf3, white's pawns double, exposing the king on an open g file. After cxd4, white could play exf6 or Bxh7, both of which look good. Probably moving the c knight at some point would be a good idea, to avoid black exchaninging it for a useless bishop."

Nxf6 definately looks the better of the two. After that white can decide about what to do with black's threat of cxd4. Options would include Ne4, Ne5, a3, Bxh7 etc.."
