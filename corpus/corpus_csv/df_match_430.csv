I do not play the Sicilian very much, but I do play against it quite a lot.  Regardless, it's always good to try something new now and again.  Appreciate your comments so we can all get better together."

An important ""general"" rule of thumb is to get your power pieces in play and don't overmove them.  Also, while trading pieces for advantage is part of the program, if you trade away too many pieces you won't have anything to work with to attack/defend."

In retrospect, Nxe4 is likely better, because at worst it lets me trade queens and and best I get some significant material advantage."
