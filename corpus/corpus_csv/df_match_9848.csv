1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"A40 Queen's Pawn Opening. The Queen's Pawn opening move is somewhat slower than the popular e4, because White will not be able to castle for three more moves. Its advantage is that it gives White more control over tactical surprises and often provides more lasting initiative and pressure."

18,g5,g7g5,r2qk1nr/pp1b1p1p/8/b2QP1p1/8/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 10,Justin's note:  I think you were doing fine up until this move.. pretty much moved it out there for me to take it without being able to really protect it. Possible better move options: Ne7 to cover your king & attack my queen.. or Bc6 to attack my queen(possibly swap queens) or Qc7 to unpin your bishop protecting your queen if you wanted to not swap queens
19,Nxg5,f3g5,r2qk1nr/pp1b1p1p/8/b2QP1N1/8/2P5/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 10,Threatens checkmate (queen captures pawn at f7) and isolates Black's pawn at f7 and Black's pawn at h7.
