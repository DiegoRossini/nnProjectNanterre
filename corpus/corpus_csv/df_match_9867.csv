1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,In this game black deviates from normal lines immediately and pays a heavy price. This game is an instructive game that demonstrates what happens when you move your queen out too early.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"This a blunder. For one it hampers blacks development of the G-Knight. Second this is not the queens ideal developing square. Usually, the queens ideal developing squares are c7, e7, d7 or a5. As a rule the queen should be one of the last pieces to be developed"
