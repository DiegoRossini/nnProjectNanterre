1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"APCT Chess ... French Defense, Winawer Variation Pawn Variation without 3.e5 
* * * * * * *
Each of three games played by Eric and I have opened with 1.e4 with my Black Defenses being this French, and an Accelerated Dragon. His Black was the Ruy Lopez Berlin Variation (3...Nf6 without playing ...a6 there). Each game has been highly interesting to me and theoretical yet displaying new ideas. 

I think this game was really quite the clash, both tactical and theoretical. And why shouldn't it be? The WT player is a highly rated otb FM and author of a book on the French Defense that was so important as to overturn the assessment of another BL mainline, making it practically (or more likely ""actually unplayable..."") unplayable for BL. And BL is a specialist in the French Defense, then at the peak of his game with performance results exceeding 2400 at this point of career, in the French. And BL has a new move begging to be tried, which fortuitously is in the very variation that WT is begging to try! This is a real slugfest of a game, so bear in mind also that it is played at a time when computers were dogs and could not beat a well prepared Class postalite, or likely even survive! 
If you are wondering why Eric was Expert at the time, well I do too. Just from the games he and I have played, it is clear he has high Master level knowledge of the game, positionally as well as tactically. (The Sicilican we played makes clear his positional abililty to not only play ""the rules"" but at a higher level as well, and play the ""exceptions"".) And is a very aggressive player as well. I suspect that he was giving up some potential rating points in a quest to get into lines he wished to try out, perhaps for publication in his works.
I never asked, but that is my theory. And besides that, the game & ratings are from APCT which was a very strong USA organization; probably the strongest if one goes by the results of the 1st National Team Championship where APCT finished a solid first place ahead of USCF, CCLA & others. Anyway, I do hope you enjoy the game!  }8-) Craig"

6,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/1b1PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"Bb4 signals this is a Winawer Variation (of the French Defense). Most common now, and objectively stongest IMO is 4.e5 which leads me most often into the mainline Poisoned Pawn Var. of 4...c5 (or 4...Ne7) 5.a3 Bxc3  6.bxc3 Ne7 (or ...Qc7 or even ...Nf5 if Ne7 previously played.) then 7.Qg4 and BL would now sac his g & h pawns to play against WT's center pawns immediately instead. If I had the WT pieces that is. 
     Sometimes I will vary with 4.Nge2 de4 5.a3 line, in which Black can try to hold his extra pawn or else give it back instead and spend his time bolstering his own center, which can then become a good one. 
     Or I might try the line with 4.e5 c5 5.Bd2 sometime, tho i have not yet done it in a rated corr. game. 
      The other lines for WT I am not very impressed with, although the one with 4.Qg4 seems solid enough, it is hardly enterprising imo. And Fischers postitional line without Qg4, which plays Nf3 instead, does not suit my abilities nor inclinations well."
