1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"As white, I open with the e pawn nearly all the time."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I know this is the Scandinavian Defense. It has been played at the highest levels, with some success. I don't know if it's in favor now, but this much I do know: I've never respected black's first move. Because to me, he invariably has to waste a tempo in repositioning the black queen. Now the flexibility in the opening, with opportunites for transitions to me has never been worth the tempo. Since I pay little attention to variations of basic openings, I just develop normally and play the board. That's probably why I'll never be a really really good chess player. But I have beaten some really good chess players! Go figure. Anyways, I just distrust anything that to me seems not so efficient. There, diatribe all done. ;)"
3,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"As white, my play is likely too passive, but I'll explain my reasons for the moves I choose."
4,Qxd5,d8d5,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"As white, my play is likely too passive, but I'll explain my reasons for the moves I choose."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"This I have seen countless times as white, so I assume this is all book. But from this point, I have no idea what is or is not book. I've seen enough to know that black can get a kingside attack that I don't like as white, so I do something a little odd. Here is the thing for me: It's a given that black is going to reposition the queen. SO why chase it? It's going to move anyways, so I'd rather spend the extra move to do something a little odd with one of my own pieces..."

7,Be2,f1e2,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/q7/8/2N5/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 3 4,"Perhaps it's passive, but I'm going to take two moves to do something with my bishop here."
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/q7/8/2N5/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 4 5,"Not exactly the safest place for the bishop, but it does a few things I want it to do."
9,Bf3,e2f3,rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/q7/8/2N2B2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 5 5,"Not exactly the safest place for the bishop, but it does a few things I want it to do."
10,c6,c7c6,rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/q7/8/2N2B2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,"I think Black must be following book moves here, because he's created as usual a place for his Queen to escape to. But from this point on, I am simply going to develop, and invite black to attack my kingside. Now, with this pawn structure, I would think black would wish to castle kingside. As I said, I don't know the book lines. But in the game, that's not what black ultimately does."
11,Nge2,g1e2,rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/q7/8/2N2B2/PPPPNPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"Just developing. Not the best place for the knight, I know, but you'll understand what I will do in a bit."
12,Bf5,c8f5,rn2kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/q4b2/8/2N2B2/PPPPNPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 7,Looks like good developing move for black.
13,d3,d2d3,rn2kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/q4b2/8/2NP1B2/PPP1NPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,"Freeing up the dark-squared bishop, and controlling c4 and e4, for the moment. I have no plan yet, just developing and castling soon."
14,e6,e7e6,rn2kb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/q4b2/8/2NP1B2/PPP1NPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"I kind of expected that. I've seen that, and ...Nd7 a number of times in this position."
15,O-O,e1g1,rn2kb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/q4b2/8/2NP1B2/PPP1NPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 8,So now the white Kingside has a nice big target painted on it.
16,Nbd7,b8d7,r3kb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/q4b2/8/2NP1B2/PPP1NPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 9,"Yeah, yeah. What is black's plan now? I am still not sure. So let's make a few moves to find out."
17,Nd4,e2d4,r3kb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/q4b2/3N4/2NP1B2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 3 9,"This is a probe. The knight is heading to b3, but I want to see if black wishes to hang onto his white bishop. It's an empty threat, really. But it will tell me something. Also,  black could play an immediate Ne5 which would result in the loss of the white bishop. He probably should have done that."
18,Bd6,f8d6,r3k2r/pp1n1ppp/2pbpn2/q4b2/3N4/2NP1B2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 4 10,"Wow. He's really ready to give up the white bishop. Is that in the book moves? Problem is, I don't want to take it with this knight even though it would remove some of the current pressure on white's king. Because I played passively, my pawn structure is more cramped, and for the early midgame, I want to hold onto my knights longer, especially since I've invited black to attack on the kingside. I don't need another pawn over there coming down. (Nxf5 pxf5) If black wishes to crash down on my kingside, he's going to need a bit more umphh, and I'm not going to help him do it."
19,Nb3,d4b3,r3k2r/pp1n1ppp/2pbpn2/q4b2/8/1NNP1B2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 5 10,"Well other than taking the bishop, which some of you will say I should have (fine, I know, I know) I instead put it here, because I am going to want to control d4."
20,Qc7,a5c7,r3k2r/ppqn1ppp/2pbpn2/5b2/8/1NNP1B2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 6 11,"Now I recently played a game where my opponent ignored such a threat, and he paid for it. I won't do the same thing."
21,h3,h2h3,r3k2r/ppqn1ppp/2pbpn2/5b2/8/1NNP1B1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 11,"Black should consider a sacrifice now to open the King side up, and pressure my King. Despite my knights way on the other side of the board, I wonder if such an attack right now, which was not made, whether it would have had me scrambling the rest of the game. I'll never know now, unless one of you choose to analyze this position for black."
22,O-O-O,e8c8,2kr3r/ppqn1ppp/2pbpn2/5b2/8/1NNP1B1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 12,"Looks like black will attack on the Kingside. Wow, look at all those pieces bearing down on my kingside, or about to. And the pawns will join in, with rooks behind them. RIGHT now black needs to aggressively go for it. But, he does not."
23,Be3,c1e3,2kr3r/ppqn1ppp/2pbpn2/5b2/8/1NNPBB1P/PPP2PP1/R2Q1RK1 b - - 2 12,"Ha, I don't want a7. That will just lose the bishop, and I'd say despite my knights, black could defend the loss of the pawns. But in a while, I'll sacrifice a knight against those black queenside pawns. A little analysis here would have been interesting to see if after Bxa7 b6 Bxb6 and black recaptures with the knight, if there would be anything white could do to take advantage of the lack of pawns there. Instinctively I think not; but again, I don't have a computer to do any analysis with. Anyone out there that wishes to do that, you're welcome to."
