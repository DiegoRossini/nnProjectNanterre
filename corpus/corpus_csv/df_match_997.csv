1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Dieharder (Chris), a Class D player, wanted somebody to annotate one of his games.  Well, I will do my best to step up to the plate here.  I thought I would choose a hard earned victory over a Class C 1400 player as this can potentially be a lot of meat for the Inquest Jury to feast on.  The game starts with 1. e4, of which black responds c5.  This is the Sicilian Defense, folks!  Also, here is the gameknot analysis version: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=22951308&rnd=0.8785890754382095"
