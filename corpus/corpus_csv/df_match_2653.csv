7,Nxd5,c3d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3N4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"An exposed queen, but the only developed piece on the board, is not so bad. I bet that I can handle this."

9,Nf3,g1f3,rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"Good. My queen's threats on e5 are not to be undervaluated. No hurry now to hunt the queen, that has its safe square already in mind: a5 and (after c6), Qc7. White will occupy the center in the meanwhile, but black is still solid and has an easy developement (Bf5 and Nd7. The bishop is to be exchanged, mainly."
10,Bf5,c8f5,rn2kb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3q1b2/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,"I can delay my c6 plan a move, thanks to the missing white knight. Now I threat Qe4+ and Qxc2 (Nd4, QxQ etc.)."
11,Be2,f1e2,rn2kb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3q1b2/8/5N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 6,"Again, without pushing but calmly developing."

13,O-O,e1g1,rn2kb1r/pp2pppp/2p5/3q1b2/8/5N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 7,"The spare tempo that helps black to catch up somewhat in developement. 
I had to decide here if e6 or e5. Both are possible, and it is not clear to me which is better. The decision has to be made in a number of similar position, so it is not easy to address. c5 is aggressive, but also blocks black's own pieces from an useful square and diagonal. e6 is more solid, and goes for a quiet game. Slighlty too defensive for my taste, but hey, I'm playing black against a 1900+ so...
Besides, in both lines, the idea is to resist to Nh4 with Bg6, that is, accepting to have it exchanged to absorb the force of the white's attack and opening an useful semiopen h column."
14,e5,e7e5,rn2kb1r/pp3ppp/2p5/3qpb2/8/5N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,"What the hell! 1900+ or not, I won't play as chicken! :-))).
Seriously. I hadn't too much time to calculate, but I swore everything was under control, and that white has handable attacks only. True or false?"
15,Re1,f1e1,rn2kb1r/pp3ppp/2p5/3qpb2/8/5N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq - 1 8,"Ok, that does look threatening, but still it is hard for white to break in. If d4, e4. And the other pawn able to break the black center is the f one. If it moves, white's king gets somewhat exposed. And black is castling-minus-two only, so white must hurry if he wants to attack. This is a good start. 
Now black: on the agenda is Bc5. Or Bd6, if the point to be attacked will be h2. This will happen after white's exchange of the knight for my lsb. So it is better for me to wait white's intention and release the dsb's developement a little, while I have useful moves like..."
16,Nd7,b8d7,r3kb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p5/3qpb2/8/5N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQR1K1 w kq - 2 9,"I doubt that in the previous move I could have tried to provoke white's knight manouver with e4, but then I said: ""Why lose a tempo, if I can get it for free?"" White is going right into it. The best thing I can do is to develop. If c4 (white seems not in a hurry to play it, but you must be aware all the time: the escape route forthe queen is still safe and open? Now it is, for sure, but after 9. c4, which will be the proper place for her? a5, d6 or e6?)"

18,O-O-O,e8c8,2kr1b1r/pp1n1ppp/2p5/3qpb2/8/3P1N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 1 10,This brings a rook on a vital column. White's queen has not it easy to move if white insist in not playing c4.
19,Be3,c1e3,2kr1b1r/pp1n1ppp/2p5/3qpb2/8/3PBN2/PPP1BPPP/R2QR1K1 b - - 2 10,"Well, this is known. You know, I don't have to worry because of Bxa2, because after b6, I win it for two pawns. My king gets exposed, but white has not it easy to get serious attack (?). Anyway. The right thing to do is to take advantage of this move to complete my developement."
20,Bc5,f8c5,2kr3r/pp1n1ppp/2p5/2bqpb2/8/3PBN2/PPP1BPPP/R2QR1K1 w - - 3 11,"The natural Nc4, that avoids white's exchange, and keeps my dsb, looks attractive, but in fact I kind of ""lose a tempo"" for developement. And I sensed that in this position, developement is first black's need. White is almost forced to accept the exchange, unless he wants to release all the tension with d4 (but a good player won't retreat of his earlier decision so easily). 
The alternative is Be7, avoiding the ""Knight manouvre"" against my lsb. But in fact I am not disgusted if white plays it, so why take a dangerous way with Bd7, Bxa2? 
Ah. Kb8, to defend a7... is a passive move. Not the required one if black wants to survive."
21,Nh4,f3h4,2kr3r/pp1n1ppp/2p5/2bqpb2/7N/3PB3/PPP1BPPP/R2QR1K1 b - - 4 11,At last! The Knight Maneuvre!
22,Bxe3,c5e3,2kr3r/pp1n1ppp/2p5/3qpb2/7N/3Pb3/PPP1BPPP/R2QR1K1 w - - 0 12,"Ok, a mistake. Maybe. But think. I prefer to have a pawn in e6 that a freeway to the white rook. Since I can actually handle e4 (can you see it? Am I right?), is a good moment to play it. The attack on f2 was only a dream, so better to forget it. I have in mind to keep control of the game, and this accomplishes that purpose. If white goes 12. NxBf5 instead, black must think hard about Bxf2+, and if 13. KxB, maybe something can be done starting with e4. This is for homework... :-)"
23,fxe3,f2e3,2kr3r/pp1n1ppp/2p5/3qpb2/7N/3PP3/PPP1B1PP/R2QR1K1 b - - 0 12,"This is probably the best way to handle Bg4 by white. If I go Be6, White would press me with Bg4, and I can't exchange (After QxB+, I think white has better game because of Bf3), This way, white will go Bg4, and if the knight leaves, black can play f5. In the meanwhile, black has in the agenda Kb8, to unpin the knight, and white can't do much about it (Is this true or false?)"
