1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,e4 classic!
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"and so the sicilian. i dont know if i followed all the proper lines to call it that but id like to know where i couldve replied better in some circumstances,"
3,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,"my opponent goes with the bishops opening,"
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 3,i decide to develop my knight over possibly playing e6 or d6 and i didnt want to invite an e5 with a move like nf6
5,a3,a2a3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/2B1P3/P7/1PPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 3,"hmm passive reply? i had no intention of going nb4 anytime soon but i am planning to push queen side and i liked this move,"
6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/2p5/2B1P3/P7/1PPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 4,last game i played with c5 start. i did a post game analysis and it judge my mistake to be when i played g6 on move 5 or 6 to try to get a square for my DSB on g7. and so i told myself i ill avoid that situation for as long as possible and look to move my bishop out through e6 and then Be7
7,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/2p5/2B1P3/P1N5/1PPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 2 4,more development + pressure on d5 and covering e4
8,a6,a7a6,r1bqkb1r/1p1ppppp/p1n2n2/2p5/2B1P3/P1N5/1PPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,"and here i thought i could get a jump on my queen side pawn push as i thought he would play nf3 next and i could then kick his LSB with b5 and after his LSB move play e6, also prevented his knight or LSB from going to b5.  is e6 first preferable or is my line of thought logical?"
9,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkb1r/1p1ppppp/p1n2n2/2p5/2B1P3/P1N2N2/1PPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,anticipated

11,Ba2,c4a2,r1bqkb1r/3ppppp/p1n2n2/1pp5/4P3/P1N2N2/BPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"anticipated. i thought he would remain on that diagonal after having opened a3, i guess he anticpated these 2 pawn moves when he played a3 on move 3."
12,Bb7,c8b7,r2qkb1r/1b1ppppp/p1n2n2/1pp5/4P3/P1N2N2/BPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 7,"and so before playing e6 i thought i could activate my LSB. is this ok? i thought he would either castle or try some sort of attack with his knight on g5. which i would consider a loss of time, or maybe finally play d3"
13,Ng5,f3g5,r2qkb1r/1b1ppppp/p1n2n2/1pp3N1/4P3/P1N5/BPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 7,he opted with the option i prefered.

15,d3,d2d3,r2qkb1r/1b1p1ppp/p1n1pn2/1pp3N1/4P3/P1NP4/BPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,he gets in his d3 before he castles
16,Be7,f8e7,r2qk2r/1b1pbppp/p1n1pn2/1pp3N1/4P3/P1NP4/BPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 9,and my development is nearly complete all is left is to castle
17,Nf3,g5f3,r2qk2r/1b1pbppp/p1n1pn2/1pp5/4P3/P1NP1N2/BPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 9,hmm retreats the knight and i dont even have to play a move like h6.
18,O-O,e8g8,r2q1rk1/1b1pbppp/p1n1pn2/1pp5/4P3/P1NP1N2/BPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 3 10,and so i castle
19,O-O,e1g1,r2q1rk1/1b1pbppp/p1n1pn2/1pp5/4P3/P1NP1N2/BPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 4 10,"castle reply!  the board is set, i didnt play the g6 mistake like last game. ive got some nice high pawns queen side. but im in uncharted territory and to be frank. i have 0 clue where to start my attack from here, lol."
20,Nd4,c6d4,r2q1rk1/1b1pbppp/p3pn2/1pp5/3nP3/P1NP1N2/BPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 5 11,mistake?  my thought is i didnt think he would trade out knights. i liked having my knight on a high outpost to start my assault.  but i think this move starts a fire that gets out of my control and costs me alot of material. and puts me in a fight where i got to climb out of a deep hole the rest of the game. but i get to put out this fire with 1 last stomp of a move in the end!
