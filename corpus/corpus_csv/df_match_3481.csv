1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I am no longer an e4 player due to the monster of theory that is the sicilian defence. I have sadly gone the way of opening with the more quiet d4 and have adopted the colle system nowadays. However this game was agreed as being a Danish Gambit accepted so I need not worry about 1 ...c5

6,dxc3,d4c3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4P3/2p5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,(0.08)
7,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1P3/2p5/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 4,(-1.21) Gambiting the second pawn.
8,cxb2,c3b2,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1P3/8/Pp3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,(-1.29)
9,Bxb2,c1b2,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1P3/8/PB3PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,(-1.13) This is the starting position of the game. I used to play the Danish Gambit as white on the odd occasion and still do in blitz chess. This opening is a relic from the olden days of romantic chess. It doesn't have a refutation i'm aware of but if black exchanges early on and defends well he will have the superior endgame.
10,Bb4+,f8b4,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/8/1bB1P3/8/PB3PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 1 6,(-1.17)
11,Nd2,b1d2,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/8/1bB1P3/8/PB1N1PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 2 6,(-1.37) This is slighlty better than 6. Nc3 because it leaves the b2 bishop active surveying the a1-h8 diagonal where the white king will be castled.
12,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/8/1bB1P3/8/PB1N1PPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 3 7,(-1.45)
13,Qb3,d1b3,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/8/1bB1P3/1Q6/PB1N1PPP/R3K1NR b KQkq - 4 7,(-3.43) This creates a battery aiming at f7 and also threatening black's dark squared bishop. I was also trying to tempt ...Nxe4.  The computer says this is a blunder suggesting 7. Ngf3 O-O 8. O-O d6 9. a3 Bc5 10. e5 dxe5 11. Nxe5. The computer evaluates black as having a moderate advantage here.
14,Bxd2+,b4d2,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/8/2B1P3/1Q6/PB1b1PPP/R3K1NR w KQkq - 0 8,"(-3.59) Black exchanges removing one of his only developed pieces instead of retreating or defending the bishop, this does have the positive of forcing my king to recapture losing castling rights and leaving it in a central position wide open to attack."
15,Kxd2,e1d2,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/8/2B1P3/1Q6/PB1K1PPP/R5NR b kq - 0 8,"(-3.51) I'm feeling uneasy with my king positioned here especially considering the strength of my opponent, but there is no alternative."
16,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/5n2/8/2B1P3/1Q6/PB1K1PPP/R5NR w - - 1 9,"(-1.97) I can see the logic in this , castling early to protect the king and trying to avoid grabbing more pawns at the expense of development howvever better is 8... Nxe4+ 9. Kc2 O-O 10. Nf3 Nc6 11. Bd5 Nf6 12. Bc3 d6 13. Bxc6 bxc6 leaving black with a large queenside majority and white with an exposed king and no realistic attacking threats as compensation."
17,e5,e4e5,rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/5n2/4P3/2B5/1Q6/PB1K1PPP/R5NR b - - 0 9,"(-3.83) My immediate thought here was to remove the Kings Knight the only piece defending the king-side. The computer analysis says this is a  MISTAKE better is  9. Qf3 d5 10. Bxf6 dxe4+ 11. Bxd8 Rxd8+ 12. Kc3 exf3 13. Nxf3 Nc6 14. Ng5 Ne5, however this leaves black with a decisive advantage. To be fair though with good defence by black, white should not be able to win from here."
18,Ne4+,f6e4,rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/2B1n3/1Q6/PB1K1PPP/R5NR w - - 1 10,(-3.51) The only alternative is 9...Ng4 but 9...Ne4+ immediately challenegs the king while also centralising the knight and attacking f2.
19,Ke3,d2e3,rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/2B1n3/1Q2K3/PB3PPP/R5NR b - - 2 10,"(-3.67) Computer; Defending f2, chosen as opposed to Ke1 because I didn;t want to block communications between my rooks witha nother piece. INACCURACY 10. Ke1 Qh4 11. Qc2 Nxf2 12. Nf3 Nd3+ 13. Kf1 Nb4 14. Rd1 is better apparently."

21,Qc2,b3c2,rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/8/2n1P3/2B5/4K3/PBQ2PPP/R5NR b - - 4 11,(-4.36) Still aiming at the kingside
22,Qg5+,d8g5,rnb2rk1/pppp1ppp/8/2n1P1q1/2B5/4K3/PBQ2PPP/R5NR w - - 5 12,(-2.34) Black is wasting time here with a pointless check and allowing me to parry by marching one of my kingside pawns up the board. Comp: MISTAKE 11... d5 12. Rd1 c6 13. Bb3 Qa5 14. Bc3 Qb5 15. Kd2 Bg4 16. Nf3 leaves black with a strong grip in the centre and only one piece behind in development and obviously two pawns up.
23,f4,f2f4,rnb2rk1/pppp1ppp/8/2n1P1q1/2B2P2/4K3/PBQ3PP/R5NR b - - 0 12,(-2.42)
