My first game against this opponent was annotated on 6/29/09 as Throw It All Away: http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/throw-it-all-away?gm=24895. That was the game I won despite, at one point near the end, my opponent having rook+bishop+6 pawns vs. my rook+4 pawns - definitely one of my favorite games ever. And now this one, not quite a spectacular, but hard-fought right down to the end. My opponent plays the Open Game and I match him, giving him the reins to pick his opening."

So, I went with the option that gets played by masters and has the lowest incidence of draws."
