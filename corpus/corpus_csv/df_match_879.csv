1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,My usual (will I ever change?).
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,My usual (will I ever change?).
3,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Accepted, which is best for white but much more tactic and complicated to play..."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"This is recommended instead of Qxd4, which leads to a ""hanging queen"" that will be easily targeted for white while developing. That's true. I still hold some hopes about the Qa5 or Qe4+ moves, but if more experienced players say they are bad... they probably are. This one seems just to gambit a pawn, because white can assure it by f4."
5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 3,"If 13. f4 instead, black is known to have enough compensation after e6, 14. dxe6, Bxe6, followed by Bb4, Ne4 etc. White will be forced to play defensively. I expected 14. Nc3 or 14. Nf3, which allow e6 (the so-called Icelandic Gambit), a line I am experiencing with. BUT I seldom or never faced this natural move. OF course, I can just take the pawn. But this gets me out of my ""confort line""."
6,Nxd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3n4/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 4,"Incredible, but it was the first time I faced this situation. Could I have simply played Nb6? NO!, because of Bxf7+, KxB, Ne4+, with a very strong attack for the piece (still better that what came later). The right move here is Bg4 (now!), prepared to exchange it, or just e6 - provided black manages to develop his lsb on b7 or a6."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3n4/2B5/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"Incredible, but it was the first time I faced this situation. Could I have simply played Nb6? NO!, because of Bxf7+, KxB, Ne4+, with a very strong attack for the piece (still better that what came later). The right move here is Bg4 (now!), prepared to exchange it, or just e6 - provided black manages to develop his lsb on b7 or a6."
8,Nf4,d5f4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/8/2B2n2/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,"?! Counterintuitive, antideveloping, etc. I just thought that normally this move can't be played because white's dsb guards f4, and the white K is castled... but not now. Of course, this move leaves white Bxf7+, KxB, Ne5+... winning, if I remember well some good games from great players in similar positions."
9,O-O,e1g1,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/8/2B2n2/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 3 5,"White goes for the easy way. I have to stop WN jump, and I don't like f6 at all. At the same time, I was considering what would be needed to make of h3 a sac point, either for N or B. When returning into the game"
10,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/8/2B2nb1/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 4 6,"?? Now I can clearly see it, as I did when analyzing the position. Then, I re-opened the board and played mechanically. After the move, I realized what had I done, and... paid for the consecuences."
11,Bxf7+,c4f7,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pBpp/8/8/5nb1/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 6,By the B move I just offered white another piece to munch after the N check. Kd7 is useless too because of Ne5+...
12,Kxf7,e8f7,rn1q1b1r/ppp1pkpp/8/8/5nb1/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 0 7,Could Ke8 or Kf6 be better?
13,Ne5+,f3e5,rn1q1b1r/ppp1pkpp/8/4N3/5nb1/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 1 7,Could Ke8 or Kf6 be better?
14,Kg8,f7g8,rn1q1bkr/ppp1p1pp/8/4N3/5nb1/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 2 8,Could Ke8 or Kf6 be better?
15,Qxg4,d1g4,rn1q1bkr/ppp1p1pp/8/4N3/5nQ1/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB2RK1 b - - 0 8,The problem for black is to prevent Qe6#... and the N is hanging!
16,Qd4,d8d4,rn3bkr/ppp1p1pp/8/4N3/3q1nQ1/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB2RK1 w - - 1 9,"Fearing f3, planning Nh6+. Against any answer, QxN."
17,Qf5,g4f5,rn3bkr/ppp1p1pp/8/4NQ2/3q1n2/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB2RK1 b - - 2 9,"Threatening the N and Qf7#, but allowing Ne2+. But this check is useless. Let's make room for my K."
18,h6,h7h6,rn3bkr/ppp1p1p1/7p/4NQ2/3q1n2/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB2RK1 w - - 0 10,? Allowing shortly ahead Ng6.
19,Nc3,b1c3,rn3bkr/ppp1p1p1/7p/4NQ2/3q1n2/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 1 10,"Passive, but in this situation, for white almost any move is good! This forbids Ne2+, but for black there are more urgent issues to assess. I would have gone f3 instead, followed by N4. True is that after Ne2+, Kh1, NxB, RxN, White loses his dsb but still has a better position."
20,e6,e7e6,rn3bkr/ppp3p1/4p2p/4NQ2/3q1n2/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 0 11,"Now that my K has an escape square, I can play this tricky move. It accomplishes a lot of things: forces white into react instead of attacking (Qf7+, Kh7, and...?). Opens the way for the dsb. Cuts white's support of d7 (so my N can came out). About countermoves: if Nb5, Qb6, QxN, QxN."
21,Qf7+,f5f7,rn3bkr/ppp2Qp1/4p2p/4N3/3q1n2/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 1 11,"""As you wish, Sir..."""
22,Kh7,g8h7,rn3b1r/ppp2Qpk/4p2p/4N3/3q1n2/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 2 12,"Nf3 could go now e4-f6#. I thought that the ""natural"" Nd5 just loses to Ng6 or Qxe6, so I had to find something else:"

24,Bd6,f8d6,rn5r/ppp2Qpk/3bp2p/4N3/3q1n2/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 1 13,"The plan is to recover my N with his, unravel a little my pieces, and force white away. If 13. Be3, QxN."
