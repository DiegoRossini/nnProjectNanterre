2,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I know, it's too early to jump to conclusions, but I already know that my opponent is about to play his new favourite opening - the Hippopotamus Defence, a very solid, flexible and sometimes aggressive hypermodern system. He made this discovery in a recent Daily Telegraph (UK) chess column by Malcolm Pein, entitled ""Try the Hippo on for Size"". He has already scored 2 victories over me with this opening. However, I believe I have found an effective way to test the Hippo to its fullest extent."

4,b6,b7b6,rnbqkbnr/p1p1pppp/1p1p4/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"The Hippopotamus is a very restrained opening, advancing pawns to a6, b6, d6, e6, g6 and h6, fianchettoing both bishops and developing the knights to d7 and e7. Black reserves the option to castle on either side, and has the possibility of leaping into the attack on either side when White commits himself by castling."

My own, personal maxim is that :::--- the greatest test for a Hypermodern opening is playing against Classical play."

One of the main ideas in the Hippopotamus is to reserve the option for a long time to castle on either side, and, quite apart from that, Black has castled right into a thunderstorm. How could anyone believe that the kingside, with my bishop raking through it, and no dark-squared bishop to cover the holes, is safe?"
