After an ignominious defeat against Ardin (Sonata) in which I dropped 18 rating points I was really chuffed when I got the result of Gameknot Analysis for this game.

Well, first of all, read the following analysis     http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15713503&fb=1&rnd=0.48895922418947063 then read on ...."
