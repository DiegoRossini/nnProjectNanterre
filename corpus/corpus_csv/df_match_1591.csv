4,exd4,e5d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3pP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,I have practiced heavily against this move. I like the opening because the queen can be easily forced away.

7,Qe5+,d4e5,rnbqkbnr/p1pp1ppp/1p6/4Q3/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 1 4,Excalibur usually plays 4.Nc3... so this was a surprise. White decides on pushing the queen ahead. 4...Ne7 is forced since 4...Be7? leads to 5.Qxg7... +/-  and 4...Qe7 allows 5.Qxc7... +/-
8,Ne7,g8e7,rnbqkb1r/p1ppnppp/1p6/4Q3/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 2 5,"White's play is active, and pressurises my own development. However, with calm moves, I can react sufficiently."

11,Qc3,e5c3,rnbqkb1r/p1ppn1pp/1p3p2/1B6/4P3/2Q5/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 1 6,"White's knight is clearly aiming at d4 and f4. Therefore, I must find a way to counter him on these squares. Also, one deficiency in my setup is the open nature of my kingside. Hence, I will be castling queenside."
12,Nbc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/p1ppn1pp/1pn2p2/1B6/4P3/2Q5/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 2 7,"White's knight is clearly aiming at d4 and f4. Therefore, I must find a way to counter him on these squares. Also, one deficiency in my setup is the open nature of my kingside. Hence, I will be castling queenside."

However, 11.Nb3... is met with 11...Qe7 - threatening the e4-pawn. This means both sides are somewhat static."
