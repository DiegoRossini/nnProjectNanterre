1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Smith-Morra Gambit--something I like to try to open the game up right away. White gives up a pawn to get very active pieces on good squares.

6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/8/3pP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,But Black isn't having it!
7,cxd4,c3d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,cxd4? Nf3 was probably best to keep the gambit alive.
8,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"Striking back at the center for equality, although taking the pawn before is better just to make me prove I know what I'm doing."

13,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 7,Qe7?! Not good--probably looking to trade queens.
