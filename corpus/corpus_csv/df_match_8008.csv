1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I am just showing some of the first few games I played here. Note the opening I totally screw up because I was on autopilot nimzo-indian/bogo-indian mode, as 2. Nc3?! is a questionable move allowing 2. d5! transposing back into a QP opening where white cannot play the Queen's Gambit, basically giving Black at least equality."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,?! 2. c4 or 2. nf3 is normal
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 2,?! 2. c4 or 2. nf3 is normal

5,e4,e2e4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"Benoni-like, no c-pawn on c4 though. Oddly enough, white plays 4. Nf3 and Black responds 4. cxd4 leading to a sicilian! 

Another interesting idea is 3. d5 leading to a french. c5 invites white to overextend himself, similar to the Nim. variation of the sicilian."

10,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/4P3/3Q4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 1 6,"? Drops material. Qf4 is better, and not Qe3 Ng4!

6. Qf4 forces black to move the Knight on f6 back to the lonely g8 square. The best continuation, which gives white a nice spacial advantage and a temporary lead in development, while Black has the plan of attacking the e5 pawn and harassing the white Queen."

13,Bf4,c1f4,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/4n3/Q4B2/2N5/PPP2PPP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 1 7,?! Does not do anything to help protect the b5 square do to the pin on the pawn. But it does create tactics that white has to be careful of. Mainly the unpinning of the pawn and the idea of b5.

17,Nb5,c3b5,r1bqkb1r/1p1p1ppp/p1n1pn2/1N6/Q4B2/8/PPP2PPP/2KR1BNR b kq - 1 9,?! White has a nice cramp on the black position. A move like 9. Nf3 which stops 9. e5 blocking the bishop leaves black with problems.
