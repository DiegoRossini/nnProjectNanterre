This move cost me a pawn, but only if White allows me to open up the g-file. It was careless if I'm honest, I hadn't analysed the position enough and did not see that White could take the lead."

Key move. I think it's bad, though I might be wrong. It certainly allowed my WS Bishop to dominate later proceedings. Omus even said straight after that perhaps he shouldn't have played this move. Of course, being a pawn up, I can understand why he would want to further weaken my pawn structure whilst simplifying the board, but he certainly misses this Bishop later."

That's the move he was hoping I wouldn't make! Omus even said he hoped I had gone too early, though if I waited, he would play R(a)e1 and tidy up his position nicely. Also, this move makes it easier for my WS Bishop to dominate, as White no longer has a piece he can trade it for without giving me the lead."

My initial analysis suggested this line would take me to an endgame featuring either the two Queens and me with a two pawn lead, or an equal material endgame with just Kings and pawns, with my King winning the race to the other side. But this analysis may be flawed, and perhaps I would only have found myself a pawn up with a lot of work still to do. Still, I'd rather have had the two Bishops than the extra Rook.
In case you hadn't noticed, Kg1 was not an option, or mate in two with Bh2 , Kh1, Bxg2#"
