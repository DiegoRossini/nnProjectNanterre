1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Welcome to the second game in this English Opening series between ptitroque and I. He crushed me the first game, but I've got the White pieces this time, so let's see if I can turn it around: what I *can* promise is an interesting game! Enjoy!"
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"The exact move order is very fluid, but I do usually like to fianchetto at least this Bishop, to better contest d5."
3,g3,g2g3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2P5/6P1/PP1PPP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"The exact move order is very fluid, but I do usually like to fianchetto at least this Bishop, to better contest d5."
4,e5,e7e5,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2P5/6P1/PP1PPP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"We're still 'on-book'. The position is basically a reversed Sicilian Dragon, now that the exchange in the center is complete."
5,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2P5/6P1/PP1PPPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 3,"We're still 'on-book'. The position is basically a reversed Sicilian Dragon, now that the exchange in the center is complete."

9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3np3/8/2N3P1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 5,I don't like this retreat a whole lot; I think Black could just as well play 5...c6 or 5...Be6 and maintain his claim to the center.
10,Nb6,d5b6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/1n6/4p3/8/2N3P1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 2 6,I don't like this retreat a whole lot; I think Black could just as well play 5...c6 or 5...Be6 and maintain his claim to the center.
11,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/1n6/4p3/8/2N2NP1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 6,White prevents a Bishop/Knight from landing on b4 and prepares for a b2-b4 push himself--a thematic move in this opening.
12,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/1nn5/4p3/8/2N2NP1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 4 7,White prevents a Bishop/Knight from landing on b4 and prepares for a b2-b4 push himself--a thematic move in this opening.
13,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/1nn5/4p3/8/2N2NP1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 5 7,White prevents a Bishop/Knight from landing on b4 and prepares for a b2-b4 push himself--a thematic move in this opening.
14,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/1nn5/4p3/8/2N2NP1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 6 8,White prevents a Bishop/Knight from landing on b4 and prepares for a b2-b4 push himself--a thematic move in this opening.
15,a3,a2a3,r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/1nn5/4p3/8/P1N2NP1/1P1PPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,White prevents a Bishop/Knight from landing on b4 and prepares for a b2-b4 push himself--a thematic move in this opening.
16,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/ppp1bppp/1nn5/4p3/8/P1N2NP1/1P1PPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 9,"This serves to keep Black from occupying c5, and threatens a b4-b5 push, dislodging the Nc6 and disrupting the Black center as a result."
17,b4,b2b4,r1bq1rk1/ppp1bppp/1nn5/4p3/1P6/P1N2NP1/3PPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 9,"This serves to keep Black from occupying c5, and threatens a b4-b5 push, dislodging the Nc6 and disrupting the Black center as a result."
18,Be6,c8e6,r2q1rk1/ppp1bppp/1nn1b3/4p3/1P6/P1N2NP1/3PPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 10,"With two goals: keep Black out of b3, and give more potency to the queenside push."
19,Rb1,a1b1,r2q1rk1/ppp1bppp/1nn1b3/4p3/1P6/P1N2NP1/3PPPBP/1RBQ1RK1 b - - 2 10,"With two goals: keep Black out of b3, and give more potency to the queenside push."
20,a6,a7a6,r2q1rk1/1pp1bppp/pnn1b3/4p3/1P6/P1N2NP1/3PPPBP/1RBQ1RK1 w - - 0 11,Black locks up the minority attack on the queenside for now.
21,d3,d2d3,r2q1rk1/1pp1bppp/pnn1b3/4p3/1P6/P1NP1NP1/4PPBP/1RBQ1RK1 b - - 0 11,"Preparing to develop the Queen or Bishop to d2, and securing the c4 square against Black invaders."
22,f5,f7f5,r2q1rk1/1pp1b1pp/pnn1b3/4pp2/1P6/P1NP1NP1/4PPBP/1RBQ1RK1 w - - 0 12,"!? Very aggressive, but dangerous. Black seems to want to get this pawn thrust done before playing ...Bf6, but he must be careful about the line he's just opened to his King (a2-g8)."
23,Bd2,c1d2,r2q1rk1/1pp1b1pp/pnn1b3/4pp2/1P6/P1NP1NP1/3BPPBP/1R1Q1RK1 b - - 1 12,"I decide I ought to keep my Bishop on the c1-h6 diagonal, since the f4 square might be in need of support soon."
24,Bd5,e6d5,r2q1rk1/1pp1b1pp/pnn5/3bpp2/1P6/P1NP1NP1/3BPPBP/1R1Q1RK1 w - - 2 13,"? Black wants to lift his Knight to a central square and get rid of my defender of e4 (the Knight), but this actually loses at least a pawn as far as I can see. It's all thanks to the open line to the BK... I was expecting 12...Bf6 or maybe 12...Qe8."
25,Nxd5,c3d5,r2q1rk1/1pp1b1pp/pnn5/3Npp2/1P6/P2P1NP1/3BPPBP/1R1Q1RK1 b - - 0 13,"First, White trades off the guardian of the light diagonal..."
26,Nxd5,b6d5,r2q1rk1/1pp1b1pp/p1n5/3npp2/1P6/P2P1NP1/3BPPBP/1R1Q1RK1 w - - 0 14,"...And now the Knight is pinned to the King, with only the BQ to defend it. Black now has to waste a move getting out of the pin with 14...Kh8, and even that loses a pawn to 15.Nxe5 (...Nxe5 16.Bxd5)."
27,Qb3,d1b3,r2q1rk1/1pp1b1pp/p1n5/3npp2/1P6/PQ1P1NP1/3BPPBP/1R3RK1 b - - 1 14,"...And now the Knight is pinned to the King, with only the BQ to defend it. Black now has to waste a move getting out of the pin with 14...Kh8, and even that loses a pawn to 15.Nxe5 (...Nxe5 16.Bxd5)."

29,e4,e2e4,r2q1rk1/1pp3pp/p1n2b2/3npp2/1P2P3/PQ1P1NP1/3B1PBP/1R3RK1 b - - 0 15,Of course. Now White wins a piece.
30,Nce7,c6e7,r2q1rk1/1pp1n1pp/p4b2/3npp2/1P2P3/PQ1P1NP1/3B1PBP/1R3RK1 w - - 1 16,"This surprised me at the time, but looking back I don't know what was better. Perhaps 15...Kh8. The reason I'm looking for something 'better' is that the text cuts off the BQ's support of g5, allowing White's next move."
31,Ng5,f3g5,r2q1rk1/1pp1n1pp/p4b2/3nppN1/1P2P3/PQ1P2P1/3B1PBP/1R3RK1 b - - 2 16,"Threatening a fork on e6 (and just a beautiful Knight placement in any situation). Of course the Black Knight is still pinned, so White can continue to maneuver and still win the material at his leisure."
32,c6,c7c6,r2q1rk1/1p2n1pp/p1p2b2/3nppN1/1P2P3/PQ1P2P1/3B1PBP/1R3RK1 w - - 0 17,"?! Black chooses to allow the fork in the hopes of eliminating some of White's attacking potential. Together with the Knight he's still going to lose, it's certainly a big material hit, but at least he'll have a little compensation in the form of a big center and a short reprieve from the attack."
33,Ne6,g5e6,r2q1rk1/1p2n1pp/p1p1Nb2/3npp2/1P2P3/PQ1P2P1/3B1PBP/1R3RK1 b - - 1 17,Of course.
