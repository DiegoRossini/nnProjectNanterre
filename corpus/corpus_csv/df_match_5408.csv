Generally capturing with a piece is the right way to go but I felt that the placement of White's light-squared bishop would require White to spend enough tempi so as to allow Black to untangle his minor pieces and secure a safe place for his king. The mainline I had calculated was a4, Be6, Ng5, Bf5, c3, (the point behind the double bishop move was to play for Nd4) g6. Where White' knight on g5 prevents the bishop from locating there in time to prevent Bg7 and 0-0."
