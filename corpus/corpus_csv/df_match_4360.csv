11,Qa4,c4a4,r2qkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n1bn2/8/Q2P4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 2 6,An awkward square for the queen but it has to remain on the 4th rank because of the weakness on d4

13,e3,e2e3,r2qkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3b4/Q2P4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"making sure your centre is solid and adquently defended is the first step in developing a successful attack. Consequently, the neglect of center is the hallmark of an attack that is doomed to fail. The lesson is that you should never go after the enemy king if you have a weak unsupported center."
14,Qd7,d8d7,r3kb1r/pppqpppp/2n2n2/3b4/Q2P4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 1 8,! highlighting the major drawback of 6. ...Bd5 because the threat is to capture on d5 winning the strategic long term advantage of the bishop pair for white.

17,gxf3,g2f3,r3kb1r/pppqpppp/2n2n2/8/Q2P4/2N1PP2/PP3P1P/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 9,"black has given up the long term advantage of the bishop pair in exchange for a permanate target on f3. However, the drawback is that white now has an extra pawn in the center so black now has to watch out for a timely e4 break."

Since any quiet moves like ...e6 would allow white to build a overwhelming center with 10. Bb5 Be7(10. ...a6 11. Bxc6 bxc6 12. Rg1 c5 13. dxc5 looks better for white) 11. e4 0-0 12. Be3 and white can take his time building on his space advantage.

22,Nfxd7,f6d7,r3kb1r/pppn1ppp/8/4n3/8/2N1PP2/PP3P1P/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 0 12,?! dubious since after 12. f4 the knights are tripping over each other. Better is Nexd7
23,f4,f3f4,r3kb1r/pppn1ppp/8/4n3/5P2/2N1P3/PP3P1P/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 12,"Gaining a huge space advantage and denying the knight the ideal e5 square. Up until this point I have not actually mounted any serious attack against the king. However, this is about to change because after 12. f4 I have defecto domination of the centre which usaully means a count blanc to do what every you want to do. Often if you play it calm and continue to play logical moves that are not too aggressive your opponent with get impatient and break himself on your pawn wall. After which you storm in sac him!"
