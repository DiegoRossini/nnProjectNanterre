1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Here's a second powerful game from Rublevsky.  In this game he creates holes by sacrificing against black's lack of development and lack of space.  I recommend playing the game out on a board so that the variations can be analyzed.
2,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,The modern defense.
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"A slightly odd move, but reasonable, it pins down the e7 pawn, prepares Qd2 and Bh6 (which never happens in this game) and incites black to make the weakening move ...h6."
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pp1p/3p2p1/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"A slightly odd move, but reasonable, it pins down the e7 pawn, prepares Qd2 and Bh6 (which never happens in this game) and incites black to make the weakening move ...h6."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pp1p/3p2p1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"A slightly odd move, but reasonable, it pins down the e7 pawn, prepares Qd2 and Bh6 (which never happens in this game) and incites black to make the weakening move ...h6."
6,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk1nr/ppp1ppbp/3p2p1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"A slightly odd move, but reasonable, it pins down the e7 pawn, prepares Qd2 and Bh6 (which never happens in this game) and incites black to make the weakening move ...h6."
7,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqk1nr/ppp1ppbp/3p2p1/6B1/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 3 4,"A slightly odd move, but reasonable, it pins down the e7 pawn, prepares Qd2 and Bh6 (which never happens in this game) and incites black to make the weakening move ...h6."
8,h6,h7h6,rnbqk1nr/ppp1ppb1/3p2pp/6B1/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"Black obliges, and tries to push off the pesky bishop."
9,Bh4,g5h4,rnbqk1nr/ppp1ppb1/3p2pp/8/3PP2B/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 1 5,"I dislike this move (though it's probably book), while ...b5 expansion seems reasonable, I prefer either ...c6 to prepare ...b5 while also aiming at the center or ...Nf6 with standard pirc development."
10,a6,a7a6,rnbqk1nr/1pp1ppb1/p2p2pp/8/3PP2B/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"I dislike this move (though it's probably book), while ...b5 expansion seems reasonable, I prefer either ...c6 to prepare ...b5 while also aiming at the center or ...Nf6 with standard pirc development."
11,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk1nr/1pp1ppb1/p2p2pp/8/3PP2B/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,In order to cramp black's kingside.
12,Nd7,b8d7,r1bqk1nr/1ppnppb1/p2p2pp/8/3PP2B/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 7,In order to cramp black's kingside.
13,a4,a2a4,r1bqk1nr/1ppnppb1/p2p2pp/8/P2PP2B/2N2N2/1PP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,In order to cramp black's kingside.
14,b6,b7b6,r1bqk1nr/2pnppb1/pp1p2pp/8/P2PP2B/2N2N2/1PP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,"White's got great development, has stopped black from getting queenside play and has a wonderful center."
15,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqk1nr/2pnppb1/pp1p2pp/8/P1BPP2B/2N2N2/1PP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 8,"White's got great development, has stopped black from getting queenside play and has a wonderful center."
16,g5,g6g5,r1bqk1nr/2pnppb1/pp1p3p/6p1/P1BPP2B/2N2N2/1PP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 9,"?? A very strange move to make when black is two moves down in development, has less space and spent the previous turn preparing to play ...Bb7.  A player like me probably wouldn't be able to exploit this as effectively, but while black's knight is on d7, he's lost the bishop's control of e6, with black's pawns on h6 and g6 he's lost control of the light squares around his king.  While this game doesn't attack the light squares quite as thematically as Rublevsky game #1 attacked the dark squares, this attack is based once again about the weaknesses in black's game."
