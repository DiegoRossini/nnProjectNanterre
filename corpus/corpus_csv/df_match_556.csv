Oddly enough, the computer programs don't always recommend the same move here, maybe because they consider both moves to be about the same. However, Stockfish on a really deep 31 ply search evaluates a3 as the best with a score of 0.14 pawns, g3 second with a score of 0.11 pawns, and Nc3 (and Bf4) third with just a score of 0.05 pawns."
