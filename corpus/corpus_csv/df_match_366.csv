This move is for o-o-o and start some kind of attack. He can play c4, that is his best mov, and I'll have to cope with c5 or something like that. All this has an extra ""trick"" if I manage to castle Qside, is the pinned d pawn until the WQ is on the d column, uncovered. This, sometimes, is a very nice resource to get out of some pawn's fork or advance."

The Q is threatened, and if BxN, BxB and d5 is pinned to the Q, saving my B. I slipped before, but I think I got the situation right by now. (I also ""have"" g6, threatening Bf5...). Let's say the previous moves, in the correct order, would have transposed to this. :-D"

Alternate plan form here is Nh5, in order to play N or B to f5. Would you say it is a good idea? I'm not sure. All in all, probably f5 was the right move. My N better move taking advantage of the pinned pawn."
