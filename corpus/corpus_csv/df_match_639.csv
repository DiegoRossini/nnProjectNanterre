1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I went with the French opening with the King's pawn to e5 and my opponent made the move h6.
2,h6,h7h6,rnbqkbnr/ppppppp1/7p/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Preparatory move I presume I know it is used to defend against the knight landing on g5.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppppppp1/7p/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,And here it is Nf3.  This move protects h4 and could be a threat to the king if I were able to move onto g5 but this is not possible with pawn at h6.
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1pp1/4p2p/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"Black played the French opening, wing gambit and moved e6 getting ready for his next move d5."
5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1pp1/4p2p/8/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 3,So I develop my LB to c4 it covers two diagonals.  I thought that this may stop d5 move but black was not going to let this bishop stop him taking the d5 square.
6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/4p2p/3p4/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,Black now played d5 which I had not realised was now protected twice by the pawn and the queen.
7,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/4p2p/3P4/2B5/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,I thought I should take d5 pawn and no doubt black would reciprocate.
8,exd5,e6d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/7p/3p4/2B5/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,This now left me with a pawn which I could not take since the queen was protecting it.  I should have seen that I would be left with a defended pawn which I would not be able to capture.
9,Be2,c4e2,rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/7p/3p4/8/5N2/PPPPBPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,So I moved LB back to e2!  All my advantage given away.  I should have moved my LB back to b3 rather than e2 but I thought I was protecting my king.
10,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/ppp2pp1/2n4p/3p4/8/5N2/PPPPBPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 6,Black looks better just now.  I have only one piece developed and as white I had the advantage but I lost it.
11,c3,c2c3,r1bqkbnr/ppp2pp1/2n4p/3p4/8/2P2N2/PP1PBPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,It seems like I am starting over again.  Now I play c3 ready to play d4.
12,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2pp1/2n2n1p/3p4/8/2P2N2/PP1PBPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 7,Black develops his knight to Nf6.
13,d3,d2d3,r1bqkb1r/ppp2pp1/2n2n1p/3p4/8/2PP1N2/PP2BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,As black played Nf6 I thought I would play d3 to deter  him from moving onto the fourth row with his knights.
14,Bd6,f8d6,r1bqk2r/ppp2pp1/2nb1n1p/3p4/8/2PP1N2/PP2BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 8,Black developed his DB to d6 attacking my h2 pawn and has access to 2 diagonals to a3 and h2.
15,h3,h2h3,r1bqk2r/ppp2pp1/2nb1n1p/3p4/8/2PP1N1P/PP2BPP1/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,I play h3 to again stop the f knight coming down to g4.  I can castle but have not done so as I feel I am behind and black may attack at any time.
16,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/ppp2pp1/2nb1n1p/3p4/8/2PP1N1P/PP2BPP1/RNBQK2R w KQ - 1 9,Black castles.
17,Be3,c1e3,r1bq1rk1/ppp2pp1/2nb1n1p/3p4/8/2PPBN1P/PP2BPP1/RN1QK2R b KQ - 2 9,I have moved Db up to e3 to control 2 diagonals.  I do not have any control of the centre but black also only has one pawn on the 5th row.  But this pawn is in the 4 squares which make up the centre of the board.
18,Re8,f8e8,r1bqr1k1/ppp2pp1/2nb1n1p/3p4/8/2PPBN1P/PP2BPP1/RN1QK2R w KQ - 3 10,Once black castled he moved his rook out to e8 to take control of e file which white currently has 2 bishops and the king is still on its square in the centre.
19,c4,c3c4,r1bqr1k1/ppp2pp1/2nb1n1p/3p4/2P5/3PBN1P/PP2BPP1/RN1QK2R b KQ - 0 10,I pushed pawn to c4 threatening d5.
20,d4,d5d4,r1bqr1k1/ppp2pp1/2nb1n1p/8/2Pp4/3PBN1P/PP2BPP1/RN1QK2R w KQ - 0 11,Black moves pawn to d4 threatening DB on e3.  DB is unable to take as d4 is protected by c6 knight.
