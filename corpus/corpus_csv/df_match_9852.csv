1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"At this moment, Black could choose to take on e4 thus entering the Rubinstein variation, but with a somewhat passive game. But if White is not cautious, Black could awaken his pawn majority (e and f) on the king side as Alexander Alekhine showed. This will be the case in this game as Black is going to transpose in this variation later."

8,dxe4,d5e4,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/6B1/3Pp3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"(!) but this is the right move, by not spoiling too much his winning chances, Black is transposing into the Rubinstein variation, with the Bg5 not naturally posted here : in fact this is not the best arrangement of pieces that white could dream of here."
9,Nxe4,c3e4,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/6B1/3PN3/8/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,Here Black had the opportunity of taking on f6 with his g Pawn opening the g file for his Rooks and castling queen side.

13,Nxf6+,e4f6,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pN2/8/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 7,This is less common : generally White develops simply here by 7.Nf3
14,Qxf6,d8f6,rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/4pq2/8/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 8,"Same here, 9.Nf3 then castle is to be preferred."

18,Nc6,b8c6,r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/2n1pq2/8/3P4/2PB4/PP3PPP/R2QK1NR w KQ - 1 10,"Tigran Petrosian's move vs Mecking in 1972, repeating the happy experience of another famous player Xavier Tartakower vs Sir Thomas in 1945. Both games were won by Black. For the moment, White has to deal with the opening of the center by e6-e5."

20,Qh6,f6h6,r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/2n1p2q/8/3P4/2PB1Q2/PP3PPP/R3K1NR w KQ - 3 11,But I did not want to exchange Queens.
21,Ne2,g1e2,r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/2n1p2q/8/3P4/2PB1Q2/PP2NPPP/R3K2R b KQ - 4 11,Happily my opponent missed the strong 11.Qg3 and it is not easy for Black to push the e-pawn without half sacrificing it and falling into complicated and double-edged play.
22,e5,e6e5,r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/2n4q/4p3/3P4/2PB1Q2/PP2NPPP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 12,Completely correct move.
23,d5,d4d5,r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/2n4q/3Pp3/8/2PB1Q2/PP2NPPP/R3K2R b KQ - 0 12,It would have been better for White to castle even with the very small disadvantage here of an isolated pawn. 12.O-O exd4 13.cxd4.
24,Ne7,c6e7,r1b2rk1/ppp1nppp/7q/3Pp3/8/2PB1Q2/PP2NPPP/R3K2R w KQ - 1 13,"Now Black has a pawn duo attacking with his pieces behind, and the White King cannot castle queen side due to the Black Queen on h6. Black is better now."
