9,Ne2,g1e2,rnb1kbnr/pp3ppp/1q2p3/2ppP3/3P4/2P5/PP2NPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,This was not a brilliant move as it blocks the white bishop. I personally would have played 5.Nf3.
10,Nc6,b8c6,r1b1kbnr/pp3ppp/1qn1p3/2ppP3/3P4/2P5/PP2NPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 3 6,I decided to put pressure on the central pawn d4. Although attacking it now would be unwise.
11,f4,f2f4,r1b1kbnr/pp3ppp/1qn1p3/2ppP3/3P1P2/2P5/PP2N1PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,White decides to add some more protection on e5 which I personally think was not necessary. White should focus on developing its pieces and unblocking its bishop.

14,h5,h7h5,r1b1k1nr/pp2bpp1/1qn1p3/2ppP2p/3P1P2/2P3P1/PP2N2P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,"I decided to bring out my knight on the King's side and to use it to put it on g4 which I think was a good spot. But, first I decided to secure g4 by advancing my pawn. Things really turned out for me as you will see later."
15,Bg2,f1g2,r1b1k1nr/pp2bpp1/1qn1p3/2ppP2p/3P1P2/2P3P1/PP2N1BP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 8,Finally bringing his bishop out.
16,Nh6,g8h6,r1b1k2r/pp2bpp1/1qn1p2n/2ppP2p/3P1P2/2P3P1/PP2N1BP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 9,"I decided to bring my knight out. h6 is not a very good spot for the knight. My goal was to put it on g4. However, things turned out better than I planned."

19,cxd4,c3d4,r1b1k2r/pp2bpp1/1qn1p2n/3pP2p/3P1P2/6P1/PP2N1BP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 10,White takes the pawn back.
20,Nxd4,c6d4,r1b1k2r/pp2bpp1/1q2p2n/3pP2p/3n1P2/6P1/PP2N1BP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 11,"I decided to take the pawn with my knight.Now, why did I do this? Well, if white takes my knight, I will not be immediately able to take it back (11...Qxd4 12.Qxd4 loses my Queen). However, the white knight would be trapped since it cannot move (due to the threat my Queen makes on the King). so, I'm fine."
21,Nxd4,e2d4,r1b1k2r/pp2bpp1/1q2p2n/3pP2p/3N1P2/6P1/PP4BP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 11,White takes my knight.
