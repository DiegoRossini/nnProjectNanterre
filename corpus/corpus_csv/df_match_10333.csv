2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"So far these are the opening moves of the standard King's Indian Defense. In Indian Defenses such as Nimzo and Queen's, Black does not challenge White in the center with pawns, and instead goes for rapid development and only challenges the center once he is completely developed."

9,Be2,f1e2,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 5,"This is where Black decides which way to challenge the center. The c5-boost is usually better in lines where White makes kingside progress such as in the 4-pawns attack or Saemisch. In this line, which is mainline King's Indian, Black usually plays e5, but c5 is just as fine, which can transpose to a Maroczy Bind or Benoni structure."

Against 7.d5, Black wouldn't be able to develop the knight to c6, but can then take advantage of the c5 weakness with Nfd7 Na6, which contains White's queenside, while Black still has lots of flexibility on the kingside."
14,Nc6,b8c6,r1bq1rk1/ppp2pbp/2np1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 2 8,"This move differs from the main line. Usually White wants to gain space on the queenside quickly with pawn pushes, and delays the maneuvering of pieces for a few moves. Against moves like 9.Nd2 and 9.Ne1, Black cannot play the agressive Nh5 which is a typical move in mainline king's indian. In this line, Black should move the knight somewhere else to prepare for the f5-boost."

I disagree, and I think a5 is good because White had to make 2 preparing moves in order to play b4."

Wasting 2 knight moves (Nf6 Nc6 Ne7 Nd7) to get the knights to these flexible squares is not really a waste of tempo, and are actually common maneuvers in openings like Ruy Lopez or other closed positions"

The main reason for this move is to play Rg8 during the attack, so it's better to play Kh8 before the attack, because Black won't want to make a move like Kh8 during the middle of his attack. But I don't think Kh8 is that necessary this early in the game."
