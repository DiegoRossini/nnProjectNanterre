1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

For the first ten moves you could be forgiven for thinking that the player with the black pieces was the beginner here, until you look at that number against black's name and then what happened after white's 12th move.  Yup, it certainly looked as though I was heading for a real slip on the banana skin.  Thankfully I managed to turn things around.  White kicks off with d4 and I respond with the popular Nf6."

I got that real horrid sinking feeling once before, about 11 or 12 years ago when, helping out at a kiddies chess club I blundered my queen to a six year old beginner.  My gut feeling told me to play on and I eventually won but boy did it not take me about what seemed an eternity to compose myself!  Thankfully I lost only a pawn, so I transformed myself from Jo Pessimist to Jo Optimist!"
