3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"By F A R the most common move at this point. Almost always leading to some manner of mainline, semi-open type of Sicilian position wherein WT plays d4. Although it is possible for him to play d3 after this, and enter a Closed Sicilian game, that is seldom played and is more limiting to WT than other move orders for a Closed Sicilian. The most common of those would be 2.Nc3 or 2.d3 for positions resembling a Kings Indian Reversed. The main alternative to those would be 2.c3, the Alapin Variation. My personal choice of response to that is 2...d5. Also possible would be 2.f4 for a Gran Prix Attack, tho this move order his earned some disfavor at present, with it being recommended now that the f4 idea be preceeded by 2.Nc3 in order to prevent BL from playing an immediate 2...d5, such as Tal has played, among others; which usually leads to WT finding himself ""embarrassed"", in wondering Why he has a pawn thrust out upon f4 all by itself. IMO"
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"2...d6 would allow me to go into either of my most usual Siclians; the Dragon Variation, or the Najdorf Sicilian. The Dragon has been of special interest to me. In Master/Expert level postal games from the 8th USCCC tournament I broke even in Dragon games. One Win and one Draw having the black pieces against Masters H. Anthony Buczko and Allen Wright, respectively. And a Loss with the White pieces vs the strong Expert, William J. Shipley, after I followed some analysis of a game played by Alex Sherzer which turned out to be insufficient in meeting Shipley's improved play as Black. Thus giving me a loss vs the ...h5 Soltis line after I played the sequence involving Bg5. I would now opt for ...Bh6 instead. But all this took place Before any of the Dragon games involving Kasparov were ever played~! So perhaps it will be time to reinvestigate the Dragon~? 
I have also played the Accelerated Dragon at times, but came to regard it as rather prone to draws."
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"As expected 98 times of 100 games. Although, for awhile in the late 1970's or early 1980's there was a fad to play 3.Nc3, to produce a finesse of such momentous importance ... that I can't remember Why anyone was doing it. Do you? If so, please bring Me to remembrance~!"
6,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"And presently, there is a quirky Blitz finesse being played, of avoiding 3...cxd4 and playing something else like ...e6 or Nf6 and then answering 4.dxc5 with Qa5+ and Qxc5 ... which I believe is solely aimed at changing the move sequence so that WT loses a bit of time changing his move, since he is probably holding a Nd4 hovering above that square to ""unclick"" for an Instant Nxd4 recapture. Objectively, WT probably does better to answer that with 4.d5 then. Or even 4.c3 making a durable center where BL will have lost a tempo if he should later play ...d5, such as after an ...e6 ala French Defense. All of which usually comes to little in a game of blitz Chess, unless it happens to be a one minute game, then the time lost in changing a move might mean something. But is most interesting and effective if/when someone has actually thought out a sequence like that where the opponent gets caught out a number of times, having to make a new move other than the commonly expected. And that is a fun part of lightning blitz, to try to set up such little quirks and finesses. Of course, you do know the technical difference between a Quirk and a Finesse?"
7,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"Ah~! A Finesse~! He plays as I sometimes do myself. Offering Black a chance to enter a Smith-Morra Gambit type game if ...e5 is played and countered by c3. Tho it can become quite different than mainline play of that opening since, for instance, WT might play Ng5 vs ...e5 and then BL counters with ...Nh6 which is usually only seen in Accelerated Dragons at times. So it would get a bit odd, compared to the usual Smith-Morra game. Rather than just being up a tempo for Black since he plays ...e5 without the customary ...e6 before that."
8,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/3pp3/8/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"Another Finesse. I let him know that I have no intention of entering the pseudo-Morra. Now it can easily become one of several Sicilians such as the Scheveningen, for one. Which is really the only one I myself play. Not being well versed in Paulsen/Taimanov etc. Too bad tho, it appears we shall not see a Dragon game after all."

A Finesse is some unexpected move that makes me think ""That's Interesting!?"" ...and might be something that I would play.

12,Qc7,d8c7,rnb1kb1r/ppq2ppp/3ppn2/8/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 3 7,"...Qc7 was played with the intent of following 7.Bb3 with ...Nc6 for a Modern Scheveningen. The Old Scheveningen plays ...a6 to stop Nb5 from attacking BL's Queen. However, it is no longer felt that such a prophalactic move is necessary. So the Modern Schev. simply allows it and using the retreat ...Qb8 if needed. Then the WT Knight can be kicked out later by ...a6, with tempo."
13,Bg5,c1g5,rnb1kb1r/ppq2ppp/3ppn2/6B1/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 4 7,"7.Bg5??  Neither a Quirk nor a Finesse, but . . . a very great surprise~! Did he simply play at a glance and miss the threat? I do not know. Yet I find my game gets more difficult than I ever would have expected it to be after his next move, despite being a piece ahead. It may well be a deficiency of my own play that I seem to have trouble handling my Sicilian with doubled f-pawns. And so I do try to avoid the formation entirely, when possible. For instance, I do not play the Poisoned Pawn variation that Bobby Fischer so enjoyed."

Also to consider is ...Ng6/Nf8 or ...Nc6/Nd8, tho this seems to me the least preferential location as a defender, even tho it does cover f7 as well as e6. Of course going to g6 does make an immediate target of the N for the f5 push and so the further retreat to Nf8 would then need to be immediate."

40,Nc4,e5c4,2r4r/1pqkbp1p/p2ppp2/P7/1PnNPP2/1Q6/2P3PP/3R1RK1 w - - 1 21,"Now it is important for WT to realize the nature of the position and potentials. Despite his +Piece, BL does not have a lot of ability to advance pawns or greatly improve his position without creating weakness or decreasing his King security, which is only sufficient. Such being the case, WT must look carefully to be certain he has no means for immediate win; To be able to force some gain or significant infiltration at once. Then seeing he does not have that, but realizing the difficulty of BL to try grabbing the initiative away; that in fact BL is pretty much relegated to placing his pieces as effectively as possible for defense, to be as responsive as possible to whatever manner of assault(s) WT may attempt ... WT should know that his proper approach will be to place all his own pieces as effectively & aggressively as possible; using whatever time (tempos) is needed to do so, without rushing. And only when fully situated should he initiate his assault. Indeed, being a piece behind it may be that he would wish only to situate effectively enough so that the threat of his assault can be stronger than its execution. Just strong enough so that Black cannot himself attempt to progress towards winning of the game. One can often find such type of situation in a Smith-Morra Gambit for instance ... where WT may not have winning position, but sufficient pressure created from his open lines and Rook placements, that BL can not press forward and convert his extra pawn into a win. I have also seen similar in the Goring Gambit. In neither of those have I actually ever had an opponent take the extra pawn and convert it to a win. Rather, when a loss would come as WT it would be due to factors from the middle-game. IE being ""outplayed"" or oversight. I have also seen pressure in d-pawn isolani positions, such that the isolani might be captured, but in doing so the player would unleash such pressure & havoc upon himself, that discretion pre-empted winning of the pawn."

Yet the move can be seen as weakening of a6, as well as bolstering to c4. Now there will is always a potential that he might sac Nxb5 in such a way and time, that his having a protected passer at a5 could be very dangerous or maybe even winning. So I accept yet another object of attack to place under constant vigilance. But the move does give more scope to my Queen & Rook for movement & protection behind my pawn structure. It also eliminates his potential to advance b4 to b5. And it is now very unlikely he might ever be able to place his Nb6. Also I have regained the potential to pin his N to K by Qa7. A trade-off of risks & potential."
