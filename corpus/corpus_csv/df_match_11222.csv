1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I was Black in this game in a team match. This game shows the importance of pawns. Especially in closed positions.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,The Sicilian Defense.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"White's other playable options are Nc3, f4, and c3. Risky, but interesting options are d4 and b4. And unsharp options are Bc4 and d3."
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"This is Black's most flexible move, because it doesn't immediately commit to a plan, and simply opens lines for development. Moves like d6 and g6 already commit to a plan. Nc6 doesn't commit to a plan either, but it allows the sharp Bb5 opening, which is a serious distraction to Sicilian players who don't know the opening."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"I haven't revealed exactly what I plan to do in this opening, so White doesn't either. He just simply develops a piece. And playing 3.d4 against the e6-Sicilian isn't as strong as it is in other Sicilians."
6,a6,a7a6,rnbqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p3p3/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"I make another move that doesn't commit to a plan. In most openings, and especially Sicilian ones, it is very important not to reveal your plans within the first few moves. Although I think 3...Nc6 was more accurate here, since 4.Bb5 isn't strong anymore because I can simply play 4...Nge7.
And 3...d5 is terrible because you shouldn't open up the position when you're behind in development. White is very good after 4.exd5 exd5 5.d4!."
7,d3,d2d3,rnbqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p3p3/2p5/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"White is the first to commit to a plan. White playing d3 in any Sicilian signifies that he wants to play a Closed Sicilian, where he tries for a slower, more strategic buildup."
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p1n1p3/2p5/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,A simple developing move. Playing 4...b5 may be risky.
9,Be2,f1e2,r1bqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p1n1p3/2p5/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 5,"It is better to fianchetto the King's bishop in the Closed Sicilian, because it gives White a King's Indian-type setup. The bishop isn't as strong on e2."
10,d5,d7d5,r1bqkbnr/1p3ppp/p1n1p3/2pp4/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"Perhaps this boost was premature. Like I said, opening up the position can be risky if you're behind in development."
11,exd5,e4d5,r1bqkbnr/1p3ppp/p1n1p3/2pP4/8/2NP1N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"A more common strategy for White is to castle and keep the pawn on e4, where it can be replaced with the d3-pawn."
12,exd5,e6d5,r1bqkbnr/1p3ppp/p1n5/2pp4/8/2NP1N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"Not the strongest move, because the bishop doesn't do much here. And if White plays 7.d4, then I play 7...c4 and am strong on the light squares."
13,Bf4,c1f4,r1bqkbnr/1p3ppp/p1n5/2pp4/5B2/2NP1N2/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 7,"Not the strongest move, because the bishop doesn't do much here. And if White plays 7.d4, then I play 7...c4 and am strong on the light squares."
14,Bd6,f8d6,r1bqk1nr/1p3ppp/p1nb4/2pp4/5B2/2NP1N2/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 8,I immediately challenge White's questionable bishop move.
15,Bxd6,f4d6,r1bqk1nr/1p3ppp/p1nB4/2pp4/8/2NP1N2/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 8,"Bg3 is another option, and goes into more complicated variations."
16,Qxd6,d8d6,r1b1k1nr/1p3ppp/p1nq4/2pp4/8/2NP1N2/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 9,Now I have a strong centre and am catching up in development.
17,O-O,e1g1,r1b1k1nr/1p3ppp/p1nq4/2pp4/8/2NP1N2/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 1 9,"When the e-file is wide open, it is a signal to castle immediately."
18,Nf6,g8f6,r1b1k2r/1p3ppp/p1nq1n2/2pp4/8/2NP1N2/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 2 10,I plan to do the same.
19,Re1,f1e1,r1b1k2r/1p3ppp/p1nq1n2/2pp4/8/2NP1N2/PPP1BPPP/R2QR1K1 b kq - 3 10,Just in time.
20,O-O,e8g8,r1b2rk1/1p3ppp/p1nq1n2/2pp4/8/2NP1N2/PPP1BPPP/R2QR1K1 w - - 4 11,Just in time.
21,h3,h2h3,r1b2rk1/1p3ppp/p1nq1n2/2pp4/8/2NP1N1P/PPP1BPP1/R2QR1K1 b - - 0 11,Whie plans to strategically maneuver his knights. A common strategy in closed positions.
22,b5,b7b5,r1b2rk1/5ppp/p1nq1n2/1ppp4/8/2NP1N1P/PPP1BPP1/R2QR1K1 w - - 0 12,"White should've tried stopping this boost with a4, but I'd most likely be able to make this boost eventually."
