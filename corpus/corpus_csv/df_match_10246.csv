1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Ah, the Caro-Kann, a favourite of Karpov's... and of mine when I was at university."
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Ah, the Caro-Kann, a favourite of Karpov's... and of mine when I was at university."
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,d4 is normal but both Nc3 and c4 are better suited to blitz games.
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Again d4 is standard.
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,Again d4 is standard.

7,h3,h2h3,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4P1b1/2N2N1P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,Bh5 is also playable.
8,Bxf3,g4f3,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4P3/2N2b1P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,Bh5 is also playable.
9,Qxf3,d1f3,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4P3/2N2Q1P/PPPP1PP1/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 5,Nf6 is another choice.
10,e6,e7e6,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3p4/4P3/2N2Q1P/PPPP1PP1/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 0 6,Nf6 is another choice.

12,dxe4,d5e4,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/8/3Pp3/2N2Q1P/PPP2PP1/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"Nf6 is probably better. However dxe4 (a rare continuation) was played by World Champion Max Euwe in Venice in 1948 and he went on to win in 25 moves. It was also played in Smyslov - Chandler (1981), a draw in 38 moves."
13,Qxe4,f3e4,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/8/3PQ3/2N4P/PPP2PP1/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"Follows the Smyslov - Chandler game, but Nxe4 looks better."
14,Nf6,g8f6,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/8/3PQ3/2N4P/PPP2PP1/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 1 8,Continues to follow Smyslov - Chandler. Qe3 might be better.
15,Qd3,e4d3,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/8/3P4/2NQ3P/PPP2PP1/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 2 8,Continues to follow Smyslov - Chandler. Qe3 might be better.
16,Bb4,f8b4,rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/8/1b1P4/2NQ3P/PPP2PP1/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 3 9,"Leaves Smyslov - Chandler, which continued with the quieter Nbd7. Bb4 is a natural move, developing the bishop and allowing 0-0."
17,Bg5,c1g5,rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/6B1/1b1P4/2NQ3P/PPP2PP1/R3KB1R b KQkq - 4 9,"Maybe Be2, also allowing 0-0, is better."
