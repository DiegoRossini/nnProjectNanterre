1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,All standard so far
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,All standard so far
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,All standard so far
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,All standard so far
5,c3,c2c3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"Hmm, I don't think this move is a mistake but I don't usually see it. It could transpose into a Guicio piano."
6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,But I decided instead to take advantage of the fact that his QN can't defend the pawn.
7,d3,d2d3,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,So now his LSB is blocked in
8,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,I thought this was the best square. d6 not only blocks in the d pawn but doesn't have much scope. On c5 it would just get chased away.
9,d4,d3d4,r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/2n2n2/4p3/3PP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,A mistake that loses a pawn
10,exd4,e5d4,r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/2n2n2/8/3pP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,So I take it
11,cxd4,c3d4,r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/2n2n2/8/3PP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,So I take it
12,Nxe4,f6e4,r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/2n5/8/3Pn3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,So I take it
13,d5,d4d5,r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/2n5/3P4/4n3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,I'm not sure this is great. Sure it pokes my knight but it overextends the pawn so that it's harder to defend.
14,Nb4,c6b4,r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/8/3P4/1n2n3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,A rather awkward square but the only other safe one was a5.
15,a3,a2a3,r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/8/3P4/1n2n3/P4N2/1P3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,It probably would have been better to go to a5 in the first place
16,Na6,b4a6,r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/n7/3P4/4n3/P4N2/1P3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 9,It probably would have been better to go to a5 in the first place
17,Bxa6,f1a6,r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/B7/3P4/4n3/P4N2/1P3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 9,my queen side pawn structure is busted
18,bxa6,b7a6,r1bqk2r/p1ppbppp/p7/3P4/4n3/P4N2/1P3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 10,my queen side pawn structure is busted
19,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk2r/p1ppbppp/p7/3P4/4n3/P4N2/1P3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 10,"I don't want to exchange my centrally placed knight, but it looks like I have to."
