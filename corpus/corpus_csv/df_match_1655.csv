1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"My opponent gave me a hard fight, but I managed to see the opportunity for a Smothered Mate, and it got there.  So, this annotation describes what to look for in setting up a SM.
The game starts with my usual opening, d4.  Typically, I play a Stonewall (e3 after ....d5 and then setting up a pawn structure with pawns at c3, d4, e3, and f4 with an outpost for the KN at e5).  

Here, I see I went into something that I am, frankly, less familiar with.  [DEAR READER:  I MADE A MISTAKE AND ANNOTATED AS IF I WERE PLAYING WHITE.... I DISCOVERED THE ERROR AT MOVE 11 OR SO AND CHANGED THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE NARRATIVE AT THAT POINT.]"

4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,White would love it if Black chose to trade his d pawn for White's c pawn.

10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/1bPP4/2N2N2/PP1BPPPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 4 6,Black read my mind.
11,e3,e2e3,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/1bPP4/2N1PN2/PP1B1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 6,Black adds tension to the Centre.  (I spelled it the old fashioned way on purpose.)

White doesn't like his Bishop on d2, or the unprotected Bishop on c4."

It does all of those things.

Oops.  A funny thing just happened:  I just realized that I am BLACK in this game!  

Oh well.  I will now continue the annotation from Black's perspective."

The Bishop, on the a2-g8 diagonal is ""biting on granite,"" as they say, would have been better off defending the pawn on e4 (""over protection"")"
30,e5,e6e5,r1b2rk1/1pq2ppp/p4n2/4p3/2B1P3/1PN1PQ2/P5PP/R4RK1 w - - 0 16,Makes room for the Queen Bishop with a very powerful move obviously planned.
