1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

As you know my queen ain't called Glenda the Defender for nothing!  However, one can easily fall asleep when dealing with her.  But watch it!  She can be very sneaky and if you doze off you can get a mighty rude awakening as my unfortunate opponent did in this game - although I think it is more appropriate to say that my opponent was pre-occupied with pinning my e pawn and missed the mate threat.  He who is without sin, cast the first stone, because in my recent game, annotated as ""Heavy Weather"" I overlooked the chance to deliver mate in 3.  Luckily the move I played won enough material for my opponent to chuck in the sponge."
