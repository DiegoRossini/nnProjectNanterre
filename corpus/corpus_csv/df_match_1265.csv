1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Normal.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Normal
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Normal.
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"Still normal, though Nc6 is more common."
5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 3,Developing.
6,h5,h7h5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/3p4/4p2p/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,"? This is where black starts to go wrong - I prefer Nf6, attacking the undefended e-pawn. Perhaps he was thinking about attacking down the kingside."
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/3p4/4p2p/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"Again, developing."
8,Qd7,d8d7,rnb1kbnr/pppq1pp1/3p4/4p2p/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,"?! Again, I prefer Nf6 or Nc6 or even Bg5 - this odd queen move blocks in the bishop and leaves a chance of a pin on the diagonal."
9,Nd5,c3d5,rnb1kbnr/pppq1pp1/3p4/3Np2p/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 5,! I give this move an exclamation since it ties the queen down to defending c7.
10,Qa4,d7a4,rnb1kbnr/ppp2pp1/3p4/3Np2p/q1B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 4 6,?? Oh dear - this leaves c7 vulnerable and wins a rook - but it also wins the queen. Not 6. Nxc7!? which looks obvious but ...
11,Bb5+,c4b5,rnb1kbnr/ppp2pp1/3p4/1B1Np2p/q3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 5 6,"The perfect fork - watch out for this in your games, it comes across a lot."
12,Qxb5,a4b5,rnb1kbnr/ppp2pp1/3p4/1q1Np2p/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"Black has no choice, but to take."
13,Nxc7+,d5c7,rnb1kbnr/ppN2pp1/3p4/1q2p2p/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,And Nxc7! - winning a pawn and queen for the bishop - a lovely tactic: I came across this in 'Chess Tactics for kids' and it is rather good. And a rather good family fork.
14,Kd7,e8d7,rnb2bnr/ppNk1pp1/3p4/1q2p2p/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 1 8,I prefer Kd8.
15,Nxb5,c7b5,rnb2bnr/pp1k1pp1/3p4/1N2p2p/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 8,And the knight chomps away the queen.
16,a6,a7a6,rnb2bnr/1p1k1pp1/p2p4/1N2p2p/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 9,"No surprise, but I think black should be thinking about developing here."
17,Nc3,b5c3,rnb2bnr/1p1k1pp1/p2p4/4p2p/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 1 9,I retreat.
18,h4,h5h4,rnb2bnr/1p1k1pp1/p2p4/4p3/4P2p/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 10,"Again, a pointless move - why not play Nf6?"
19,d4,d2d4,rnb2bnr/1p1k1pp1/p2p4/4p3/3PP2p/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 10,I open up the centre.
20,h3,h4h3,rnb2bnr/1p1k1pp1/p2p4/4p3/3PP3/2N2N1p/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 11,I think black is seriously into attacking the kingside.
