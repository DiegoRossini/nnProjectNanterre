1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Ok the first rule of chess is that white always moves first. This is a very important rule that goes back years and years to a time when people were a bunch of racistist.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,wait a second... what colour am i?
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,oh yeah i'm black. Good. That was him moving his horse. Ok Ok. Rule number two. Always research your opponent for strengths and weaknesses.
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,Today i am up against a solid 1500 player called volhouder. I checked out his profile. He's Dutch and looks just like Sven goran Erikson. He might be interested in football? I could post messages on this topic to distract him at a crucial stage. I'll add this to my chess notes at the side of the board.
5,h3,h2h3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N1P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,One of the first things i noticed about Volhouder is that he is pretty old. About 70. So hes got lots of good chess experience.
6,b6,b7b6,rnbqkbnr/p1p2ppp/1p1p4/4p3/4P3/5N1P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,Having said that old people do tend to make silly mistakes. Like my dad for instance. He kept forgetting to take his keys when he left his house and ended up having to smash the front door down like 3 times in a week or something
7,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/p1p2ppp/1p1p4/4p3/2B1P3/5N1P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,There's no use trying unorthodox fancy moves against someone with as much experience as volhouder. The guys probably seen just about every chess move there is. I'm going to play it nice and safe for the mean time.
8,h6,h7h6,rnbqkbnr/p1p2pp1/1p1p3p/4p3/2B1P3/5N1P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,Moving my pawn up stops him moving his horse into g5. He'd then be in a threatening position for a check with his bishop
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/p1p2pp1/1p1p3p/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N1P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,Ok now he's moved his other horse out. He is starting to 'develop' by getting his major pieces off the back line. Apparently it is good to 'develop' early on. Someone told me this. Although i'm yet to see any real evidence that this is true.
10,Bb7,c8b7,rn1qkbnr/pbp2pp1/1p1p3p/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N1P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 6,Ok i think this was my first mistake... i've broken my back line and started to develop as well. Before i had all my major pieces in a nice straight line. Seriously though... moving my bishop to b7 is a good move against the less experienced chess players like children or drunk people. They often forget about pieces in the corners so try to cram as many pieces in there for a surprise attack. This is a good move against anyone with a rating of 1100 or lower.
11,d3,d2d3,rn1qkbnr/pbp2pp1/1p1p3p/4p3/2B1P3/2NP1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"Unfortunately for me though, my opponent is of a much higher standard. Asking the obvious question... why did i bother making this move?
Ok, anyway, he has now moved his pawn up to d3. This provides further support to his pawn on e4 that my bishop was attacking. It also allows his black bishop to come out and develop/attack if he wants"
12,a6,a7a6,rn1qkbnr/1bp2pp1/pp1p3p/4p3/2B1P3/2NP1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,I'm now building a safe area to castle into. If i choose to castle that side my king will be well protected...  Apparently it's important to castle in the first 12 moves. I'd like to disagree with this statement but i've lost track of the number of games i've messed up through NOT castling early enough
13,a3,a2a3,rn1qkbnr/1bp2pp1/pp1p3p/4p3/2B1P3/P1NP1N1P/1PP2PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,still no pieces taken and there are no obvious signs that things will change in the next few moves
14,Ne7,g8e7,rn1qkb1r/1bp1npp1/pp1p3p/4p3/2B1P3/P1NP1N1P/1PP2PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 8,Hopefully volhouder will forget his house keys like my dad. That way he might time out.
15,Be3,c1e3,rn1qkb1r/1bp1npp1/pp1p3p/4p3/2B1P3/P1NPBN1P/1PP2PP1/R2QK2R b KQkq - 2 8,"I love it when your opponents times out. You win the game without even having to think or nothing. Remember kids… it’s the winning that really matters, not the taking part. No one likes a loser"
16,g6,g7g6,rn1qkb1r/1bp1np2/pp1p2pp/4p3/2B1P3/P1NPBN1P/1PP2PP1/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 9,Ok so he now has both horses and bishops out and in play. In good attacking positions. One of my horses is blocking in my bishop. Can't really go anywhere either. I'll have to move a pawn to free the bishop up. g6
17,d4,d3d4,rn1qkb1r/1bp1np2/pp1p2pp/4p3/2BPP3/P1N1BN1P/1PP2PP1/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 9,i think he wants to get rid of my central pawns. I'm currently in no position to castle and do not want to lose my middle pawns as it will leave my king vulnerable. time to bring in some extra support
18,f6,f7f6,rn1qkb1r/1bp1n3/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2BPP3/P1N1BN1P/1PP2PP1/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 10,"I know it's hard to believe but i actually don't really know that much about chess. However, i'm pretty sure that it's NOT a good idea to have moved three pawns all up one space like i have on the right hand side of the board. I would also imagine that most good chess players would tell you that white is in a much stronger position at this stage"
19,Be6,c4e6,rn1qkb1r/1bp1n3/pp1pBppp/4p3/3PP3/P1N1BN1P/1PP2PP1/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 10,never saw that coming... don't know what he is playing at but i sure as hell don't like it
20,Bg7,f8g7,rn1qk2r/1bp1n1b1/pp1pBppp/4p3/3PP3/P1N1BN1P/1PP2PP1/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 11,oh yeah great move... how has that bloody helped? Don't know what i was thinking there?
