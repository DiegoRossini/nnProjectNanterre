I won't go into further detail because the game is still in progress, but in the post-game analysis of this game with my computer, it indicated 10.f5 as the best move which is what I also played against blitzkov."

I was actually hoping he would commit his king to the kingside so I would have an attacking target. This move may also come in handy if Black is going to place his queen on the a7-g1 diagonal or to avoid a bishop check on d4."

I still find it hard to master the finesses of this opening, to know exactly which placement of the pieces is best in which positions. Another example is the question whether to start an attack with e5 or f5, although I'm finding f5 is usually the better choice."

Probably 13.Bg5 was better because my move seems to lose a tempo compared to the game. That was also a move that I had considered.
