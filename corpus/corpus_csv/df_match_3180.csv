1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This game can be boiled down to central themes. #1 pawn breaks which means pawns attack to create a weakness and #2. Central dominance.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Not normal, but still well within establish theory. The major draw back is that black's most important device for countering white is attacking e4 but now that is all but impossible."

9,c3,c2c3,r1bqkb1r/1pppnppp/p1n5/4p3/B3P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,!? Play consistently until your aggressive opponent makes a mistake. This is the bedrock from which this opening system of white is built upon. I can not tell you how many times I have won tournaments by just playing safely and not going out of my way to create an attack.
10,g6,g7g6,r1bqkb1r/1pppnp1p/p1n3p1/4p3/B3P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,Black aims for indirect control of the center while White is aiming for direct control. The lines in the sand could not drawn any clearer.
11,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkb1r/1pppnp1p/p1n3p1/4p3/B3P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 6,Black chooses the Cozio system in response to white's 5. c3. A good defensive position but not very strong against the deferred center system
12,Bg7,f8g7,r1bqk2r/1pppnpbp/p1n3p1/4p3/B3P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 7,Black chooses the Cozio system in response to white's 5. c3. A good defensive position but not very strong against the deferred center system
13,d4,d2d4,r1bqk2r/1pppnpbp/p1n3p1/4p3/B2PP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,This pawn thrust can be played now or at anytime in the future. I played this because I knew that Jstevens is a spirited fighter and would not resist playing 7. ...exd4 giving me the majority of the center. FYI white's move order with c3 followed by d4 is known as the unassailable center because no matter what black does white will always maintain the edge in the center.
14,exd4,e5d4,r1bqk2r/1pppnpbp/p1n3p1/8/B2pP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,'centre'

16,b5,b7b5,r1bqk2r/2ppnpbp/p1n3p1/1p6/B2PP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 9,"!? this is fine but one of the defining features of the cozio system is to avoid harassing this bishop. It is base on the strategic idea that on a4 white's LSB is somewhat of play. Here instead black can most likely improve her position with 8. ...d5!? challenging the centre before white can consolidate it with Be3 and Bc2. Even more important is forcing white into playing an isolated pawn position.

Alternative variation: 8... d5 9. exd5 Nxd5 10. Bg5 Qd6 11. Nbd2+/="
17,Bc2,a4c2,r1bqk2r/2ppnpbp/p1n3p1/1p6/3PP3/5N2/PPB2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 9,"9. Bb3? is not good because it gives black time to get in ...c5 with tempo. 9...Na5 10. bc2 d6 is fine for black.
Alternative variation: 9. Bb3 Na5 10. Bc2 d5"
18,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/2ppnpbp/p1n3p1/1p6/3PP3/5N2/PPB2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 2 10,"Black's lack of direct attention in the center is actually disturbing

This is a thematic move which is played to provoke a weakness in black's queen side pawns."
20,Bb7,c8b7,r2q1rk1/1bppnpbp/p1n3p1/1p6/P2PP3/5N2/1PB2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 1 11,?! more than likely this is not the best move since it allows white to make a favorable exchange on b5. Most of the time black is reluctantly forced to play 10. ...b4 followed by either ...a5 or ...Rb8 in order to keep the lanes closed. If you do not think black is forced to push the pawn forward then read on dear reader. Because this is where the game is won and lost.
21,Nc3,b1c3,r2q1rk1/1bppnpbp/p1n3p1/1p6/P2PP3/2N2N2/1PB2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 2 11,Attacking b5 twice and expecting ...b4 to be played.
