1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Pretty standard opening move
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Now I've had people question the motive behind pawn a3 or pawn h3, but it's because it helps me set up future positions and a safe point if it comes to pass in the future. Obviously we are only 2 moves into this game so I don't know what will happen further down the line."

8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1pp1/2n1pn1p/8/3P1B2/P4N2/1PP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,Ultimately I prefer the Bishops to always have some pressure on Black pawn at c7 in case they castle. Same goes for White bishop currently at f1. Although looks like Black is more likely to O-O

11,Bg3,f4g3,r1bqkb1r/pppp1pp1/2n1p2p/3n4/3P4/P4NBP/1PP1PPP1/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 2 6,I push B to g3 instead of h2 because I was very confident that he'd castle on the bishop side. I didn't want to be in the Rh1 way when I tried for the backdoor checkmate

32,Nb6,d5b6,r1bq1rk1/1pp2pp1/pn1ppb1p/8/3PP2P/PP1B1NB1/2PQ1PP1/2KR3R w - - 1 17,"With this, the attack begins. To be honest I don't think Black fully saw what i was ultimately going for due to lack of piece positions which I believe to be the downfall"
