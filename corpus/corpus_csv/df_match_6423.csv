1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I never play the sicilian. It is too studied, too played. I don't study, so... 
Anyway: I am a little tired of the Scandinavian. I know that my system can be beaten, so it's time to explore new sets."

3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"A self-blocking move, but this is my opinion. I know it is perfectly playable.
I like to leave the c pawn free, it's a free center-controlling outpost."
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"It gets interesting! The f pawn is delicate. From my ""advanced c pawn"" perspective it is not easy to attack. My lsb fianchettoed would be ok, but then I am supposed to castle kingside... leaving him facilities to attack it. And queenside castling doesn't sound good. So the game looks interesting at once."

6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2pp4/4PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"If he exchanges, his king gets a little exposed, not mine. I think about d5, of course."
7,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/5P2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"Getting a good ""squeezing outpost"" on the center, but leaving wide open my play on the great light diagonal! 
And trhowing away the possible f5. Kingside gets somewhat ""blocked"", unless he plays, in the future, g4 (hmmmm!)"
8,a6,a7a6,rnbqkbnr/1p3ppp/p3p3/2ppP3/5P2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"Necessary. If d5 at once, the knight jumps ""looking at d6, a place I don't want it to get. The black's dsb has a good spot in b5, I don't want to leave holes so early in my position."
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/1p3ppp/p3p3/2ppP3/5P2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"If d5, Ne4, aiming to d6. 
I have the ""problem"" to develop my kingside, as always in the scheme I am playing. 
But, since I plan to fiachetto the lsb... why don't go for a pawn storm on the queenside and starting worrying him? 
I want to take advantage of the uneasy position of the knight c3."
10,b5,b7b5,rnbqkbnr/5ppp/p3p3/1pppP3/5P2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Now, once I have covered the white squares a4 and b5, I can push d4! and the knight has to retire. Ok, it is not a great plan, since he can retire it and use it for a kingside attack. But he has to go for it, and I will have time to defend or go ahead with my attack."
11,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/5ppp/p3p3/1pppP3/3P1P2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"Veeeerrry tempting: c4! Then Bd7 (he blocked the diagonal for my fianchetto), and b4! What a lot of space!

Ok, now think a moment: not a single piece developed. I recall a game someone won without moving a single piece, only pawns... but hey, stay calm. 

cxd keeps the possibility of a clearance of the white diagonal. But I will be seeing too many white pieces around... so I decided to play the thematic (but not in this order)..."
12,Qb6,d8b6,rnb1kbnr/5ppp/pq2p3/1pppP3/3P1P2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,"Now he cannot take (Bxc4 is good for me, since Na4 is not possible) and I threat to take it then Bc4. So he must play..."
13,Be3,c1e3,rnb1kbnr/5ppp/pq2p3/1pppP3/3P1P2/2N1BN2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 2 7,"I am not worried (as thematic in this scheme), since he cannot easily put another piece attacking c5. 
Even starting with a sicilian, I am playing in a kind of familiar scheme (Scandinavian with 2. e5). I don't like my white bishop is inside (I like this position with the bishop in f5, even if it get exchanged with the white knight).
But It looks good, specially because white seems too in a hurry to attack the kingside."

Ok. 
I had directly Qa4, or the normal Ne7. 
I don't know exactly why, I played the ""other"" normal one."

Ok, but his queen can go to..."

On the other side: am I in danger? Of what? A sac in b5, maybe...?"

With the lsb OUTSIDE, this sac is dangerous, but not now. Oh, yes, he wants me to take it to have his knight in b5, then d6... it LOOKS strong, indeed."
