If Black had done Kb6 here instead, I would have done Qxc6+, which would have basically forced Black to take my queen with his own, and then I would have taken the queen with my pawn. Black would probably have then either taken my pawn with the king, in which case I would have captured the bishop with my rook, or moved the bishop out of harm's way, in which case I would have moved my rook to a6 to check the king again,. Even so, I have played through that outcome and although I am still able to checkmate, it takes an additional few moves, and since I'm not sure how Black would have responded to some of them, the game might not have ended so quickly."
