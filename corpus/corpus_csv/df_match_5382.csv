7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk1nr/pp1pppbp/6p1/2p5/4PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 4,"It is surely bad to exchange the dsb, but in this case it has two interesting conuntersides: if white goes d2xc3 leaves the two pawns alone. Yes they are strong, but will they survive the midgame? If bxc3, white has a strong center, but on the other side has no really safe castling either side. Just wondering. Of course the text move is perfectly ok."

10... Nxd5 will lead to massive exchanges. After them, white can end up with a doubled c pawn (BxN somewhere) or even tripled (if dxc5) :-) 10... Nxd5, 11. dxc5? NxNc3, 12. QxQ+, KxQ, 13. Rd1+, Kc7, 14. bxNc3 (virtually forced) Bxc3, 15. Rb1, b5, with a better position for black, I believe.

No hurry to take d5, better try to block a little white's already cramped position. But overlooks white's next move:"
