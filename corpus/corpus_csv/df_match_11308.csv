1,b3,b2b3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is one of my favourite games and a game which every beginner chess player should see. In this game Boris Spassky demonstrates his ability to sacrifice accurately against Bent Larsen. It also shows how powerful a passed pawn can be.

1.b3: 

A typical Larsen move. Larsen was an adventerous player who allways like to play for wins. Larsen was also famous for this opening move, b3 which was rightfully named after him (Nimzovich-Larsen attack). However, this move is considered ""less perfect"" compared to the ""perfect five"" (e4, d4, c4, Nf3 and g3). One might ask why as g3 and b3 are very alike but there are two differences between them:

1. b3 followed by Bb2 does not help K-side castling where as g3 and bg2 does.
2. To enhance the power of the bishop on b2 white will probably play f4 which weakens the K-side but to enhance the power of a bishop on g2 white can play c4 which doesn't weaken the K-side."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Black has plenty of options (e5, d5, c5, Nf6) but this move is probably the best. Black tries to limit the power of white's bishop on b2 (when it gets there). However, the e pawn being the weaker pawn compared to the d pawn may come under attack from the bishop on b2."
3,Bb2,c1b2,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/1P6/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,The logcal follow up attacking the e pawn.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/8/1P6/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,Developing and neutralising white's threat. The other possible move was d6 but the text move keeps blacks' options open.
5,c4,c2c4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2P5/1P6/PB1PPPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,White seizes control of d5 with a good move. The other option was e4 but after 3...Nf6 4.Nc3 the bishop on b2 is out of action and black has an easy game.
6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2P5/1P6/PB1PPPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,Simple developing.
7,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2P5/1P3N2/PB1PPPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,"A interesting move by Larsen. White dares the e pawn to advance which gains time but as compensation, white gets full control of the a1 h8 diagonal. The idea behind this move is similar to the Alekhine Defence (1.e4 Nf6)."
8,e4,e5e4,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/2P1p3/1P3N2/PB1PPPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,What I said before about gaining time.
9,Nd4,f3d4,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/2PNp3/1P6/PB1PPPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,Ng5 risks discovered attacks if the Nf6 moves. Therefore the knight will have to be protected by a pawn wasting more time.
10,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b5/2PNp3/1P6/PB1PPPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,A good move from Spassky. Black forces white to waste more time by moving the knight again.
11,Nxc6,d4c6,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2N2n2/2b5/2P1p3/1P6/PB1PPPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,The only logical move. Nf5 is met with 6...d5 with a massive centre. (If 7.Nxg7 then Kf8 and the Knight is trapped.
12,dxc6,d7c6,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2p2n2/2b5/2P1p3/1P6/PB1PPPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,An excellent move. Usually it is best to caputre towards the centre but Spassky accurately analyses that white is behind in development and with this move he opens the diagonal for his other bishop to come in and help an attack.
13,e3,e2e3,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2p2n2/2b5/2P1p3/1P2P3/PB1P1PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,White must get the bishop out to be able to castle.
14,Bf5,c8f5,r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2p2n2/2b2b2/2P1p3/1P2P3/PB1P1PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,Developing.
15,Qc2,d1c2,r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2p2n2/2b2b2/2P1p3/1P2P3/PBQP1PPP/RN2KB1R b KQkq - 2 8,"An interesting move. The queen now puts pressure on the e-pawn and prevents the e pawn from moving as Qxf5 wins material (all this will come clear on whites 10th move). However, this does nothing to help the K-side development and perhaps Be2, 0-0 and then this move is better."
16,Qe7,d8e7,r3k2r/ppp1qppp/2p2n2/2b2b2/2P1p3/1P2P3/PBQP1PPP/RN2KB1R w KQkq - 3 9,Black bolsters his e-pawn as it is a real hazard for white. He also prepares Q-side castling which is a good idea as the Bb2 could be dangerous if he castles K-side.
17,Be2,f1e2,r3k2r/ppp1qppp/2p2n2/2b2b2/2P1p3/1P2P3/PBQPBPPP/RN2K2R b KQkq - 4 9,Preparing castling.
18,O-O-O,e8c8,2kr3r/ppp1qppp/2p2n2/2b2b2/2P1p3/1P2P3/PBQPBPPP/RN2K2R w KQ - 5 10,"Simple castling one might think, but watch the Rook on the d file and the pawn on d2..."
19,f4,f2f4,2kr3r/ppp1qppp/2p2n2/2b2b2/2P1pP2/1P2P3/PBQPB1PP/RN2K2R b KQ f3 0 10,"As said in my first comment, white this move is usually played to enhance white's bishop. This is also the main idea behind Larsen's Qc2 move as exf en passant Qxf5 wins. However, white should have played Bxf6 exchanging blacks knight because the following move puts him in trouble..."
20,Ng4,f6g4,2kr3r/ppp1qppp/2p5/2b2b2/2P1pPn1/1P2P3/PBQPB1PP/RN2K2R w KQ - 1 11,"! An excellent move by Spassky which prevents castling! If 11. 0-0 then Rxd2! wins material as Qxd2 loses to Bxe3  forking the queen and king and winning Two pawns and a queen for a rook and bishop. Furthermore, Black threatens Qh4  with a massive attack."
