1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I was going to do an annotation of this great counter-attacking game and then (sadly for me) I found a far better one in Mihail Marin's ""Secrets of Attacking Chess.""  Since I felt the need to share this gem with people I've given his analysis here with a few notes.  I fully recommend the book.  Be aware that the analysis is frequently lengthy, but is nicely historical (theory-wise) and gives interesting thoughts, though I HUGELY recommend having a board to follow variations and only playing this game through if you have a lot of time.  Also the analysis starts on move 15.  Enjoy!  Oh yeah, and there's not much point in rating this (though of course you can) cause I didn't do the analysis."

By retreating the bishop to a less exposed square, Geller avoids the fork with ...e4 and keeps his attacking potential intact.  The obvious drawback of this move is that a1-rook is cut off from play for a long time, but, as we shall see, Black needs to display great ingeuity to take advantage of this detail."
30,d5,d6d5,2r2rk1/1bq1bppp/p4n2/np1pp3/3PP3/5N1P/PP3PP1/RBBQRNK1 w - - 0 16,"At the time I am writing (note: the book's copyright is 2005), theory on this whole variation is rather well developed.  However, until very recently, I have never played the closed systems of the Ruy Lopez.  And yet, my feeling is that this move is an inaccuracy.  Black opens the diagonal of the white light-squared bishop too easily.

Later, Keres started employing another, more subtle, method based on 15... Nd7 against both 15.Bd3 and 15.Bb1.  In case of a natural developing move, such as 16.Ne3, he would release the tension in the centre with 16... exd5 in order to activate all his minor pieces.  The method of play looks especially effective against 15.Bb1, when white still has to justify the placement of his bishop.  The critical test probably consists of 16.d5 when Black can stir up huge complications with 16... f5 undermining the d5-pawn and activating his b7 bishop."
31,exd5,e4d5,2r2rk1/1bq1bppp/p4n2/np1Pp3/3P4/5N1P/PP3PP1/RBBQRNK1 b - - 0 16,"?!  Since 16... e4 seems less effective now in view of 17.Ng5, Keres adopts a rather simplistic solution.  This attitude could have cost him dearly.  Later, he came to the conclusion that this line should be continued a bit further with 17... Rfd8 18.Nxe4 Nxd5.  Indeed, Black has definite compensation for the pawn, in view of his excellent mobilization and White's problems developing his queenside (to which the b1-bishop belongs now).  As for a definitive evaluation of  this position, tournament practice might some day give an answer.

After Keres's move, White has a very promising position.  With the exception of the a1-rook all his pieces are well situated.  His minor pieces are targeting the enemy kingside, the e1-rook keeps the e7-bishop under pressure and the queen is ready to join an eventual attack.  Black has some problems with his coordination.  His a5-knight is quite far from the king and can hardly be of any use in the eventuality of a lightning attack.  Even the seemingly active major pieces doubled on the c-file do not threaten anything serious.

With his next move, Geller causes his opponent big problems with recuperating the d5-pawn."

33,Bg5,c1g5,2r2rk1/1bq1bppp/p4n2/np1P2B1/3p4/5N1P/PP3PP1/RB1QRNK1 b - - 1 17,"! The pin is quite unpleasant.  The main point is that 17... Nxd5? leads to disaster in view of 18.Bxe7 Nxe7 19.Bxh7 ! Kxh7 20.Ng5  Kg6 21.Ng3! as given by Keres.  This is a superb illustration of the force displayed by White's minor pieces in combination with the queen.  The bishops were employed to eliminate important defenders and to create disharmony in Black's camp, while the knights offer the queen reliable support in the hunt for the king.  The immediate threat is 22.Qh5  Kf6 23.Nh7#, while after 21... Rh8 22.Qg4  the threat of Ne6 , hitting both g7 and c7, is impossible to parry adequately since 22... f5 allows 23.Re6# while 22... Kf6 is strongly met by 23.h4! placing the g5 square under control and creating decisive threats such as Re6  or Nh7  followed by Qg5#.

Keres took what looked like a reasonable decision:"

However, Keres correctly points out that this natural move should have been the losing mistake.  However, he is too optimistic when considering Black's position as entirely satisfactory after 17... Rfe8.  This is a good move but the problem is that Black has already gone wrong and there are no completely satisfactory options available to him any more.  Curiously, contemporary theory is not too well settled here:

a) ECO gives 18.Qd3 as winning but black seems able to survive with 18... Kf8!  (ECO only  mentions 18... g6? when after 19.Rxe7 Qxe7 20.Qxd4 White obtained an overwhelming attack in Ernst-Hedman, Avesta 1993), acknowledging that the infiltration of the queen to h7 is not dangerous in itself, if it does not lead to an immediate mate. (note: there's a reference here to another game in the book that I've taken out of this annotation)  After 19.Bxf6 (19.Nxd4 can now be met by 19... h6!?, followed by the capture on d5) 19... Bxf6 we suddenly see the drawback of the retreating the bishop to b1: the lack of coordination between the rooks and the weakness of the first rank prevent white from obtain anything concrete.  For instance 20.Qa3 (the most ambitious move but probably not the best; White should probably admit that he has no advantage with either 20.Qxh7 Rxe1 21.Nxe1 Bxd5 or 20.Rxe8  Rxe8 21.Qxh7 Bxd5; in fact I would prefer black in both cases) 20... Be7 21.Rxe7 (this is intended to be a strong tactical blow) 21... Qxe7 22.Qxa5 White has managed to win material, but after 22... Rc1 23.Qd2 Qc5 his queenside is completely paralyzed.  Once again, the usefulness of the move ...Kf8 is obvious: White cannot take on h7 with check.

b) 18.Qxd4 seems to be a better solution.  After 18... Nxd5 19.Bf5 Rxd8 20.Rac1 Nc6 21.Qh4 white completes his development and retains strong pressure.  This has occured in some correspondence games.  We now return to 17... h6?:"
35,Bh4,g5h4,2r2rk1/1bq1bpp1/p4n1p/np1P4/3p3B/5N1P/PP3PP1/RB1QRNK1 b - - 1 18,"? This is the turning point of the game.  White's play so far has been quite logical and once can sense the danger looming over Black's position.  I am pretty sure that Geller was looking for a tactical crowing of his superior strategy and that the sacrifce 18.Bxh6! didn't escape his attention.  After 18... gxh6 the relatively 'quiet' move 19.Qd2 gives Black unsolvable problems.  Once again, the combined action of the queen and the minor pieces has devastating effect.  Keres gives the following analysis: 19... Rfd8 (aiming to clear the way for the king and activate the rook via the fifth rank; both 19... Bxd5 20.Qxh6 Bxf3 21.Ng3! followed by Nf5 or, in some cases, Nh5 and 19... Kg7 20.Ng3 Ng8 21.Nf5  Kh8 22.Nxe7! are hopeless for Black) 20.Qxh6 Rxd5 21.Re4! (as Keres indicates, 21.Ng3 is less clear in view of 21... Bf8! 22.Qxf6 Bg7 23.Qh4 d3 when White suddenly has problems with his queenside, while the black king has relative safety) 21... Rh5 22.Rg4  (eliminating the h5-rook which is the key defender of the king) 22... Nxg4 23.Qxh5 Nf6 24.Qg5  Kf8 25.Qh6  Ke8 (or if 25... Kg8 then 26.Ng5 followed by Bh7 , Bg6  and Bxf7 ) and now the simple threat of 26.Bf5 completing development and threatening Qh8  or Re1 is decisive.

However, calculating everything over the board is not easy here and after some time he might have asked himself whether there wasn't any simpler solution available.  Then he must discovered the variation actually played in the game up the the 22nd move and decided this was a better practical decision, being competely risk-free.   If my supposition is right, Geller would have needed just an effort of will to follow his instinct, since Keres considers the rejection of the sacrifice with 28.Rfd8 to be the lesser evil, although he agrees that after 19.Bg5 Rxd5 20.Qd3 g6 21.h4 white has a nice attacking position.  Although these variations are quite instructive, the most interesting phase of the game is still to come."

However, it is perfectly understandable that such an approach, obviously aiming for equality, didn't appeal to Geller.

Indeed, the position of the b1-bishop will not be easy to improve while the a5-knight just needs to jump once (to c4) to join the rest of the well-centralized black army.

a) The attempt to include the bishop in the attack leaves the c2-square without defense (the only good the bishop has been doing this game) after 26.Be4 Nxf2  27.Kg1 (or similarly 27.Kg2 Nxe4 followed by ...Rc2 ) 27... Nxe4 28.Rxe4 Qxf3 followed by ...Rc2.

b) 26.Nh2 places the knight on a vulnerable square and leaves White without the possibility of defending the g-file with Ng3 in case of 26... Nxf2  27.Kg2 Rc5 or 26...Rc5 at once.

c) 26.Kg2 seeks to create disharmony in Black's army based on the fact that the f4-square is temporarily unavailable to the knight.  However, this fails.  After the simple 26... Qh4 the threat of ...Nf4  followed by ...Qh4 cannot be parried adequately; for instance, 27.Qd2 (or 27.Nh2 Nf4  28.Kh1 Qxf2 29.Rg1 Rc1! mating; in case of 27.Re4 Qxf2  28.Kxh3 Qxf1  Black has three pawns for the bishop, while the white queenside is paralyzed for ever) 27...
