I have gone with Qc3 as it allows the powerful d5 advance (threating mate and attacking the c6 knight) and allows Nb-d2."

Nd-f3 is interesting, but it heavily commits the h4 knight - If the bishop at b6 wasn't attacking the e3 rook it would be playable and interesting, but I don't want to risk the combination after 23. Nf3 g5 24. d5 Qxc3 25. Bxc3  Which seems to leave the h4 knight and the e3 rook hanging.

23. Rf3 is very interesting if it wasn't for the fact the Nx4 seems to kill any hopes on that line. 23. Rg3 increases the threat of d5 but again the d4 pawn is hanging.

I think I have no choice but to play Nh-f3, and take a draw if black does not play for more."
