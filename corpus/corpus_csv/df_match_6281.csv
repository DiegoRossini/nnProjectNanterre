I have to be careful of his knight moving. Right now, my queen's protecting my bishop on d6, but if I put a knight on d7, then I have to watch for discovered attacks. Normally, White likes to play Bf4 to get rid of Black's powerful bishop, and it's a good move for Black to capture Bxf4 and force White to recapture with gxf4; that hurts White's kingside a lot. But I'm wondering if White will play Nd3 to enable him to recapture with the knight instead of the bishop."

He's threatening 12. Nxe4 fxe4; 13. Bxe4 and my pawn on d5 is pinned because the bishop on e6 is unguarded. I thought about playing Nxc3 here. That's a trap -- if he plays Qxb7, I'll play Nxe2+ and then Qb6 (and if he plays Qxa8 after that, Nd7 traps his queen)."
22,Qe7,d8e7,rn3rk1/pp2q1pp/2pbb3/3pNp2/3PnB2/1QN3P1/PP2PPBP/R4RK1 w - - 6 12,"This move protects both of my bishops and my pawn on b7. 
What I'm nervous about is that my queen is being used to guard two pieces and a pawn. I have to watch out for combinations against her being overworked.
Next, I may play Na6, looking at Rc8 and c5 at some point."

It may be that he's anticipating my playing Na6 and looking at c5, and then he would want a rook on the d-file to be hitting the pawn on d5."

I looked for a while at how I might play g5 to chase off his bishop. The books I taught from showed lots of games where Black's surprisingly safe when playing g5 in the Dutch. I think it's because White's queen is on the queenside and diagonals to the king are blocked, so White really can't take good advantage of the move. For Black, it leads to f4 at some point, and my queen and a rook and bishops and a knight are ready to attack his king if I can open it up a little. 
But, for now, I can't play g5 because he can trade knights first on e5 then take the pawn with the bishop. And if I take back with the queen, he plays Qxb7. But I'm going to remember that move in case I can use it still, coming up."
25,Nd3,e5d3,r4rk1/pp2q1pp/n1pbb3/3p1p2/3PnB2/1QNN2P1/PP2PPBP/R2R2K1 b - - 9 13,"Yeah, I thought I saw that move coming. 
I can't trade on f4 because it makes his knight too powerful and I have to move my bishop to f7. That's not a bad square for it (it lets the bishop go over to h5 at the right time), but I'd rather not block my rook yet."
26,Rab8,a8b8,1r3rk1/pp2q1pp/n1pbb3/3p1p2/3PnB2/1QNN2P1/PP2PPBP/R2R2K1 w - - 10 14,"I looked at g5 again, but I lose a pawn after. 13 â€¦ g5; 14. Nxe4 fxe4; 15. Bxd6 Qxd6; 16. Qxb7. 
 
I didn't find any real strong offensive moves, so I chose a defensive move that stop the Qxb7 threat. Now g5 becomes an option -- though I have a feeling he's planning to trade my bishop on d6 and then put the knight back on e5 even. 
 
Sometimes it's good to ask which is your worst piece, and then make plans to improve it. I don't like my knight on a6. It doesn't stop anything, and I'm not sure it threatens anything -- unless I want to play c5. I have to look at that. It threatens c4. But if he trades pawns on c5, I'm not sure that helps me, and my pawn in the center is isolated and weak. The other choices for my knight are b4, but that's not good. It chases his knight back to a better square (e5), it's easily chased away by a3 (and can only return to a6), and it's not even safe after White plays Bxd6 and removes one of its defenders. So that means that the knight is going to c7. But what can it do there unless I move my other bishop and let it go to e6.
 
I feel like I don't have any real weaknesses, but I don't have a strong plan yet."
27,e3,e2e3,1r3rk1/pp2q1pp/n1pbb3/3p1p2/3PnB2/1QNNP1P1/PP3PBP/R2R2K1 b - - 0 14,"That surprised me. I was certain he planned to trade my bishop and put his knight back on e5. I'm not sure what he's up to. This closes the position even more and makes my position even safer. His, too."
28,Bxf4,d6f4,1r3rk1/pp2q1pp/n1p1b3/3p1p2/3Pnb2/1QNNP1P1/PP3PBP/R2R2K1 w - - 0 15,"So I decided to do what I'd rejected before. I'm going to trade the bishops. I'm sure he'll recapture with the knight, and I'm kind of hoping, even, that he'll trade his knight for my other bishop. In closed positions like this, knights generally have a big advantage over bishops. Notice that all of pawns on white squares make both of our light bishops pretty ineffective. His hope for an advantage might be to trade his knight for my bishop, put his on h3, and then trade knights on e4. If I take back fxe4, suddenly his bishop would control an important line behind my pawns. 
 
 What I'm looking at is getting my knights to d6 and f6 (I'm guessing his other choice is to play f3 to chase mine off of its powerful post). Then, if he plays Ne5, I'll be able to play Nf7 to challenge it.
 
That's a lot of knight moves, but that's the big difference between open and closed game. This is a closed game; look how there aren't any open lines and the pawns block attempts to get to the other king. In closed positions, knights are stronger because they can get past the roadblocks. Also, attacks develop much more slowly. You don't have to be as concerned about rapidly developing attacks because the lines of attack just don't exist yet. In closed positions, be willing to take your time to get your pieces to the best square; don't rush your attack."
29,exf4,e3f4,1r3rk1/pp2q1pp/n1p1b3/3p1p2/3PnP2/1QNN2P1/PP3PBP/R2R2K1 b - - 0 15,"That's a huge surprise to me. I felt that his knight would be very strong on f4. Maybe he was worried about me playing g5, but then he'd just go back to d3 and e5.
 
When your opponent surprises you, think about what he's planning to do. He didn't just arbitrarily make a bad move; he has a plan in mind that I'll have to deal with. The sooner I can figure out what he's up to, the better off I'll be.
 
I think he's telling me that he cleared out the e-file so he can post rooks on it and dominate it. If he puts a rook on e1 and plays f3 to chase away my knight, he might be planning to put the rook on e5 and then the other one on e1. It'd be hard to withstand the pressure on my bishop.
 
I need to decide if I want to stay defensive and play Nc7 which would support that bishop. Or do I want to break open the other side with c5 while I have two knights and a queen supporting that move."
