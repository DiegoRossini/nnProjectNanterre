1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Queen's pawn. One of my favorite openings. It usually leads to expansive and open games (which I tend to loose, but still enjoy)"
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Nothing strange, he replies in kind."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Queen's gambit. I love this opening, for if he accepts the gambit by playing dxe4, I'll reply with e5, immediately opting for control of the center squares and attacking his c-file isolated pawn."
4,Be6,c8e6,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/4b3/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"Then he plays a strange move. Mistake by my calculation. This move is also not in the GK database. This move protects the d-pawn but it impairs development. The e-file pawn cannot advance and the dark square bishop (DSB) is blocked in.

e6 would be better do decline the gambit."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/4b3/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 3,"Developing the queen's side pieces, re-enforcing my control of the center while attacking d5."
6,c6,c7c6,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p1b3/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Protecting the d-pawn.

Another mistake, as this reduces developing options for the knight on b8."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p1b3/3p4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,Developing.
