However, treat material like a positional factor in a position, like activity, structure, better minor pieces etc.. A 2300 player, in a game once failed to sacrifice his queen for 2 bishops but large counterplay and stuck to his passive defense and lost quickly. I have won the psychological battle against material overestimation here. Unfortunately, my opponent fights his own battle against ""chess fear""."

Although 9...Nxf4 10.Ne5? Bxe5 11.Bxf4 Qd4+ gives black a clear advantage, I had prepared a pawn sacrifice with 9...Nxf4 10.Ne4! with full compensation. Another line is 9...Bxf4?! 10.Bxf4 Nxf4 11.Qd2 Ng6 12.Qe3 is good or slightly better for white. @jkarp and others: Please read my annotations. I know that they may be tedious, but they will help you get rid of bad thought process. I gave variations here justifying the pawn sacrifice. Yes, he can win a ""point""(Pawn is more accurate, since counting points in positions doesn't mean much usually), but remember again: MATERIAL IS JUST ANOTHER POSITIONAL IMBALANCE. If you lose a game, something in the position must have been bad for you, whether it was doubled pawns or something else. The point is that, in my variations, I get adequete development and activity to offset this imbalance. The point: If you treat material as different and worth more than the other positional considerations, then you will always be timid to the strong sacrifices. Material is important, but activity is just as important. Instead of tying down my pieces and weakening their activity, I strengthen my own pieces and increase the activity, all for a pawn. It is a sound sacrifice."

He makes 2 exchanges of his most active pieces, and leaves white with a kingside advantage with opposite color bishops, and no piece protection for the king. This also frees my dark squared bishop immediately. Ridiculous move, but it shows my opponent being afraid of ghosts and ""exchanging to draw"". That leaves another principle: Exchanges do not necessarily clarify the position at all. When you make an exchange, you are making a critical decision that may alter the position drastically. Once again, please remember that because material is even, does not mean the position is close to it. In fact, here, white has a major advantage worth just as much or even more than a pawn, since he will soon have a powerful attack."

Applying these into your thought process wioll improve you a lot, because these are 3 huge and common mistkaes by even strong players. @jkarp: After looking at your thought process, I believe that the way for you to improve is the following: 1.Do not think so much about the principles and general rules in chess as much as the concrete analysis. This is the 3rd most common mistake by club players: They judge the quality of moves by using principles and general rules. Principles are only for selecting candidate ideas and tiebreaks in case you analysed 2 moves, and they are equal. Objectivity is the key.  2.Remember the rule: A move, no matter how good it looks, is only good or bad based on the opponent's answer(s) to it. 3.If you can use these ideas in your though process, your performance will soar.
