18,Bb7,c8b7,rn1qk2r/1b2bppp/p2ppn2/1p4B1/3NP3/1BN5/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 2 10,"It's more common to castle here, but I decided to put some more pressure against the e4-pawn."
19,Re1,f1e1,rn1qk2r/1b2bppp/p2ppn2/1p4B1/3NP3/1BN5/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 b kq - 3 10,An interesting alternative variation would be 10. Bxe6!? fxe6 11. Nxe6 Qd7 12. Nxg7  Kf8 and white would surely have an advantage. Therefore I think 9...0-0 would have been better.
20,Nbd7,b8d7,r2qk2r/1b1nbppp/p2ppn2/1p4B1/3NP3/1BN5/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 w kq - 4 11,Notice how 10... b4 11. Nd5 exd5 12. exd5 Bc8 13. Bxf6 gxf6 is good for white with good initiative.
21,h3,h2h3,r2qk2r/1b1nbppp/p2ppn2/1p4B1/3NP3/1BN4P/PPP2PP1/R2QR1K1 b kq - 0 11,"? Black has a cramped position, but this move allows him to get back in the game. 11. Bxe6 fxe6 12. Nxe6 would have been better I think."
22,b4,b5b4,r2qk2r/1b1nbppp/p2ppn2/6B1/1p1NP3/1BN4P/PPP2PP1/R2QR1K1 w kq - 0 12,I now feel that 11... Nc5 would have been a stronger option here. After for example 12.a3 black is slightly better.
23,Na4,c3a4,r2qk2r/1b1nbppp/p2ppn2/6B1/Np1NP3/1B5P/PPP2PP1/R2QR1K1 b kq - 1 12,12. Nd5!? exd5 13. Bxd5 Nxd5 14. exd5 looks interesting but I think black can hold here.
24,Nxe4,f6e4,r2qk2r/1b1nbppp/p2pp3/6B1/Np1Nn3/1B5P/PPP2PP1/R2QR1K1 w kq - 0 13,"?? Grabbing the pawn almost instantly, but 12... O-O secures black's position."
25,Bxe7,g5e7,r2qk2r/1b1nBppp/p2pp3/8/Np1Nn3/1B5P/PPP2PP1/R2QR1K1 b kq - 0 13,"White is winning here. The e6-pawn is very weak, especially because the black king is still in the centre and the black queen isn't very well placed on e7."
26,Qxe7,d8e7,r3k2r/1b1nqppp/p2pp3/8/Np1Nn3/1B5P/PPP2PP1/R2QR1K1 w kq - 0 14,"White is winning here. The e6-pawn is very weak, especially because the black king is still in the centre and the black queen isn't very well placed on e7."
27,Qg4,d1g4,r3k2r/1b1nqppp/p2pp3/8/Np1Nn1Q1/1B5P/PPP2PP1/R3R1K1 b kq - 1 14,"?? Too bad, this move doesn't really improve the position for white. 14.f3 looks almost winning to me. But let's not forget the time control here. Time flies when you're having fun!"
28,Nef6,e4f6,r3k2r/1b1nqppp/p2ppn2/8/Np1N2Q1/1B5P/PPP2PP1/R3R1K1 w kq - 2 15,Setting up a rather obvious trap.
29,Qxg7,g4g7,r3k2r/1b1nqpQp/p2ppn2/8/Np1N4/1B5P/PPP2PP1/R3R1K1 b kq - 0 15,??? White is lost now. 15. Qg3 was a good chance to save the game. 15...Nh5 16. Qe3
