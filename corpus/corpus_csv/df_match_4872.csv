4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,This is usually why you don't see the Grand Prix all that much.  But White's game is still quite playable.
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/4PP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,Invites Black's reply.  White has a certain gambit in mind...
6,dxe4,d5e4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2p5/4pP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Inviting ...Nf6 to protect the lead e-pawn.  White is aiming for a line I have dubbed the 'Demolition Derby' Attack:  4...Nf6  5.Bc4!? (apparently allowing Black to win White's Queen) ...Bg4  6.Bxf7ch Kd7  7.Qxg4 Nxg4  8.Be6ch ... 9.Bxg4.  For the Queen, White gets active play and Black has difficulty just developing.  The jury is still out on the soundness of this ultra-violent line.  (I wonder if  'A Clockwork Orange' Attack wouldn't be a better appellation?  Maybe that should go with the Caro Kann version...)."

9,Bb5+,f1b5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/8/1Bp1p1N1/4pP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,"(!?) I have my doubts about this, though I won't condemn it out of hand.  It seems to me 5.Bc4 was still a good move here."
10,Bd7,c8d7,rn1qkbnr/pp1b1ppp/8/1Bp1p1N1/4pP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 6,"The obvious response.  Yet there was something to be said for 5....Nc6, even though Black might have got a lot of doubled pawns scattered about: 5...Nc6  6.Bxc6 bxc6  7.Nxe4 exf4 ..."
11,Bxd7+,b5d7,rn1qkbnr/pp1B1ppp/8/2p1p1N1/4pP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"In effect, White has gambited a pawn, but doesn't have all that much for it.  Could this be one of those positional gambits the hypermoderns used to play, with a view to the ending?  White has the Q-side majority (which proves to be a major motif in this game), but realising it seems a long way off."

15,O-O,e1g1,r2qkbnr/pp1n1ppp/8/2p5/4Np2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 8,"Pragmatic: continuing her development.  But worth considering was 8.Qe2, a move that has some developmental value, but tests Black's alertness.  If he were to play, say, 8...Nf6 then 9.Nd6# ends proceedings right there.  Black would just about have to play his lone already-developed piece (8...Ne4) to remain on roughly level terms."
16,f5,f7f5,r2qkbnr/pp1n2pp/8/2p2p2/4Np2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 9,"Rather awkward, as it interferes with the development of the other knight.  Too bad: there doesn't seem to be anything better."

18,Bd6,f8d6,r2qk1nr/pp1n2pp/3b4/2p2p2/5p2/2N5/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 10,"An interesting development.  Black wants to maintain that lead f-pawn for as long as possible.  Was he already contemplating a direct attack upon White's King?  Note that the bishop exerts, through the f-pawn, a certain amount of pressure on h2."
19,d3,d2d3,r2qk1nr/pp1n2pp/3b4/2p2p2/5p2/2NP4/PPP3PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 10,"(!?)  Sticking to his plan of attack against h2, and maintains the lead f-pawn for the time being as well.  The GK engine mislikes this in favour of 10...Ne2  11.Nb5!? Be5  12... 0-0-0.  This alternative is less committal, but equally less forcing.  The game continuation does, however, give White the opportunity for counter-action."
20,Qh4,d8h4,r3k1nr/pp1n2pp/3b4/2p2p2/5p1q/2NP4/PPP3PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 11,"(!?)  Sticking to his plan of attack against h2, and maintains the lead f-pawn for the time being as well.

21,Qf3,d1f3,r3k1nr/pp1n2pp/3b4/2p2p2/5p1q/2NP1Q2/PPP3PP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 2 11,"(!?) Thematic, but the GK engine indicates 11.Nb5 ought to have come first, with attack against d6 and c7.  After 11.Nb5 the engine suggests 11...Bb8  12.Qf3 with threats against f4 and b7.  But 11...Be5 seems better, as after 12.Qf3 Ne7  13.Qxb7?? Rb8  14.Qa6 Rb6  looks very nasty.  Instead 13.Bxf4 keeps things more or less level.  My own view is that the text move is unobjectionable."
22,g5,g7g5,r3k1nr/pp1n3p/3b4/2p2pp1/5p1q/2NP1Q2/PPP3PP/RNB2RK1 w kq - 0 12,"Further protection for f4, and stormclouds appear to be gathering darkly on the King-side.  Though 11...0-0-0 was more solid, White would have been able by 12.Bxf4 somewhat to blunt Black's attack.  As it happens, White doesn't appear to be much fazed by Black's threatening attitude..."

24,Rb8,a8b8,1r2k1nr/pQ1n3p/3b4/2p2pp1/5p1q/2NP4/PPP3PP/RNB2RK1 w k - 1 13,"(!?) Sensible-looking, and centralising, yet the GK engine doesn't approve.  According to its wisdom, 13.Qa6 ought to have been played.  I'm inclined to agree, as that move combines attack on a7 as well as d6.  But I think White wanted to keep the Queen nearer the action, bearing in mind, her Q-side has yet to make a move."

26,Be5,d6e5,1r2k1nr/p2n3p/8/2pQbpp1/5p1q/2NP4/PPP3PP/RNB2RK1 w k - 3 14,"(!) Good defence: keeps a watch over f4 (and h2), and closes off the e-file (else White might have continued Qe6ch and Re1)."
27,Qe6+,d5e6,1r2k1nr/p2n3p/4Q3/2p1bpp1/5p1q/2NP4/PPP3PP/RNB2RK1 b k - 4 14,"As planned, I suspect, but White might equally well have considered beginning to bring out her Q-side: 14.Nd2, with 15.Nf3 to follow.  Black has a bit of a lead in development that White can not afford to see become much longer."
28,Kd8,e8d8,1r1k2nr/p2n3p/4Q3/2p1bpp1/5p1q/2NP4/PPP3PP/RNB2RK1 w - - 5 15,Black has to forgo castling as after 14...Ne7  15.Nd5! g4  16.Bxf4 Bxf4  17.Rxf4 Kd8 and white can exchange down into a very promising endgame: 18.Qxe7ch Qxe7  19.Nxe7 Kxe7  20.b3 - White would have the stronger pawns and an extra pawn as well.
29,Qxf5,e6f5,1r1k2nr/p2n3p/8/2p1bQp1/5p1q/2NP4/PPP3PP/RNB2RK1 b - - 0 15,"(!?) Once more, GK prefers 15.Nd2.  But White has it in mind to stymie once and for all, Black's K-side offensive."
