82,g5,g7g5,b7/5p2/7p/N1K1kppP/P7/5P2/2P3P1/8 w - g6 0 42,This move forces White now to take a look at at least four different possibly winning candidate moves.  It is interesting to note the positions of the knight and the bishop here.  We are familiar with the saying that a knight on a rim is grim.  But could it be that a bishop on a rim is even more grim?!
83,Nc6+,a5c6,b7/5p2/2N4p/2K1kppP/P7/5P2/2P3P1/8 b - - 1 42,"This move brings the knight back into the center of the board rather than keeping it hanging out on the west coast on a5.  It also enables White to keep the pawn on the all-important h-file, thereby fixing the pawn on h6 as a probable target for the knight, rather than exchanging it for Black's g5 pawn as in 42.hxg6 e.p.  If White can capture Black's pawn on h6, the game will soon be over, since White can then push the a-pawn AND the h-pawn, and even a bishop in the center of the board will not be able to stop one of the pawns from promoting."
