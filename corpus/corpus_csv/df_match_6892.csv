1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I think i went wrong in the opening in this game and my opponent developed a very strong position and had a positional bind which i was fortunate enough to overcome and managed to win this game which was very important in the tournament we are both in as with his score of 100% i considered him a serious rival for 1st place so knew i was going to have to fight hard. The game was certainly very interesting and though a draw should have been a fair result we were both clearly playing for the win.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Currently my choice against e4 but i am itching to play d5 again.
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,Indicating that perhaps the grand prix attack is on the cards with a quick f4.
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,My standard response as the accelarated dragon is not too concerned about it.
5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/2p5/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 3,Standard stuff
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/2p5/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 2 4,Bg7 is probably better followed by e6 and the Knight finds a home on e7. The Knight move is a bit premature here and leads to a problem for me as you will see.
7,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/2p5/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 4,Giving up the opportunity of the grand prix attack but still a good move as he has developed 3 pieces and is ready to castle whereas i have developed one and i am no where near ready to castle.
8,Bg7,f8g7,r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/2p5/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 4 5,Sensing the problem but a move too late.
9,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/2p5/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 5 5,Because the pawn is not on c3 i could play Nf6 but e5 is a problem to meet. Ng4 is met by Bxf7 winning a pawn so i never feel safe with a Knight on f6 so.....
10,e6,e7e6,r1bqk1nr/pp1p1pbp/2n1p1p1/2p5/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 6,So i can slot my knight on e7 but the problem is that he is all developed and ready to go and i need 2 more moves that i have not got.
11,d4,d2d4,r1bqk1nr/pp1p1pbp/2n1p1p1/2p5/2BPP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 6,"Excellent move. It sacrifices a pawn but puts the question to me ""What are you going to do??"" I had completely missed this very strong idea."
12,cxd4,c5d4,r1bqk1nr/pp1p1pbp/2n1p1p1/8/2BpP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,Of Course it has to be taken.
13,Nb5,c3b5,r1bqk1nr/pp1p1pbp/2n1p1p1/1N6/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 7,Thats the point he can recover the pawn at will but is threatening Nd6+ which may be very strong and at the same time Bf4 is not out of the question increasing the pressure. If i play d6 then he could play Bg5 or take the pawn on d4 and i have a weakness and i am still no closer to castling and his attacking potential increases and i am going to be in trouble very quickly.
14,Nge7,g8e7,r1bqk2r/pp1pnpbp/2n1p1p1/1N6/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 8,I decided to live with the check and hope hye will grab the pawn as i want to retain the possibility of playing d7-d5 in one go and the flexibility of my pawn chain.
15,Nd6+,b5d6,r1bqk2r/pp1pnpbp/2nNp1p1/8/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 3 8,Understandable and this knight is going to be a problem for a few moves.
16,Kf8,e8f8,r1bq1k1r/pp1pnpbp/2nNp1p1/8/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 4 9,The easiest choice of the game since it is forced.
17,Bf4,c1f4,r1bq1k1r/pp1pnpbp/2nNp1p1/8/2BpPB2/5N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 5 9,Got to be a reasonable continuation for white. He now just needs to get the files open and his rooks active whilst my pieces are in disarray.
18,Qb6,d8b6,r1b2k1r/pp1pnpbp/1qnNp1p1/8/2BpPB2/5N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 6 10,Since i have allowed the check i have to keep hold of the material to justify my existence as if he ever regains the pawn i am simply lost.
19,Qd3,d1d3,r1b2k1r/pp1pnpbp/1qnNp1p1/8/2BpPB2/3Q1N2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - - 7 10,Connecting the rooks got to be good.
20,e5,e6e5,r1b2k1r/pp1pnpbp/1qnN2p1/4p3/2BpPB2/3Q1N2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 11,Treading a tightrope with this move. My only developed bishop is now rubbish but i must keep the material and try to sure up the position to survive and i figured if i can get f6 in as well his attacking chances will be stopped for a while.
