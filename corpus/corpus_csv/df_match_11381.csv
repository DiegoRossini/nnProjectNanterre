1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"this was my second game against a well rated player, at the time he was 1801. i show an example of a good looking smothered mate. he was evidentlly a bit upset that he fell for an obvious move. this however does hold some merit and has a good look to it so it would be good to analyse.i took the white pieces.

e4 the move i will almost always open with"
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,my opponent had already played me and lost so i think in playing the caro-kahn he was trying to throw me off gaurd in thinking perhaps i would not know it.
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,this is in standards of the opening book. when black follows with d5 white will keep a good center with a pawn advance to e5
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,this is another book move with a bishop attaking a later weak pawn. once white has developed this move may be a cause for concern.
5,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,this is another book move with a bishop attaking a later weak pawn. once white has developed this move may be a cause for concern.
6,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pPb2/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,this is another book move with a bishop attaking a later weak pawn. once white has developed this move may be a cause for concern.
7,Nf3,g1f3,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pPb2/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,white is in no immediate threat so a continuation of development is the best choice here.solidifying the center
8,e6,e7e6,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3pPb2/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,this is still a book move. black tries to compensate the center
9,Be2,f1e2,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3pPb2/3P4/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,this move primarily is done for me to castle.blacks bishop is poised at the moment so i want to go kingside out of harms way
10,Nd7,b8d7,r2qkbnr/pp1n1ppp/2p1p3/3pPb2/3P4/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 6,the idea here is to advance a pawn to position his knight in the center after the exchange
11,O-O,e1g1,r2qkbnr/pp1n1ppp/2p1p3/3pPb2/3P4/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 3 6,logical. also i was wanting to see what black had in mind
12,c5,c6c5,r2qkbnr/pp1n1ppp/4p3/2ppPb2/3P4/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,i saw this move without any worry
13,Nc3,b1c3,r2qkbnr/pp1n1ppp/4p3/2ppPb2/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 7,"thexchange looked good for black, this way i would have a better game if black takes the pawn"
14,c4,c5c4,r2qkbnr/pp1n1ppp/4p3/3pPb2/2pP4/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,looks powerfull for black but all his play is on the queenside
15,Be3,c1e3,r2qkbnr/pp1n1ppp/4p3/3pPb2/2pP4/2N1BN2/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 1 8,development
16,a6,a7a6,r2qkbnr/1p1n1ppp/p3p3/3pPb2/2pP4/2N1BN2/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 9,"stoping my knight moving to b5, i feel this is too pasive and so i begin my attack"
17,Qd2,d1d2,r2qkbnr/1p1n1ppp/p3p3/3pPb2/2pP4/2N1BN2/PPPQBPPP/R4RK1 b kq - 1 9,"this move is the first in my attacking idea, somtimes you have to make a passive move to attack"
18,Ne7,g8e7,r2qkb1r/1p1nnppp/p3p3/3pPb2/2pP4/2N1BN2/PPPQBPPP/R4RK1 w kq - 2 10,"now this is a mistake which i will take advantage of, better perhaps would have been bishop to b4"
19,Nh4,f3h4,r2qkb1r/1p1nnppp/p3p3/3pPb2/2pP3N/2N1B3/PPPQBPPP/R4RK1 b kq - 3 10,many players would think this was illogical but it is ok for white. an attack on the kingside is forming
20,Rc8,a8c8,2rqkb1r/1p1nnppp/p3p3/3pPb2/2pP3N/2N1B3/PPPQBPPP/R4RK1 w k - 4 11,trying to free some space by using a rook lift but all is too late at this point also cramping his king. note there are no escape squares for the king
21,Bg5,e3g5,2rqkb1r/1p1nnppp/p3p3/3pPbB1/2pP3N/2N5/PPPQBPPP/R4RK1 b k - 5 11,now the knight cannot move i am setting up the mating move
22,h6,h7h6,2rqkb1r/1p1nnpp1/p3p2p/3pPbB1/2pP3N/2N5/PPPQBPPP/R4RK1 w k - 0 12,black fails to see what i have planned
