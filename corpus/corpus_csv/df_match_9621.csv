1,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"(game info on previous page) Bird's opening (A03) named after the 19th century English master Henry Bird, probably just comes outside the bracket of the most popular opening moves: e4, d4, c4, Nf3 and g3.  They all try and contribute to control of the Centre (Nf3 and g2 in a more hyper-modern way), but Bird is less popular than The English (c4) because it weakens WT's King-Side and WT has to watch that fools mate diagonal (e1-h4).  Bent Larsen however used it to good effect.
Comment from yanov (1817):  if you look to statistics, black won more games than white, in all variations
Comment from me:  Yes, I don't particularly like it."

Another interesting option in the database was e5: The From Gambit, where White will have to play accurately to put out the flame in blacks attack.
Comment from charleshiggie (1937):  Perhaps, in case anyone is wondering, I should point out LSB = Light Squared Bishop and DSB = Dark Squared Bishop. The author also uses WT = white
Comment from me:  OK, sorry I thought it was pretty self explanatory. I'll explain that in any future annotations."

This shouldn't be a problem however should he choose to play a fianchetto with b3 and Bb2.  However with me planning to fianchetto my Bishop along the same diagonal, I heard somewhere that the K-Side Bishop usually gains control of the diagonal when opposed by a Q-Side Bishop along the same diagonal.  Not sure if that's true though.
Comment from yanov (1817):  anyway, this construction is very passive -- white must play b3 rapidly
Comment from me:  I don't see this as too bad."

Comment from just_some_guy (1303):  i actually think black is a tiny bit better here he has more open pieces his dsb is only blocked at the moment his lsd has a 5 square attack d=radius at the moment his queen has a 3 square, but white's q and lsd have 1 and 0 squares respectablly.
