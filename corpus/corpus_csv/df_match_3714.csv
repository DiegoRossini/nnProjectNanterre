21,Ne4,c3e4,r2q1rk1/pp1bbppp/2n2n2/1Bp3B1/3pN3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 b - - 1 11,Best posting for the Knight; centered and doubly defended.

45,Kf1,g1f1,4q1k1/pp3ppp/8/2Q5/3p4/3P3P/PPP1nPP1/R4K2 b - - 2 23,White chooses to grab black's last center pawn rather than press the black Queen with 24. Re1.

49,Kg1,f1g1,6k1/pp3ppp/8/8/3Q1n2/3P3P/PPP1qPP1/R5K1 b - - 2 25,"One wonders if black has decided on suicide rather than resignation. The best move here was clearly 25...Ne6, removing both the threat to the black Knight and the threat of 26. Qd8++ while attacking the white Queen."
