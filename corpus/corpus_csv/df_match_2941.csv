1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I am currently teaching myself the ""Stone Wall Attack"" and all of the variations. This is just one of the many games I am using to practice this opening. My opponent doesn't follow what I felt he would do and you'll see that I abandon the Stone Wall pretty early.

However I lose some momentum and material early and feel that I should have lost this game do to some poor decisions on my part. My opponent doesn't take advantage of his two Bishops vs. my two Knight late and makes what a feel was a fatal error with a trade. 

My opponent also either lost focus or completely undervalued pawns later and allowed me to crawl back into this game and ultimately win.

I give myself credit for hanging in and getting the Win but some bad decisions should have sunk me pretty early on.

Here we go.

D4 - Typical opening for The Stone Wall. I'm expecting Nc6 or d5."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"Nf6 - I think he is going for center control early, w/out any pawn structure or help."
3,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"I ignore the Nf6 and continue w/ the typical stone wall pawn structure. I don't like that he is already threatening e4, but w/out the pawns opening the middle he is falling behind in momentum."
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"g6- Uh oh, I Know I've seen this somewhere before... I'm perplexed as this doesn't open up the middle for black and w/ my pawns on Black if he fienchetto's his biship or even brings it to the H file he is blocked. I am bummed however as the pawn on G6 will effect my intended attack w/ the Stone Wall.

This should have been my first clue to drop the stone wall and adjust my opening."
5,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/3P4/3BP3/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 3,"However, as I am extremely new w/ this opening I know vary little variations and sadly continued to plunge on forward w/ Bd3. A better move might have been to Fienchetto my own bishop to g2 and take control of the long light squared diagonal that is unobstructed."
6,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/3P4/3BP3/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 4,Bg7 - Black is still way behind in development. I think this allowed me to build a false sense of security w/ all of my advancement.
7,e4,e3e4,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/3PP3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 4,e4 - At this point I realize that my stone wall will not work and attempt to adjust my strategy a bit. My aim was to kick the knight off of f6 and to further hem in the Bishop on g7. However I should have kept him home for a few more moves and developed my two knights first.
8,d6,d7d6,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,d6 - Black finally comes to the party... This prevents me from being able to kick the knight off of F6. Just the beginning of my pains.
9,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/6B1/3PP3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 1 5,"Bg5 - Not sure what I was thinking here. I'm losing momentum and don't even realize it. Throwing away moves that should be used to develop pieces such as my two knights. This ""threat"" does nothing to deter Black."
10,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bqk2r/pppnppbp/3p1np1/6B1/3PP3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 2 6,"Nd7 - Develops and protects in move. Black has easily gained in momentum and I am disjointed to say the least. No support, protection or clear attacking lanes. My starting idea of using the Stone Wall has quickly fallen into Ciaos. While Black is a little bottled up and I am more open, I feel that I should lose this game, based on this position alone."
11,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqk2r/pppnppbp/3p1np1/6B1/3PP3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 3 6,"Nf3- Hey, I wake up and decide to bring in some protection."
12,b6,b7b6,r1bqk2r/p1pnppbp/1p1p1np1/6B1/3PP3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"b6- Not sure What Black is doing here also. Neither of us has attacked yet, so maybe he is leaving himself some options to castle Queen side. I felt that him getting his King to safety or opening up the middle was the better option here as it would have allowed him to take advantage of my poor support and positioning."
13,e5,e4e5,r1bqk2r/p1pnppbp/1p1p1np1/4P1B1/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 0 7,"e5- In my mind, probably the worst move so far this game. Again, I have neglected to develop pieces. Should have Castled here or Nbd2. Both moves would have gave needed support to the middle and possibly hid my King. I could be wrong but I feel that this was the down turn in the game for me."
14,dxe5,d6e5,r1bqk2r/p1pnppbp/1p3np1/4p1B1/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"Be4 - Again... I see this as a poor decision. I attack Ra8, but neglect to defend e5, while exposing my queen. I'm starting to see patience as a issue in my game."
15,dxe5,d4e5,r1bqk2r/p1pnppbp/1p3np1/4P1B1/8/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 0 8,"Be4 - Again... I see this as a poor decision. I attack Ra8, but neglect to defend e5, while exposing my queen. I'm starting to see patience as a issue in my game."
16,Ng8,f6g8,r1bqk1nr/p1pnppbp/1p4p1/4P1B1/8/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 1 9,"Be4 - Again... I see this as a poor decision. I attack Ra8, but neglect to defend e5, while exposing my queen. I'm starting to see patience as a issue in my game."
17,Be4,d3e4,r1bqk1nr/p1pnppbp/1p4p1/4P1B1/4B3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 2 9,"Be4 - Again... I see this as a poor decision. I attack Ra8, but neglect to defend e5, while exposing my queen. I'm starting to see patience as a issue in my game."
18,Rb8,a8b8,1rbqk1nr/p1pnppbp/1p4p1/4P1B1/4B3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQk - 3 10,Rb8 - I won the ability to move the rook and prevent Queen side castling... Which is not even a remote possibility here. I'm giving away momentum in this game.
19,Nc3,b1c3,1rbqk1nr/p1pnppbp/1p4p1/4P1B1/4B3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQk - 4 10,"Nc3- I think I just missed the double attack on e5, winning Black a pawn and attacking my queen at the same time."
20,f6,f7f6,1rbqk1nr/p1pnp1bp/1p3pp1/4P1B1/4B3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQk - 0 11,"f6- Not sure, but White just couldn't pull the trigger on snatching the pawn. Maybe Black wanted to kick the Bishop off of the G5 Square."
21,exf6,e5f6,1rbqk1nr/p1pnp1bp/1p3Pp1/6B1/4B3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQk - 0 11,"Ngxf6- Black didn't want to trade bishops and didn't seem to want to open the D file. Possilby feared the Queen exchange and having to recapture w/ the King, which would totally prevent future Castling."
22,Ngxf6,g8f6,1rbqk2r/p1pnp1bp/1p3np1/6B1/4B3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQk - 0 12,"Ngxf6- Black didn't want to trade bishops and didn't seem to want to open the D file. Possilby feared the Queen exchange and having to recapture w/ the King, which would totally prevent future Castling."
23,Bc6,e4c6,1rbqk2r/p1pnp1bp/1pB2np1/6B1/8/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQk - 1 12,"Bc6- Again going in w/ guns blazing w/ no backup. My thought process was to keep black hemmed in a little longer. Again, I am giving away momentum as Castling here would have been the better move."
24,O-O,e8g8,1rbq1rk1/p1pnp1bp/1pB2np1/6B1/8/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 2 13,0-0 - Black totally negated my Knight Pin to his king. Black is tidy and well defended. However he is sorely behind in development.
