Not my usual but I am enjoying playing different openings"

Although white gets the c-pawn the a-pawn will be more dangerous than the c was. Then black should be able to get his king in behind the white K-Side pawns. (Only quick analysis) So I will come back later and do some more this may be mistaken. I managed to lose my notes on this position so I don't know what else I saw.

60,a5,a7a5,8/6k1/5ppp/p1p5/3nPP2/P5P1/5K1P/5B2 w - - 0 31,This stops the c-pawn from moving. However White's king is in a poor position so he needs to move the a-pawn to free the king. Also black maybe able to play a4 however I am not a fan because it places the pawn on a light square however this would free the c-pawn to be pushed. White will trade the bishop and have two pawns for his piece with one of them an outside passed pawn. Good thing with a4 is that it ties down the white king
