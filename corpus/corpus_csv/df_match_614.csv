GameKnot may have recommended this to you, but I am betting you could find this move on your own as well. Why? Because advancing the e-pawn gives you a firm grip on the center, takes away d5 from him, gives you easy development of your LSB (light-squared bishop), an additional diagonal of infiuence for your queen, and contests control of f5.
An impressive list, yes? But then, good moves will usually serve several purposes! And guess what - that *is* a very, very good way of finding the good moves in any position: select a move which serves multiple purposes."

Indeed, according to my database you should now have an approx. 82.5% chance of winning. Of course, that number includes your opponent playing less than optimally ... but it does indicate that your position is clearly favourable.
However, we really need neither engines nor databases to tell us that; simply look at the position:
White: more space, more developed pieces, easier development, more mobile pieces (your bishops control far more squares than his!), better center control."

Shouldn't he concentrate on getting his king castled instead? Well, yes. However, this move does have the advantage of contesting your space advantage on the queen-side, and you will be forced to spend a move responding to that. So it doesn't really cost him anything - directly. However, as the game continuation shows, he will be more or less forced to follow up with a5 to support that pawn, and *that* move will cost him time better spent elsewhere. For that reason, I believe b5 is a strategic mistake.
Gameknot agrees with that assessment, by the way, adding to your evaluated positional advantage."

The closer they get to the 8th rank, the more powerful they will be: once they get to the 6th rank they will severely restrict Black's freedom of action, and on the 7th rank they will prove a massive problem for him. But as they are right now, they are more a nuisance than an actual threat, and this allows Black the freedom to start actions against White's position. This should never have been allowed to happen. When you consider which move to make, it is a good rule of thumb always to make the one which poses the most problems for your opponent. In this case, the pawn advance: 30.e5 h4 31.f5 g3 32.Bxg3 hxg3 33.Rxg3"
