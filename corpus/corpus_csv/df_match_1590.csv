1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,With 1.e4 white gains some control over central square d5 and open lines of development for his queen and kings bishop.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,With 1...c5 black prevents white from playing 2.d4 and gains some control over the central square d4.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"White is ahead in development and can develop more freely. Black however, has a structural advantage in that he has an extra central pawn , white gains him a long-term advantage of taking control of the centre. A typical imbalance has arisen. From here white should use his development advantage in order to secure an early initiative. If White plays passively or his initiative runs out of steam,then typically its black,with the better pawn structure, who has the long-term chances. If black equalise he is already better. This structural advantage is seen in most Open Sicilian Lines for example the dragon, the najdorf and scheveningen variations. The major exception to this rule is the Sveshnikov variation in which black accepts pawn weaknesses for activity."

Other Moves are 6...e6(Scheveningen) and the 'spoiling idea' 6...Ng4"

Black obtains a free game after either 7...Bxf5 8.exf5 d5! 9.Bg5 d4 10.Bxf6 or 7...d5! 8.Bg5 d4 9.Bxf6. Another idea for white is 7.Nf3 which is more positional where white's main idea is to control d5. White main moves are Bc4,Bg5,Bxf6"

The positional motivation behind the idea is that white intends g4-g5, forcing the black knight to move away from its ideal posting at f6 and lessening black's control over d5-square. Note:Control of the d5-square is of utmost importance in the najdorf sicilian."

The stage is set for another uncompromising battle between the two sides. White will develop with Qd2 and 0-0-0 and if allowed, will push forward on the kingside with g4-g5. Black may forestall this advance with the defensive move ...h7-h6, or be ready to move his knight to either h5 or d7 (once the other knight has vacated this square.) If the f6-knight is forced to move elsewhere (g8, for example then this is usually a sign that things have gone wrong for black. Once again black's counterplay lies very much on the queenside. Often the fight is over the d5 square, black plays the pawn lunge ...b5-b4. This asks the question of the knight on c3, which will either jump into d5 or retreat elsewhere. Black will find it difficult to arrange the freeing advance ...d6-d5, but if white is carless enough to allow this then often this turns out to be favourable for black. In general, play is sharp and dynamic, often involving positional or tactical sacifice from both sides"
