1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"?! This opening (the Ponziani, for those who care) is dubious because White is trying to build a big center but neglecting to develop the necessary pieces to support it. Nf3 is far more common, and Nc3, f4, d4 and even c4 or g3 are better as well."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"?!

3,c3,c2c3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"?! This opening (the Ponziani, for those who care) is dubious because White is trying to build a big center but neglecting to develop the necessary pieces to support it.

4,b6,b7b6,rnbqkbnr/p1pp1ppp/1p6/4p3/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"?! Interesting. The queenside fianchetto (that is, playing …b6 followed by …Bb7) is fine in a vacuum, but it doesn't usually mix well with …e5. 
Also, White's last move was begging to be embarrassed with …Nf6, which is basically a ""free"" move. You have to be on the lookout for those kinds of tempo-gaining moves in the opening!"
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/p1pp1ppp/1p6/4p3/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"This move is fine, but what about d4? That was the point of 2. c3, no?"
6,Bb7,c8b7,rn1qkbnr/pbpp1ppp/1p6/4p3/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,"I like how you attack White's pawn instead of stopping to defend your own – both are good plans, but your move shows ambition and commitment to your own plans."
7,d3,d2d3,rn1qkbnr/pbpp1ppp/1p6/4p3/4P3/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"?! Are we sure the Queen wants to be here? Why not develop the minor pieces first, and then see where the best place for the Queen is? (…Nc6)"
8,Qf6,d8f6,rn2kbnr/pbpp1ppp/1p3q2/4p3/4P3/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"?! Are we sure the Queen wants to be here? Why not develop the minor pieces first, and then see where the best place for the Queen is? (…Nc6)"
9,Be2,f1e2,rn2kbnr/pbpp1ppp/1p3q2/4p3/4P3/2PP1N2/PP2BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 5,"White should consider g3 and Bg2, although that is a bit slow."
10,d6,d7d6,rn2kbnr/pbp2ppp/1p1p1q2/4p3/4P3/2PP1N2/PP2BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"? There is no need to move this pawn at all. Develop your pieces!!!! 
Also, this pawn may well want to move to d5 some time down the line. (In fact, it does do that, at move 13.) That makes …d6 a wasted move, unless you had some important need for it to go to d6 first (you don't). On top of that, now the DSB (dark-squared Bishop) is locked in."
11,Bg5,c1g5,rn2kbnr/pbp2ppp/1p1p1q2/4p1B1/4P3/2PP1N2/PP2BPPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 1 6,! Developing with a gain of time on your exposed Queen.
12,Qg6,f6g6,rn2kbnr/pbp2ppp/1p1p2q1/4p1B1/4P3/2PP1N2/PP2BPPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 2 7,"? The Knight belongs here. White wants to trap your Queen, which is wishful thinking."
13,Qd2,d1d2,rn2kbnr/pbp2ppp/1p1p2q1/4p1B1/4P3/2PP1N2/PP1QBPPP/RN2K2R b KQkq - 3 7,"? The Knight belongs here. White wants to trap your Queen, which is wishful thinking."
14,h6,h7h6,rn2kbnr/pbp2pp1/1p1p2qp/4p1B1/4P3/2PP1N2/PP1QBPPP/RN2K2R w KQkq - 0 8,! Good! Boot that Bishop!
15,Nh4,f3h4,rn2kbnr/pbp2pp1/1p1p2qp/4p1B1/4P2N/2PP4/PP1QBPPP/RN2K2R b KQkq - 1 8,"?? Oops. White made an understandable, but still awful, blunder here."
16,Qxg5,g6g5,rn2kbnr/pbp2pp1/1p1p3p/4p1q1/4P2N/2PP4/PP1QBPPP/RN2K2R w KQkq - 0 9,"! Good, you saw it!"
17,Qxg5,d2g5,rn2kbnr/pbp2pp1/1p1p3p/4p1Q1/4P2N/2PP4/PP2BPPP/RN2K2R b KQkq - 0 9,"Alright, at this point Black is up a piece. White really doesn't have any compensation. This should be enough to win, no problem – if I were writing for experts, and felt lazy, I'd write,  ""the rest is a matter of technique."" Of course, having a won game is not the same thing as winning it – let's see how you go about doing that."
18,hxg5,h6g5,rn2kbnr/pbp2pp1/1p1p4/4p1p1/4P2N/2PP4/PP2BPPP/RN2K2R w KQkq - 0 10,"Alright, at this point Black is up a piece. White really doesn't have any compensation.

20,Nc6,b8c6,r3kbnr/pbp2pp1/1pnp4/4pNp1/4P3/2PP4/PP2BPPP/RN2K2R w KQkq - 2 11,Good start. Black needs to develop pieces.
21,Nd2,b1d2,r3kbnr/pbp2pp1/1pnp4/4pNp1/4P3/2PP4/PP1NBPPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 3 11,!? I like how you kick this Knight out so that you can finish development. That's high-level planning.
22,g6,g7g6,r3kbnr/pbp2p2/1pnp2p1/4pNp1/4P3/2PP4/PP1NBPPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 12,!? I like how you kick this Knight out so that you can finish development. That's high-level planning.
23,Ng3,f5g3,r3kbnr/pbp2p2/1pnp2p1/4p1p1/4P3/2PP2N1/PP1NBPPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 1 12,"? What is the point of this? For the next few moves, White just marks time with aggressive-looking moves and wait for you to make a mistake."
24,Nf6,g8f6,r3kb1r/pbp2p2/1pnp1np1/4p1p1/4P3/2PP2N1/PP1NBPPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 2 13,"? What is the point of this? For the next few moves, White just marks time with aggressive-looking moves and wait for you to make a mistake."
25,a4,a2a4,r3kb1r/pbp2p2/1pnp1np1/4p1p1/P3P3/2PP2N1/1P1NBPPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 0 13,"? What is the point of this? For the next few moves, White just marks time with aggressive-looking moves and wait for you to make a mistake."
26,d5,d6d5,r3kb1r/pbp2p2/1pn2np1/3pp1p1/P3P3/2PP2N1/1P1NBPPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 14,"? On one hand, there is some very good thinking behind this move – you're seizing more influence in the center and releasing your DSB. You're also rightfully ignoring White's pointless pawn pushes and doing your own thing.
Before you open the center like this, though, you really, really need to develop your pieces. That includes getting your King out of the center first, too. …0-0-0 is a must."
27,b4,b2b4,r3kb1r/pbp2p2/1pn2np1/3pp1p1/PP2P3/2PP2N1/3NBPPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 0 14,"This has nothing to do with your play in the center, which is the central issue of the game right now. 0-0 or Rd1 are better."
28,d4,d5d4,r3kb1r/pbp2p2/1pn2np1/4p1p1/PP1pP3/2PP2N1/3NBPPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 15,"? Good, you're continuing to ignore the pawn pushes. This move is too impatient, though. 
It looks like you're trying to open b4 or c5 for your DSB, which is admirable. Still, it would have been better to castle and keep the tension in the center. (Tension is a pretty advanced skill, but development is development.)"
29,cxd4,c3d4,r3kb1r/pbp2p2/1pn2np1/4p1p1/PP1PP3/3P2N1/3NBPPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 0 15,b4! is much better.
