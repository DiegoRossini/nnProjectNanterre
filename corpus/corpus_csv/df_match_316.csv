4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"I've tried the obvious b6, in order to fiachetto the lsb. But white players are normally well aware of it and manage to have it blinded by my own d5, which has to be played in most lines."
5,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/3P4/3BP3/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 3,"I would never play this as white, but I know that h7 will be targeted sooner or later."

7,c3,c2c3,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/3P4/2PBP3/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 4,This is MY favourite asset with white pieces (but for the B)... and I use to win with it!
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/2p5/3P4/2PBP3/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 5,"Uh, oh! My opponent is playing seriously. My ""normal developement"" Nc6, carelessly played, probably costed me a strong attack on the kingside!"

11,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2pp4/3P1P2/2PBPN2/PP4PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"Fortunately, my opponent is more focused in castling than in attacking. I don't know if he's right, but I would have gone for attack."
12,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/2pp4/3P1P2/2PBPN2/PP4PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 7,"I don't like to move this B, since after dxc4 it has to move again. But I was a little scared. Now I think that cxd had to be played, and the N exchanged in order to counterattack him, instead of this ""normal developement"" move."
13,Nbd2,b1d2,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/2pp4/3P1P2/2PBPN2/PP1N2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 7,"Again, my opponent is more focused in developing than in exploit my weaknesses. This is a good move, of course, but it is not aiming at my ""mistakes""."
14,a6,a7a6,r1bqk2r/1p2bppp/p1n1pn2/2pp4/3P1P2/2PBPN2/PP1N2PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"I plan to pawnstorm on the Qside, if white doesn't attack soon. Again, cxd would have been better, but let's say that is not a bad thing to keep it for whenever I want. True is that now W playing 8. dxc, Bxc4, 9. b4 had won tempo, but hey: white's e3 is hanging! Of course, I won't, ever, castle here: it's asking for troubles! Bd7 instead supports the b5 advance in another way: I'll have to take out of the way Nc6, probably with Na7 or Na5... I'm at a loss, in a board completely different from the ones I normally play."

The white Q is too dangerous, for example on g4, to be allowed."

But, at the same time, I felt that this pressure won't go anywhere, because of white will get a scope for his dsb. So I preferred to keep white closed in, and play with with the semi-opened resulting g column. My best result will be to play the e pawn without allowing f5 in response. I need to be patient."
