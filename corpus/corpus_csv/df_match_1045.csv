1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"1.d4 opens lines for whites bishop on c1 and the pawn on d4 now keeps a eye on e5 advance, so a standard developing move. This move limits blacks strongest responses in the opening.
eg 1.e4-c5."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,2.Nf3 gives support to the d4 pawn and keeps a eye on the e5 advance square.Places an extra hold on the g5 square which is been monitored by the bishop on c1.It is a good developing move.

move played may be threatening a capture on b2 or a check on b4 or on a5 later to maybe create pawn structure weaknesses but this move is easily parried."

13,Qxd4,d1d4,rnb1kb1r/pp1p1ppp/1q2p3/1N1n4/3Q1B2/4PN2/PPP2PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 7,7.Qxd4 here regains the pawn and protects against blacks plan of taking the bishop on f4 leading to white doubling his pawns! so sort of makes black think of 7...Qxd4 swap offs to continue with the plan of taking the bishop on f4.
14,Qa5+,b6a5,rnb1kb1r/pp1p1ppp/4p3/qN1n4/3Q1B2/4PN2/PPP2PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 1 8,This is a bad mistake by black of 7..Qa5+ the check is of no real gain.And the plan of blacks next move of possibly playing 8...Nxf4 9.Qxf4 is to prevent the possible Knight on b5 landing on c7 to fork the king and rook safe in the knowledge that the black queen on a5 cannot capture because of the defence from the bishop on f4 so a good idea to get rid of this threat and loose the black d5 knight for the bishop on f4!.However the plan is flawed due to the queen taking the bishops place and reinforcing the threat.

If black could offer exchange of queens at some point then it may help his cause!

If a queen exchange was offered after 10..Nxf4 11.exf4-Qd5 12.Qxd5-exd5
then after some Knight moving i would gain the pawn on d5 and taking me a pawn up."

Black's king is now stuck in the center and will soon loose tempo with subsequent checks forming a king hunt for white."

If we take stock of blacks game so far, the bishops have not been developed the rooks are still in there starting positions and the Queen due to the early ascent into the game with 7...Qa5+ is left isolated on the Queen side far from her kings defence.Black has a slight weakness in his king side pawn structure which is begging to be exploited by white.And the king is stuck in the center with no chance of ever castling.

So the point to the start of the game! Never make to many pawn moves in the opening unless forced or you have a concrete understanding of the opening employed develop fast with a view of where the pawns and pieces will be best placed for an endgame ie no doubling of pawns avoid isolated pawns and avoid to many exchanges leading to to many pawn islands."
