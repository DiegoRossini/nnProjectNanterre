1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I aim for the opening I know best as White, the Stonewall.  White seeks a pawn formation:  c3, d4, e3, f4, the K N eyeing e5."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"Sometimes I play a Trompolski here (Bg5), but only against weaker opponents."
3,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"I play the passive looking e3, opening the diagonal for the Bishop and preparing f4."
4,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,This wasn't according to plan.  White hoped for e6 or d5.  But the Stonewall plan against cd is ed! opening the diagonal for the Bishop.
5,c3,c2c3,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/3P4/2P1P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"The usual order for White is Bd3, but given Black's surprise 2nd move, White gets in the critical Q side pawn formation, still planning to retake on d4 with the e pawn."
6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/3P4/2P1P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Black returns the initiative to White.  Perhaps better was Nc3.  White likes to see a pawn on the e6 square because it blocks the c8 Bishop, which often frustrates plans by developing to g4."
7,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/3P4/2PBP3/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 4,"White's setup is according to plan.  The order was changed, and Black looks a little awkward now with the c5 pawn.  White wants to continue f4, Nf3 and 0-0."
8,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/3P4/2PBP3/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,"Because of Black's move, White prevents Black from occupying e4 with a Knight."
9,Nd2,b1d2,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/3P4/2PBP3/PP1N1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 5,"Because of Black's move, White prevents Black from occupying e4 with a Knight."
10,c4,c5c4,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/3p4/2pP4/2PBP3/PP1N1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,Now this pawn thrust is a waste of time.  Black forces the Bishop to a square it wanted to go to.
11,Bc2,d3c2,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/3p4/2pP4/2P1P3/PPBN1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 6,"The Knight move prepares e5, which White immediately prevents while completing the Stonewall formation."
12,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/3p4/2pP4/2P1P3/PPBN1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 2 7,"The Knight move prepares e5, which White immediately prevents while completing the Stonewall formation."
13,f4,f2f4,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/3p4/2pP1P2/2P1P3/PPBN2PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 7,The Bishop is biting on granite.  White has an easy development.
14,Bd6,f8d6,r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2nbpn2/3p4/2pP1P2/2P1P3/PPBN2PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 1 8,The Bishop is biting on granite.  White has an easy development.
15,Ngf3,g1f3,r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2nbpn2/3p4/2pP1P2/2P1PN2/PPBN2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 8,This is undoubtedly a mistake as a waste of time.
16,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2nbpn2/3p4/2pP1P2/2P1PN2/PPBN2PP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 3 9,This is undoubtedly a mistake as a waste of time.
17,O-O,e1g1,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2nbpn2/3p4/2pP1P2/2P1PN2/PPBN2PP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 4 9,This is undoubtedly a mistake as a waste of time.
18,b5,b7b5,r1bq1rk1/p4ppp/2nbpn2/1p1p4/2pP1P2/2P1PN2/PPBN2PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 10,This is undoubtedly a mistake as a waste of time.
19,Ne5,f3e5,r1bq1rk1/p4ppp/2nbpn2/1p1pN3/2pP1P2/2P1P3/PPBN2PP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 10,Now Black can't play NxN because of the pawn fork.  And an exchange on e5 will open the f-file.
20,Bb7,c8b7,r2q1rk1/pb3ppp/2nbpn2/1p1pN3/2pP1P2/2P1P3/PPBN2PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 2 11,"White prepares the advance of the e pawn.  In some instances, White will defend e5 by playing the d2 N to f3.  In others, White plays a ""rook lift"" (Rf3-h3)."
21,Qe1,d1e1,r2q1rk1/pb3ppp/2nbpn2/1p1pN3/2pP1P2/2P1P3/PPBN2PP/R1B1QRK1 b - - 3 11,"White prepares the advance of the e pawn.  In some instances, White will defend e5 by playing the d2 N to f3.  In others, White plays a ""rook lift"" (Rf3-h3)."
22,Nd7,f6d7,r2q1rk1/pb1n1ppp/2nbp3/1p1pN3/2pP1P2/2P1P3/PPBN2PP/R1B1QRK1 w - - 4 12,"Black will often try f7-f5, a counter Stonewall.  Black's pieces are clustered on the Q-side whereas Whites target the poorly defended King.  Black's latest move removed a key defender from the K side."
23,e4,e3e4,r2q1rk1/pb1n1ppp/2nbp3/1p1pN3/2pPPP2/2P5/PPBN2PP/R1B1QRK1 b - - 0 12,"This opens the dark Bishop's diagonal, with the two Bishops raking the K side.  White doesn't give Black time to play f5."
24,Re8,f8e8,r2qr1k1/pb1n1ppp/2nbp3/1p1pN3/2pPPP2/2P5/PPBN2PP/R1B1QRK1 w - - 1 13,This move by Black I don't understand.
25,Ndf3,d2f3,r2qr1k1/pb1n1ppp/2nbp3/1p1pN3/2pPPP2/2P2N2/PPB3PP/R1B1QRK1 b - - 2 13,White defends e5 with a piece.
26,f6,f7f6,r2qr1k1/pb1n2pp/2nbpp2/1p1pN3/2pPPP2/2P2N2/PPB3PP/R1B1QRK1 w - - 0 14,"Black forces the ""bone in his throat"" to move.  (This phrase more properly applies to a N on the 6th rank.)"
27,Nxc6,e5c6,r2qr1k1/pb1n2pp/2Nbpp2/1p1p4/2pPPP2/2P2N2/PPB3PP/R1B1QRK1 b - - 0 14,Circumstances have forced a change in plans.  White plays to force open the f-file.
