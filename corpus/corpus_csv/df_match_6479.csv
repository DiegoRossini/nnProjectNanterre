1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game finally ends my drought between my father and I. Online games vs my father are rather poor but, I sit down at the board in real life and win game after game. I feel somewhat detached to my online games; thereby I end up not focusing on them enough and I lose.  Anyway enough with the commentary no one really cares all that much about and on to the details of this game. Starts off with the typical d4 push."
