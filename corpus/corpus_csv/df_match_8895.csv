1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"In the past I have had trouble against the kings gambit, so it was good to get this win. Although technically it was on time-out, the match was effectively over.
The game highlights the need to use moves effectively when material down, otherwise any positional or attacking advantage can be eroded"

9,O-O,e1g1,rnbqk1nr/pppp1pbp/8/6p1/2B1Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 3 5,Grabbing the centre powerfully
10,d6,d7d6,rnbqk1nr/ppp2pbp/3p4/6p1/2B1Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 6,Grabbing the centre powerfully
11,d4,d2d4,rnbqk1nr/ppp2pbp/3p4/6p1/2BPPp2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 6,Grabbing the centre powerfully
12,h6,h7h6,rnbqk1nr/ppp2pb1/3p3p/6p1/2BPPp2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,"Securing the flank, and unpinning the queen from protection of the g5 pawn. With whites control of the centre, I need to develop quickly, and hopefully castle queenside since the kingside is now weak"
13,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk1nr/ppp2pb1/3p3p/6p1/2BPPp2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 7,"Aiming his knight at the d5 square. Another strong move is c3, opening up lines for his queen."
14,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk1nr/ppp2pb1/2np3p/6p1/2BPPp2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 8,"Developing, and pressuring his d4 pawn."
15,Bb5,c4b5,r1bqk1nr/ppp2pb1/2np3p/1B4p1/3PPp2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 3 8,"Usually moving the same piece twice in the opening should be avoided, but guidelines should be followed in light of the position. Nothing else is any better, and this move does present a threat and reinforces whites pressure in the centre."
16,Bd7,c8d7,r2qk1nr/pppb1pb1/2np3p/1B4p1/3PPp2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 4 9,Developing another piece and moving closer to being able to castle if things get hairy
17,e5,e4e5,r2qk1nr/pppb1pb1/2np3p/1B2P1p1/3P1p2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 9,"The computer prefers d5 or Qd3, but neither are particularly exciting. And given that white is a pawn down, he needn't worry about material, and should look to open lines"
18,dxe5,d6e5,r2qk1nr/pppb1pb1/2n4p/1B2p1p1/3P1p2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 10,"Allowing the pawn to capture exd6 would open lines in front of my king, and the move d5 simply loses the pawn. So I reason this is my best chance of keeping whites major pieces away from my king"

20,Bxc6,d7c6,r2qk1nr/ppp2pb1/2b4p/4p1p1/3P1p2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 11,"A weak move, I suspect white forgot his original plan or made this move without considering the position (ie part of a combination worked out earlier and not rethought). I am forced to move the bishop, but the position remains closed which is to my advantage"

25,Qd3,d1d3,r2qk1nr/ppp2pb1/7p/3Pp1p1/5pb1/2NQ1N2/PPP3PP/R1B1R1K1 b kq - 4 13,"Removes the pin, once again threatening Nxe5"

Another option is moving the bishop to d2 and unleashing the other rook"
