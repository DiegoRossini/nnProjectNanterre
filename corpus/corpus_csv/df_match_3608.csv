1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The Sicilian, popular at all levels."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The Sicilian, popular at all levels."
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,Planning to play the Grand Prix attack (an early f4 against virtuallyh all systems Black can choose). The immediate 2.f4?! is not as effective since Black can immediately challenge the centre with 2...d5 and get an equal game.
4,a6,a7a6,rnbqkbnr/1p1ppppp/p7/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"!? A common move in many Sicilians. This is to stop knights or bishops from coming to b5 and to prepare a ...b5 pawn push for himself. I was not happy to see this move, since I always play the GPA with Bb5, but that's impossible now (the grand prix can be played with Bc4 as well, but I don't know those lines). Therefore, I had to change plans already."
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/1p1ppppp/p7/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"Therefore, I decided to switch to open Sicilians, which I played earlier in my chess career."
6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p3p3/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Black can still choose some different systems, for example the Kan or Scheveningen. This is a quite basic and flexible set-up for Black."
7,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p3p3/2p5/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"Black can still choose some different systems, for example the Kan or Scheveningen. This is a quite basic and flexible set-up for Black."

15,f4,f2f4,r1b1kb1r/1pqp1ppp/p1n1pn2/8/3NPP2/2NBB3/PPP3PP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 8,"?! And there we have the first of many mistakes made by me in this tournament. This simply loses a pawn. I wanted to prevent ...Ne5, but obviously I should have castled first before playing f4."
16,d6,d7d6,r1b1kb1r/1pq2ppp/p1nppn2/8/3NPP2/2NBB3/PPP3PP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 9,"?! Apparently my opponent didn't see it (he played really fast the whole game) or thought it was too dangerous. But if he had played 8...Nxd4 9.Bxd4 Qxf4 he would have been a pawn up. The open f-file and centralized bishop are not enough to compensate for a pawn in my opinion, especially because Black has no weaknesses \and is very solid. With this move, we get into a Scheveningen Sicilian."

23,Bxd4,e3d4,r1b2rk1/1pq1bppp/p2ppn2/8/3BPP2/2NB1Q2/PPP3PP/4RRK1 b - - 0 12,"? This must have been the point, Black wants to gain more center control with tempo. Unfortunately it fails tactically."

25,Be3,d4e3,r1b2rk1/1pq1bppp/p2p1n2/4p3/4PP2/2NBBQ2/PPP3PP/4RRK1 b - - 1 13,"?! However, I don't see it (I know, this was not my best game tactically). Strong was 13.fxe5 dxe5 14.Qg3! after which the bishop can't be taken due to the pin on the queen, while White has a strong attack on the e5 pawn which can hardly be defended (14...Bd6?? fails to 15.Rxf6! and the g-pawn is pinned so Black can't retake)."
