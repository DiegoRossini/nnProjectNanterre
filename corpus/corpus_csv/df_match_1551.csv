4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 3,I did not want to play e4 and lose the e file. I opted for something slightly different from my recent matches.

8,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/1bPP4/5N2/PP1NPPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,I did not plan on moving the Q out early however I saw an opening for something different. I played the Q in case my opponent blocked with either his b or c pawn. I would have an easy capture of his B.

13,Nxc6,e5c6,r2qk2r/pppb1ppp/2N1pn2/3p4/QbPP4/8/PP1NPPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 7,I retreated my Q from her exposed position. I did not want to move her back to her starting postion.

18,O-O,e8g8,r2q1rk1/ppp2ppp/2b1pn2/3p4/2PP4/8/PPQBPPPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 2 10,I wanted to open a lane for my LSB and did not want to break the K-side pawns. e4 would have been a very poor move due to the amount of pieces my opponent had aimed towards it.
