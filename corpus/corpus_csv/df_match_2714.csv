12,e5,e7e5,rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/3p1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2N1BP2/PP4PP/R2QKBNR w KQ - 0 7,Black strikes at the white centre.

My thinking is this - if I castle kingside he has a ready-made attack with f5-f4, g5-g4-g3 etc. If he tries to attack my king on the queenside, he is going to find it hard to open uip the a or the b file. There are two plans I can follow - either move my king to b1, and try and take over the c file, or to launch an attack on the kingisde. However afterwards I found that castling kingside is more common in this position. What do you think dear reader, which side would you castle on?"

26,Qa5,d8a5,r1b2rk1/3n1pbp/p2p2p1/qp1Pp2n/4P3/2NBBP2/PP1QN1PP/1K1R3R w - - 2 14,Threatening b4 now. I was surprised that this position is in the Gameknot opening database. There are two games. Both times white played a3 here. But I thought a3 would just help black open up lines on the queenside. I decided to give my knight the d1 square and played...
