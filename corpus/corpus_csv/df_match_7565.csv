1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,a Queen's pawn opening...
2,h5,h7h5,rnbqkbnr/ppppppp1/8/7p/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,?! huh? This is a strange opening choice for Black!
3,c3,c2c3,rnbqkbnr/ppppppp1/8/7p/3P4/2P5/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,I ignore it for now and go ahead with my own development
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1pp1/4p3/7p/3P4/2P5/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Opens up the diagonals for the queen and bishop, but Black seems to have no interest in contesting the centre."
5,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1pp1/4p3/7p/3P4/2P1P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,and I've finished with my pawn structure - the d-pawn backed up by the c and e pawns.
6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/4p3/3p3p/3P4/2P1P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Black now makes his own claim to the centre
7,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/4p3/3p3p/3P4/2PBP3/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 4,"I bring out my bishop, where it sits and waits for a chance to strike. I guess that's the idea for this opening - defence"
8,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/ppp3p1/4p3/3p1p1p/3P4/2PBP3/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,"?! I guess this would be to block my bishop, but still, it's another strange pawn move from Black"
9,Ne2,g1e2,rnbqkbnr/ppp3p1/4p3/3p1p1p/3P4/2PBP3/PP2NPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,"usually, I play Nf3 in this position, but I was worried about the prospect of 5...g5, which could end up having me lose tempo trying to retreat my knight"
10,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/ppp5/4p1p1/3p1p1p/3P4/2PBP3/PP2NPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"it's here that I begin to recognise this position - there are some chess players who do this kind of pawn line-up all over the board. I hate it when that's played against me - it leads to some very cramped play... but then again, here it could hold an advantage for Black as his dark-square bishop is a lot more mobile than my own (one of the drawbacks that discouraged me from this opening for awhile)"
11,O-O,e1g1,rnbqkbnr/ppp5/4p1p1/3p1p1p/3P4/2PBP3/PP2NPPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 6,"castling kingside, as I normally do, but maybe that should have waited - I just castled to the area of all Black's pawns."
12,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp5/4pnp1/3p1p1p/3P4/2PBP3/PP2NPPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 7,"Black finally develops a piece, but right now it doesn't hold much of a threat against me"
13,Nd2,b1d2,rnbqkb1r/ppp5/4pnp1/3p1p1p/3P4/2PBP3/PP1NNPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 3 7,"Like I've already mentioned, the trouble with this is the lack of mobility of my dark-square bishop - but hopefully White's solid defence should compensate for that"
14,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/ppp5/2n1pnp1/3p1p1p/3P4/2PBP3/PP1NNPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 4 8,"Black brings out his other knight, which prompts me to play..."
15,b4,b2b4,r1bqkb1r/ppp5/2n1pnp1/3p1p1p/1P1P4/2PBP3/P2NNPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,"threatening to drive away his knight, and starting a queen-side attack with my pawns (you know, I'm really starting to like my pawns :) )"
16,a6,a7a6,r1bqkb1r/1pp5/p1n1pnp1/3p1p1p/1P1P4/2PBP3/P2NNPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 9,White prevents my b-pawn from reaching the b5 square...
17,a4,a2a4,r1bqkb1r/1pp5/p1n1pnp1/3p1p1p/PP1P4/2PBP3/3NNPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 9,so I put more pressure on it. This game is starting to open up a little
18,a5,a6a5,r1bqkb1r/1pp5/2n1pnp1/p2p1p1p/PP1P4/2PBP3/3NNPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 10,? a mistake - White can now do what it intended to do in the first place...
19,b5,b4b5,r1bqkb1r/1pp5/2n1pnp1/pP1p1p1p/P2P4/2PBP3/3NNPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 10,drive away the knight!
20,Na7,c6a7,r1bqkb1r/npp5/4pnp1/pP1p1p1p/P2P4/2PBP3/3NNPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 1 11,"? another mistake here - it leave White with a possible future opportunity to attack the knight, as well as leaving the knight with no escape options (the other alternative was Ne7 - definitely the better choice)"
