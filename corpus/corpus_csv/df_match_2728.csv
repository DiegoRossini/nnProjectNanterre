2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"This has been my go-to response, although lately I've reverted somewhat to 1. ...e5.  I feel the Sicilian has more complex lines and variations, and my lack of serious study can hurt me when playing it."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"If anyone has a strong argument for another move here, I would love to hear it.  I have always played 2. ...cxd4 here and had great success with it."

5,Qxd4,d1d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"This is weaker, in my opinion, than c3, which gives white more offensive lines for the pawn, and avoids the loss of time."
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"This is not the most common move here, but I think it's stronger than 5. ...e6 or d6.  This is an aggressive reach for an even share of the center, and the eventual ...d5 should deal with the backward queen's pawn."
7,Qd1,d4d1,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 2 4,"This is not the most common move here, but I think it's stronger than 5. ...e6 or d6.  This is an aggressive reach for an even share of the center, and the eventual ...d5 should deal with the backward queen's pawn."

Also, I figured I had at least an even game after 9. Bd2, and a winning game after 9. O-O, so why not."

The bishop's only safe square is 12. Bb4, which loses to 12. ...exf3 and if 13. Qxf3 Qxb4.  Therefore 13. gxf3 would be forced and white's king is dangerously open."
