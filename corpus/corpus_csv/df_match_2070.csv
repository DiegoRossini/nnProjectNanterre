2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"A waiting ànd developing move ! He prevents me from playing 2. e4, thus I can't occupy the whole center. Nevertheless, this wasn't my intention, as said before.."
3,Bf4,c1f4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P1B2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 2 2,"Going on with my development, some sort of ""London System""."

Interesting !!"
