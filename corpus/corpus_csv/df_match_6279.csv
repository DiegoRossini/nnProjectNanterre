1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hey guys, this is a blitz game between kholkhole and I, which I chose because I really like the ending. We'll get to that."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"(!) I like when Black plays 1. ... e5, because then I get to play this move. King's Gambit is like the Queen's Gambit, usually it's not really a gambit because you get it back. I get the pawn back in this game, plus a ton of mobility. I'd recommend this opening to anyone who doesn't know how to play the Ruy Lopez well. I think I'm in that category for now. On we go."

4,exf4,e5f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"I think the best way to counter this is to either accept, as such, or 2. ... d5, leading to 3. exd5 c6 4. Nc3 exf4 5. Nf3 Bd6 6. d4 Ne7 and Black has a veritable position."
5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 3,"(!?) This is my favourite version of the King's Gambit Accepted. I esp. like when Black plays 3. ... Qh4+, then I get to play 4. Kf1 d6 5. d4 Be6 6. Qd3 Nd7 and White looks in a very good position. However the danger lies in 4. ... d5! 5. Bxd5 Bd6 6. Nf3 Qh5 7. d4 Ne7 8. Bb3 and White might find it hard."
6,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/2B1Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 4,Black plays this safe move. Unfortunately it gives me a big advantage after...
7,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/2BPPp2/8/PPP3PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 4,(!) And I have the centre. This centre is hard to challenge.
8,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2pp4/8/2BPPp2/8/PPP3PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,I think holding onto the pawn here with 4. ... g5 is better.
9,Bxf4,c1f4,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2pp4/8/2BPPB2/8/PPP3PP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,"(!?) This move set me back a little. I'm not sure why, but I didn't want to develop my queen onto e2 at this stage. And if 7. Nc3 b4, threatening the knight, that is protecting e4."
10,b5,b7b5,rnbqkbnr/p4ppp/2pp4/1p6/2BPPB2/8/PPP3PP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,"(!?) This move set me back a little. I'm not sure why, but I didn't want to develop my queen onto e2 at this stage. And if 7. Nc3 b4, threatening the knight, that is protecting e4."
11,Bb3,c4b3,rnbqkbnr/p4ppp/2pp4/1p6/3PPB2/1B6/PPP3PP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 1 6,"(!?) This move set me back a little. I'm not sure why, but I didn't want to develop my queen onto e2 at this stage. And if 7. Nc3 b4, threatening the knight, that is protecting e4."
12,Qe7,d8e7,rnb1kbnr/p3qppp/2pp4/1p6/3PPB2/1B6/PPP3PP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 2 7,"(!?) This move set me back a little. I'm not sure why, but I didn't want to develop my queen onto e2 at this stage. And if 7. Nc3 b4, threatening the knight, that is protecting e4."
13,Nd2,b1d2,rnb1kbnr/p3qppp/2pp4/1p6/3PPB2/1B6/PPPN2PP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 3 7,(?!) Closing off my opportunities for the b3-f7 diagonal. Maybe 8. Qf3 was better.
