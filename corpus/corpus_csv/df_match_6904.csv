1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game is a perfect example of how misjudging a position can make you lose a won game. The term ""won game"" in and by itself is something one needs to be careful with. If you think of a match as having won it already, you're prone to make errors which can be costly. In the case of this match it was an innocent looking move, and one I didn't put much thought into because I had ""won"" already, that led to my demise."
