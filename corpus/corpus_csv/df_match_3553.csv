1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"My opponent is a young girl of about 11, she is part of a group of juniors that gets thorough coaching and in my expierence are known for being taught to play rather attacking chess, though this games shows that this doesn't come at the expense of positional knowledge, blacks play this game impressed me for such a young player. The game was for an interclub teams game of which we were the bottom board, this game will be very useful for learning chess players who have not come across these positional concepts before, also it would be useful to have a strong player look over this game for my sake as well, I'm not sure if my interpretation of the endgame is correct."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,I have quite often seen this flexible knight move sometimes it's played with the intention of transposing into an Indian defense system so I chose my next move to be equally as flexible.
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 2,I didn't want to go into a nimzo Indian here so I played another non committal move.

6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2P5/2N2N2/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Now that I have avoided getting into what she likely wanted to play we now have what appears to be a queens gambit declined, this should be good for me since it is not an attacking game and is very positional one which should be slightly better for me. Whites play now should be based around an eventual minority attack on the queenside."

8,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"However with this final transposition we now have a tarrasch defense! This makes sense from blacks perspective since this particular game gives black more attacking options than the queens gambit declined, usually black accepts the classic isolated d pawn in order to get free and easy piece development and potential for better piece activity, from whites point of view we need to show that the pawn is a weakness and that the free piece development is an illusion and the weakness of the pawn is of more consequence."
9,dxc5,d4c5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2Pp4/2P5/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"Of course I would have liked to develop my DSB outside the pawn chain before getting this move in however I don't think I had enough time for it, any other move would allow black to push the pawn immediately, is pushing the pawn a correct idea here? I wasn't sure at all weather or not it worked out and rather than enter such unclear territory I played this logical move. It is important to realize that when it comes to weak pawns it is not always the pawn itself that is weak But the weak square in front of the pawn that is often of more consequence. So it is vital that we as white strive to control the d4 square and this phase of the game will revolve around both sides attempting to seize control of the critical square. If white can immobilize the pawn then trade of the minor pieces (since the pawns pluses involve active piece play) then white will have a great position especially if the ideal set up of a queen + rook ending can be achieved."

14,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/5n2/2bp4/8/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 1 8,"!? Ordinarily one would want to avoid moving a piece more than once in the opening however there are some more subtle factors in play here, both sides are trying there hardest to achieve control over d4 and the battle continues to rage. In any case black was threatning to push her pawn toward and thus liquidating her only weakness in which we are left in an even position where black has a slight lead in development. So perhaps this is forced if white wishes to maintain the first move advantage."

18,Bg4,c8g4,r2q1rk1/pp3ppp/2n2n2/1Nbp4/6b1/4PN2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 5 10,"!? This is a move I was worried about during the game but looking at it in hindsight maybe it was not as scary as I first thought. In any case the idea is quite advanced black may be intending to exchange bishop for knight in order to obtain more control over d4 however in order to do so black must first give up the bishop pair. Perhaps this move is good perhaps it is an in accuracy, it is up to the players to show that their idea is more important than the opponents so both sides need to work hard in order to implement their ideas quickly."

Actually come think of it black gains equality now by chopping the bishop on g4 where mas exchanges simply leave an even position. ...Nxg4 Qxd4 Re4 followed by d4 and maybe even an extremely slight edge for black due to better development and piece activity."

I shop is no longer influencing the d4 square, instead it makes this simple one move mate threat against my king.

Of course I had to make sure that there were no tactics here since I've just placed my queen on an undefendind square."
