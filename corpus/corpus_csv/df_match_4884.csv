1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Until some three months ago I played the Slav against 1.d4, but I felt uncomfortable in the resulting middlegame positions so I decided to switch to 1...Nf6."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"Until some three months ago I played the Slav against 1.d4, but I felt uncomfortable in the resulting middlegame positions so I decided to switch to 1...Nf6."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 2,"The Budapest Gambit is now my main weapon against 1.d4, because it results in open positions, in which I feel more comfortable than in closed ones. But to get into the Budapest my opponent has to play 2.c4. Now I have to come up with something else."
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,I decide to play a Grunfeld defence... If my opponent allows this.
5,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/6B1/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,!? Interesting move. White doesn't decide to play c4 and instead develops another piece. It's hard to reach a Grunfeld position now.
6,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/6B1/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,"This had to be played anytime, because otherwise 2...g6 wouldn't make sense."
7,e3,e2e3,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/6B1/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,Still no c4. Note that after 4.c4 I wouldn't be able to play 4...d5 to try to reach a Grunfeld because 5.Bxf6 Bxf6 6.cxd5 would win a pawn. I would probably have played 4...O-O and only play ...d5 after Nc3.
8,c5,c7c5,rnbqk2r/pp1pppbp/5np1/2p3B1/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Now that my opponent refuses to play c4, I decide to move up my own c pawn. I'm suspecting my opponent won't play c4 at all and will instead go for a system with c3."
9,Nbd2,b1d2,rnbqk2r/pp1pppbp/5np1/2p3B1/3P4/4PN2/PPPN1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,Trying to open up the position a bit.
10,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqk2r/pp1pppbp/5np1/6B1/3p4/4PN2/PPPN1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,Trying to open up the position a bit.
11,exd4,e3d4,rnbqk2r/pp1pppbp/5np1/6B1/3P4/5N2/PPPN1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,This is the normal position for the bishop in this set-up.
12,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp1pppbp/5np1/6B1/3P4/5N2/PPPN1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 1 7,This is the normal position for the bishop in this set-up.
13,Bd3,f1d3,rnbq1rk1/pp1pppbp/5np1/6B1/3P4/3B1N2/PPPN1PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 2 7,This is the normal position for the bishop in this set-up.
14,Nc6,b8c6,r1bq1rk1/pp1pppbp/2n2np1/6B1/3P4/3B1N2/PPPN1PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 3 8,As expected.
15,c3,c2c3,r1bq1rk1/pp1pppbp/2n2np1/6B1/3P4/2PB1N2/PP1N1PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 8,As expected.
16,d5,d7d5,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2n2np1/3p2B1/3P4/2PB1N2/PP1N1PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 9,"I'm trying to get some play in the centre of the board as soon as possible, to try and punish White for his somewhat passive opening play. This will be hard though, because this system is very solid and White has no weaknesses."
17,Qc2,d1c2,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2n2np1/3p2B1/3P4/2PB1N2/PPQN1PPP/R3K2R b KQ - 1 9,"!? Interestingly, this has never been played before. All games we were following continued 9.O-O. The queen and the bishop are lined up on the same diagonal, but they're biting on granite now because there's only the well-defended g6 pawn to attack."
18,Re8,f8e8,r1bqr1k1/pp2ppbp/2n2np1/3p2B1/3P4/2PB1N2/PPQN1PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 2 10,"Meanwhile I'm preparing my third thrust in the centre, ...e5."
19,O-O-O,e1c1,r1bqr1k1/pp2ppbp/2n2np1/3p2B1/3P4/2PB1N2/PPQN1PPP/2KR3R b - - 3 10,"?! This is dubious in my opinion. the pawns on the other flank seem to form a better shield for the king. But there are four pieces around to help defending the king, so it can't be that dangerous, can it?"
20,e5,e7e5,r1bqr1k1/pp3pbp/2n2np1/3pp1B1/3P4/2PB1N2/PPQN1PPP/2KR3R w - - 0 11,"?! I'm a minor piece behind in development, but my center control is greater and my rooks both have a nice file to control (once the c8 bishop has moved, the a8 rook can go to c8). So I thought this break was reasonable, but the computers don't really like it as after 11.dxe5 Nxe5 12.Nxe5 Rxe5, White can chase my rook with 13.Nf3 Re8 and I'm also left with an isolated d pawn. Probably White has a small plus there."
21,dxe5,d4e5,r1bqr1k1/pp3pbp/2n2np1/3pP1B1/8/2PB1N2/PPQN1PPP/2KR3R b - - 0 11,? This can't be good. White is voluntarily giving up the bishop pair in an open position? A strange decision.
22,Nxe5,c6e5,r1bqr1k1/pp3pbp/5np1/3pn1B1/8/2PB1N2/PPQN1PPP/2KR3R w - - 0 12,? This can't be good. White is voluntarily giving up the bishop pair in an open position? A strange decision.
23,Rhe1,h1e1,r1bqr1k1/pp3pbp/5np1/3pn1B1/8/2PB1N2/PPQN1PPP/2KRR3 b - - 1 12,? This can't be good. White is voluntarily giving up the bishop pair in an open position? A strange decision.
24,Nxd3+,e5d3,r1bqr1k1/pp3pbp/5np1/3p2B1/8/2Pn1N2/PPQN1PPP/2KRR3 w - - 0 13,Developing with tempo. White's king is starting to feel a bit uncomfortable. The computers don't like this move and suggest 13...Qa5 instead.. I'm not sure why.
25,Qxd3,c2d3,r1bqr1k1/pp3pbp/5np1/3p2B1/8/2PQ1N2/PP1N1PPP/2KRR3 b - - 0 13,Developing with tempo. White's king is starting to feel a bit uncomfortable. The computers don't like this move and suggest 13...Qa5 instead.. I'm not sure why.
26,Bf5,c8f5,r2qr1k1/pp3pbp/5np1/3p1bB1/8/2PQ1N2/PP1N1PPP/2KRR3 w - - 1 14,Developing with tempo. White's king is starting to feel a bit uncomfortable. The computers don't like this move and suggest 13...Qa5 instead.. I'm not sure why.
27,Qb5,d3b5,r2qr1k1/pp3pbp/5np1/1Q1p1bB1/8/2P2N2/PP1N1PPP/2KRR3 b - - 2 14,"?! I was feeling a bit uncomfortable about the possibility of checks on the back row, that could slow down my attack.. probably that's why I exchanged.  Another reason was that I didn't want to lose a tempo if I'd play 14...Rc8 and my opponent exchanged twice on e8 with 15.Rxe8+ Qxe8 16.Qxe8 Rxe8 (this would make 14...Rc8 a loss of tempo). It seems illogical though, because I'm the attacking side and would want to keep as many pieces on the board as possible."
28,Rxe1,e8e1,r2q2k1/pp3pbp/5np1/1Q1p1bB1/8/2P2N2/PP1N1PPP/2KRr3 w - - 0 15,"?!

29,Rxe1,d1e1,r2q2k1/pp3pbp/5np1/1Q1p1bB1/8/2P2N2/PP1N1PPP/2K1R3 b - - 0 15,"This is a pawn sac, but in fact I'm already planning to sac more than just the isolated d pawn.."
30,Qc7,d8c7,r5k1/ppq2pbp/5np1/1Q1p1bB1/8/2P2N2/PP1N1PPP/2K1R3 w - - 1 16,"This is a pawn sac, but in fact I'm already planning to sac more than just the isolated d pawn.."
31,Bxf6,g5f6,r5k1/ppq2pbp/5Bp1/1Q1p1b2/8/2P2N2/PP1N1PPP/2K1R3 b - - 0 16,"?! This is not the losing mistake, but a step in the wrong direction. It's obvious my opponent is planning to grab the d5 pawn (otherwise he'd never exchange this bishop for my knight), but that would be a blunder as we'll see later."
