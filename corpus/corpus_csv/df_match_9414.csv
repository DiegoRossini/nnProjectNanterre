4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 3,"Black blunts the bishop's diagonal and prepares for an eventual d5.  One of the ideas of d5 is the black center expands with a gain of time, but it seems to me that the quality of this is questionable because white would like to reposition the bishop anyway."
5,a3,a2a3,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/2B1P3/P7/1PPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 3,"This could also prepare for an attempt to play b4?  If this is white attempting to prepare an escape for the bishop, I don't think much of the move: 3... d5 4.exd5 exd5 5. Ba2?  After all, 5.Bb5  can easily be met by 5... Bd7  Nor do I think much of an early Bc4 for that matter either because white has zero control over whether c4 will prove to be an effective spot for the bishop.  How much of an advantage is ""better developed"" if it's developed to the wrong square?"

If this were an English opening, this move by black would be ""Kere's move.""  It can be particularly effective there, and there's a good chance it has some teeth here too."
10,a6,a7a6,rnbqk1nr/1p1p1pbp/p3p1p1/2p5/2B1P3/P1P2N2/1P1P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"Black prepares Nc3 as to avoid Bb5.  Bb5 allows an exchange that worsens the black pawn structure.  One odd characteristic of Sicilian defenses (according to Alburt and Dzindzichasvili in Chess Openings for Black Explained) is that should the game progress to the endgame, the endgame will tend to favor black.  Therefore preserving the black pawn structure is probably worth the extra effort."

I believe that cxd4 (I'm a little unsure as to when the defense is a pure or semi-Tarrasch defense) leads to black being able to force white into an Isolated Queen Pawn situation (7... d5), but neither alternative is clearly superior.  Top players attempt to use the IQP as a weapon as much as a liability.  The drawback here is until black plays Ne7, d5 will force both sides to accept the IQP.  White simply had the option of restoring his central pawns and declined."

One factor favoring a white king-side attack is the bishop on e3. One factor discouraging it is White's center not being firm. I've played a few games where f4 as white (f5 as black) was played against me and I survived because it wasn't prepared properly. I've also played games where I played f4 or f5. To me (for some reason I don't fully comprehend) f4 seems a little more natural than f5, but f5 actually is a fair response to f4."

White chooses the exchange, and black decides to attempt to deny white the bishop pair.  If black were to take back with the e pawn, he transposes into a pure Tarrasch defense by accepting the isolated queen pawn.  Now for white to continue, there are a few interesting ideas offered by myself and others.  In the comments, dmaestro suggests the complex  [A]12. Nxc6 leading to either [A1]12...
