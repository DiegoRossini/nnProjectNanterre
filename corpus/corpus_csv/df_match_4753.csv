6,Ne7,g8e7,rnbqk2r/ppppnppp/8/2b1Q3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"Black makes another error - possibly worried about 4. Qxg7, Black develops the Knight but leaves the Bishop all alone."
7,Qxc5,e5c5,rnbqk2r/ppppnppp/8/2Q5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"Black attacks the White Queen and provides an avenue for his Bishop to develop into. I'd have preferred 4. d6 to prevent Qe5, but I don't mind this."
8,b6,b7b6,rnbqk2r/p1ppnppp/1p6/2Q5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"Black attacks the White Queen and provides an avenue for his Bishop to develop into. I'd have preferred 4. d6 to prevent Qe5, but I don't mind this."

12,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/p1ppn1pp/1p3p2/8/4P3/6Q1/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQ - 2 7,"Black chooses to castle here - given this choose of move, I think Black might have been better castling last move."
13,d4,d2d4,rnbq1rk1/p1ppn1pp/1p3p2/8/3PP3/6Q1/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQ - 0 7,"As it stands at this position, White has a very strong advantage - both materially and spatially."

Ng6 would have prevented the mating threat and forced the bishop to move away... However, Black would have won his piece back with Nf5, using the Rook on e8 to pin the pawn to e4."

Kh8 12. gxf6 would lose for Black. 12... Ng6 13. Bg7# or 12... Rg8 13. Qg7+ Rxg7 14. Bxg7# or 12... Nf5 (either knight) 13. Qg7+ Nxg7 14. Bxg7#."
