5,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pP4/5P2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"Normally, I dislike throwing my queen out early. I've been learning to play by playing blitz chess every week for the last three months. My education has been hard, but I quickly learnt that exposing my queen early on was a good way to lose quickly. However, in this instance, although I was nervous it seemed the best possible move. The e-file is open in front of white's king, which, if a quick defense isn't sorted (perhaps d3?), will allow me to pick off the weakened f-pawn."
