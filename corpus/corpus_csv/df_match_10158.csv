Move order *can* be used by Black to limit/allow various methods of advance by White, but this is generally a very subtle finesse. For instance, Black can castle instead of playing ...d6, inviting White to advance the pawn to e5 hitting the N which then drops back to e8. White will then attack to use his center as an aggressive weapon (the Classical idea), and Black will defend to demonstrate how White's center is actually overextended and weak (the Hypermodern idea). Neither side is ""right"" it's just a matter of taste (especially at a level below GM)."
