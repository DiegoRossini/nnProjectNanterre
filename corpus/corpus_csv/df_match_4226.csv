1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"My opponent (a much lower-graded player, whom I hoped to beat easily considering the ECF grades given above) opens with the queen pawn. Grabbing a stake in the centre, and opening up lines to develop the dark-squared bishop and later queen. Standard and theoretical stuff."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"A very common reply. Black also grabs his share of the centre, and makes it less attractive for White to play an immediate e2-e4 (which he would like to attempt at some point, to take more control of the centre)."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"One of the most common openings in existence: the Queen's Gambit. White apparently sacrifices a pawn (in reality, most experts do not consider this a pawn sacrifice, because the pawn can easily be regained and theory offers no tried-and-tested way for Black to keep hold of the extra pawn). White's purpose in playing this move is to challenge Black's stake in the centre and build pressure against the d5-pawn."
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"The reply which I always play against the Queen's Gambit - known simply as the Queen's Gambit Declined. A simple (yet highly theoretical) move, aimed at keeping a pawn in the centre (e.g. after the unusual but playable 3.cxd5 exd5). The obvious drawback being that Black's light-squared bishop is blocked in."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"The usual move in the Queen's Gambit Declined: White develops a piece, and increases the pressure against Black's pawn on d5. I have played this position many times, from both sides of the board. An interesting alternative is 3.Nf3."
6,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2pp4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"This opening for Black is called the Tarrasch. Black opts to occupy the centre with an unstable pawn structure, in exchange for long-term fast development and good spatial control. Note that it is not possible for White to win a pawn immediately, although it may initially appear so: in fact, 4.cxd5 exd5 5.dxc5? is a well-known equalising line for Black after 5...d4! 6.Ne4 Bxc5! 7.Nxc5 Qa5+ with the fork regaining the minor piece."
7,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2pp4/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"? Clearly, my opponent did not know how to meet the Tarrasch - this move is an opening error! This move simply loses a pawn for White, as the following moves demonstrate:"
8,dxe4,d5e4,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2p5/2PPp3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"? I think that this was a mistake on my part - and the computer (Fritz 10) corroborates this judgement. I played this move in the hope that White would allow a queen exchange, which would help to consolidate Black's material advantage. However, 5...cxd4 is better, since it affords Black a space advantage and a firm grip on the centre as well as his material advantage. Black could then have followed up with ...Nc6 and ...e5, with a powerful grip on the central dark squares."
9,Nxe4,c3e4,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2p5/2PPN3/8/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"? I think that this was a mistake on my part - and the computer (Fritz 10) corroborates this judgement. I played this move in the hope that White would allow a queen exchange, which would help to consolidate Black's material advantage. However, 5...cxd4 is better, since it affords Black a space advantage and a firm grip on the centre as well as his material advantage. Black could then have followed up with ...Nc6 and ...e5, with a powerful grip on the central dark squares."
10,Qxd4,d8d4,rnb1kbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2p5/2PqN3/8/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"? I think that this was a mistake on my part - and the computer (Fritz 10) corroborates this judgement. I played this move in the hope that White would allow a queen exchange, which would help to consolidate Black's material advantage. However, 5...cxd4 is better, since it affords Black a space advantage and a firm grip on the centre as well as his material advantage.

11,Qc2,d1c2,rnb1kbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2p5/2PqN3/8/PPQ2PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 1 6,"! Avoiding a queen exchange, and placing the queen on a (slightly) more useful square."
12,Nf6,g8f6,rnb1kb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2p5/2PqN3/8/PPQ2PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 2 7,"Developing a piece, and aimed at exchanging off White's strong central knight, thus robbing White of a useful piece. Piece exchanges, I decided, would be useful in consolidating my small but significant material advantage. In fact, this formed my strategy for the next few moves - so much so that I unfortunately sank into positional apathy and handed over the initiative to my opponent."
13,Bd3,f1d3,rnb1kb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2p5/2PqN3/3B4/PPQ2PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 3 7,"Developing a piece, and preparing to replace the central knight with a well-placed central bishop, if the former is exchanged off."
14,Nxe4,f6e4,rnb1kb1r/pp3ppp/4p3/2p5/2Pqn3/3B4/PPQ2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 0 8,"Carrying out my strategy of exchanging pieces, whenever possible."
15,Bxe4,d3e4,rnb1kb1r/pp3ppp/4p3/2p5/2PqB3/8/PPQ2PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 0 8,"Despite being a pawn down, White now has an excellent position - his light-squared bishop holds Black's queenside in a bind, as well as putting pressure on Black's kingside. I therefore decided to force this bishop to move away as follows:"
16,f5,f7f5,rnb1kb1r/pp4pp/4p3/2p2p2/2PqB3/8/PPQ2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 0 9,"?! An odd-looking move, leaving Black's e-pawn backward and weak. However, I was determined to dislodge White's light-squared bishop from its excellent post in the centre!"
17,Bf3,e4f3,rnb1kb1r/pp4pp/4p3/2p2p2/2Pq4/5B2/PPQ2PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 1 9,"The most useful square for White to place his bishop, retaining the unpleasant bind on Black's queenside. Black cannot play ...Bd7, because the b-pawn and then rook are hanging; Black also cannot play ...b6, because the pawn is pinned to the rook."
18,Bd6,f8d6,rnb1k2r/pp4pp/3bp3/2p2p2/2Pq4/5B2/PPQ2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 2 10,"Developing a piece to a good square, and preparing to castle."
19,Ne2,g1e2,rnb1k2r/pp4pp/3bp3/2p2p2/2Pq4/5B2/PPQ1NPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 3 10,"Developing a piece, and forcing Black's queen to give up the useful post in the centre."
20,Qf6,d4f6,rnb1k2r/pp4pp/3bpq2/2p2p2/2P5/5B2/PPQ1NPPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 4 11,"By now, Fritz 10 rates the position as approximately equal. If we take into consideration the fact that White is a pawn down, this means that the computer believes that White has enough compensation for the pawn. I agree with the computer - White's pieces are mostly developed to excellent, logical squares (whereas Black's queenside is in a bind and undeveloped, and Black's central pawns are weak)."
21,O-O,e1g1,rnb1k2r/pp4pp/3bpq2/2p2p2/2P5/5B2/PPQ1NPPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 5 11,"By now, Fritz 10 rates the position as approximately equal.

22,Nd7,b8d7,r1b1k2r/pp1n2pp/3bpq2/2p2p2/2P5/5B2/PPQ1NPPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 6 12,"Struggling to catch up with White in the development race. I was unwilling to play 11...Nc6 because of 12.Bxc6 bxc6, giving Black horrible doubled and isolated c-pawns to worry about."
23,Rd1,f1d1,r1b1k2r/pp1n2pp/3bpq2/2p2p2/2P5/5B2/PPQ1NPPP/R1BR2K1 b kq - 7 12,"Developing the rook to an excellent square, from where it controls the open d-file. White also gains a tempo in playing this move, since Black must do something about his undefended bishop on d6."
