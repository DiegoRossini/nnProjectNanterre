As such it is a certainty that black intends to challenge d5 with a qb fianchetto.  i will look for opportunities to pin hi kb (c1-g5), prevent black qb fianchetto by opening the h1-a8 diagonal by repositioning my king's knight (f3-e1-c2..e3), and increase control of d5"

d5 deserves consideration.  however, i don't think there is a rush, i'd like to take some advantage of my lead in development by developing further, strongly, and i would like to give black another move or so, so as to get a sense of how he is planning to develop before opening up and possibly giving black counterchances."

I'd like to keep my bishop on the board, but leaving black with his neutralizes that somewhat, and leaves black with a still dangerous piece. there is also the weakness at d4.  i'd like to have the bishops off the board and a knight on c6, protecting d4, attacking a7, attacking the rook, and threatening nd7.  the knight maintains an escape square at e6, giving it further options.  should white black avoid the trade, his only option is 15 ...ba6, which after 16 re1 only strengthens my position, and removes any initiatiative the black qb had."
