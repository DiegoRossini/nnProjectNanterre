1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I open with e4 quite often, as I like open games and love playing the King's Gambit in blitz games here on GameKnot."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"Okay, my opponent decides to play Alekhine's defence, no open game."
3,e5,e4e5,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/4P3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Provoking another knight move.
4,Nd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/3nP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,Establishes a strong pawn center...
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/3nP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,Establishes a strong pawn center...
6,d6,d7d6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p4/3nP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,...which Black will usually try to smash up as soon as possible.
7,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p4/3nP3/2PP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"Okay, time to provoke another knight move."
8,Nb6,d5b6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/1n1p4/4P3/2PP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"The four pawns attack suits my taste. Unfortunately, my decent opening theory knowledge ends at this point. I guess it's time to develop some minor pieces!"
9,f4,f2f4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/1n1p4/4P3/2PP1P2/8/PP4PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"The four pawns attack suits my taste. Unfortunately, my decent opening theory knowledge ends at this point. I guess it's time to develop some minor pieces!"
10,g5,g7g5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/1n1p4/4P1p1/2PP1P2/8/PP4PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"I was very surprised by this move as I haven't seen it before. According to the GameKnot opening database it's called the ""Planinc variation""."
11,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/1n1p4/4P1p1/2PP1P2/5N2/PP4PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"After 6. fxg5 Black could destroy my pawn center immediately with 6... dxe5, so I decided to attack that pawn another time by developing a minor piece."
12,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pp1p/1n1p4/4P1p1/2PP1Pb1/5N2/PP4PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 7,Pins my knight.
13,h3,h2h3,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pp1p/1n1p4/4P1p1/2PP1Pb1/5N1P/PP4P1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"I figured out that Black should now be forced to take my knight (or retreat somewhere on the c8-h3 diagonal), otherwise his bishop is lost. I would retake with my queen, which would have a nice place on f3, attacking b7 and being on the f-file which could get very powerful after castling short, like in the King's Gambit. Furthermore, I'd own the pair of bishops."
14,Bh5,g4h5,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pp1p/1n1p4/4P1pb/2PP1P2/5N1P/PP4P1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,"?! Interesting, he neither takes my knight nor retreats to the queenside."
15,g4,g2g4,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pp1p/1n1p4/4P1pb/2PP1PP1/5N1P/PP6/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,The happy bishop hunting begins! At this time I was a bit unsure of this move because it seems my King could have a hard time finding a safe place after all those pawn moves...
16,Bg6,h5g6,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pp1p/1n1p2b1/4P1p1/2PP1PP1/5N1P/PP6/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 9,"I should have played 9. f5 immediately, I don't know why I considered this knight move to be more important. Now Black has one last chance to save the bishop."
17,Nxg5,f3g5,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pp1p/1n1p2b1/4P1N1/2PP1PP1/7P/PP6/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 9,"I should have played 9. f5 immediately, I don't know why I considered this knight move to be more important. Now Black has one last chance to save the bishop."
18,dxe5,d6e5,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pp1p/1n4b1/4p1N1/2PP1PP1/7P/PP6/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 10,? Black could have saved his bishop with 9... Bxb1.
19,f5,f4f5,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pp1p/1n4b1/4pPN1/2PP2P1/7P/PP6/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 10,Now or never!
20,f6,f7f6,rn1qkb1r/ppp1p2p/1n3pb1/4pPN1/2PP2P1/7P/PP6/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 11,Defending the attack with a counter-attack. This creates the possibility to retreat to f7 after I move my knight which is attacked.
21,Ne6,g5e6,rn1qkb1r/ppp1p2p/1n2Npb1/4pP2/2PP2P1/7P/PP6/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 11,"! Fortunately, the knight has a superb square on the sixth rank where it attacks the queen, so Black has no time to save the bishop."
22,Qd6,d8d6,rn2kb1r/ppp1p2p/1n1qNpb1/4pP2/2PP2P1/7P/PP6/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 12,Now taking the bishop doesn't bring in any material advantage because my knight could be taken by the queen afterwards (12. fxg6 Qxe6).
23,c5,c4c5,rn2kb1r/ppp1p2p/1n1qNpb1/2P1pP2/3P2P1/7P/PP6/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 12,"Creating a nice fork. At this point three of Black's pieces are attacked, material loss can't be avoided."
