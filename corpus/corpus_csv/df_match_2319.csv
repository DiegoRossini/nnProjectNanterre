1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Let's see if he lets me play my Caro-Kann.
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Let's see if he lets me play my Caro-Kann.
3,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"I expect white to now play ex5, or some other developing move."
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"I expect white to now play ex5, or some other developing move."
5,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pP3/5P2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,This often becomes a target; I'll have to watch for that. But it's one way to slow down white's pawns on the kingside.
6,h5,h7h5,rnbqkbnr/pp2ppp1/2p5/3pP2p/5P2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,This often becomes a target; I'll have to watch for that. But it's one way to slow down white's pawns on the kingside.
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp2ppp1/2p5/3pP2p/5P2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,Bg4 may have been better.
8,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkbnr/pp2ppp1/2p5/3pPb1p/5P2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,Bg4 may have been better.
9,Be2,f1e2,rn1qkbnr/pp2ppp1/2p5/3pPb1p/5P2/5N2/PPPPB1PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 5,"D4 might have been good. But this develops the bishop and has set up a discovered double attack on the h pawn, if he chooses."
10,e6,e7e6,rn1qkbnr/pp3pp1/2p1p3/3pPb1p/5P2/5N2/PPPPB1PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,This is done to solidify black's pawn structure.
11,O-O,e1g1,rn1qkbnr/pp3pp1/2p1p3/3pPb1p/5P2/5N2/PPPPB1PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 6,"D4 for white was also playable here. No obvious way to use the early tempo for anything; it does not harm white to castle just now. And now, I have a decision. Should I allow my light-squared bishop to be taken if white chooses to? I decide yes; it's early for such decisions, but my g8 knight needs to be developed, and I don't want to advance my g pawn just yet. Still, that bishop is not really a bad bishop despite my pawn setup because of the h7-g1 diagonal."
12,Ne7,g8e7,rn1qkb1r/pp2npp1/2p1p3/3pPb1p/5P2/5N2/PPPPB1PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 7,"I take a chance here that white won't move Nh4 or Ng5. Taking my h pawn too can be a bit of trouble, because it opens lines up now to the white king. In return, there would be a lot of pressure on black's kingside. White opps for a quieter setup."
13,d3,d2d3,rn1qkb1r/pp2npp1/2p1p3/3pPb1p/5P2/3P1N2/PPP1B1PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,"White must have already intended this developing move, and so my knight gets away with the maneuver. D4 was probably a little better for white here."
14,Ng6,e7g6,rn1qkb1r/pp3pp1/2p1p1n1/3pPb1p/5P2/3P1N2/PPP1B1PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 8,"This is a risk too; I am betting my opponent won't take advantage of my cramped kingside before he develops a little more. My king could come under some pressure here. As an side, I am not afraid of h3 and g4 here. I have Nh4 to allow the bishop to retreat, and to frustrate that would take white too long. One other risk too, is that white could begin operations in the center or over on the queenside, as my pieces are not very mobile. It may not be wise for white to seize the black h pawn... if he does, it will be a very pitched battle."
15,c3,c2c3,rn1qkb1r/pp3pp1/2p1p1n1/3pPb1p/5P2/2PP1N2/PP2B1PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,"Now I've noticed that my opponent, for castling so quickly, is not developing quickly. And this move is a little slow too. I, for that matter, am very slow too. This allows me to fix my kingside."
16,Be7,f8e7,rn1qk2r/pp2bpp1/2p1p1n1/3pPb1p/5P2/2PP1N2/PP2B1PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 9,"I ponder here whether white will wish to keep my knight out of g4, because that's where it's headed. I want to get rid of the f3 knight. I take a little too long to do that, because I need to develop more first."
17,Na3,b1a3,rn1qk2r/pp2bpp1/2p1p1n1/3pPb1p/5P2/N1PP1N2/PP2B1PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 2 9,"Still, I get lucky here; this move is very very slow. I don't think white has a plan; it seems he is switiching ideas every couple of moves. Often when my opponent does this I'll consider taking the knight with the bishop, to double up the pawns on the a file. But, because things are a bit cramped on my kingside, I don't want to allow play to happen on the queenside just yet, because my pieces would be little help for some time over there."
18,Nd7,b8d7,r2qk2r/pp1nbpp1/2p1p1n1/3pPb1p/5P2/N1PP1N2/PP2B1PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 3 10,"...bc5 would otherwise be a good move. Here, I simply develop."
19,Nc2,a3c2,r2qk2r/pp1nbpp1/2p1p1n1/3pPb1p/5P2/2PP1N2/PPN1B1PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 4 10,"I don't know why he is repositioning the knight when Nd4 would have been enough to trade a knight for the white bishop, if he really wanted my bad bishop that bad. This seems like a lot of maneuvering for little gain."
20,Nh4,g6h4,r2qk2r/pp1nbpp1/2p1p3/3pPb1p/5P1n/2PP1N2/PPN1B1PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 5 11,"For some time, white could probably win a pawn; but so far, has chosen not to do so. Fritz much wanted me to castle Kingside here, and does not like this move at all. But if I castle kingside, I think my king will be vulnerable, and it will hamper my own efforts for attacking on the kingside in this position."
21,Ne3,c2e3,r2qk2r/pp1nbpp1/2p1p3/3pPb1p/5P1n/2PPNN2/PP2B1PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 6 11,"This seemed odd to me; Nd4 a couple moves ago could have instantly troubled my light-squared bishop. As a result, white is behind in development now."
22,Nxf3+,h4f3,r2qk2r/pp1nbpp1/2p1p3/3pPb1p/5P2/2PPNn2/PP2B1PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 12,"I finally take that knight, knowing that doing so saves the bishop. But that's not why I do so. I have thought up and discarded about three or four different plans involving sacrifices to crack open the kingside; None seemed good yet..."
23,Bxf3,e2f3,r2qk2r/pp1nbpp1/2p1p3/3pPb1p/5P2/2PPNB2/PP4PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 12,"I don't know if taking with the rook or pawn would have been better for the position. In general, taking with the Bishop is correct, but this position is a bit odd."
24,Bg6,f5g6,r2qk2r/pp1nbpp1/2p1p1b1/3pP2p/5P2/2PPNB2/PP4PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 1 13,"White could, with just a little more preparation, strike down at the kingside with f5! and I would have to defend a while. He chooses not to, fortunately for me."
