3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,Nothing Strange yet
4,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/8/2p1p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,He is after the centre squares i think.
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/8/2p1p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,I will bring out my Knight.
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n5/2p1p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,I was wondering if he would do that or d6.  I personally think this is better.
7,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n5/2p1p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 4,"I will bring out my bishop attacking f7, attacking centre of the board and enabling a castling option."
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/2p1p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 4 5,With this lay out i always tend to look at d3 for extra back up for e4 and it also opens up the diagonal for my black bishop.  The trouble is it stops my white bishop from retreating in sight of any danger.
9,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/2p1p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 5 5,Instead i chose to castle to leave me more options.
10,d6,d7d6,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2np1n2/2p1p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 6,Obviously to defend pawns and open or his Bishops diagonal.
11,a3,a2a3,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2np1n2/2p1p3/2B1P3/P1N2N2/1PPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 6,I will deal with that later but first I will give my bishop an extra square.
12,a6,a7a6,r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1np1n2/2p1p3/2B1P3/P1N2N2/1PPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,assuming he is lining up an attack of my bishop (b5).  But now I have both a2 and b3 to retreat i will.....
13,d3,d2d3,r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1np1n2/2p1p3/2B1P3/P1NP1N2/1PP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,....stregnthen my e4 pawn and open up the bishops diagonal.

17,Bxf6,g5f6,1rbqk2r/1p2bppp/p1np1B2/2p1p3/2B1P3/P1NP1N2/1PP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b k - 0 9,any way as I said lets get rid.

19,Bd5,c4d5,1rbqk2r/1p3ppp/p1np1b2/2pBp3/4P3/P1NP1N2/1PP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b k - 1 10,Lets try this. attacks Knight stopping the movement of b7 pawn whilst still attacking f7 although I guess a castle is coming.
20,Qb6,d8b6,1rb1k2r/1p3ppp/pqnp1b2/2pBp3/4P3/P1NP1N2/1PP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w k - 2 11,b2 under attack
