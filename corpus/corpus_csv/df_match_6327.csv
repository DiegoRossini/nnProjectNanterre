An important point is that B played 1...e6, preventing a move like .....Bg4.  This choice creates a ""bad bishop"" for B later, similar to many variations of the French Defense.  It is not a bad choice, but it dictates some rock-ribbed behavior by B to get through to the early middle-game, with normally good prospects."

6. e3  I seriously considered 6. e4 to command the center.  But that is B's intention anyway, and I had decided first to counter-balance B's Q-side pressure.  And getting in my early 5. a4 guarantees that good counter-balance and an eventual recovery of the c-Pawn."

27,Nxc4,e5c4,rnb2rk1/p4ppp/3qpn2/B7/2NP4/4P3/5PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 14,"14....Qd5.  We are commencing a fascinating phase of the game.  First observe that the control of the a8-h1 diagonal will begin to dominate the game.  This is the ongoing counter-balance strategy I have started.  But secondly, also observe that B has activated his Queen and can soon activate his Q-side minor pieces to do some serious damage to W's King.  How do these two strategies play out against each other?"

32,Bd7,c8d7,r4rk1/p1Bb1ppp/2n1pn2/3q4/2NP4/4P3/4BPPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 5 17,"16....Bd7.  B did not apparently consider 16...Bb7, maybe because some variations seem to leave that bishop hanging undefended on that a8-h1 diagonal, depending upon how the N/c6 moves.   Once W moves Bf3, the diagonal belongs to W.  It was possibly worth looking at 16....e5 for B, even though it costs a Pawn, because it really frees up his pieces and gives his a-Pawn more support if it can make it to a5.  But the timing is important.  Can he do that knowing that Bf3 is looming?"

The Knight can leave its e6 post as long as the B Queen is not on the fifth rank; otherwise she escapes her confinement.  But in this position, she is on the sixth rank.  And by moving the Knight, I am able to use the Q's Bishop on c7 to harass the B Queen.  As a reminder, my own Q is completely out of play.  She is not needed!  This is still a very dynamic position.  For example, even though the B Queen is on the sixth rank and seemingly confined, with a properly timed ....e5 she can escape from the area of h6."

The choices are to release the Q Rook from behind that pin by the W King's Bishop but give up that isolated Pawn on a7.  That Pawn is often a winner for B in many variations where B is successful in launching a Q-side attack.  But here it is totally stalled. So the only other choice for B is to reinforce the Knight at c6 and maintain the block on that diagonal.  What will give first?"

And soon the Rook will start to train on the K-side.  In this position, W's Queen seems superfluous, aside from supporting the a8-h1 diagonal pin!  A very odd position, a type I have never played before."
