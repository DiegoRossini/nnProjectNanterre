6,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pPb2/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"The continuation with 3....Bf5 is still the most popular choice. I have however used Botvinnik-Carls gambit quite successfully with 3....c5, and it is now part my repetoire. The Kavalek Variation with 3....Na6 is an interesting alternative which I have touched on the odd occasions."
7,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pPb2/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 4,4.Nc3 is part of the Nigel Short repetoire which he used in the PCA 1993 world championship challenge. I like it.
8,e6,e7e6,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3pPb2/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"As you will see over the next few moves, simple development with Be2, and kingside castling will lead to a quieter game with a lot of maneuvering. This is my preference. I have however used the sharp Van der Wiel Variation 4.Nc3 e6 5. g4! which leads to exciting play on a few occasions, mostly as a surprise weapon in OTB chess."

10,Nd7,b8d7,r2qkbnr/pp1n1ppp/2p1p3/3pPb2/3P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,Still in the main lines. This move covers the c5 square and places pressure on the e5 square as well. The battle for the centre is underway.
11,Be2,f1e2,r2qkbnr/pp1n1ppp/2p1p3/3pPb2/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 6,"I feel this pre-emptive move is too quiet, and loses a tempo. Blacks pieces are already congested and a more sharper alternative would be my choice. 7....Bg4, is a possibility or alternatively 7....Ng6, which would be my preference, freeing the black diagonal bishop. If white opts for h3, then Nh4."
12,Ne7,g8e7,r2qkb1r/pp1nnppp/2p1p3/3pPb2/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 4 7,"I feel this pre-emptive move is too quiet, and loses a tempo.

15,Be3,c1e3,r2qkb1r/pp1nnpp1/2p1p2p/3pPb2/3P4/2N1BN2/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 1 8,"8. Re1 is a natural alternative, but this move with 8.Be3 reinforces the centre pawns preparing against the inevitable ....c4 assault. In addition it is a good developing move. The rooks are only one move away from being connected!"
16,a6,a7a6,r2qkb1r/1p1nnpp1/p1p1p2p/3pPb2/3P4/2N1BN2/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 9,"I feel this move weakens the pawn structure unnecessarily, and does nothing to place pressure on Whites control of the centre. In addition, it has created a target for white on the b6 square with that backward pawn. 8....Q-c7 would be more active. The advance to a6 should only be used if forced. Otherwise a7 is the best position for it."
17,a3,a2a3,r2qkb1r/1p1nnpp1/p1p1p2p/3pPb2/3P4/P1N1BN2/1PP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 9,This is what may be called a 'Prophylaxis' move. ie. Taking preventative measures in anticipation of an opponents move. This move is already laying the groundwork for a Queenside attack.
18,c5,c6c5,r2qkb1r/1p1nnpp1/p3p2p/2ppPb2/3P4/P1N1BN2/1PP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 10,"I feel this move was premature, there is not enough artillery present to make this effective. 9....Qc7 could still have been utilized. Obviously, Black wanted to use this as an attacking move, as well as a freeing move for his Knight and black diagonal bishop, but I feel it could have waited."
19,dxc5,d4c5,r2qkb1r/1p1nnpp1/p3p2p/2PpPb2/8/P1N1BN2/1PP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 10,No hesitation required in accepting the pawn.
20,Nc6,e7c6,r2qkb1r/1p1n1pp1/p1n1p2p/2PpPb2/8/P1N1BN2/1PP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 1 11,A perfunctory glance shows Black has now opened some lines and alleviated the congestion. However Black has failed to see that the b6 square has been Whites target since 8....a6.
21,Na4,c3a4,r2qkb1r/1p1n1pp1/p1n1p2p/2PpPb2/N7/P3BN2/1PP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 2 11,Now Knight to a4! This move protects the valuable c5 pawn as well as threatening Nb6.
22,Qb8,d8b8,rq2kb1r/1p1n1pp1/p1n1p2p/2PpPb2/N7/P3BN2/1PP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 3 12,I feel Qc7 would be a better move. Keeping the Queen guarding the a5-d8 diagonal is arguably a better alternative. In addition the 'a' file rook would still remain active. This move loses another tempo for black because this is not the ideal placement for the queen. The Queen will have to move again.
23,Qd2,d1d2,rq2kb1r/1p1n1pp1/p1n1p2p/2PpPb2/N7/P3BN2/1PPQBPPP/R4RK1 b kq - 4 12,"White could have moved 12.b4 now. But  d2 gets the Queen active, as well as opening a path for both whites rooks to get involved at a later date. They are now connected. There is no rush, White has developed comfortably and there are no immediate threats."
24,Ncxe5,c6e5,rq2kb1r/1p1n1pp1/p3p2p/2Ppnb2/N7/P3BN2/1PPQBPPP/R4RK1 w kq - 0 13,I feel the following moves for black were in the wrong sequence. These subtle differences accumulate to small advantages for white. This is an obvious choice in one respect. But was the e5 pawn really going anywhere? White already knows this pawn this pawn is lost. The knight move to a4 confirms Whites intentions on keeping the c5 pawn instead. I feel Black could have delayed this move and alternatively moved 12....Be7 leaving the King the option of castling and activating the h file rook if required.
25,Nd4,f3d4,rq2kb1r/1p1n1pp1/p3p2p/2Ppnb2/N2N4/P3B3/1PPQBPPP/R4RK1 b kq - 1 13,No hesitation here. Placing a direct threat on the bishop whilst developing the Knight.
26,Be4,f5e4,rq2kb1r/1p1n1pp1/p3p2p/2Ppn3/N2Nb3/P3B3/1PPQBPPP/R4RK1 w kq - 2 14,This is a wasted move I feel. White was planning to activate this pawn regardless. The bishop should have retreated h7 immediately. Another tempo lost for Black.
27,f3,f2f3,rq2kb1r/1p1n1pp1/p3p2p/2Ppn3/N2Nb3/P3BP2/1PPQB1PP/R4RK1 b kq - 0 14,Now b4! White has claimed a lot of space and developed well.
28,Bh7,e4h7,rq2kb1r/1p1n1ppb/p3p2p/2Ppn3/N2N4/P3BP2/1PPQB1PP/R4RK1 w kq - 1 15,Now b4! White has claimed a lot of space and developed well.
29,b4,b2b4,rq2kb1r/1p1n1ppb/p3p2p/2Ppn3/NP1N4/P3BP2/2PQB1PP/R4RK1 b kq - 0 15,Now b4! White has claimed a lot of space and developed well.
30,Qd8,b8d8,r2qkb1r/1p1n1ppb/p3p2p/2Ppn3/NP1N4/P3BP2/2PQB1PP/R4RK1 w kq - 1 16,This is the 2nd time the Queen has shifted in 4 moves? I still feel the c7 square is a better placement for the Queen.
