1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was a fairly typical Ruy Lopez, but black's move here is an inaccuracy, allowing d4! and white has a push."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"This was a fairly typical Ruy Lopez, but black's move here is an inaccuracy, allowing d4! and white has a push."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"This was a fairly typical Ruy Lopez, but black's move here is an inaccuracy, allowing d4! and white has a push."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"This was a fairly typical Ruy Lopez, but black's move here is an inaccuracy, allowing d4! and white has a push."
5,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,"This was a fairly typical Ruy Lopez, but black's move here is an inaccuracy, allowing d4! and white has a push."

7,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/1B2p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,"This is often what I will do, when I'm playing white. Not always, however; it's not the best way to maintain tension and create a complicated position wherein one can find beautiful continuations."
8,exd4,e5d4,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/1B6/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"Castling here for white is now possible, but I prefer to create a long time problem for black."
9,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/1B6/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,The best move. Ne7 here is rather passive.
10,Bd7,c8d7,r2qkbnr/pppb1ppp/2np4/1B6/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 6,The best move. Ne7 here is rather passive.
11,Nxc6,d4c6,r2qkbnr/pppb1ppp/2Np4/1B6/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"bxc6 would have been better, gaining black a useful tempo."
12,Bxc6,d7c6,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2bp4/1B6/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"bxc6 would have been better, gaining black a useful tempo."
13,Bxc6+,b5c6,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2Bp4/8/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,"And so I have created three pawn islands for black, while I have only two; in addition, he has doubled pawns. This is definitely advantage white. Now, it's a race to develop properly, and take advantage of that, which.... admittedly I fail to do! ;)"

15,O-O,e1g1,r2qkbnr/p1p2ppp/2pp4/8/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 8,White's advantage according to Fritz is more than a pawn!
16,Nf6,g8f6,r2qkb1r/p1p2ppp/2pp1n2/8/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 9,"The pawn is immune in this position, due to the knight pin that would result. So I take the time to get my king off the black bishop's dark squares. So far, so good. An immediate Re1 might have been better here."
17,Kh1,g1h1,r2qkb1r/p1p2ppp/2pp1n2/8/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1R1K b kq - 3 9,"The pawn is immune in this position, due to the knight pin that would result. So I take the time to get my king off the black bishop's dark squares. So far, so good. An immediate Re1 might have been better here."
18,Be7,f8e7,r2qk2r/p1p1bppp/2pp1n2/8/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1R1K w kq - 4 10,"Preparing to castle, and threatening now white's e pawn for real."
19,f3,f2f3,r2qk2r/p1p1bppp/2pp1n2/8/4P3/5P2/PPP3PP/RNBQ1R1K b kq - 0 10,"Better was a developing move, as noted in another annotated game by elyhim."
20,O-O,e8g8,r2q1rk1/p1p1bppp/2pp1n2/8/4P3/5P2/PPP3PP/RNBQ1R1K w - - 1 11,"The game is mostly equal, but I like white better."
21,Be3,c1e3,r2q1rk1/p1p1bppp/2pp1n2/8/4P3/4BP2/PPP3PP/RN1Q1R1K b - - 2 11,Fritz wanted me to move the knight to d2. I didn't like that idea here.
22,c5,c6c5,r2q1rk1/p1p1bppp/3p1n2/2p5/4P3/4BP2/PPP3PP/RN1Q1R1K w - - 0 12,"This move caught me off guard, but in retrospect I should have realized black would immediately try to wrest the initiative from me, and put his odd pawns to work in order to remove their liability. In addition, it is restricting my white bishop; so a very useful move at this point."
23,Nd2,b1d2,r2q1rk1/p1p1bppp/3p1n2/2p5/4P3/4BP2/PPPN2PP/R2Q1R1K b - - 1 12,"The previous black move also caused me to move my knight very passively. Had I put the knight on c3, I thought black would immediately force pawn trades in the middle, which I felt I was not ready for."
24,c6,c7c6,r2q1rk1/p3bppp/2pp1n2/2p5/4P3/4BP2/PPPN2PP/R2Q1R1K w - - 0 13,"Preparing d5, but it's not quite ready."
25,Rb1,a1b1,r2q1rk1/p3bppp/2pp1n2/2p5/4P3/4BP2/PPPN2PP/1R1Q1R1K b - - 1 13,"Simply getting my rook off that dangerous diagonal, and protecting the b pawn. Very passive, and black takes advantage of this."
26,d5,d6d5,r2q1rk1/p3bppp/2p2n2/2pp4/4P3/4BP2/PPPN2PP/1R1Q1R1K w - - 0 14,"Alas for black, he needed to prepare first to prevent white's reply..."
27,e5,e4e5,r2q1rk1/p3bppp/2p2n2/2ppP3/8/4BP2/PPPN2PP/1R1Q1R1K b - - 0 14,"And now the position is getting a bit difficult for white, because if I am not careful, those pawns could roll a ways. I've let them start to dominate! Not good. But I'm not quite ready to maneuver to attack."
28,d4,d5d4,r2q1rk1/p3bppp/2p2n2/2p1P3/3p4/4BP2/PPPN2PP/1R1Q1R1K w - - 0 15,"This is a blunder, one I did not catch while we played. It gives white a piece for the pawn. But, I didn't see it, playing too quickly in this Blitz game, I retreated the Bishop."
29,Bf2,e3f2,r2q1rk1/p3bppp/2p2n2/2p1P3/3p4/5P2/PPPN1BPP/1R1Q1R1K b - - 1 15,"So by not seeing this properly, I've now made a blunder, throwing away all white advantage."
