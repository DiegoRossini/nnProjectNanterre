1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,After a heavy defeat its hard to face ones demons but if we wish to improve face them we must. So two weeks after the game has finished I finally have got round to annotating it for the Walk the walk thread.

13,Rc1,a1c1,rnbq1rk1/p1p1bppp/1p2pn2/3p4/2PP1B2/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/2RQKB1R b K - 1 7,&.cxd and 7.Bd3 are also popular here.
14,Bb7,c8b7,rn1q1rk1/pbp1bppp/1p2pn2/3p4/2PP1B2/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/2RQKB1R w K - 2 8,Clarifying the situation with the pawn centre. 8.Bd3 may have been better.
15,cxd5,c4d5,rn1q1rk1/pbp1bppp/1p2pn2/3P4/3P1B2/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/2RQKB1R b K - 0 8,Clarifying the situation with the pawn centre. 8.Bd3 may have been better.
16,Nxd5,f6d5,rn1q1rk1/pbp1bppp/1p2p3/3n4/3P1B2/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/2RQKB1R w K - 0 9,Keeping the h1/a8 diagonal open and better than 8....exd
17,Nxd5,c3d5,rn1q1rk1/pbp1bppp/1p2p3/3N4/3P1B2/4PN2/PP3PPP/2RQKB1R b K - 0 9,Played so that I didn't have to retreat the Bishop on f4
18,Qxd5,d8d5,rn3rk1/pbp1bppp/1p2p3/3q4/3P1B2/4PN2/PP3PPP/2RQKB1R w K - 0 10,10.Rxc7 Bb4 11.Nd2 Na6 doesn't give white much.

20,Nd7,b8d7,r4rk1/pbpnbppp/1p2p3/3q4/3P1B2/P3PN2/1P3PPP/2RQKB1R w K - 1 11,I'm out of my book now so my loss in only another 9 moves is particularly galling as in this position white looks to have equality at the least. Though I think my esteemed opponent would be happy with his position due to his piece activity.
21,Bc4,f1c4,r4rk1/pbpnbppp/1p2p3/3q4/2BP1B2/P3PN2/1P3PPP/2RQK2R b K - 2 11,11.Qa4 may have been much better here and after the game I found in the GK database a game played with this move. When I played 11.Bc4 I saw the Qa4 ch and wasn't too unhappy about the Q exchange. Interestingly both the GameKnot engine and Houdini 2 give my move as imprecise going from a +0.20 to a -0.10
22,Qa5+,d5a5,r4rk1/pbpnbppp/1p2p3/q7/2BP1B2/P3PN2/1P3PPP/2RQK2R w K - 3 12,12.Nd2 was also possible as 12....Bxg2 13.Rg1 Bb7 14.Bh6 Bf6 and now the move I missed 15.Bxg7. Having missed this I played 12.Qd2
23,Qd2,d1d2,r4rk1/pbpnbppp/1p2p3/q7/2BP1B2/P3PN2/1P1Q1PPP/2R1K2R b K - 4 12,12.Nd2 was also possible as 12....Bxg2 13.Rg1 Bb7 14.Bh6 Bf6 and now the move I missed 15.Bxg7. Having missed this I played 12.Qd2
24,Qxd2+,a5d2,r4rk1/pbpnbppp/1p2p3/8/2BP1B2/P3PN2/1P1q1PPP/2R1K2R w K - 0 13,13.Nxd2 was an option and may have been preferable. I didn't play it because of 13.....Bxg2 but like the previous note Bxg2 is weak.
25,Kxd2,e1d2,r4rk1/pbpnbppp/1p2p3/8/2BP1B2/P3PN2/1P1K1PPP/2R4R b - - 0 13,13.Nxd2 was an option and may have been preferable. I didn't play it because of 13.....Bxg2 but like the previous note Bxg2 is weak.
26,c5,c7c5,r4rk1/pb1nbppp/1p2p3/2p5/2BP1B2/P3PN2/1P1K1PPP/2R4R w - - 0 14,Thematic attacking the centre and threatening whites somewhat exposed king.
27,dxc5,d4c5,r4rk1/pb1nbppp/1p2p3/2P5/2B2B2/P3PN2/1P1K1PPP/2R4R b - - 0 14,An error due to worrying about getting an isolated pawn. GK -0.69 Houdini2 -0.37. 14.Ke2 should have been played with a position close to equality e.g. 14.Ke2 cxd 15.Rhd1(the intermezzo I missed) Rad8 16.exd with a position close to equality.
28,Nxc5,d7c5,r4rk1/pb2bppp/1p2p3/2n5/2B2B2/P3PN2/1P1K1PPP/2R4R w - - 0 15,Played to get rid of the weak pawn on b2 though again Ke2 getting the King of the exposed D-file was better.
29,b4,b2b4,r4rk1/pb2bppp/1p2p3/2n5/1PB2B2/P3PN2/3K1PPP/2R4R b - - 0 15,Played to get rid of the weak pawn on b2 though again Ke2 getting the King of the exposed D-file was better.
30,Ne4+,c5e4,r4rk1/pb2bppp/1p2p3/8/1PB1nB2/P3PN2/3K1PPP/2R4R w - - 1 16,Black now attacks whites now weak pawn on b4. I now wish I had left it on b2.
31,Ke2,d2e2,r4rk1/pb2bppp/1p2p3/8/1PB1nB2/P3PN2/4KPPP/2R4R b - - 2 16,Black now attacks whites now weak pawn on b4. I now wish I had left it on b2.
32,a5,a7a5,r4rk1/1b2bppp/1p2p3/p7/1PB1nB2/P3PN2/4KPPP/2R4R w - - 0 17,Black now attacks whites now weak pawn on b4. I now wish I had left it on b2.
33,bxa5,b4a5,r4rk1/1b2bppp/1p2p3/P7/2B1nB2/P3PN2/4KPPP/2R4R b - - 0 17,A blunder.-1.88 GK.-1.06 Houdini2. Both give 17Rhd1 as better though I still lose the pawn.
34,Rxa5,a8a5,5rk1/1b2bppp/1p2p3/r7/2B1nB2/P3PN2/4KPPP/2R4R w - - 0 18,A blunder that loses a piece.  Though with white about to drop his remaining Q-side pawn then having to face blacks Q-side passer it probably shortened my misery.
35,Ne5,f3e5,5rk1/1b2bppp/1p2p3/r3N3/2B1nB2/P3P3/4KPPP/2R4R b - - 1 18,A blunder that loses a piece.  Though with white about to drop his remaining Q-side pawn then having to face blacks Q-side passer it probably shortened my misery.
36,g5,g7g5,5rk1/1b2bp1p/1p2p3/r3N1p1/2B1nB2/P3P3/4KPPP/2R4R w - - 0 19,Zip to four and probably my worst performance against stalhandske. Food for thought and back to the drawing board. But once again well played by my opponent.
37,Bg3,f4g3,5rk1/1b2bp1p/1p2p3/r3N1p1/2B1n3/P3P1B1/4KPPP/2R4R b - - 1 19,Zip to four and probably my worst performance against stalhandske. Food for thought and back to the drawing board. But once again well played by my opponent.
38,Nxg3+,e4g3,5rk1/1b2bp1p/1p2p3/r3N1p1/2B5/P3P1n1/4KPPP/2R4R w - - 0 20,Zip to four and probably my worst performance against stalhandske. Food for thought and back to the drawing board. But once again well played by my opponent.
