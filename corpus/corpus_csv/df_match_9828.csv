1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"One of the interesting aspects of playing 1.Nf3 is to transpose to Queen's pawn openings with ready antidotes to a number of thematic replies : Nimzo-Indian, Queen's Indian, Grunfeld... and here's the case for the Dutch Opening. Notice that there is no real antidotes to the Slav, Semi-Slav system or King's Indian, with the 1.Nf3 move order to enter Queen's pawn openings."
2,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,"Ready to transpose to the Dutch opening after 2.d4 , but there's something unusual waiting for Black."
3,d3,d2d3,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/8/3P1N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,"Not the Lisitsin Gambit (2.e4 fxe 3.Ng5) which is now not so dangerous, but something similar and trickier to answer, which begins with an apparently modest move 2.d3 . What I very much like about 1.Nf3 is that the opponent generally does not know how to react correctly as it depends on the mood of his opponent to decide upon creating huge complications or just playing for small positional advantages."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppppp1pp/5n2/5p2/8/3P1N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 3,"About every plausible moves have been tried here for Black , 2...d5 trying a stonewall without d4 is not a good idea so the flexible 3.c4 must be a good answer. 2...Nc6 encounters 3.d4 and the Queen's knight is misplaced."
5,e4,e2e4,rnbqkb1r/ppppp1pp/5n2/5p2/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"it is really dangerous to accept the pawn after 3...fxe4 4.dxe4 Nxe4 5.Bd3, as games published show."
6,d6,d7d6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1p1pp/3p1n2/5p2/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"4.e5 or 4.Nc3 were also nice tries. The game move should be the most principled one, as the following exchange of white-squared bishops and opening of the center with d4 should highly favour White with white square weaknesses for Black in the open."

8,Bxf5,c8f5,rn1qkb1r/ppp1p1pp/3p1n2/5b2/8/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Now White had just to exchange pawns on e5, and playing quietly and purposefully. Black has a huge task ahead to maintain equality dynamically, as his white square weaknesses will be a permanent burden."

16,e4,e5e4,r2qkb1r/pppn2pp/3p1n2/1Q6/3Pp3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 9,"I was shocked by this move, happily I recovered as my position is not so bad after all. My mood after this good practical, aggressive move from Black was to reach a stable and good position and refusing further complications."
17,Ng5,f3g5,r2qkb1r/pppn2pp/3p1n2/1Q4N1/3Pp3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 1 9,"While playing this move, I was feeling like George Clooney waiting for his espresso : What else ? ;-)"
18,Qc8,d8c8,r1q1kb1r/pppn2pp/3p1n2/1Q4N1/3Pp3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 2 10,"Somewhere Black must have gambited one or two pawns by playing 9...d5 consolidating the center, and taking further the initiative to launch an attack. It would have been good strategy. Here, after this move 9...Qc8, I just have the time to retreat, castle, and take a good position."
