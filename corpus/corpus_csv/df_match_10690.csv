I wouldnt call Bb5 the best move, but from the psychological point of view, the character of the opening changes from very tactical, to positional (mostly) . I dont mind playing all kinds of positions, as long as my opponent feels uncomfortable with it. Another reason is, that i wanted to play a long game, eventually keeping a small  , and then waiting for a mistake. I thought, if i have to play for a win as a maniac, I could do it later as well."

I couldn't track this move back in any of my books.

That's the only move in order to make some progress. Otherwise the white bishop paralizes black's development. It's also a direct assault on the white centre, in order to open it up, and let his bishops dance all over the board. Although the white centre looks fragile it's hard to come through, without taking serious risks."

A great move. Black sensed that he'd be lost positionally if he'd wait any longer with a5. The threat was Nc3-a4-c5, and white has it all. Now that's not possible because after Nc3, black simply replies with a4! and wins the opening."
