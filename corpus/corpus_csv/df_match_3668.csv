1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi, this is Ren and I would like to show you my first game here of GameKnot.
My opponent was 412364, who had black pieces; I, with white, started with d4."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"My opponent plays d5, giving a Closed Game opening."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,c4: Queen's Gambit...
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"...and now Nf6, defending the pawn on d5."
5,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"The idea behind e3 was to defend the c4 pawn with the light-square bishop, although taking on d5 may have been a better continuation."
6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Again, it would have been better for me to have played cxd5, as after the knight recaptures, this move, Nf3, could allow for 5.e4."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"Again, it would have been better for me to have played cxd5, as after the knight recaptures, this move, Nf3, could allow for 5.e4."
8,Bd6,f8d6,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/3bpn2/3p4/2PP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,"Here, my opponent's bishop is developed nicely, sitting behind the d5 pawn."
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/3bpn2/3p4/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 5,"Perhaps not the best move in the circumstances, blocking off a diagonal for a potential bishop on d2."
10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/3bpn2/3p4/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 4 6,"7.Bd3 is a bit of a mistake, conceding the tempo with a knight fork on bishop and queen."

Incredibly enough, neither of us saw it, and despite me having numerous opportunites to advance the pawn, it would forever remain on the fourth rank.

Live and learn, I suppose..."

I hesitated quite a while, thinking this could be a trap, however I resolved that it was free material a second time after not seeing any winning variatons for black."
