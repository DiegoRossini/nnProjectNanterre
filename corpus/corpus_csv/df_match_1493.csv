1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Black wants to play some esotic opening to avoid a long theoretical battle.

3,e4,e2e4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/7n/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,White's plan is to solidly play in the center and avoid to much complications in the opening. Evan more solid would have been to first develop a knight.

6,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/6pn/8/2BPP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 4,"This is a very typical error. White deviates from his ""I play solid"" strategy and tries to occupy the center, but doing so weakens the kingside for the attacks of Nh6 and Bg7. According to SF5 white's advantage has completely vanished at this point. Almost any solid developement move would have retained the advantage."

8,c6,c7c6,rnbqk2r/pp1pppbp/2p3pn/8/2BPPP2/8/PPP3PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,"Now white's plane must be to play e5 and try to suffocate black monster Bg7. To do this, it must be possible to answer d5 with e5, and to do this the Bc4 must be moved. Nc3 was good at any of the previous moves but now it misses the necessities of the position."

10,d5,d7d5,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/2p3pn/3p4/2BPPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,Yes! Black open the game and the kingside weakening will play a decisive role.
11,exd5,e4d5,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/2p3pn/3P4/2BP1P2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 6,This favors black's development. Nf3 was more solid. After 7. Nf3 SF5 proposes 7. ... Nf5 8. Bb3 cxd5 9. g4 Nd6 10. h3 with a slight advantage for black.

14,Nxc6,b8c6,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2n3pn/8/2BP1P2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQK1NR w KQ - 0 8,The move is somehow natural but is blamed as very bad by SF5. It prefers 8. d5 Nd4 9. Nge2 in which white gives a tempo to keep the pawn and avoid threats by the Queen. Now the game is heavily compromised.
