1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"A very interesting end game. The Bishop and Knight Mate is the most difficult of the so-called ""elementary"" mates and there is nothing elementary about them for a beginner player.... or even a more experienced one. It is a very rare ending but it is a very useful to learn how to do this, otherwise the game will sure to be thrown into a draw either due to 50 move rule, or a stalemate. This would be off course unfortunate because it is a won game, but one must know exactly what to do. I will deal with this more in detail toward the end but for right now lets begin:"
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I am dealing clearly with a superior player so my strategy in such matches is always the same: MUST TAKE RISKS or else I won't stand a chance. (I will probably lose either way, but if I take a risk I have at least a remote chance of surprising my opponent and create an interesting game)."

You will see what I mean by that in the coming moves."

More emphasis on a development. It usually creates a richer and more complex game, with greater number of possibilities.
