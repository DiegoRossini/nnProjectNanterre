From this position according to Book it is Qxg7 Rg8 Qxh7 cxd4 and White cannot capture in return cxd4. See yourself Why. 10. Ne2 Nbc6 11. f4 Bd7 12. Qd3 And White don't like this position 'cause White will nott get what he wanted When he played Qg4. Instead White has two isolated pawns actually 3 and 1 double pawn exposed king. While Black King is rock solid after castling Queen Side and is rook at g-file is too dangerous for White as White King will go to g-file after castling ...
So simply analysing above theory abro denied book and played next move ..."
