7,e4,e2e4,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,Taking up the centre with a large 'classical' sort of set up
8,d6,d7d6,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"Black will need to strike at whites large pawn centre, and has the option of either doing so with the c pawn to indicate queen side play or else with the e pawn which is indicative of king side play"

12,e5,e7e5,rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/3p1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 7,I think this is the more commons pawn break and indicates that black probably wants to attack on the king side
13,O-O,e1g1,rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/3p1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 7,"I think d5 used to be the go however these days castles is considered more accurate, with the idea that black must first make some sort of concession before white clarity's the situation in the centre for example if Re8 now then white plays d5 and the rook is misplaced since the closing of the centre means the rook really belongs on f8. In short castling is the more flexible option and strong players love to play flexibly"
14,Nc6,b8c6,r1bq1rk1/ppp2pbp/2np1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 2 8,Now white closes the centre whilst hitting the knight. And now that the centre has been closed up play will now take place on the wings. White will attack on the queen side whereas black will attack on the kingside which is where he has the most space

Another option is to play Nd2 and look to get in c5 followed by exchanging on d3 and then brining the knight to c4 to grind at d6"

When both sides are attacking on opposite wings it becomes essential that both party's go after there goals with as much speed and energy as possible since reacting to the opponents threats will mean the defending side will quickly go down hill"

This was done so that it would be harder for black to get in ...g4 however I should have jumped on the chance to exchange on b7 where after black recaptures, he must waste time brining his bishop back into play on the kingside and in the meantime white would look to bring a knight to the c6 square and possibly a rook to the c file and I think white has more than enough play on the queenside to distract black from his play on the kingside"
