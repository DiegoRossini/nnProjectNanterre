1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I've been playing this weekend at the 2015 American Open in Anaheim, CA in the U/2200 section. Here's a game which I just finished playing which not only likely the fastest game of the section, is also rife with tactics and teachable play, and most of all fun to watch (as white). Recently, I've picked up this Smith-Morra gambit as white with relatively good success. I got white both games today, both Morras, and the first was a 20 move theoretical draw, so I was itching for a killing this game.

Also if you notice a large rating gap between white and black, I taught as a coach for 4 years at a chess club, and having been asked to play games against students while rusty I took many rating hits. I have played with fair success in U/2200 sections for over a year now, so although I dislike playing up (since it is rude to the other player) no reason to stop now. It is quite hilarious to see a 1877 playing a 2165 at board 1 in the U/2200 section (a different round of mine).

For your convenience, I recommend if you are not already, observe this game in interactive mode. There are far too many annotations to make scrolling page by page an enjoyable experience."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The starting position of the Morra gambit. Black usually has a lot of fun in the Sicilian, however the Morra gambit essentially says:

White: ""So Black, I'm going to give you a pawn, but in exchange I get to have all of the fun the entire game. Deal or no Deal.""

2. cxd4 is the main way to play, all other moves transpose or are simply bad for black. For example, after 2...d6, white enjoys a comfortable position after 3. dxc5 Qa5+ 4. Nc3, ahead the tempos without the cost of the pawn. 2...e6 seems logical, however white enters a solid Benoni after 3. d5, which would take many Sicilian players out of their repertoire. Anyways, in this game black fully accepts the gambit, so let's just trod on ahead.

Note: Black was noticeably unnerved and unhappy with white's opening selection (alongside the pressure from playing down 250 rating points, and not knowing my actual strength level). Mission accomplished!"

Keeping the king exposed can and will cost you your attack on many occasions. Plus, who doesn't want to use the h1 rook as soon as possible? Actually, as you'll see later in this game: not me. But king safety is nice."
14,Nge7,g8e7,r1bqkb1r/1p1pnppp/p1n1p3/8/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 8,"And now we see the variation Black has committed to. Although most Morra variations are without a name due to the rarity of the opening, this response is the Grandmaster approved choice employed by many top GMs including Hikaru Nakamura and Loek van Wely. Black's goal is simple: it is too early to commit the dark squared bishop to a square, the light squared bishop may enjoy a post on b7 or potentially d7 or other squares on the diagonal should it open. Black wants to commit the knight to g6, where it stops white from thrusting e4-e5 with a bind on the dark squares and white's light squared bishop from coming to f4. Often times one or both knights end up crossing the e5 square as a transition square or outpost.

Admittedly, black confessed after the game that they had been testing this opening through blitz and had little formal repertoire with this line, but that in no way diminishes the potency of the opening itself. Also admittedly, this is often times white's least comfortable variation of the Morra accepted, perhaps only second to the classical main line.

Black is also fine in other lines should they choose to first develop the dark squared bishop, however then white can opt for e5 or Bf4 should he choose, among other heinous deeds."

Protip: Play as many annoying moves as you can as long as they are sound. Just don't lose points that way. Then you're the one who's annoyed."

Plus, f6 supports a future knight on e5, and stops a white knight or pawn from romping on in.

White: ""Tickle tickle.""

Black: ""Stahp."""

White aims to potentially sacrifice a piece on d5: a make-or-break theme of the Morra, however 3 things interfere with this plan: 1. Black having a pawn on d6 2. Black harassing an unprotected bishop on c4 and 3. Black's king being closer than 2 moves from castling. In this position, Bb3 fulfills the final restriction, preparing to open pandora's box with Nd5!"

This move does little to help black aside from preparing to castle, which would prevent Nd5, except that after having played f6 the king will simply be stranded in the center or be forced to return the piece to castle anyways. 10...b5 is absolutely necessary, gaining space on the queenside to seek counterplay against a knight sac, in fact, 10...b5 is the only move in book. However, discouraged by the thought of black castling in only 1 move, I did not sacrifice on d5 yet, first playing the solid 2nd move (and only inaccuracy/mistake of the game on my part)."

White lets Black get away with dropping the soap, but only for a moment. You need to build the suspense, you see."

23,Nd5,c3d5,r1bq1rk1/1p1pb1pp/p1n1ppn1/3N4/4P3/1B2BN2/PP3PPP/2RQ1RK1 b - - 7 12,"! White immediately threatens 13. Bb6 Qe8 14. Nc7, winning the rook, and if 12...Rb8 then 13. Bb6 works quite well again after 13...Qe8 14. Bc7 Ra8 15. Nb6 Ra7 with a positional bind and a lasting attack. Black, despite being left with one option (to take), spent 45 minutes on this move, perhaps sensing that something had gone quite wrong and searching for a way out or perhaps simply out of angst, trying to calculate their next few moves beforehand. Either way, to me it's a free time advantage, and with 28 moves to go before the SD kicks in time is a precious commodity, especially in a thick position like this.

White: ""Mmhmm. Now I'll tell you what, I like you, and I want you. Now, we can do this the easy way, or we can do this the hard way: the choice is yours. What's it gonna be?"""

26,Na5,c6a5,r1bq1rk1/1p1pb1pp/p4pn1/n2P4/8/1B2BN2/PP3PPP/2RQ1RK1 w - - 1 14,"? The first mistake (or perhaps blunder) of the game. Instead of addressing the threat of the discovered check appropriately with 13...Kh8, Black seeks to trade off the knight for the light squared sniper. However, as they will soon find out, Kh8 was not only recommended, but necessary, and the knight on c6 may have been more valuable than they thought.

Qd5!? and Black cannot retreat the bishop lest he be mated, and will be forced to take on d6 with 15...Bxd6, only to be met with an outpost for white with 16. Qxd6 Qe7 17. Bc5! where black is miserable and worse, although not lost (yet).

Back to 15...Rf7, this move obviously creates a pin, however this pin is more valuable than it may seem immediately."
