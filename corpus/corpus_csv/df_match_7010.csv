1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

After I waved the white flag on my buddy Steve I found myself entering some conditional moves after finding myself in a K & P ending against a bare king.  Luckily it was Hilary who found himself with the bare king - as he beat me in our first match - I was playing white in that game I was sure chuffed to get my revenge on him!  This, I am sure, will be of some benefit to members of the Coaching Club who may well encounter this type of ending, so maybe some useful guidelines here.  Anyhow, in the early stages of it I found myself on the black side of a Ruy Lopez."
