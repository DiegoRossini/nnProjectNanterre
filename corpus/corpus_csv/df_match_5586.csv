1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"This game is, thus far, my favorite bloody bout playing the Dutch Defense.  I was very pleased with the king-side storm I manufactured, and the tactical mêlée that ensued.  Settle in for a tour of Devil's Den."
2,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,"1. ...d6 is a flexible move against 1. Nf3, and is one of my favorites."
3,g3,g2g3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/8/5NP1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,"Now with 2. d4, which I believe is best after 1. Nf3 d6, I planned on experimenting with 2. ...Bg4!?, The Wade Defense, named after British IM Robert Wade, or 2. ...f5, which will transpose eventually to more standard Leningrad Dutch or Antoshin Dutch lines."
4,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/8/5NP1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"I am always happy to get to play these three pawn moves off the bat against KIA/English setups and claim a healthy and solid share of the center.  I call the d6/e5/f5 formation the ""Dutch Wing"" because it resembles a bird's wingspan, and this is the common ideal pawn structure in the classical Dutch."
5,d3,d2d3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/8/3P1NP1/PPP1PP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"I am always happy to get to play these three pawn moves off the bat against KIA/English setups and claim a healthy and solid share of the center.

7,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/3p4/4pp2/8/3P1NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"White has elected to play the Barcza System, named after Hungarian GM Gideon Barcza.  Basically a King's Indian Defense reversed with a tempo up.  A flexible hypermodern approach, however I'm always comfortable when white gives me a free hand in the center."
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp3pp/3p1n2/4pp2/8/3P1NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,"White has elected to play the Barcza System, named after Hungarian GM Gideon Barcza.

The f-pawn's early push opens up a road for black queen Qd8-e8-h4, where it is well placed for king-side operations in the middlegame, as black's development scheme and pawn structure, ""the Dutch Wing,"" positionally points in that direction."
16,Qe8,d8e8,r1b1qrk1/ppp1b1pp/2np1n2/4pp2/2P5/P1NP1NP1/1P2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 9,"Another thematic Dutch move.

Black usually expends two tempi to reach e5, whereas in this opening, I've gotten it for ""free"" in one."
19,Qb3,d1b3,r1b2rk1/ppp1b1pp/2np1n2/4pp1q/1PP5/PQNP1NP1/4PPBP/R1B2RK1 b - - 2 10,"!? This move anticipates b4, and also ""undevelops"" the knight to actually a very useful square on the back-rank, where it eyes the light-squares at f7 and e6 (and may re-route to them) that the white queen is contesting on the g8=a2 diagonal, and frees up the c-pawn to potentially move."

24,Kh8,g8h8,r1b2r1k/ppp1b1pp/3pnn2/1NP1pp1q/1P6/PQ1P1NP1/4PPBP/R1B2RK1 w - - 1 13,Unpinning the knight and taking the King off the g8-a2 artillery range.  A useful and often necessary prophylactic move in such positions.

Another thematic move in the classical Dutch, gaining more king-side space for an attack, and preparing the ...f4 break anyway.  It helps that I've moved my king on h8, and was able to redevelop my QN via Nc6-d8-e6 to support playing just this move!"

30,f4,f5f4,r1b2r1k/pp2b2p/3pnn2/1N2p1pq/1P3p2/PQ1PPNP1/1B3PBP/R4RK1 w - - 0 16,"As advertised, aiming at breaking up the solid Indian Castle white has built.  Some may ask why I haven't bothered with ...a6 over the last couple of moves, and the reason is that I felt that white's knight was a tad misplaced on b5 with little to do, and actually would be more useful if it was withdrawn to c3, where it could eye the central light squares, and maybe jump to d5 in the future."
31,exf4,e3f4,r1b2r1k/pp2b2p/3pnn2/1N2p1pq/1P3P2/PQ1P1NP1/1B3PBP/R4RK1 b - - 0 16,"The only way white can capture.  Opening up the highway to his king with 16. gxf4 is very bad, since my KR is ready to shift over a square to g8.  He must maintain the structural integrity of his kingside pawns."
