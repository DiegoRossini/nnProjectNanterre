1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,In this game I was playing one of my close friends who was one of the leading 11 year olds in the country. This game had one of the greatest endgames ever. So i opened up with e4 which leads up to the most exciting positions in chess.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,He played c5 which is Sicilian defense. This is the sharpest response to e4 in that it takes control a square in the centre.
3,c3,c2c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,2. c3 This is the Alapin variation. I like this variation b/c it is never dangerous for white and you only get positions which are good for white or positions that are equal but have exciting dynamic tactics. I planned to take control of the centre with d4.
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,2... d5 Takes advantage of c3 because now the knight can't attack the queen with a tempo.
5,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pP4/8/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"e5 gives black a slight advantage after Bf5, so this is the only move."
6,Qxd5,d8d5,rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pq4/8/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,taking control of the centre.
7,d4,d2d4,rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pq4/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,taking control of the centre.
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2pq4/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,This move develops a piece and is waiting for the way that white wants to develop.
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2pq4/3P4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,Developing a piece on a good square that takes control of the centre.
10,e6,e7e6,rnb1kb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pq4/3P4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Also playable is Bg4, but in all variations dxc5 is good for white. e6 while blocking that bishop in lets the dark bishop develop. Also black's light bishop can develop on b7 controlling a powerful diagonal."
11,Bd3,f1d3,rnb1kb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pq4/3P4/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,Developing the bishop to target black's kingside. Also playable is the idea of Be2 and Na3.
12,Be7,f8e7,rnb1k2r/pp2bppp/4pn2/2pq4/3P4/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 7,Preparing to castle quickly.
13,O-O,e1g1,rnb1k2r/pp2bppp/4pn2/2pq4/3P4/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 3 7,Gets the king out of the centre and brings the rook into the game.
14,O-O,e8g8,rnb2rk1/pp2bppp/4pn2/2pq4/3P4/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 4 8,same idea that white has.
15,Be3,c1e3,rnb2rk1/pp2bppp/4pn2/2pq4/3P4/2PBBN2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b - - 5 8,"The way black played is annoying b/c I lost a tempo. usually people will play cxd4 early and my dark bishop will go to g5 immediately. At this tourney, I didn't consider the Be2 and Na3 variations."
16,cxd4,c5d4,rnb2rk1/pp2bppp/4pn2/3q4/3p4/2PBBN2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - - 0 9,This defends against the tactic dxc5 bxc5 Bxh7  Kxh7 Qxd5 Nxd5 Bxc5 which would win a pawn.
17,cxd4,c3d4,rnb2rk1/pp2bppp/4pn2/3q4/3P4/3BBN2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b - - 0 9,"This makes room for Nc3. The isolated d-pawn is double edged because it is an endgame weakness in most cases, but in the middle game it controls key squares like c5 and e5."
18,Nc6,b8c6,r1b2rk1/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/3q4/3P4/3BBN2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - - 1 10,Nc6 develops his knight on a centre-controlling square. He is eying my isolated d-pawn now.
19,Nc3,b1c3,r1b2rk1/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/3q4/3P4/2NBBN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 2 10,Attacks the queen and develops with a tempo.
20,Qd8,d5d8,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/8/3P4/2NBBN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 3 11,Gets the queen out of the attack. Personally I prefer Qd6 in this position.
21,a3,a2a3,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/8/3P4/P1NBBN2/1P3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 11,a3 prevents the idea black has of playing Nb4 and then Nbd5 which would be a strong post and an equalized position. a3 is the only chance for an advantage.
