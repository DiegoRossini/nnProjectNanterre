1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,In OTB chess I haven't yet adopted my Gameknot policy of abandoning the KP openings against stronger players.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The Ruy Lopez, or Spanish Opening, the second opening I ever learnt after the Giuoco Piano."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"The Ruy Lopez, or Spanish Opening, the second opening I ever learnt after the Giuoco Piano."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"The Ruy Lopez, or Spanish Opening, the second opening I ever learnt after the Giuoco Piano."
5,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,"The Ruy Lopez, or Spanish Opening, the second opening I ever learnt after the Giuoco Piano."
6,a6,a7a6,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,"The main alternative is the Spanish Exchange, whereby White takes on c6, giving up his powerful Bishop to give Black doubled pawns.  The game develops very differently."
7,Ba4,b5a4,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"The main alternative is the Spanish Exchange, whereby White takes on c6, giving up his powerful Bishop to give Black doubled pawns.  The game develops very differently."
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,The Orthodox Defence
9,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 3 5,"in which White allows Black to capture the e-pawn, if she wants, in return for an open centre and pressure down the open files.  Black normally declines the invitation in the interest of quick development."
10,b5,b7b5,r1bqkb1r/2pp1ppp/p1n2n2/1p2p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 6,"The disadvantage of the Spanish from White's point of view is the time wasted fleeing Black's attacks on this Bishop.  The benefit of doing so is the power exercised by the Bishop along the diagonals a2-g8 and/or b1-h7.  This is seen in this game.  By attacking the B so quickly, as in this game, Black gets the opportunity to force a swap off by following up with 6... Na5.  Otherwise this move order tends to transpose to the main line."
11,Bb3,a4b3,r1bqkb1r/2pp1ppp/p1n2n2/1p2p3/4P3/1B3N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 6,"Interesting!  As explained, I was expecting 6...Na5, but Black sticks to opening principles, avoiding moving a piece twice, instead developing her QB on the long diagonal, threatening not only to attack my B but also the e-pawn at the same time.  Looking this up in my old book on the Spanish by Alexei Suetin, I find that this is the Archangel Variation, or a modern version of the M�ller system.  I don't remember ever meeting this before."
12,Bb7,c8b7,r2qkb1r/1bpp1ppp/p1n2n2/1p2p3/4P3/1B3N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 7,"Interesting!

13,d3,d2d3,r2qkb1r/1bpp1ppp/p1n2n2/1p2p3/4P3/1B1P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,"I opt for a cautious approach, defending the e-pawn with my d-pawn, since I fear that Heather's tactical ability will over-power me if I adopt a sharper variation.  The only alternative I seriously considered was 7. c3, providing a hole for my B, but I wasn't confident that I could cope with the tactical possibilities after 7...Na5 8. Bc2 Nxe4 9. Re1 d5, for example.  Suetin also considers 7. d4, 7. Nc3 and 7. Re1, which all look weak to me but White probably has hidden resources."
14,Bd6,f8d6,r2qk2r/1bpp1ppp/p1nb1n2/1p2p3/4P3/1B1P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 8,"? Shocking!  I've never seen such a bad opening move from such a good player.  Unsurprisingly this does not feature in Suetin's book.  I could only conclude that she was trying to encourage me to ""teach her a lesson"" and overstretch myself or that she planned 8 c3 Na5 9. Bc2 c5 and 10... Bc7.  The B belongs on e7, not blocking in the d-pawn, but protecting the Nf6 from being pinned against his Q."
15,c3,c2c3,r2qk2r/1bpp1ppp/p1nb1n2/1p2p3/4P3/1BPP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,Resuming proper opening principles rather than following the plan I'd envisaged.
16,O-O,e8g8,r2q1rk1/1bpp1ppp/p1nb1n2/1p2p3/4P3/1BPP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 1 9,Resuming proper opening principles rather than following the plan I'd envisaged.
17,Bg5,c1g5,r2q1rk1/1bpp1ppp/p1nb1n2/1p2p1B1/4P3/1BPP1N2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b - - 2 9,"Normally, with the Black B on e7, this B stays at home while the QN goes on a tour of the back ranks before emerging on e3 or g3 and then going to d5 or f5.  But in this position, I'd defended e4 with d3 rather than Re1, so I wasn't yet ready for that tour.  Furthermore, the Black B was out of position, so I decided to exploit that with this move."
18,h6,h7h6,r2q1rk1/1bpp1pp1/p1nb1n1p/1p2p1B1/4P3/1BPP1N2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - - 0 10,"Naturally, Black chases him away"
19,Bh4,g5h4,r2q1rk1/1bpp1pp1/p1nb1n1p/1p2p3/4P2B/1BPP1N2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b - - 1 10,"I don't want to free Black's position by giving up the Bishop pair, swapping my good B for her N, allowing her to develop her Q to f6, which would partially justify her 7th move."
20,Re8,f8e8,r2qr1k1/1bpp1pp1/p1nb1n1p/1p2p3/4P2B/1BPP1N2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - - 2 11,"a sensible developing move, which also allows the B to retreat to f8, as it does in the Breyer, where Black also redevelops the QN via b8 to d7.  I seem to remember Spassky using that system against Fischer, unsuccessfully."
21,Nbd2,b1d2,r2qr1k1/1bpp1pp1/p1nb1n1p/1p2p3/4P2B/1BPP1N2/PP1N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 3 11,continuing my development in the most flexible way.
22,Bf8,d6f8,r2qrbk1/1bpp1pp1/p1n2n1p/1p2p3/4P2B/1BPP1N2/PP1N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 4 12,"Now it looks like Black will regain a tempo for her fianchetto by launching her g-pawn to g5, pushing my B back.  If I cooperate with her plan, I'll have a horribly cramped position, so I'm already thinking about taking on g5.  I haven't yet decided whether to sac the N or the B for two pawns though.  Both plans had their attractions with the f-pawn undefended and attacked by my Bb3 and with the potential to make the pin on the black diagonal permanent."
23,Re1,f1e1,r2qrbk1/1bpp1pp1/p1n2n1p/1p2p3/4P2B/1BPP1N2/PP1N1PPP/R2QR1K1 b - - 5 12,"I make space for the QN to continue its tour if necessary, meanwhile reinforcing e4 and preparing to contest the file if it opens up after either ...d5 or d4."
24,g5,g7g5,r2qrbk1/1bpp1p2/p1n2n1p/1p2p1p1/4P2B/1BPP1N2/PP1N1PPP/R2QR1K1 w - - 0 13,as expected
