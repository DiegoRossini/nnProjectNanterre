3,d3,d2d3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"White pushes the d-pawn one square instead of the more normal two squares to d4.
This move has the disadvantage of blocking the light-square bishop.
In my opinion, nothing is gained by not playing the more normal d4 move."

However, I think e5 would have been a stronger move."

However, this move is a mistake. The pawn on e4 is fairly weak, but will take time to re-capture. I think it simply best to for White to have played dxe4"
