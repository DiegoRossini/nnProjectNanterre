1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was my simul game against retured GM Lars Bo Hansen, the former captain of the dutch national team. Of course I didn't have much of a chance, but it was fun and we used hour and a half clocks in 18 games so he had time problems. I was white"
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Too much to ask for Ruy Lopez I suppose. I spent a solid minute and a half before deciding he only did that to set up d5. So I pre-empted it.
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"I wasn't ecstatic about losing my king's pawn this early against a GM, but I didn't see a hugely sucessfull way to decline."

7,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3p4/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"To develope pieces, prevent a check (giving him extra initiative), and support that d pawn I thought that Nf3 would be best. I still wonder on the best possible move."

I'm not sure if h3 gives me a distinct weakness (I'm not used to playing against players who can exploiut that crazy type of stuff) so I wait and see how he responds to pressure. LAst thing I want to do is play defense against a 2600+.
12,Bg4,c8g4,r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/1B1p4/3P2b1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 5 7,While he returns favor...

I wanted to take that knight (because knight tactics always get me and he can probably come up with some insane ones) and I wanted to exchange that g5 bishop, but not for the expense of having that f3 knight overloaded with him pinning my queen. I move the queen so I can cover both of my knights. Again, I still wish I knew the best move here."

I think for a while about whether that queenside gap on his side would serve me best on the b or c collumn. Ultimately, this move helped undue me, so looking back I put a ? beside it on my score card. But I decided that a gap on the b collumn would leave an isolated pawn he would have to work to defend."

I knew that castling queenside would lead to a lot of problems but I also don't want to be down material in this game. So I castled queenside even though I thouht I would do better on the other side.

Maybe my second worst move of the game (the worst coming later.) A friend of mine watched me make the movie and actually luaghed out loud... On my score sheet I listed it as Kb1??????? Not only does this not help defend, it sets me up to suffer all kinds of crazy tactics without much of an escape route."
