1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Going into this game, I didn't know what to expect from white.  Looking at white's (short) game history, he looked like a ~1300 player, but it's hard to tell with the opponents he was playing."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I did my usual king's pawn response.
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,White plunges into main line Sicilian.
4,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3pP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"To me, this is a weak move, but a lot of folks seem to like it.  I prefer c3."
5,Qxd4,d1d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"To me, this is a weak move, but a lot of folks seem to like it.  I prefer c3."
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 1 4,Chase the queen a little.
7,Qe3,d4e3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/4P3/4Q3/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 2 4,"Good place to hide the queen, except for the king/rook/queen fork it creates on c2."
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/4P3/4Q3/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 3 5,"I though long and hard about this move.  I was *really* tempted to play either Nb4 or Qa5  in an attempt to get that king/queen fork, but in the end I decided that any strategy that relies on my opponent making a mistake is a bad strategy.  Instead, I cautiously fall back into king's indian.  I lead with the knight instead of the queen's pawn because e5 is met with Ng4, costing white the pawn."
9,b3,b2b3,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/4P3/1P2Q3/P1P2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 0 5,White prepares to fianchetto the dark bishop.
10,d5,d7d5,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/3p4/4P3/1P2Q3/P1P2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"I had origianlly intended to play d6, but I had been expecting more direct pressure from white.  Since white's last move was non-aggressive, it left me some room to play.  I decided to challenge white for the center."
11,e5,e4e5,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/3pP3/8/1P2Q3/P1P2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 0 6,"Another weak move.  As I noted before, it loses the pawn to Ng4."
12,Ng4,f6g4,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2n5/3pP3/6n1/1P2Q3/P1P2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 1 7,"After 7. Qe2 Nxe5, I'm left in control of the center.  White is also left with his queen in front of his king on a half open file..."
13,Qe2,e3e2,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2n5/3pP3/6n1/1P6/P1P1QPPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 2 7,"Another weak move.  Not only is it not a pin, but it's reversible."
14,Ngxe5,g4e5,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2n5/3pn3/8/1P6/P1P1QPPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 0 8,"Another weak move.  Not only is it not a pin, but it's reversible."
15,Bf4,c1f4,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2n5/3pn3/5B2/1P6/P1P1QPPP/RN2KBNR b KQkq - 1 8,"Another weak move.  Not only is it not a pin, but it's reversible."
16,Ng6,e5g6,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2n3n1/3p4/5B2/1P6/P1P1QPPP/RN2KBNR w KQkq - 2 9,"Now the white bishop is in jeopardy, my knight's of out reach of a pin, and I'm lined up for e5.  I did screw up the king's indian, but I had already strayed from that path when I saw that I could take the center."
17,g3,g2g3,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2n3n1/3p4/5B2/1P4P1/P1P1QP1P/RN2KBNR b KQkq - 0 9,Predictable.  Again white prepared to fianchetto the bishop.
18,e5,e7e5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n3n1/3pp3/5B2/1P4P1/P1P1QP1P/RN2KBNR w KQkq - 0 10,"I now own the center, and the bishop is forced to flee.  Time to look towards castling."
19,Bd2,f4d2,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n3n1/3pp3/8/1P4P1/P1PBQP1P/RN2KBNR b KQkq - 1 10,White retreats to a defensive stance.

21,Qd1,e2d1,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/6n1/3pp3/3n4/1P4P1/P1PB1P1P/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 3 11,White falls back and protects c2.
22,Bf5,c8f5,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/6n1/3ppb2/3n4/1P4P1/P1PB1P1P/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 4 12,I bring additional pressure to the c2 square.  Play should continue 12. Bd3 e4 13. Be2 e3 14. fxe3 Nxc2  15. Kf2 Nxa1
23,Nf3,g1f3,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/6n1/3ppb2/3n4/1P3NP1/P1PB1P1P/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 5 12,"However, white failed to see the danger."
