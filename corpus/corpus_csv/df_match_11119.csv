1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Tried and true e4.  Usually leads to a game with faster lines.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"A common counter, e5."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Nf3 attacks e5 and develops a piece.
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,d6 protects the e4 pawn.  I have never been very successful with this approach as it hinders the black squared bishop early in the game before it is decided where he will best fit.
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,d4 attacks e5 a second time and is protected by the knight or queen.  Thus stengthening central control.
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,Nf6 develops a piece and attacks the e4 pawn.
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,Nc3 develops a piece and protects the e4 pawns.
8,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/3PP1b1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 3 5,Bg4 pins the f3 knight and develops a piece.
9,dxe5,d4e5,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4P3/4P1b1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,dxe5 forks the f6 knight and d6 pawn (most do not really call this a fork).
10,Bxf3,g4f3,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4P3/4P3/2N2b2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,Bxf3 forces either gxf3 or Qxf3 to keep material somewhat balanced.  Both will weaken white's position.  Qxf3 would reduce the pressure on the d6 pawn and gxf3 doubles pawns.
11,gxf3,g2f3,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4P3/4P3/2N2P2/PPP2P1P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,gxf3. I decided the pressure on the d6 pawn was too much to give up at this point in the game.  Unfortunately I am sitting with 2 doubled pawns now.
12,Nc6,b8c6,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4P3/4P3/2N2P2/PPP2P1P/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,Nc6? develops a piece and attacks e5... Hangs f6 Knight.
13,exf6,e5f6,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1P2/8/4P3/2N2P2/PPP2P1P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,exf6 white is ahead in material but his position overall is weak.  Tripled pawns but I expect he will help me out with that on his move and for the material advantage gained I will take it
14,Qxf6,d8f6,r3kb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1q2/8/4P3/2N2P2/PPP2P1P/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,Qxf6.  Takes my pawn and makes way for a queenside castle.
15,Bb5,f1b5,r3kb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1q2/1B6/4P3/2N2P2/PPP2P1P/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 8,Bb5 pins the knight.  Makes way for the kingside castle even though that would really weaken every part of my game obviously.
16,Be7,f8e7,r3k2r/ppp1bppp/2np1q2/1B6/4P3/2N2P2/PPP2P1P/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 9,Be7?  Clears way for a kingside castle
17,Nd5,c3d5,r3k2r/ppp1bppp/2np1q2/1B1N4/4P3/5P2/PPP2P1P/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 9,"Nd5  Forks queen, bishop and pawn.  Black cannot stop the King and Rook from being forked without losing the Queen."
18,Qe6,f6e6,r3k2r/ppp1bppp/2npq3/1B1N4/4P3/5P2/PPP2P1P/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 4 10,Qe6?  However I totally did not expect this move.
19,Nxc7+,d5c7,r3k2r/ppN1bppp/2npq3/1B6/4P3/5P2/PPP2P1P/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 10,Nxc7  A Royal fork.
20,Kd7,e8d7,r6r/ppNkbppp/2npq3/1B6/4P3/5P2/PPP2P1P/R1BQK2R w KQ - 1 11,Kd7 Moves King out of check and attacks the knight
