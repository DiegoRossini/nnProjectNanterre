1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This is a King's pawn opening that quickly got out of anything with which I'm familiar. I dropped a pawn early but gained some initiative which allowed me to get a winning position.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I'm not familiar with 3.d3
3,d3,d2d3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,I'm not familiar with 3.d3
4,Bc5,f8c5,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,My thinking was to develop
5,Be2,f1e2,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/4P3/3P4/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 3,3. Be2 again is unfamiliar to me. I'm guessing setting up a castle but the light squared bishop is blocked. I would guess 3. g3 setting up a fianchetto might be better
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/4P3/3P4/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 3 4,More pressure on the d4 square
7,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/4P3/3P1N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 4 4,Here I'm so excited to place my knight in a good square and attack the Bishop that I complete overlook my hanging pawn
8,Nd4,c6d4,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/3nP3/3P1N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 5 5,Here I'm so excited to place my knight in a good square and attack the Bishop that I complete overlook my hanging pawn
9,Nxe5,f3e5,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1N3/3nP3/3P4/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,I lose my most active piece here but do exchange a knight for a bishop
10,Nxe2,d4e2,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1N3/4P3/3P4/PPP1nPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,I lose my most active piece here but do exchange a knight for a bishop
11,Qxe2,d1e2,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1N3/4P3/3P4/PPP1QPPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 6,This doesn't really protect the knight and I thought 7. Bg5 pinning my knight might be better
12,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/2b1N3/4P3/3P4/PPP1QPPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 1 7,This doesn't really protect the knight and I thought 7. Bg5 pinning my knight might be better
13,Bf4,c1f4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/2b1N3/4PB2/3P4/PPP1QPPP/RN2K2R b KQkq - 2 7,This doesn't really protect the knight and I thought 7. Bg5 pinning my knight might be better
14,d6,d7d6,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/2b1N3/4PB2/3P4/PPP1QPPP/RN2K2R w KQkq - 0 8,Chasing off the well placed knight
15,Nc4,e5c4,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/2b5/2N1PB2/3P4/PPP1QPPP/RN2K2R b KQkq - 1 8,I lost the pawn but did put the queen into a bad position so I thought pushing her around was a good strategy.
16,Bg4,c8g4,r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/2b5/2N1PBb1/3P4/PPP1QPPP/RN2K2R w KQkq - 2 9,I lost the pawn but did put the queen into a bad position so I thought pushing her around was a good strategy.
17,Qd2,e2d2,r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/2b5/2N1PBb1/3P4/PPPQ1PPP/RN2K2R b KQkq - 3 9,9. f3 weakens the king side castle but I thought kept initiative for white
18,O-O,e8g8,r2q1rk1/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/2b5/2N1PBb1/3P4/PPPQ1PPP/RN2K2R w KQ - 4 10,I wanted to keep the knight off the b5 square

23,d5,d4d5,r2q1rk1/1pp2ppp/p2p1n2/3P4/1bN1PBb1/2N5/PPPQ1PPP/R3K2R b KQ - 0 12,I think not realizing 12. Nxe4 Nxe4 13. Bxd2 loses the queen
24,Nxe4,f6e4,r2q1rk1/1pp2ppp/p2p4/3P4/1bN1nBb1/2N5/PPPQ1PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 13,Setting up the discovered pin of the queen. White cannot capture 14. Nxe4 because the king is pinned by the dark squared bishop. A castle earlier in the game would have prevented this line.

28,Nxc3,e4c3,r2qr1k1/1pp2ppp/p2p4/3P4/1bN2Bb1/2n1QP2/PPP3PP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 15,Pins the queen

30,Qxe8+,d8e8,r3q1k1/1pp2ppp/p2p4/3P4/1bN2Bb1/2n2P2/PPP3PP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 16,I think better is 16. Kf2 to alleviate the problem that occurs in the game continuation
