Qg6+ is the obvious move follwing gxh3, which allows him to harrass my king. But I couldn't see how this led to mate. Ignoring the sacrifice didn't seem an entertaining option either, g3 didn't look like it would bring me far after the queen swung by kingside. Freddy's comment after telling him that I couldn't see how the sarifice would lead to mate? ""watch and learn"""
