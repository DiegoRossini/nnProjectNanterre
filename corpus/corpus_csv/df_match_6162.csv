11,Nf3,g1f3,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPPP2/2N2N2/PP4PP/R1BQKB1R b KQ - 2 6,Thus early in the MT I stayed with the standard lines.
12,Bg4,c8g4,rn1q1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPPPb1/2N2N2/PP4PP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 3 7,"A tempting idea, and this square features a great deal in Black's thinking in this opening, but here it is probably premature.  White's centre remains unattacked."
13,Be2,f1e2,rn1q1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPPPb1/2N2N2/PP2B1PP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 4 7,"The obvious reply, but not the only.  Also possible was 7.Be3, taking advantage of the bishop's occupation of g4, prohibiting the knight from striking at the freshly developed prelate.  Also coming into consideration was 7.d5 - a thematic expansion in the centre."
14,e6,e7e6,rn1q1rk1/ppp2pbp/3ppnp1/8/2PPPPb1/2N2N2/PP2B1PP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 8,"Now, 7.c5 was still good..."
15,O-O,e1g1,rn1q1rk1/ppp2pbp/3ppnp1/8/2PPPPb1/2N2N2/PP2B1PP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 8,... and here 8.e5 was certainly worth a look.
16,Bxf3,g4f3,rn1q1rk1/ppp2pbp/3ppnp1/8/2PPPP2/2N2b2/PP2B1PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 9,Possibly second-guessing that White might play h2-h3.  But he could have waited for the hit before making this capture.  8....Nc6 was called for.
17,Bxf3,e2f3,rn1q1rk1/ppp2pbp/3ppnp1/8/2PPPP2/2N2B2/PP4PP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 9,"The 'natural' recapture, yet 9.Rxf3 deserved a closer look perhaps, possibly with a view to doubling rooks on the f-file."
18,c6,c7c6,rn1q1rk1/pp3pbp/2pppnp1/8/2PPPP2/2N2B2/PP4PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 10,"White was threatening 10.e5, attacking the knight and unmasking the f3-bishop's line to b7..."

27,Nb5,c3b5,rn3rk1/p1qn1pbp/1pp1p1p1/1N2P3/2PP4/4BB2/PP2Q1PP/R4RK1 b - - 3 14,Exploiting the pin on the line white diagonal to bring the knight to d6.

36,Rfb8,f8b8,rr4k1/p1qnBpb1/nppNp1pp/4P3/2PP4/5B2/PP2Q1PP/2R2RK1 w - - 2 19,"(?) He missed it!  Well, it wasn't that easy to see when you're under pressure from an opponent whose rating is 500 point north of your own.  Black thought he had to save the rook.  But with 18...Nxe5!! Black would have repulsed White's attack: 19.Bxf8?! Nxf3+ 20.Rxf3 Rxf8 21.Ne4 Bxd5+ and with two pawns for the exchange (B and 2P vs R) Black looks pretty good.  Or 19.dxe5 Qxe7 20.Bxc6 Rad8 21.Bb5!? Nc7 and Black has consolidated, with material level."
