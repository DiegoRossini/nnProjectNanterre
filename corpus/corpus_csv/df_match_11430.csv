I think this game goes to prove the point that pawn grabbing just for the sake of pawn grabbing is an affliction that can affect all of us - from patzers like me to World Champions like Lasker. I'm reminded of the phrase ""If it looks too good to be true then it usually is."" Lasker learned that concept the hard way in this game as his voracious appetite for pawns cost him dearly. I hope you enjoyed it:) - Thomas"
