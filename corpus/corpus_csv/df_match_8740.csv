2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Pawn to pawn. This is how men begin a fight!
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Second game starts exactly like the first. This probably would have turned into an...Italian opening? I think somebody called it that. Just like the Ruey Lopez save white's move three only goes as far as Bc4.
