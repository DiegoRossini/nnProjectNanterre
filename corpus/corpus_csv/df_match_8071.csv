In Master Freddy's annotation tournament I now have 4 points out of 7 games and have chalked up my third win.  I take the black side of this Sicilian Grand Prix Mini Tournament.  I get into my usual bind in the middle game but somehow get out of it into a won endgame.  Anyhow.  Let's start the action on move 8 where I play Kc6."
