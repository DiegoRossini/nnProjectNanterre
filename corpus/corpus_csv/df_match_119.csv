1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Queen pawn opening. A bit interesting, I suppose. Normally I see e4, but this is equally good."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,To stop e4.
3,d5,d4d5,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/3P4/8/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Feeling a bit under pressure. I've never had a game where the queen pawn went so far forward.

5,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/3P4/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"Constrained. White is able to move his pieces around quite easily, but I am now unable to develop my bishops and knights where I want them. Would there have been a better move than d6 to allow that?"
6,d6,d7d6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3ppn2/3P4/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Constrained. White is able to move his pieces around quite easily, but I am now unable to develop my bishops and knights where I want them. Would there have been a better move than d6 to allow that?"
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3ppn2/3P4/2P5/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,I don't want that knight coming down to b5. I'm constrained enough as it is.
8,a6,a7a6,rnbqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p2ppn2/3P4/2P5/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,I don't want that knight coming down to b5. I'm constrained enough as it is.

20,O-O,e8g8,rn1q1rk1/1p1bbppp/p1pp4/3Pp3/P1P1P1n1/2N2N2/1P1BBPPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 1 11,"Blunder on my end. Failed to notice that b7 was unguarded, and that White's queen was sitting pretty on b3, ready to take both a pawn and a rook."

24,Qc8,e8c8,rnq2rk1/1Q1bbppp/p1pp4/3Pp3/P1P1P1n1/2N2N2/1P1BBPPP/R3K2R w KQ - 1 13,"I think I did this hoping he'd go for a trade. However, this move is incredibly important because of what it does to White's queen if it happens to take the rook: its escape route will be cut off (a6 will be guarded by the queen)."
25,Qxa8,b7a8,Qnq2rk1/3bbppp/p1pp4/3Pp3/P1P1P1n1/2N2N2/1P1BBPPP/R3K2R b KQ - 0 13,Traps the queen in!
