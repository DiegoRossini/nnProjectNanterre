1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This not actually my first Stonewall Attack game, but my second. The first one being played so poorly that it did not even resemble a SW game after just a few moves. This one looks like a SW game but I blunder early on and never recovered from the mistake. My opponent usually wins our games and I am on a bit of a losing streak lately (having a bad cold and sort of burned out with chess both)so I am not surprised I give up the game after 23 moves. But the game was instructional for me."
