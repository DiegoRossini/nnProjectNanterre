I thought I could play h3 followed by e5 and kick the Knight to bad position and later use e4 my other Knight. the problem is that I did not think the fact that when i play e5 I leave the d5 square for his knight. Thus i regretted this move already in a second.

I could simply exchange on d4 and maybe later play  b3 and somehow Bb2 followed by Rc1. That would be devastating. Bishop would be too strong on diagonal and Rook on c1 would be extremely well placed. But i didnt bother thinking about that strategy, it is the bad side of playing 5 min chess on the net. So i followed the previous strategy: play c4 followed by e5, then his knight has no good squares and my knight has e4."
