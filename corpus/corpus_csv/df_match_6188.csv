1,b4,b2b4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/1P6/8/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"!? There's a book out with the amusing title ""Play 1. b4!: Shock your opponents with the Sokolsky"". I have to admit, it personally never failed to shock me so far, because it is so unusual! White doesn't occupy the center, but plans to do that indirectly with the dark-squared bishop which will be placed on the long diagonal soon. Another opening following that strategy, which is probably more calm (because the pawn isn't placed on Black's dark-squared bishop diagonal immediately) is 1. b3 -- this is called the ""Nimzowich/Larsen Attack""."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/1P6/8/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Alright, immediately attacking the pawn and occupying the center!"
3,Bb2,c1b2,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/1P6/8/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"With the queen-side fianchetto bishop, a counter-attack on my pawn is started."
4,Bxb4,f8b4,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/1b6/8/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"I decide to exchange my central pawn to White's non-central queen-side pawn, an action which increases the opponents impact on the center. But for that, I enjoy a gain of development. Another very interesting option, which maintains central control and has been played frequently by grandmasters, would have been 2... f6."
5,Bxe5,b2e5,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/4B3/1b6/8/P1PPPPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,Performs the indirect pawn exchange and threatens to take on g7 as a little bonus.
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4B3/1b6/8/P1PPPPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"Defends g7, develops the knight and prepares to castle king-side. The other option, namely 3... f6?!, looks dubious to me."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4B3/1b6/5N2/P1PPPPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,Simple development.
8,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/5n2/4B3/1b6/5N2/P1PPPPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQ - 3 5,"King-side is fully developed now, the next few moves have to focus on the movement of the queen-side pieces which have been quite lazy till now."
9,e3,e2e3,rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/5n2/4B3/1b6/4PN2/P1PP1PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQ - 0 5,Letting out the other bishop as well.
10,Nc6,b8c6,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4B3/1b6/4PN2/P1PP1PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQ - 1 6,"Developing with a gain of tempo. If White doesn't want me to possess the pair of bishops (and thus the minor imbalances), he has to move his attacked dark-squared bishop..."
11,Bb2,e5b2,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/1b6/4PN2/PBPP1PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQ - 2 6,... which he does of course.
12,d5,d7d5,r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3p4/1b6/4PN2/PBPP1PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQ - 0 7,"Time for gaining some central control with my d-pawn. In earlier games I preferred to play d6 instead of the last knight move to banish the opponents bishop, but I figured out it would be better to perform a double-step with the pawn because it increases central control and -- for me personally more important, because that often has been a problem! -- it enables my bishop to retire to d6 or e7, in case it is attacked or wants to aim for the king-side."
13,Be2,f1e2,r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3p4/1b6/4PN2/PBPPBPPP/RN1QK2R b KQ - 1 7,Calm development which prepares king-side castling.
14,Bg4,c8g4,r2q1rk1/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3p4/1b4b1/4PN2/PBPPBPPP/RN1QK2R w KQ - 2 8,"I'm not sure whether this can be considered a good move. It looks very active to me and I usually like pinning my opponents knight with the bishop, but in this case it isn't pinned at all; quite the contrary, it could be dangerous for me, because if White's knight moves, my bishop is under attack and he threatens to win material."
15,h3,h2h3,r2q1rk1/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3p4/1b4b1/4PN1P/PBPPBPP1/RN1QK2R b KQ - 0 8,?! This move weakens White's king-side pawn structure and enables a nice attack a few moves later. I guess the opponent should better have castled immediately instead of trying to get rid of my bishop.
16,Bh5,g4h5,r2q1rk1/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3p3b/1b6/4PN1P/PBPPBPP1/RN1QK2R w KQ - 1 9,I prefer keeping on that diagonal.
17,O-O,e1g1,r2q1rk1/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3p3b/1b6/4PN1P/PBPPBPP1/RN1Q1RK1 b - - 2 9,Possessing the half-open e-file.
18,Re8,f8e8,r2qr1k1/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3p3b/1b6/4PN1P/PBPPBPP1/RN1Q1RK1 w - - 3 10,Possessing the half-open e-file.
19,d4,d2d4,r2qr1k1/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3p3b/1b1P4/4PN1P/PBP1BPP1/RN1Q1RK1 b - - 0 10,"Increasing central control, but also limiting the scope of the dark-squared bishop -- following the definition, it is a ""bad bishop"" now."
20,Ne4,f6e4,r2qr1k1/ppp2ppp/2n5/3p3b/1b1Pn3/4PN1P/PBP1BPP1/RN1Q1RK1 w - - 1 11,"The knight has a nice home there for a short time, as it can't be attacked by the d-pawn anymore."
21,Nfd2,f3d2,r2qr1k1/ppp2ppp/2n5/3p3b/1b1Pn3/4P2P/PBPNBPP1/RN1Q1RK1 b - - 2 11,"Of course, White wants to get rid of my knight by attacking it with a knight of his own. Besides of that, my light-squared bishop is under attack, so I have to do something about that."
