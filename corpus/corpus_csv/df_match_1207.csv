1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,So I start with my usual.
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"He invites a Caro-Kann, which would arise if I play 2. e4, and he replies with d5. I am sure he knows more about it than me, so I avoid that!"
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,So I invite a Slav defence with d5
4,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/pp1pp1pp/2p5/5p2/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,But he avoids that and opts for a Dutch Defence.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1pp1pp/2p5/5p2/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,So I develop.
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp1pp1pp/2p2n2/5p2/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,He does the natural developing move too.
7,g3,g2g3,rnbqkb1r/pp1pp1pp/2p2n2/5p2/2PP4/2N3P1/PP2PP1P/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,And me also.
8,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pp1pp2p/2p2np1/5p2/2PP4/2N3P1/PP2PP1P/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"He opts for a Leningrad formation, with his bishop on g7 rather than playing e7-e6 and developing it along the f8-a3 diagonal."
9,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqkb1r/pp1pp2p/2p2np1/5p2/2PP4/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 5,I continue to develop.
10,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/pp1pp1bp/2p2np1/5p2/2PP4/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 2 6,As does he.
11,e4,e2e4,rnbqk2r/pp1pp1bp/2p2np1/5p2/2PPP3/2N3P1/PP3PBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 6,So I grab the centre.
12,fxe4,f5e4,rnbqk2r/pp1pp1bp/2p2np1/8/2PPp3/2N3P1/PP3PBP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 7,He takes.
13,Nxe4,c3e4,rnbqk2r/pp1pp1bp/2p2np1/8/2PPN3/6P1/PP3PBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 7,I take back.
14,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp1pp1bp/2p2np1/8/2PPN3/6P1/PP3PBP/R1BQK1NR w KQ - 1 8,He castles.
15,Ne2,g1e2,rnbq1rk1/pp1pp1bp/2p2np1/8/2PPN3/6P1/PP2NPBP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 2 8,I play the natural developing move too. I am planning 0-0 and Ne2-c3 to back up the knight on e4.
16,Nxe4,f6e4,rnbq1rk1/pp1pp1bp/2p3p1/8/2PPn3/6P1/PP2NPBP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 9,So he takes before I can get the knight round.
17,Bxe4,g2e4,rnbq1rk1/pp1pp1bp/2p3p1/8/2PPB3/6P1/PP2NP1P/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 9,"I take back. e4 is a lovely square for one of my minor pieces, but it would be even better to have a knight on this square rather than a bishop."
18,e5,e7e5,rnbq1rk1/pp1p2bp/2p3p1/4p3/2PPB3/6P1/PP2NP1P/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 10,"I am not sure about this move. After my next, the range of his Bg7 is limited, and my minor piece on e4 is unable to be shifted by a pawn."
19,d5,d4d5,rnbq1rk1/pp1p2bp/2p3p1/3Pp3/2P1B3/6P1/PP2NP1P/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 10,So I close up the position.
20,Qb6,d8b6,rnb2rk1/pp1p2bp/1qp3p1/3Pp3/2P1B3/6P1/PP2NP1P/R1BQK2R w KQ - 1 11,"This move surprised me. He has pressure on f2 and b2, but is this move really better than simple development such as d6?"
