1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I've picked this for annotation because I found it quite an intriguing example of how a game can turn on one move - it's not intended a a technical analysis, just my thoughts and observations. The title of it is nothing more than a reflection of the rivalry I share with my mate, Blackbaron. Although Blackbaron and myself average out at similar ratings, he always seems to be significantly ahead of me in games won."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,I always feel there's a certain amount of psychology in our opening play - no two openings in our game history are ever the same.........
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,......this one turns out to be just a standard Queen's pawn opening
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,......this one turns out to be just a standard Queen's pawn opening
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,......this one turns out to be just a standard Queen's pawn opening
6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,......this one turns out to be just a standard Queen's pawn opening
7,c5,c4c5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/2Pp4/3P4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,Keeping things tight for now
8,b6,b7b6,rnbqkb1r/p1p2ppp/1p2pn2/2Pp4/3P4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,Not the expected move from black here. Looks like an attempt to free up the black-diagonal bishop rather than a fiancetto for the white-diagonal bishop.
9,cxb6,c5b6,rnbqkb1r/p1p2ppp/1P2pn2/3p4/3P4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,Accepting the swap starts to make black look weak on the Queenside
10,axb6,a7b6,rnbqkb1r/2p2ppp/1p2pn2/3p4/3P4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,Keeping the bishop's options limited
11,a3,a2a3,rnbqkb1r/2p2ppp/1p2pn2/3p4/3P4/P4N2/1P2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,Keeping the bishop's options limited

17,dxc5,d4c5,rnbq1rk1/5ppp/1p1bpn2/2Pp4/8/P1N1PN2/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQ - 0 9,A bit too negative I now think - Bb5 may have been a better attacking move at this point.
18,bxc5,b6c5,rnbq1rk1/5ppp/3bpn2/2pp4/8/P1N1PN2/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 0 10,A bit too negative I now think - Bb5 may have been a better attacking move at this point.

20,Qc7,d8c7,rnb2rk1/2q2ppp/3bpn2/2pp4/8/P1N1PN2/1P2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 2 11,Lining up a Queen-bishop combo - may mean a kingside castle for me is rather risky
21,h3,h2h3,rnb2rk1/2q2ppp/3bpn2/2pp4/8/P1N1PN1P/1P2BPP1/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 11,Preventing the knight from attacking h2 and f2 - should make castling a bit more comfortable.

31,Qe2,d1e2,5rk1/5ppp/r1nqpn2/2pp4/8/P3PN1P/1P2QPP1/R1B2RK1 b - - 1 16,My past few moves have been nothing more than unsuccessful attempts at chasing away one or two of black's pieces and trying to carve out some kind of opening.......
