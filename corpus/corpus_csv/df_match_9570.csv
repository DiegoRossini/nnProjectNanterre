1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"(game info on previous page) Yep..  Slow and true, the old wood pusher reaches out and plays what he knows.  ""e4 for show, d4 for dough"".  Not true of course, it's about opinion."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I had played the flexible and most common Nf6 which is my usual response to 1. d4 twice against Graham.  It can transpose in many different openings such as King's Indian, Nimzo-Indian, Queen's Gambit and Queen's Indian to name just a few.  The 1st time he slaughtered me with a fantastic combination and the second game I should have won, I had the material advantage, blundered and a draw was agreed.  So I'm going to change it up here with the solid and logical d5, mimicking WT's 1st move, it tends to become quite a closed game and I'm adopting it as my main response from now.  It's yielded me good results."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Queens Gambit, wants to exchange a wing pawn for 1 of my centre pawns to put it simply."
4,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Slav Defence.
5,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2PP4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"I would have chosen a sharper line, but I can't question this move really.  Goes with his solid opening style of minimal surprises possible (may cause the old boy a heart attack ;) and trying to slowly crush his opponents in the middle-game.  His Bishop on c1 has limited movement now however."
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/2PP4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,Transposing into a semi-slav.
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/2PP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 4,Transposing into a semi-slav.

9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,Sensible stuff.
10,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,"Thematic move in most QP variations.  It is better here than on c6 usually as it doesn't obstruct my c-pawn and prepares c5 and e5 advances (and yes, I know I can't put it on c6 anyway)."
11,Be2,f1e2,r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 6,"Bd3 was a more aggressive alternative, but then it becomes slightly vulnerable to a fork on e4, also I can play 6. dxc4 7. Bxc4 and then to get it back on the powerful c1-h7 diagonal he would have to use up 'tempo' and b5 can come with more 'tempo' setting up some Q-Side play.  Still, both moves are pretty standard."
12,Bd6,f8d6,r1bqk2r/pp1n1ppp/2pbpn2/3p4/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 4 7,"Perhaps preparing a future e4 (and a disadvantage of the Bishop on e2, on d3 it would be perfectly placed in accordance with e4).  That QB needs developing soon though either via fianchetto or after e4.  When it eventually does move it is reduced to defensive duties.."
