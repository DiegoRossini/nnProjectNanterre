Usually, the outcome of the game can be an interesting feature of a closed game."
3,d3,d2d3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"2. d3 ;) King Indian Attack against French Defence is nice. Among user of this repertoire including Fischer, Kasparov and many others in their early years. Some say nuisance of playing this move as it not directly motivating on controlling the centre but they need to know, white motive here is to strengthen e4 and to pursue pawns march toward kingside."

I play tactically. But in this game, I try to demonstrate my positional understanding. 9. f4 is simply to gain the space advantage and in case black having to castling kingside, kingside pawns march is nice way of attack."
