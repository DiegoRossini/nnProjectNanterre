1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"(game info on previous page) The usual e4, suits my style and I almost exclusively play it now, just occasionally play d4 to change it up against certain players and I've played The English (c4) just once and The Reti (Nf3) a few times.  
e4 opens lines for both my LSB & Q while taking control of 2 central squares.  On the other hand a small downside is that it's not protected.  
It's important to note for beginners, that there is no 1st move which is strictly 'best' (despite Bobby Fisher's ""e4 best by test"" quote), it's all about what style of player you are (It would be ridiculous for someone like Petrosian to play e4, for instance).  
If you are a more positional player, you may want to go for d4 instead, but it's recommended for beginners to become well versed in the open game, before you may want to move on."
2,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Modern Defence (B06). 
I quite like playing against fianchettos for some reason, I think it's because it gives me a target to attack, or at least the squares around it.  
I knew he would play it, looking through his 'Past Games History' and he's played it against me before.  
I had also got pretty much used to his very 'hyper-modern' style of accepting a 'cramped' opening and allowing me total occupation of the centre, but then trying to strike out later at the inevitable weaknesses that having a 'big' centre entails with long-range pieces such as Bishops and well timed pawn advances such as c5, d5, e5, and f5, whatever the position requires.  
I however as a mostly 'classical' player was relying on my superior development and piece activity to prove telling.  
I also was also quite sure that he was going to fianchetto both bishops down the a1-h8 and h1-a8 diagonals and try to bring both Knights to e7 and d7, after e6 and d6, which I think is called the Hippo or elephant system, something crazy anyway..  However slow, it doesn't lack subtlety and may draw someone inexperienced into a premature attack.  I personally think playing like this is a bit passive and predictable, but hey, that's just my opinion.."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"I'll take the centre then if he doesn't want it and try to develop as quickly as possible.  
My rough plan from the start was to hopefully get some play going down the c1-h6 diagonal with a Queen-Bishop battery, Castle Q-Side and try for a K-Side attack, if he castles down that side, that's a bonus, but of course he wouldn't castle straight into my attack.  Even so, with him playing his arguably slow system, I knew his Q-side was going to be hard to unravel for castling, as was the case in the game.  
Of course this was a very rough plan, I'd have to change it if the position required."
4,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"Simple development, clearing Q-side for potential castling and supporting my centre."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 3,"Simple development, clearing Q-side for potential castling and supporting my centre."
6,e6,e7e6,rnbqk1nr/pppp1pbp/4p1p1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"I think d6 or c6 is slightly more common here, this is fine however."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk1nr/pppp1pbp/4p1p1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"More simple development, controlling centre.  Knights before Bishops, unless there's a fairly good reason, blah, blah.."
8,d6,d7d6,rnbqk1nr/ppp2pbp/3pp1p1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Content with his compact, solid, yet passive, hedgehog-type setup.  Trying to create an 'impregnable fortress'.  Here however both my Bishops are 'good' with lots of open lines, while his position is cramped and he is lagging behind in development."
9,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqk1nr/ppp2pbp/3pp1p1/6B1/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"Developing aggressively with tempo, preparing to play next move Qd2 and this also invites h6, which is forced at some stage to unpin Knight and Queen and also my DSB can't be allowed such an influential square to reside.  
I was happy to be driven off of g5 however, as h6 gives me another potential target and of course it can't be supported by g7 because of the fianchetto."
10,Ne7,g8e7,rnbqk2r/ppp1npbp/3pp1p1/6B1/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,"Forced if he wants to go with his plan and I think it was best.  
Another option of course was Nf6, but then it's vulnerable to a later e5 break because of my 'Big' centre and his DSB would not exactly be looking out across a lot of squares.  
Also playing his way perhaps his Knights are best on e7 and d7 rather than their so called 'best' squares f6 and c6, because they can better support timely pawn advances into the centre and against pawns on e4 and d4, Knights on f6 and c6 are vulnerable to attack, by advances from those pawns, as I said.  
f6 would make his DSB very in-active and that would then be 4 pawn moves in his 1st 5 moves, not good!
And allowing the trade of DSBs by Bf6 is not good because that would leave those K-Side dark squares weak."
11,Qd2,d1d2,rnbqk2r/ppp1npbp/3pp1p1/6B1/3PP3/2N2N2/PPPQ1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 3 6,"Threatens a standard maneuver 7. Bh6 (immediately may be slightly premature), forcing the exchange of DSBs and makes K-Side castling risky IMO (with his DSB gone those dark squares around his King become weak)."
12,h6,h7h6,rnbqk2r/ppp1npb1/3pp1pp/6B1/3PP3/2N2N2/PPPQ1PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 7,yep.. Had to be played.
13,Be3,g5e3,rnbqk2r/ppp1npb1/3pp1pp/8/3PP3/2N1BN2/PPPQ1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 1 7,"Not minding retreating down the same diagonal I came and giving back the 'tempo', because now my Q and DSB are both aimed at h6, which stops any ideas all together he may have of K-Side castling.  
Other options were Bh4 which is also good as it maintains the pin and encourages the weakening g5 advance, but breaks some of the pressure on h6.  
Bf4 which is not so good IMO.  It also may draw him into playing g5 (which I knew he was too good to make the mistake of doing anyway), but it can also become a target for a later 'tempo' gaining e5 advance from him.  
What I chose makes my DSB less of an object for attack and strengthens d4, which goes by Nimzowitch's 'over-protection' theory (not that I pretend to have read 'My System', but look to purchase it one day.  Any thoughts on the book anyone??)."
14,b6,b7b6,rnbqk2r/p1p1npb1/1p1pp1pp/8/3PP3/2N1BN2/PPPQ1PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 8,Told you!  Very clear what his plan is here.

I think to play this sort of system he likes, you have to know what you are doing and be confident of your defensive abilities.."
16,Bb7,c8b7,rn1qk2r/pbp1npb1/1p1pp1pp/8/3PP3/2N1BN2/PPPQ1PPP/2KR1B1R w kq - 2 9,"Those Bishops are looking good though, down strong diagonals, putting pressure on my centre.  
His price however is that now he is behind in development and his King is still in the centre.  
If he wants to castle, I do think he needs to slightly change his very regimented plan of bringing his Knight to d7, as that's the only current spot for his Queen.  So he should bring it IMO to c6 instead.  
A disadvantage you can see here of moves such as e7 and d7 played together, is that they can be horribly cramping unless you are careful!"
17,h4,h2h4,rn1qk2r/pbp1npb1/1p1pp1pp/8/3PP2P/2N1BN2/PPPQ1PP1/2KR1B1R b kq - 0 9,"I already have the Knight sac prepared in my mind, and so want to unseat his g pawn to make it possible and over-extend his K-Side pawn structure.  
To stop this he could play h5, but that loses a tempo because of his earlier h6 and creates a backward g-pawn, so my Knight would have a strong outpost on g5."

I would have more than an eye on my threats as well however.."

Answer:  I feel completing development 1st is nearly always best.  This links my Rooks and as I am planning to advance my h-pawn further to h6 and challenge his DSB on g7, if my LSB was still on f1 the threat would be non-existent, because my h-pawn would be pinned to my Rook."
