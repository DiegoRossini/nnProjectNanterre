1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"Reti. I intend on the Fianchetto at this point, but what I like about f3 is there are so many options. I've learned this is probably not a good opening when I'm playing a more advanced player."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 2,Book
3,g3,g2g3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/8/5NP1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,I have had some success against 1300-1400 level players when I Fianchetto and that is still my plan. I prefer flank attacks.
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/8/5NP1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"In hindsight, I think Bg2 may have been better here. I deviated from my initial plan. I'm now a move behind that plan. In addition, my DSB is not happy."
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/5NP1/PPP1PP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"In hindsight, I think Bg2 may have been better here. I deviated from my initial plan. I'm now a move behind that plan. In addition, my DSB is not happy."
6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3P4/5NP1/PPP1PP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"In hindsight, I think Bg2 may have been better here. I deviated from my initial plan. I'm now a move behind that plan. In addition, my DSB is not happy."
7,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3P4/4PNP1/PPP2P1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"In hindsight, I think Bg2 may have been better here. I deviated from my initial plan. I'm now a move behind that plan. In addition, my DSB is not happy."
8,Bd6,f8d6,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/3bpn2/3p4/3P4/4PNP1/PPP2P1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,A little late. I wanted to castle first!
9,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/3bpn2/3p4/3P4/4PNP1/PPP2PBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 5,A little late. I wanted to castle first!
10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/3bpn2/3p4/3P4/4PNP1/PPP2PBP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 3 6,4. e3 is still not that useful. Seems like I wasted a move and I don't think black will forgive.
11,O-O,e1g1,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/3bpn2/3p4/3P4/4PNP1/PPP2PBP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 4 6,4. e3 is still not that useful. Seems like I wasted a move and I don't think black will forgive.
12,c5,c7c5,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/3bpn2/2pp4/3P4/4PNP1/PPP2PBP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 0 7,4. e3 is still not that useful. Seems like I wasted a move and I don't think black will forgive.
13,Nc3,b1c3,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/3bpn2/2pp4/3P4/2N1PNP1/PPP2PBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 7,Developing minor pieces. I would like to advance my knights quickly here since the center seems so complicated.
14,Nc6,b8c6,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2nbpn2/2pp4/3P4/2N1PNP1/PPP2PBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 2 8,"That's ugly. Two pieces unprotected. I think advancing the knight to b5 was premature. I considered Nd6, but that doesn't look very healthy."
15,Nb5,c3b5,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2nbpn2/1Npp4/3P4/4PNP1/PPP2PBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 3 8,"That's ugly. Two pieces unprotected. I think advancing the knight to b5 was premature. I considered Nd6, but that doesn't look very healthy."

18,Nxe5,c6e5,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/4pn2/1Nppn3/3P4/4P1P1/PPP2PBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 10,"That's ugly. Two pieces unprotected. I think advancing the knight to b5 was premature. I considered Nd6, but that doesn't look very healthy."

20,Nd7,f6d7,r1bq1rk1/pp1nbppp/4p3/1NppP3/8/4P1P1/PPP2PBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 11,"Trying to free up my DSB, still paying for that e3 move. I thought black would trade pawns."
21,e4,e3e4,r1bq1rk1/pp1nbppp/4p3/1NppP3/4P3/6P1/PPP2PBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 11,"Trying to free up my DSB, still paying for that e3 move. I thought black would trade pawns."
22,d4,d5d4,r1bq1rk1/pp1nbppp/4p3/1Np1P3/3pP3/6P1/PPP2PBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 12,"Rut Roh, that can't be good."
23,Nd6,b5d6,r1bq1rk1/pp1nbppp/3Np3/2p1P3/3pP3/6P1/PPP2PBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 12,I reconsidered the knight move. I thought I might get a chance to protect the e5 pawn with my DSB. I should've moved f4.
24,Nxe5,d7e5,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/3Np3/2p1n3/3pP3/6P1/PPP2PBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 13,So much for that plan.
25,Nxc8,d6c8,r1Nq1rk1/pp2bppp/4p3/2p1n3/3pP3/6P1/PPP2PBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 13,"I thought a bishop might be worth more than a knight. In hindsight, maybe the other bishop, but black's LSB is not really worth the trade."
26,Rxc8,a8c8,2rq1rk1/pp2bppp/4p3/2p1n3/3pP3/6P1/PPP2PBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 14,"From here, I made so many errors (beyond what I've already made), I've also decided to stop annotating. Good game."
