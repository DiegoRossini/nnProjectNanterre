1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"IN this game, I attack white's bishop, while at the same time threatening his b2 square. The b2 threat was the more dangerous one since taking the bishop would allow him to fork my king and knight to win the piece back. So he moves the bishop and suffers the consequences. Annotation Updated Wednesday, July 21, 2010."

3,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,"White made a knight move to the side of the board, (this is usually a bad move, though there are exceptions). He most likely had the intention of playing Ng5 to attack my f-pawn. Of course the 2nd Knight move, if allowed, would get the piece back in the game. I normally don't like to give my bishop for a knight. This is because knights are the stronger piece in cramped, closed positions, while bishops are stronger in open positions. You have to consider each game individually, but generally, pieces get traded off and closed positions in the opening, become open positions in the middle game and end game. So, although both pieces are technically the same value, the bishops are my piece of choice. Yet in this case the advantage gained far outweighs the loss of a bishop. He must capture toward the outside of the board, deserting crucial central squares. In addition he will have double pawns on the h-file, which will be easy prey in the endgame. Thus my next move, 4. ... Bxh3.

On the other hand, he gets an open g-file. So to prevent any attacks on my king, I planned to castle queen side.

(The advantages mentioned I never capitalized on because after he castled on the queen side, I was able to chase his king back into the middle of the board where I would have mated had he not resigned.)"
