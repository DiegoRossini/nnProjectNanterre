16,Qd6,d8d6,rn2k2r/pp3ppp/1bpqbn2/8/3P4/2P2N2/PP2BPPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 9,"This weird move aims to create a battery after Bc7. I will have to get in Bg4 in order to exchange the N to make it a real threat, and white still has c4.c5 to disrupt it. But my Q will land on d7, with nice ideas of a sac on the white castled king. By provoking c4-c5, black obtains a secure dominion of d5, and this is not all that bad. c4-Bc7-c5-Qd7 would be the sequence. The important thing is with this move I prevent Bc4, while with the alternative option (o-o, Nd7), I allow it."
