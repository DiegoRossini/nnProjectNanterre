13,Qh5,d1h5,rn2kbnr/pp1q1ppp/8/3pp2Q/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 1 7,This is horrible. Black is going to have a huge lead in development and is much better now.
14,e4,e5e4,rn2kbnr/pp1q1ppp/8/3p3Q/4p3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 0 8,"e4 is perhaps inaccurate. Not only because the pawn can be easily liquidated (which isn't too big of a problem as black is so far ahead that the open lines may help), but because after 7 ... Nc6! black gets to develop naturally with ... Nf6 and it isn't too clear how white is going to survive black's lead in development."
