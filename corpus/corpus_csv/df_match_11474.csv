1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Great move played by many great players. (Fischer)
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Although I play a lot of Sicilian, it always hurts my heart to cancel a good-old open game."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,...here preferred to 3.Bb5 - leading to the not so open Spanish game
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,...here preferred to 3.Bb5 - leading to the not so open Spanish game
5,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,...here preferred to 3.Bb5 - leading to the not so open Spanish game
6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,"counter-attacking the central pawn, here preferred to the safer 3...h3, preventing the following ..."
7,Ng5,f3g5,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p1N1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 5 4,with direct attack on the weak f7 pawn.
8,d5,d7d5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3pp1N1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,I like this variation as it is aggressive. Black sacrifices a pawn in attempt to grab the initiative and speed the development of his light pieces.
9,exd5,e4d5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3Pp1N1/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,I like this variation as it is aggressive. Black sacrifices a pawn in attempt to grab the initiative and speed the development of his light pieces.
10,Na5,c6a5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/n2Pp1N1/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 6,I like this variation as it is aggressive. Black sacrifices a pawn in attempt to grab the initiative and speed the development of his light pieces.
11,d3,d2d3,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/n2Pp1N1/2B5/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,not the usual 6.Bb5  but rather building a strong pawn center.
12,h6,h7h6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2pp1/5n1p/n2Pp1N1/2B5/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,the knight  already  means no threat at g5 and appears to be the weakest link in White's positioning of pieces.
13,Nf3,g5f3,r1bqkb1r/ppp2pp1/5n1p/n2Pp3/2B5/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,the essence of the attack. 8.dxe4 is certainly not possible here.
14,e4,e5e4,r1bqkb1r/ppp2pp1/5n1p/n2P4/2B1p3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,the essence of the attack. 8.dxe4 is certainly not possible here.
15,Qe2,d1e2,r1bqkb1r/ppp2pp1/5n1p/n2P4/2B1p3/3P1N2/PPP1QPPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 1 8,White blocks the danger by pinning black's king.
16,Nxc4,a5c4,r1bqkb1r/ppp2pp1/5n1p/3P4/2n1p3/3P1N2/PPP1QPPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 9,"My distant knight on the ""a"" for his white-square bishop looked to me like the best deal in this position."
17,dxc4,d3c4,r1bqkb1r/ppp2pp1/5n1p/3P4/2P1p3/5N2/PPP1QPPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 9,"The development of that bishop has been the greatest dilemma of my exhistance. 9...Bd6 with attack on h2 and blocking the aggressive d pawn also looks solid. Here I considered that king-side castling was the best white could get from his position, where Bc5 would pretty much justify itself."
18,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk2r/ppp2pp1/5n1p/2bP4/2P1p3/5N2/PPP1QPPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 1 10,"The development of that bishop has been the greatest dilemma of my exhistance. 9...Bd6 with attack on h2 and blocking the aggressive d pawn also looks solid. Here I considered that king-side castling was the best white could get from his position, where Bc5 would pretty much justify itself."
19,Nfd2,f3d2,r1bqk2r/ppp2pp1/5n1p/2bP4/2P1p3/8/PPPNQPPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 2 10,"The position here looks as good as even. Black has a more active play as a compensation for the lost pawn. For his undeveloped queen side, white has a double center pawns and chances of counter-play through Nb3 and Nc3."
20,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/ppp2pp1/5n1p/2bP4/2P1p3/8/PPPNQPPP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 3 11,"castling in the opening - whenever possible - is an indisputable rule for me and my opponent here. However, in his case it may not have been the wisest of choices."
21,O-O,e1g1,r1bq1rk1/ppp2pp1/5n1p/2bP4/2P1p3/8/PPPNQPPP/RNB2RK1 b - - 4 11,my opponent certainly didn't like the idea of  rook at e8.
22,Bg4,c8g4,r2q1rk1/ppp2pp1/5n1p/2bP4/2P1p1b1/8/PPPNQPPP/RNB2RK1 w - - 5 12,"strong move, but exclaim would not be proper here as this attack appears natural. The bishop is coming to pick up the fruits of White's blocked position."
23,Qe1,e2e1,r2q1rk1/ppp2pp1/5n1p/2bP4/2P1p1b1/8/PPPN1PPP/RNB1QRK1 b - - 6 12,"not too many options, are there?"
24,Re8,f8e8,r2qr1k1/ppp2pp1/5n1p/2bP4/2P1p1b1/8/PPPN1PPP/RNB1QRK1 w - - 7 13,"securing my strongest weapon - the ""e"" pawn, that pretty much solved the game."
25,Nb3,d2b3,r2qr1k1/ppp2pp1/5n1p/2bP4/2P1p1b1/1N6/PPP2PPP/RNB1QRK1 b - - 8 13,natural move for white unleashing the bishop on c1 and counter attacking queen side.
26,Qd6,d8d6,r3r1k1/ppp2pp1/3q1n1p/2bP4/2P1p1b1/1N6/PPP2PPP/RNB1QRK1 w - - 9 14,"realizing the importance of the diagonal held by my bishop, the fatality of 13...Bb6, and the shame of 13...Bd6/e7"
