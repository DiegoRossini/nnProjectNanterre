1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Here is one long struggle, against a player called Cristiana (aka mantidereligiosa) from Master Skorpio's Group.  Cristiana mounted a very strong middlegame attack against Yours Truly who attracts passivitis like a fly to a leg of ham!  This attack gained two pawns.  I tried to restore the balance a little more in my favour by conceding two rooks and a few pawns and retaining the services of Glenda.  Glenda did her best, but alas, with the formation of the pawns, it was impossible for her to get a draw through Ye Olde Perpetualle and I ended up resigning our game on the grounds of Unavoidable Mate,  So, how did this happen?

Well, read on."

Black must attend to the possibility of a queen check down the Fool's Mate diagonal.  However, a timely knight move to f6 normally addresses this issue."
