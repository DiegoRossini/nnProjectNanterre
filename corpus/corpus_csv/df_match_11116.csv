1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hello,

If you read my other annotation ""Willingness to change tactics..."" then you will recognize this as a sort of continuation on that same theme.  This game embodies a strategy that was brought to my attention through the annotations of andydufresne.  I'm sure that he isn't the first to describe or think of this, but I feel the need to give him props for turning me onto it as it has helped me in many games since.

This game is just one of the more successful examples of turning initial won material into an actual win.

Disclaimer:
There were many irrational moves made on the part of my opponent (and on my part also), which made this win a little easier then it could have been, but that's part of chess isn't it?  Taking advantage of your opponents blunders or lacks in judgement.  So please, no comments about how these tactics would not have worked on someone who knew what they were doing.

Amazingly enough there are people out there that actually know less about chess than I do.  This is mainly for those people who are  at my level or below.  My hope is that due to my stated lack of technical knowhow about the game I might be able to offer some sort of understanding in a language that they can understand if for no other reason that I am working within the same scope of understanding as they are.

This is more of an excercise for me and also it may help someone of equal or lesser skill than I realize something they have never thought of before about chess strategy. Hopefully, it will help me understand mine and my oppents play a little better also. :)"

This seems like a wasted move to me, it puts a hanging pawn out there and doesn't do anything to attack the center squares.  The only possible move I could see following this would be a bishop move.. but he shouldn't have pushed it out so far.   It's as if he confused his 2nd and 3rd pawn move.  The e pawn should have been pushed out 2 spaces, while the b pawn only should have gone out 1, if he was in fact planning a fiancetto."

1) developing another piece and
2)tripling the pressure on the e4 square

Admittedly I didn't really know what was going on at this point, I was just trying to establish a firm hold on the center while my oppenent was giving me free moves."

By moving my pawn here, I protect my Bishop and also open up an oppurtunity to  capture his hanging b pawn with my black squared bishop."

All it took was one wrong move from White and he would be mated with Qxf2.  Alas the game was not to be won so easily (which is good because what fun is an easy win right?) ;)

Also White can not take my Kt without losing his rook:

PxKt
QxRk

Which would put him in a world of hurt."

At this point, I was still entertaining the idea that I might be able to still make some sort of devestating blow to white's defence, and it's very likely that I missed some great replies on my part."

But at this point I was trying to set up an exchange of Queens.  I was willing to trade Queens (or anything) at this point as long as I kept my  1 lead in material, however with this move I was hoping to set up a situation whereby I might actually gain additional material over white.


My basic plan was this:

..p a6  planning...
..Kt c6
..p e5

The p a6 is a protective measure for my Kt move.  while white's hanging b Pawn is a weakness for him right now, if I move my Kt to c6 he could move his pawn to b5 ruining all my plans.

the Kt c6 is move is designed to put coverage on the e5 square (to protect my future pawn move)

The pawn is then moved to e5 in order to initate more piece exchanging, while the current move you're looking at continues to provide protection for my bishop.

Additionaly I was thinking that with everything else it accomplished, moving my Kt would give me the ability to 0-0-0."

Now I'm up  2 in material, but my bishop and Queen are under attack.  Perhaps the old me would have moved my Queen to e7 in order to retake the pawn and put white in check again.  

However, thanks to Andy I was now thinking of other things besides saving material or putting my opponent in check."

This is a sort of strange tactic for me, and probably for a lot of you watching because now I have put 3 pieces in danger!  Am I crazy!?

I don't think so.

Keep in mind that White is still one move away from being mated.  With this move, I continue to postpone his plans to take my Queen unless he would like to trade Queens, which most players that I play (read: of my ranking) are unwilling to do unless they have no other choice.

I'm remember White's first few moves and so it's not a far stretch to assume that maybe he will take the bait and recapture with his Queen, allowing me to checkmate.  

His only other options are to take my Queen with his Knight allowing me to take his Q with my bishop.. he would take back with his King (regaining his bishop and I would still be up my 2 points in material.  This move also put his b1 Kt in danger of being captured, which would allow me to gain a Bishop and a Knight for the price of 1 bishop.  Not a bad deal eh?

His only other viable option would be to move to d2.."

I chose this square to move to only after some debate.

I still had a pretty good control over e4 and I decided my best plan of action was to try and secure some kind of control over the other diagnal.  At the moment I'm not able to wrest control of the longest black diagnal (a1-h8), but the h1-b3 was free so I opted for that one.

I had some plans here that involved p f6, but I don't remember what point that served.. my apologies."
