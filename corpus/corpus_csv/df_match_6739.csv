41,Bxh6,e3h6,r5qr/pQ6/1ppbk2B/2p1p3/2P1P1pp/2NP3P/PP3P2/R4RK1 b - - 0 21,"I liked the game up until 21, with the exception of White bringing out his Queen to early and leaving his King defenceless.  But then Black blundered.  Now Black did end up winning the game, (in 55 moves) but he could have ended it in 22 or 23 moves.  Right now!  Instead he follows White's tune and goes along with the exchange. 

Figure it out?  The Black Queen has the White King on the same file with only a Pawn in between.  If he moves the Pawn out of the way, the King will be in check.  The Bishop can jump in between, but White has nothing protecting g5, so the Queen could take that and again call check,  The White King only has 2 possible moves.

Pawn takes Pawn  - check.
White's King can only move to h1 or h2
Queen to g2 is mate"
