1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hello and welcome to part two of this ongoing team match! Now I have the White pieces, and I've abandoned my current infatuation with wing openings (English, Larsen, etc) in favor of the old standby, 1.e4! I was hoping to get some practice with the Sicilian, and my opponent very kindly gave it to me. The game that followed was about as wild as one might expect from this opening. Enjoy!"
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The Sicilian, also known as ""That Intimidating Opening With Uncountable Thousands of Pages of Grandmaster Analysis Devoted To It"". I'm going to go quickly through the first several moves, as there's no shortage of literature on it, by much better players than I."

This is still all very standard: the big question for White is now which square--f2, g3, or h4--is best for his Queen. For Black, the question is just how to avoid creating any weaknesses for White to attack."

21,Ne5,f3e5,r1b2rk1/2q1ppbp/ppp2np1/2p1N3/4PP2/2NPB3/PPP3PP/R3QRK1 b - - 1 11,"This is sort of an empty attack, since the c-pawn is defended, but the intention is really just to see what Black will do about this advanced Knight. Chess is as much a psychological game as anything else, and this Knight advance helps to reveal Black's mindset: is he willing to let the Knight stay? Will he just push back directly on the queenside?"
22,Nd7,f6d7,r1b2rk1/2qnppbp/ppp3p1/2p1N3/4PP2/2NPB3/PPP3PP/R3QRK1 w - - 2 12,"Black wants the e5 Knight gone, and I don't blame him. White still gets something out of this, though: he's removed one of the Black King's defenders."

27,Rb1,a1b1,r4rk1/2qbppbp/1pp3p1/p1p5/P3PP2/2NPB3/1PP3PP/1R2QRK1 b - - 1 14,"Getting off the long diagonal and supporting the b-pawn. A quiet, but necessary step before the Nc3 can leave its post. This also has the advantage of looking aggressive (and indeed, it could become aggressive!), which may cause Black to commit more to the queenside than he needs to. The computer evaluates the position as dead even here."

My thought was that on d8, the BQ would obstruct the QR--essentially, removing another potential defender from the Black kingside."
