9,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/1p1ppppp/p1n5/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"I thought about playing c4, but I had an interesting idea which I think still has merit."
10,e6,e7e6,r1bqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p1n1p3/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"White is preparing a Yugoslav style attack, but Black is not playing the Dragon variation.  This was my idea, and I was really curious to see Black's real defenses against something simply not played as far as I know.   I searched through a database and there was only one game with players above 2000.  CM recommends Be2 to expedite castling.  Thanks for the line Ion, I purchased a work on the Sozin via ebay.  The author presents the Sozin as three interconnected systems framed largely around the white piece setup we see here ."

12,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/1p1p1ppp/p1n1pn2/8/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 7,CM expects White to exchange of Black's c6 knight at any moment.
13,f3,f2f3,r1bqkb1r/1p1p1ppp/p1n1pn2/8/2BNP3/2N2P2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,"I was concerned with 7...Nxe4 8.Nxe4 d5!  Also, f3 is part of the yugoslav lines of the Dragon."
14,Qc7,d8c7,r1b1kb1r/1pqp1ppp/p1n1pn2/8/2BNP3/2N2P2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 8,I felt that he was strongly discouraging me from going Queen-side.  Stubborn compunction;  There must be some merit in the idea because he is attempting to discourage it.
15,Be3,c1e3,r1b1kb1r/1pqp1ppp/p1n1pn2/8/2BNP3/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 2 8,Played to prepare Qe2.

If black plays dxc4, then the game is over.  Unfortunately, the very strong (and probably obvious) response is played by Black.  I still think the idea might have merit, but the bishop safety must come first."

I have two aims:  stop his development and promote my own."
