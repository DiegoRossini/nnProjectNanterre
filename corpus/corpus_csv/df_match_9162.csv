1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone, here I played against a Sicilian against a near-Expert more than 200 points north of my rating.  Up until move 13 we followed a game against an Expert and a Master who had a similar rating differential to me and my opponent.  I had to improve on that Expert's line or lose the game!  Given my performance against Apastpawn and Marinvucusic it was an extremely Herculanean order!  Did I find an improvement on Move 13?  Let the jury decide!  Joanne"
