Now, Black has tempo and Black has the centre. The question is, of course, what to do with it! I felt a strong temptation to rattle White's cages with e or d4 but needlessly dissolving the centre would just mean Black would have to develop all over again. Instead, in anticipation of the kingside castle, Black is better to wheel its pieces towards the kingside, where it will build pressure, whilst retaining its centre dominance to keep White bottled up."

Here, I could well have both bishop and knight pairs bringing fire to bear on the centre-kingside of the board, with 8...Be6-9...Ng6 or 8...Ng6-9...Be6 looming. With such distractions, White will be so occupied that they shouldn't ever have time to mount a flanking threat on the queenside; which seems White's only possible avenue of attack."

I found it so hard to choose I started annotating this game for a more thorough appreciation of the state of play. Here I am and still deliberating! But better to be spoilt for choice between several good moves than the converse! Looking at this position, there is an attraction to connecting those hanging central pawns to their brethren. But the big factor here for Black is time. They have plenty of it. 9c4 is White's only real immediate threat."

Which Black, of course, has no intention of making. Curious that White has played a very similar game before and lost with an unwise series of exchanges on the kingside that let Black's Q and rooks come into play. Assuming White is attempting to replay this game but using sounder strategy, we'll presume we won't be invited to waltz into the precious kingside so openly this time.  At this stage, then, just like in our complimentary game as White, our opponent's Qside is beginning to look rather vulnerable (Bb2 could change that a little). Here the centre may become the screen not just for kingside but queenside attacks as well, building those little threats that Euwe wrote about until White just has too much territory to cover. Here the c6 movement will anchor our hanging d pawn in order to help accomplish this plan. Be6 may become delayed for b5 as Black's 10th move."

White, on the other hand, has built a rather impressive fortress. But chess is not one side seeking to assault a prepared position;  this is two armies in the field with no salients, motes, palisades, curtain walls or turrets to give one side an advantage over another. No, only piece coordination, including mobility, can win the day on an open battlefield and White's cramped position will turn from stronghold to sepulchre swiftly if they don't get moving!"

Sometimes an opponent's unexpected move is due to an oversight in one's own calculations and leads to disaster. Otherwise, it's because the opponent has made a mistake. This, I think, belongs to the latter. White was better served to continue Qside mobilisation; they have blocked their own dcb's control of a long diagonal and have allowed sudden unlooked for construction of a dominant pawn chain for Black. In every line I run through, both after a couple of whites and after a couple of reds, the best move here seems to be the e pawn gliding past White's d pawn over-extension to facilitate sudden and absolute trouble for White on the kingside! Just like in our complimentary game, the Qside roll will have to wait. In the complimentary game it was postponed for defensive aggression (if that makes sense) designed to undo the opponent's strength stemming from control of a diagonal. Here White has undone their own strength! Allons-ay!"

What I do see is the opponent's bishop and queen again sharing a diagonal just as in the complimentary game. If action is to be about the kside with a stymied qside, then addressing that is a priority. With the Q having not moved as of yet, seems a nice time to set up Bg4 and the resulting deconstruction of White's position. If White decides to push the c pawn, Bxg3 can also deconstruct White's position. If pushing the b pawn, axb5 opens a file and the bishop recapture as a reply to exd5 was already explained as beneficial to Black. Overall, then, with White lacking any good moves (save perhaps Bh5, which Qd7 prepares for), it is the best time for Black to manoeuvre instead of trying to create something from nothing."
