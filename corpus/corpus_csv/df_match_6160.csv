1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game was part of a mini-tournament, ""Derman's sicilian  XXI"". Not surprisingly if you know the name, this was the starting position.  The idea of the Sicilian is that White gets a developmental lead and tries  to attack in the centre or on the kingside, while Black seeks counterplay  on the queenside and the c-file (which is usually opened soon)."

6,Qa5+,d8a5,rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/q1p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,"?! Yes, the queen is a very  powerful piece. But to get her out so early is risky, to say the least. She can  now easily come under attack, and because she is so powerful, you should  try to keep her on the board, unless you get very good compensation or can  deliver checkmate. That's why this is not a good move. Better would be  3...cxd4, exchanging a wing pawn for a central one and opening the c-file to  attack."

38,exd5,e6d5,2kr4/pp5p/8/2pp2Q1/1q1rPB2/1B5P/PPP2PP1/2K4R w - - 0 20,? The  wrong capture. Better would be 19...Rxd5 20.exd5. But now comes another trap  that was set by the sac:
