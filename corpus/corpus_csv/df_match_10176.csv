2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"QGD, symmetrical (Austrian) defense  
I have only played against this opening once, looks like it should be a very open fast paced game."

7,Nf3,g1f3,rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pq4/3P4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"I have 2 knights developed and the black pawn at d4 is a dead duck. Not to mention his Queen being under attack. So far so good, and pretty standard judging from the GK database."

12,e5,e7e5,rnb1kbnr/pp3ppp/8/q3p3/3N4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"I have to move the Knight twice, which I normally loathe, but I'm okay with that for now. He still has only his Queen developed and my reply will attack her."
13,Nb3,d4b3,rnb1kbnr/pp3ppp/8/q3p3/8/1NN5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 7,"I think Black is looking at f2, but with no support that will be a tough one. I don't like having both my knights placed so far from his (and my) King, but this looks playable!"

16,Bb4,f8b4,rnb1k1nr/pp3ppp/1q6/4p3/1b2P3/1NN5/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 9,Very common pin in the QP game. I never worry about them. I'm typically happy to have a bishop over a knight.
17,Bd2,c1d2,rnb1k1nr/pp3ppp/1q6/4p3/1b2P3/1NN5/PP1B1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 2 9,I still allow the possibility of the knight moving (like to d6!) and get another piece into the fray. But Black has much potential and I have to be careful!

19,Be2,f1e2,rn2k1nr/pp3ppp/1q2b3/4p3/1b2P3/1NN5/PP1BBPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 4 10,pretty even in development and his queen could present a problem.
20,Nc6,b8c6,r3k1nr/pp3ppp/1qn1b3/4p3/1b2P3/1NN5/PP1BBPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 5 11,pretty even in development and his queen could present a problem.

22,Rd8,a8d8,3rk1nr/pp3ppp/1qn1b3/4p3/1b2P3/1NN5/PP1BBPPP/R2Q1RK1 w k - 7 12,"I expected nf6 to prepare to castle. Unless I act, I lose the knight!"
23,Qc2,d1c2,3rk1nr/pp3ppp/1qn1b3/4p3/1b2P3/1NN5/PPQBBPPP/R4RK1 b k - 8 12,"I decide to leave my pawns intact. I wonder though if the open file on A would have helped. Oh well, the die is cast!"
24,Bxb3,e6b3,3rk1nr/pp3ppp/1qn5/4p3/1b2P3/1bN5/PPQBBPPP/R4RK1 w k - 0 13,"I decide to leave my pawns intact. I wonder though if the open file on A would have helped. Oh well, the die is cast!"

26,Rxd2,d8d2,4k1nr/pp3ppp/1qn5/4p3/1b2P3/1QN5/PP1rBPPP/R4RK1 w k - 0 14,Rats! This seems to be my trademark. Squandering a minor piece early on. And one of my beloved bishops at that!At least I still have the other one!
27,Bc4,e2c4,4k1nr/pp3ppp/1qn5/4p3/1bB1P3/1QN5/PP1r1PPP/R4RK1 b k - 1 14,I am attacking f7 as well as getting the WS Bishop the heck out of there!
28,Qc7,b6c7,4k1nr/ppq2ppp/2n5/4p3/1bB1P3/1QN5/PP1r1PPP/R4RK1 w k - 2 15,"Q-c7 was the most common reply in move 7, now I see why...."
29,Nd5,c3d5,4k1nr/ppq2ppp/2n5/3Np3/1bB1P3/1Q6/PP1r1PPP/R4RK1 b k - 3 15,Wheee! Fork!!
