9,Nf3,d4f3,r1b1kbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/4P2q/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,"The common moves are Nc3, where White tries to hold on to the pawn, and Nb5, where White gets the pawn but Black gives up the right to castle.

I felt that this was a mistake because Black gets the pawn and still gets to castle. But it turns out not so easy to castle, even here."

I think I was more worried that he would play c3 here, and I'd have to move the bishop again instead of developing the knight next or Nbd2 -- probably the best move -- and make me take a move with the queen. Though, I know the queen can't stay out in the middle of the board like this."

He can play Bd6, but I'll move my queen to f6. He can move his queen, but I don't have to settle for a rook trade. I can play Nxe2+ and then Qxd6 after he plays Qxe2."
