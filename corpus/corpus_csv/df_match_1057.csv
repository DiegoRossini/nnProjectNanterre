1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Controlling the centre and giving my queen and LSB space to move.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Nothing new yet.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,As usual.
4,f6,f7f6,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,?! The Damiano Defence. This will allow me to mess up my opponent's position a lot. I prefer Nc3.
5,Nxe5,f3e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"Here is the knight sacrifice. From this point onwards, Black is in dire straits."
6,fxe5,f6e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"He retakes, a bit surprised at my move."
7,Qh5+,d1h5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4p2Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 1 4,Check. Here is a chance to win a pawn.
8,Ke7,e8e7,rnbq1bnr/ppppk1pp/8/4p2Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQ - 2 5,"g6 allows me to get the rook, but this allows me to develop with tempo and wreck Black's position more."
9,Qxe5+,h5e5,rnbq1bnr/ppppk1pp/8/4Q3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQ - 0 5,Black is forced to do Kf7.
10,Kf7,e7f7,rnbq1bnr/pppp1kpp/8/4Q3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQ - 1 6,Developing with tempo.
11,Bc4+,f1c4,rnbq1bnr/pppp1kpp/8/4Q3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 2 6,Developing with tempo.
12,Kg6,f7g6,rnbq1bnr/pppp2pp/6k1/4Q3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 3 7,"Another option was d5, but that gives away a pawn at best."
13,Qf5+,e5f5,rnbq1bnr/pppp2pp/6k1/5Q2/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 4 7,"Black's king is once again forced, this time to h6."
14,Kh6,g6h6,rnbq1bnr/pppp2pp/7k/5Q2/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 5 8,"Discovered check. Qg5 is mate in one, so best is g5."
15,d4+,d2d4,rnbq1bnr/pppp2pp/7k/5Q2/2BPP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 0 8,"Discovered check. Qg5 is mate in one, so best is g5."
16,g5,g7g5,rnbq1bnr/pppp3p/7k/5Qp1/2BPP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 0 9,The best move.
17,Bxg5+,c1g5,rnbq1bnr/pppp3p/7k/5QB1/2BPP3/8/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R b KQ - 0 9,"Check. I don't think that this leads to a forced mate. However Qxg5 allows me to go on a killing spree, starting with Qxf8+. Is there a move here leading to forced mate?"
18,Kh5,h6h5,rnbq1bnr/pppp3p/8/5QBk/2BPP3/8/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R w KQ - 1 10,"Allowing a mate in one, either by g4# or Bf7#."
19,Bf7#,c4f7,rnbq1bnr/pppp1B1p/8/5QBk/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R b KQ - 2 10,"Checkmate! Although we are equal in material points, we aren't in position. Black's king is stuck on the side of the board and no pieces have been developed. The moral: play the Damiano Defence with caution. Please give constructive and helpful comments."
