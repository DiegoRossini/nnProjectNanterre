3,f3,f2f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/5P2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Black's alternatives are usually quite good when white moves this weak pawn.
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/4P3/5P2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Pdxe4 is the most popular response, though this too is good.  Pe6 might be even better, asserting greater control of the center."
5,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3pP3/8/5P2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"Pulling the queen out early generally is not so great.  Against weak players it can be powerful, but strong players will chase her, developing their pieces while the queen moves over and over."
