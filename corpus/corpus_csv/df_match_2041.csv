1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,The first move is 1. e4. I take control of the centre (d5- and f5-squares) and at the same time open diagonals for the bishop at f1 and the queen at d1.
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Black plays an opening called Caro-Kann. The idea is to play a pawn to d5 next, when it is supported by the c6 pawn. This challenges the control of the center."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,I play the most common move: d4. This move takes control of more central squares (e5 and c5) and opens a diagonal for the bishop at c1.
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2p3p1/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"This move is a surprise to me. Black does not follow the usual plan, but intends to put his bishop on g7 (or h6). This is called a fianchetto. It is possible that Black transposes to another opening via this move order."
5,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2p3p1/8/2PPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"Here I had several alternative moves. I could have developed a piece. My knights and bishops are ready to move. But because Black has not yet challenged the centre, I want to make it as difficult as possible for Black to play d5. Move c4 achieves this. In addition, the knight at b1 stands better behind the c-pawn than in front of it."
6,f6,f7f6,rnbqkbnr/pp1pp2p/2p2pp1/8/2PPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"In my opinion, this is a positional mistake. It weakens the king's protection and does not serve any good purpose. Perhaps Black tries to play a pawn to e5 and wants to protect the pawn. But, in general, protecting the e5-pawn with f6 is bad. The e8-h5 diagonal becomes weak. Now, because of the pawn on g6, it cannot be utilized, but later it can be a problem for Black.

P.S. The computer agrees with me that this is a mistake. 3...d5 was actually possible here."
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1pp2p/2p2pp1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,"I start developing the pieces. I want to find good squares for all my pieces, so that they play well together and don't step on each others toes. The knight is easy to put here, because it controls the central squares e4 and d5."
8,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp2p2p/2pp1pp1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,So Black opens the diagonal for the light-squared bishop and possibly prepares e5.
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp2p2p/2pp1pp1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,I continue development. Here the knight controls the d4- and e5-squares.
10,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkbnr/pp2p2p/2pp1pp1/8/2PPP1b1/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,"Black decides to develop the bishop and simultaneously pin my knight against my queen. The pin inderectly weakens my control of the d4- and e5-squares, because my knight cannot take on those squares without losing the queen. I expect that Black wants to play e5, challenging the center and freeing squares for the pieces."
11,Be2,f1e2,rn1qkbnr/pp2p2p/2pp1pp1/8/2PPP1b1/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 6,I develop my bishop and break the pin. Now it is also possible to castle kingside.
12,Bxf3,g4f3,rn1qkbnr/pp2p2p/2pp1pp1/8/2PPP3/2N2b2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"Black takes the knight. Although it decreases my central control, it is bad for two reasons: it loses the bishop pair and it loses tempos. This might require an explanation. With the bishop pair, I mean that having two bishops on the board is better than having a bishop and a knight or two knights. This is something that a beginner might not know. And by losing tempos, I mean that Black trades a piece that has moved twice for a piece that has moved only once."
13,Bxf3,e2f3,rn1qkbnr/pp2p2p/2pp1pp1/8/2PPP3/2N2B2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,"I capture with the bishop. I briefly thought about capturing with the g-pawn, although it would shatter the pawn structure, because the e4-pawn would get a supporting pawn on f3. However, I decided to keep the pawn structure intact, which makes the king feel safer if it castled kingside. Look at the board now. I have two pieces developed, the king is one move away from castling, and I control the center. Black has no pieces developed, the king is far from castling, and the central control is modest."
14,Qa5,d8a5,rn2kbnr/pp2p2p/2pp1pp1/q7/2PPP3/2N2B2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 8,"Black brings the queen out. This temporarily pins my remaining knight against the king. While this is not such as bad move, it does not help Black's development. Usually it is wise to move knights and bishops first."
15,O-O,e1g1,rn2kbnr/pp2p2p/2pp1pp1/q7/2PPP3/2N2B2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 2 8,I castle. The king is safer now and there is no pin anymore.
16,Bh6,f8h6,rn2k1nr/pp2p2p/2pp1ppb/q7/2PPP3/2N2B2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 3 9,Black develops the dark-squared bishop and offers to exchange it with my bishop.
17,Qd3,d1d3,rn2k1nr/pp2p2p/2pp1ppb/q7/2PPP3/2NQ1B2/PP3PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 4 9,"I do not want to take on h6, because it helps Black to develop the knight. Moving the bishop along the c1-h6 diagonal seems less effective, because Black can trade it off. I find another useful move. The queen moves away from the back rank, so the rooks are free to move wherever they are needed. I also plan to take the d-file in my control after the center opens up."
18,Bxc1,h6c1,rn2k1nr/pp2p2p/2pp1pp1/q7/2PPP3/2NQ1B2/PP3PPP/R1b2RK1 w kq - 0 10,And Black trades off the bishop. I think that keeping the tension would have been better.
19,Raxc1,a1c1,rn2k1nr/pp2p2p/2pp1pp1/q7/2PPP3/2NQ1B2/PP3PPP/2R2RK1 b kq - 0 10,I capture with the a-rook. Now all my pieces have moved.
20,Na6,b8a6,r3k1nr/pp2p2p/n1pp1pp1/q7/2PPP3/2NQ1B2/PP3PPP/2R2RK1 w kq - 1 11,"Developing the other knight and making it possible to castle queenside.

I think, I must act now, before Black's king finds a safe place. So what are the possible plans? Breaking the center with e5 would open files. But what if Black plays 0-0-0? I do not like Black's rook on the d-file then. So the first thing I do is prevent the queenside castling."
