Most modern books on the Benoni do not even cover this move and for good reason. It is way to slow! The appeal of this move is that white essentially shuts the door on tactics for the time being. Holding true the Stientz altruism, ""It is better to keep your enemy at arms length until you have finished developing."" Well he did not say that exactly."

It was this move that sparked me to start a defending 101 thread in our club forms. All to often mistakes come in pairs. I am sure black thought white can not play f4 but he was wrong.
