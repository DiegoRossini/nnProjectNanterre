1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

GM Cyrano kindly invited me to a MT of his called Italian Coffee.  I am one of 4 players rated south of 2000 in this 11 player MT and two of those were Class A 1900+ players.  This is one of them.  I find myself in a KGA and I end up losing a piece for two pawns very early on in the game.  I managed to get a third pawn for a piece but alas, that proved to be insufficent in the endgame and Yours Truly had to take a 7 point rating hit, preventing me from getting my rating north of 1860.  How did this happen?  Well, here is the GA version of the game which you can follow.  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=16652944&fb=1&rnd=0.6964235451517038"
