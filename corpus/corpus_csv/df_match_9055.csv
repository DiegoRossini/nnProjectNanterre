1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"My comments are from Black's point of view, so it might be helpful to ""flip the board"" so that Black is on the bottom.  Tim starts every game with e4.  It's a strong first move since it takes control of the center and opens the diagonals for his Queen and light squared Bishop."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"This is a good first move for Black, as it attacks Tim's pawn on e4 and stakes a claim to the d5 square.  Tim will either protect his pawn with another pawn or more likely with his Knight (w/ Nc3).  He can also push his pawn forward to e5, threatening your Knight."
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 2,Protecting w/ his Knight.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pppppppp/2n2n2/8/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 3 3,"Jim develops his second Knight, which stakes a claim to the e5, d4,  and b4 squares.  It sets up nicely for his next move, which should be to push his pawn to e5.  Nice job following the general rule that says:  Develop your Knights before your Bishops."
5,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkb1r/pppppppp/2n2n2/8/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 4 3,"Tim also follows the rule, developing his second Knight.  Looking at Tim's development, he controls 5 central squares with his two Knights and one pawn: b5, d5, e5, f5 and g5.  Picture perfect."
6,d6,d7d6,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2np1n2/8/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"This move releases the light squared Bishop and claims control over the c5 and e5 squares.  A slightly better move (the move I would have played) is pushing your pawn to e5, but I might be splitting hairs."
7,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2np1n2/1B6/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"This is a signature move by Tim.  His Bishop is pinning the Black Knight to it's King, meaning you can't move the Knight because you'd be in check ( ).    is the symbol for check.  Tim did this same move in the game vs Putz that I commented on."
8,a6,a7a6,r1bqkb1r/1pp1pppp/p1np1n2/1B6/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"I view this as a wasted move.  Putz did the same thing, if you go back and look at that game.  As I said then, on Tim's next move, he will take your Knight (no worries, because your Knight is protected so it's an even trade, but Tim's goal is to mess-up your pawn structure, giving you doubled pawns, as shown on your 5th move.  The best move here is to move your Bishop to the d7 square (Bd7) because it breaks the pin, prevents the double pawns and develops your Knight.  Compare that to what you've accomplished with a6.  So when Tim takes your Knight, you just take his Bishop with your Bishop."
9,Bxc6+,b5c6,r1bqkb1r/1pp1pppp/p1Bp1n2/8/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,Making the Knight Bishop trade.
10,bxc6,b7c6,r1bqkb1r/2p1pppp/p1pp1n2/8/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"Completing the trade.  Now you have doubled pawns (which isn't always bad, but it can be)."
11,e5,e4e5,r1bqkb1r/2p1pppp/p1pp1n2/4P3/8/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"This is why I recommended playing e5 back on move 3, because it would have prevented this move by Tim. It's an even trade, pawn for pawn, but you'll have his Knight sitting menacingly in your territory."

16,Nd5,f6d5,r1b1kb1r/2p1pppp/p1pq4/3nN3/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 9,"Decent move. Another option here instead of moving the Knight is Bg4 which attacks Tim's Queen.  Your Bishop on g4 would have been protected by your Knight on f6.  I like this move instead because it forces Tim to move his Queen, develops your Bishop and clears the way to Castle long (0-0-0) which would put your Rook on the d file.  Just a thought."

Take a close look here, because this is a mistake by Tim.  A blunder.  Why?  Because Jim can take Tim's Knight with his Queen, giving Jim a material advantage.  If Jim did this, he'd have 2 Rooks, 2 Bishops and a Queen.  Tim would have 2 Rooks, 1 Bishop and a Queen.  Advantage Jim."
