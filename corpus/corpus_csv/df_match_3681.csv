1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I consider this a risky opening for black. It pulls black's queen out early. White can develop his own bishops and knights to threaten the queen. The result is white develops several pieces before black deploys his own bishops and knights.
