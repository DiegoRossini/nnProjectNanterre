For those of you who haven't come across it before, it is the Caro Kann (B10.) ""According to chessgames.com the stats are like this:

Heres some background history on the caro-kann from everyman chess.
""The caro-kann is named after the two european masters Horatio Caro and Marcus Kann. Off the two, Caro had the slightly more distinguished playing career having played in a number of strong tournaments around the year 1900. It is fair to say that if it wasn;t for there contribution to opening theory there names would have sunk without a trace within the annals of histopry. Individually they are totally forgettable but together they have achieved great fame. As raymond keene put it, Caro and Kann has become as inseperable as Tweedledee and Tweedledum

This opening is introduced by the moves 1. e4 c6 and has long been one of black's ,ajor defences to 1. e4. The idea behind 1...c6 is to simplysupport the advance 2...d5, now if white captures on d5 black will be able to recapturewith the pawn, maintaining an equal position in the centre. If plack had started 1...d5 then this would not have been posssibleand he would have to recapture with a piefe/ This (1...d5) is slightly less respectable Scandinavian Defence (otherwise known as the centre counter)

In chess there are two distinct approaches to playing the oepning with black. The first is to try and negate White's advantage of moving first through careful, no nonsence play. The second, more risky strategy is to counter-attack at once, concentrating more on one's own ideas rather than what white is doing. The Caro-Kann is, with the exception of one or two sidelines, belongs firmly to the first group. it is an  opening that should appeal tot hose who like a solid st"
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"This is the two knights variation, I have found this has been played a lot agianst me recently. I don't know why because it is certainly not a mainline or one that is deemed very strong. I have been doing quite well against it. 

In the two knights variation of the caro-kann white will play Nf3 at some point in place of the usual d2-d4. 3.Nf3 isn't bad but it offers black a serious alternative to conceding the centre."

5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,Another reasonable alternative here is 3... g6. I prefer the more common move I played here.

b) 10... Bb4 is the old line that has been the subject of many heated theoretical battles over the yearsm After 11. h4!

Not so though, it was the ceertainly the view of the purist Russian soviet press when they savaged Mikhail tal for playing 5... gxf3in the third game of his match with Botvinnik in 1960. They virtually accused him of bringing the game into disrepute.Tal defended his decision on sychological grounds. The game ended in a draw but Tal won the match and became world champion silencing the critics in the end.

According to the Chess Opening Explorer database I use, they have five games on their database with 5. gxf3, four ended in draws and one with a win for black. A couple of famous games between Fischer and Petrosian from the 1959 candidates tournament reached the position after 5.Qxf3 and 5....Nf6 and a later d4 by black was played instead of 5....e6 in both cases, although on the database e6 is a much more commonly played move. One of the Fischer-Petrosian games ended in a draw and is annotated by Fischer in his book ""My 60 Memorable Games"" and the other ended in a win for Petrosian and is annotated by Edmar Mednis in his book ""How to Beat Bobby Fischer"". Both were exciting, long, hard-fought games and are worth looking up."""

This is logical however unnecessary because the bishop pair is strong in open positions which this might become and this is not the best way of anticipating and reacting to the potential threat 10.Rd1 is much better and maybe then exchanging the bishop for that knight later if deemed necessary."

No, this is not good at all, castling on opposite sides leads a very sharp game with pawn storms on opposite flanks occur a lot. The side to get there attack in first normally wins. However I can't see white mounting a very swift pawn storm on my kingside castled position because of all the pieces blocking littleboo's pawns in.  I on the other hand have an un obstructed pawn on a7 which I can put into action quicky. Why Queen can also gain attacking positions very quickly on b6 or a5 immediately and my rooks when connected will make a powerful battery on the b-file. To conclude the best move here is 11. 0-0"
