27,Nge4,g5e4,r1br2k1/ppp2p2/1bp4p/3nP3/4N2B/2N5/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b - - 2 14,... but now the Rook is under assault.
28,Rf8,d8f8,r1b2rk1/ppp2p2/1bp4p/3nP3/4N2B/2N5/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w - - 3 15,I think Black was a little too worried about forked checks when he made this move. 14... Nxc3! should have been played instead. 15. Bxd8 Nxe4 wins the exchange. The response would have been either 15. Nxc3 or bxc3 which then gives the Black Rook luft.
29,Nxd5,c3d5,r1b2rk1/ppp2p2/1bp4p/3NP3/4N2B/8/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b - - 0 15,The pesky Knight must be slain.

34,c6,c7c6,r1b2r2/pp3pk1/1bp4p/3NP3/7B/8/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 18,A dubious move. It probably would have been better to develop the light-squared Bishop and connect the Rooks with a gain in tempo.
35,Nxb6,d5b6,r1b2r2/pp3pk1/1Np4p/4P3/7B/8/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b - - 0 18,I remove his better Bishop which was aimed at my King AND compromise his Queenside pawn majority.
