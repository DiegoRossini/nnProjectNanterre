1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"A move either telegraphing an intent to play the Wing Gambit, or just displaying the arrogance of someone standing at the edge of becoming a Master with his next rated win or two, in effect drawling, ""I can play whatever I like and it doesn't matter because I'll win anyway,"" or both.

Unbeknownst to my opponent, I am both familiar with the Wing Gambit and a little stronger player than the ""1200 rating"" indicates. A word of advice to the wise chess competitor: *ALWAYS* come to the board prepared to play for blood; put your best game out there, and don't screw around. Play against *EVERY* opponent as if you believe he's really a Grandmaster regardless of what his actual rating may be. It will make you a better player.

First, I enjoy playing the Wing Gambit on occasion. I like playing the Danish, too. And these days my main weapon against 1. ...f5 is a little bit of inspired psychosis called the Krejcik Gambit. But let's be serious: the Wing Gambit stands at the edge of the theoretical abyss - i.e. it's *barely* sound. Any competent defender is going to make White's life miserable (...look what I just did to a 2196 player!) even if he doesn't get better than a draw out of the game. But White isn't usually playing for a draw, so if he ends up with one his intent to win has been effectively thwarted, wouldn't you agree?

You want proof of the WG's lack of serious reputation? Then just compare the frequency with which any variation of it is played at the Grandmaster level relative to any non-gambit variation of the Sicilian, or even to such optimistic White-side Sicilian gambits as the Smith-Morra. Sure, Fischer used a variation of the WG to beat up on Boris Spassky in their second match; but he assayed the opening as a surprise ...and Spassky was cooperatively surprised. But let's also observe, drchopper, that with a rating of 1549, you're ""a fer piece"" from playing like Bobby Fischer (as am I, let's add). Bottom line: the WG is fun to play against the small fry, and, every third blue moon or so, it can even be useful as a shock weapon against peer and stronger competition - as long as you're willing to accept the consequence of getting embarrassingly thumped for your impertinence. But is it something you'd play with the kind of frequency that allows your opponents to *expect* it from you, and thus make preparations for it? ...Huh! Not a chance.
