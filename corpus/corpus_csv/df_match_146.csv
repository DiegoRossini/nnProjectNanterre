An excellent London System against a Hypermodernist.  The London System can be used for virtually every defense the the Black pieces can conjure.  This offensive opening has foolowed all the opening principles thus far and should be a sound position.  Seemingly passive?  Ha...just goading Black to advance poorly!

On the other side of the board, Black has chosen to wiat on a good home for the King's Knight.  this is a theorectical ploy in the Modern Defense.  Either Nh6 looking for f7 after the f-pawn advances or e7 after that pawn advances.  Often here you may find a ""Hippo"" structure without the advanced b-pawn.  Also a very strong defense.

Obviously this game is starting very positional and will play well to those wanting a highly strategic game."

This is the first violation of opening principles.  ""Avoid moving any piece twice before the Rooks are connected or an opening sequence is complete"" (humbly, my wording only).  Obviously there are exceptions especially when material or some static/dynamic can be obtained.

Once a principle is violated by one, the opponent must look at the cost but often looks to ""see"" how to punish the violation.
Another ""candidate"" move should be considered in line with opening principles unless a tactic can earn an advantage.  Other CM's might be 0-0, h3 to tuck the DSB away if needed, and even a theorectical a5 often played to ""attack"" Black's Queenside or al least offer tension."
