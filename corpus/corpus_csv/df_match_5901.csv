1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"This game is my first annotated game. I picked this one in particular for my rook sacrifice at the end, which I really like but don't actually know if it is good or not. Overall not one of my better games, having difficulty handling an opponent 100 points below me. My tactical skills in the middlegame especially are lacking."
