6,g6,g7g6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/2p5/2B1P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 4,preparing to bring my bishop out to the long diagonal
7,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/2p5/2BPP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 4,offering an exchange....
8,cxd4,c5d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/8/2BpP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,which I accept
9,cxd4,c3d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/8/2BPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,"so far, these moves remain a part of the GK database - white has solid control of the centre; all of Black's pressure is on the d4 square"
10,Bg7,f8g7,r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/8/2BPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 6,"so far, these moves remain a part of the GK database - white has solid control of the centre; all of Black's pressure is on the d4 square"
11,d5,d4d5,r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/3P4/2B1P3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 6,"This move, however, is not part of the GK database. Most played in this position is 6. Nf3"
12,Ne5,c6e5,r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/6p1/3Pn3/2B1P3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 7,moves out of danger ond threatens White's bishop
13,Nd2,b1d2,r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/6p1/3Pn3/2B1P3/8/PP1N1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 2 7,good developing move which gives support to the bishop
14,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/pp1pppbp/5np1/3Pn3/2B1P3/8/PP1N1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 3 8,"preparing to castle, and developing my knight. There is also the threat of winning a pawn with 8...Nxe4 9.Nxe4 Nxc4, which will also, at the end put pressure on the b2 pawn"
15,b3,b2b3,r1bqk2r/pp1pppbp/5np1/3Pn3/2B1P3/1P6/P2N1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 8,"that attack becomes more powerful here, as it puts White's rook in direct attack from the bishop."
16,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp1pppbp/5np1/3Pn3/2B1P3/1P6/P2N1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQ - 1 9,"instead, though, I develop, not realising what I could do"
17,Ndf3,d2f3,r1bq1rk1/pp1pppbp/5np1/3Pn3/2B1P3/1P3N2/P4PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQ - 2 9,"hoping to pressure my knight, perhaps chase it around the board...."
18,Nxf3+,e5f3,r1bq1rk1/pp1pppbp/5np1/3P4/2B1P3/1P3n2/P4PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQ - 0 10,"so I decide to exchange. This wasn't the best move here, though; Nxe4 would have been better, as it gives my other knight protection with the bishop, and threatens a knight-for-rook exchange (10...Nd3+ 11. Bxd3 Bxa1) Also, White would not be able to exchange because of 10. Nxe5 Bxe5 11. Rb1 Nc3, which forks Queen and Rook"
19,Nxf3,g1f3,r1bq1rk1/pp1pppbp/5np1/3P4/2B1P3/1P3N2/P4PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 10,although this move stops White doubling his pawns....
20,Nxe4,f6e4,r1bq1rk1/pp1pppbp/6p1/3P4/2B1n3/1P3N2/P4PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 11,it leaves me free to take his e-pawn (I guess this should have been done earlier)
21,Bd2,c1d2,r1bq1rk1/pp1pppbp/6p1/3P4/2B1n3/1P3N2/P2B1PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 1 11,a good move - White sees the danger of the Queen-Rook fork and opts for an exchange instead....
22,Qb6,d8b6,r1b2rk1/pp1pppbp/1q4p1/3P4/2B1n3/1P3N2/P2B1PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 2 12,"I do not go for it straight away, however - instead, I aim for a mate"
23,O-O,e1g1,r1b2rk1/pp1pppbp/1q4p1/3P4/2B1n3/1P3N2/P2B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 3 12,the best move here
24,Bxa1,g7a1,r1b2rk1/pp1ppp1p/1q4p1/3P4/2B1n3/1P3N2/P2B1PPP/b2Q1RK1 w - - 0 13,"In hindsight, I'm not so sure about this move - I've just given up a powerful bishop for a semi-trapped rook. Also,the Queen, at a1, proves to be a big part of my loss in just a couple of moves from here. However, I do win on the exchange, and I had no idea at the time how powerful the Queen would be there"
