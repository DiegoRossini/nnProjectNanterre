At the top level it does make a sneaky appearance and has recently also being doing fairly well. The teeth of the Blackmar-Diemar are still 'theoretically' in place."

15,Qe1,d1e1,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/5np1/8/2BP4/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1B1QRK1 b - - 5 8,Plan A. Go for the King. (there is only one plan in the Blackmar which makes it so appealing.) The Queen is heading for the h-file.

36,Rfd8,f8d8,r2r2k1/pp2pp1p/2pn1nPQ/6N1/3q4/2N4P/PP6/2R2R1K w - - 1 19,Giving the King the square f8 as running room. But now we see a gxh7+ Kh8 and Nxf7 mate idea popping up. The d6 Knight is stopping that one.
37,Rce1,c1e1,r2r2k1/pp2pp1p/2pn1nPQ/6N1/3q4/2N4P/PP6/4RR1K b - - 2 19,"19.Rcd1 with the idea of chopping the d6 Knight (see previous note.) is another idea. 19.Rce1 has the same idea, it allows the c3 Knight to enter the fray and eyeball the d6 Knight."
38,Rd7,d8d7,r5k1/pp1rpp1p/2pn1nPQ/6N1/3q4/2N4P/PP6/4RR1K w - - 3 20,So if 20...Ndxe4 21.gxh7+ mates with either a Queen or a Knight landing on f7.
39,Nce4,c3e4,r5k1/pp1rpp1p/2pn1nPQ/6N1/3qN3/7P/PP6/4RR1K b - - 4 20,So if 20...Ndxe4 21.gxh7+ mates with either a Queen or a Knight landing on f7.

41,Ne6,g5e6,r5k1/pp1rp2p/2pnNnpQ/8/3qN3/7P/PP6/4RR1K b - - 1 21,That's a good one. The threat is Qg7 mate. And if the heroic d6 Knight drops back to e8 to defend g7 then Qf8 is mate.
42,Ng4,f6g4,r5k1/pp1rp2p/2pnN1pQ/8/3qN1n1/7P/PP6/4RR1K w - - 2 22,Nothing saves Black. 21...Nf5 22.Rxf5. 21...Nh5 meets what was played in the game. White wraps it up with a wee bit of panache.
43,Qf8+,h6f8,r4Qk1/pp1rp2p/2pnN1p1/8/3qN1n1/7P/PP6/4RR1K b - - 3 22,22.Rf8+ would have done but no complaints from me. A Queen sac still thrills.
