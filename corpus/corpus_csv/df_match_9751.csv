1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"*back one for intro* My standard as of late. Shooting for a Reti, but ready and willing to transpose to QG lines."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 2,"I'm perversely proud of the fact that I've never in my OTB life played 1. e4, so any variation of QGD lines are just fine by me."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,"I'm perversely proud of the fact that I've never in my OTB life played 1. e4, so any variation of QGD lines are just fine by me."

7,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3P4/3P4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"For anyone putting together a scouting report on me, this capture will absolutely, positively be made in this position every time. My goal is to jump on the c file as quickly as possible via Rc1 after developing the queenside pieces (Bg5 and Nc3 or Nd2)."
8,exd5,e6d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,Correct. [4...Nxd5 e4! with tempo and a nice real estate grab]
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,?! f5 and g4 are much more natural squares. This bishop is now basically a pawn.
10,Be6,c8e6,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4bn2/3p4/3P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,?! f5 and g4 are much more natural squares. This bishop is now basically a pawn.
11,Bg5,c1g5,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4bn2/3p2B1/3P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 3 6,Everything is moving along as planned.
12,Nbd7,b8d7,r2qkb1r/pppn1ppp/4bn2/3p2B1/3P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 4 7,I liked this move for black. His probable c5 push and his pinned knight are both supported.
13,e3,e2e3,r2qkb1r/pppn1ppp/4bn2/3p2B1/3P4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"Black gets a Slav pawn in, and both sides near completion of development."
14,Bb4,f8b4,r2qk2r/pppn1ppp/4bn2/3p2B1/1b1P4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,"Black gets a Slav pawn in, and both sides near completion of development."
15,Bd3,f1d3,r2qk2r/pppn1ppp/4bn2/3p2B1/1b1P4/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 2 8,"Black gets a Slav pawn in, and both sides near completion of development."
16,c6,c7c6,r2qk2r/pp1n1ppp/2p1bn2/3p2B1/1b1P4/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 9,"Black gets a Slav pawn in, and both sides near completion of development."
17,Qc2,d1c2,r2qk2r/pp1n1ppp/2p1bn2/3p2B1/1b1P4/2NBPN2/PPQ2PPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 1 9,"Castling also crossed my mind here, as it is usually wise to do so early and it would break a pesky pin, but I reconsidered when I realized I could safely delay doing so while double tapping h7. I'm gambling a little here that he will make what I considered to be a logical next move in 0-0, thereby winning a pawn as his Nf6 is pinned to his queen."
18,O-O,e8g8,r2q1rk1/pp1n1ppp/2p1bn2/3p2B1/1b1P4/2NBPN2/PPQ2PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 2 10,Bingo....he didn't see the tactic.
19,Bxh7+,d3h7,r2q1rk1/pp1n1ppB/2p1bn2/3p2B1/1b1P4/2N1PN2/PPQ2PPP/R3K2R b KQ - 0 10,"Ok, the egomania I mentioned in the intro kicks into high gear. I'm now a pawn up with a pleasing and active position. Time to liquidate everything in sight."
20,Kh8,g8h8,r2q1r1k/pp1n1ppB/2p1bn2/3p2B1/1b1P4/2N1PN2/PPQ2PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 1 11,"Ok, the egomania I mentioned in the intro kicks into high gear. I'm now a pawn up with a pleasing and active position. Time to liquidate everything in sight."

22,Qc7,d8c7,r4r1k/ppqn1pp1/2p1bn2/3p2B1/1b1P4/2NBPN2/PPQ2PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 3 12,"Black is far from dead, and still has numerous dangerous possibilities. This move unpins the queen and claims a dangerous diagonal should I 0-0."
23,Bf4,g5f4,r4r1k/ppqn1pp1/2p1bn2/3p4/1b1P1B2/2NBPN2/PPQ2PPP/R3K2R b KQ - 4 12,"BxN only assists black in moving forward, so I opt to just check his queen. I feel sure enough that he won't want to give up that diagonal and play Bd6, allowing me to more safely liquidate."
24,Bd6,b4d6,r4r1k/ppqn1pp1/2pbbn2/3p4/3P1B2/2NBPN2/PPQ2PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 5 13,"Black has played as I predicted so far, and I'm feeling great. I'm going to go 4-0 and sweep the section. I'd like to thank the Academy, my parents, all of the wonderful people behind the scenes........"
25,Bxd6,f4d6,r4r1k/ppqn1pp1/2pBbn2/3p4/3P4/2NBPN2/PPQ2PPP/R3K2R b KQ - 0 13,"Black has played as I predicted so far, and I'm feeling great. I'm going to go 4-0 and sweep the section. I'd like to thank the Academy, my parents, all of the wonderful people behind the scenes........"
26,Qxd6,c7d6,r4r1k/pp1n1pp1/2pqbn2/3p4/3P4/2NBPN2/PPQ2PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 14,"Black has played as I predicted so far, and I'm feeling great. I'm going to go 4-0 and sweep the section. I'd like to thank the Academy, my parents, all of the wonderful people behind the scenes........"
27,h4,h2h4,r4r1k/pp1n1pp1/2pqbn2/3p4/3P3P/2NBPN2/PPQ2PP1/R3K2R b KQ - 0 14,"As I still have my nice battery and my Rh1 is on a semi-opened file facing the enemy monarch, I decide to give my h pawn a battlefield promotion to Kamakaze. I'm prepared to sac him for just about anything to open that h file, and I see 0-0-0 in my near future."
28,Nh5,f6h5,r4r1k/pp1n1pp1/2pqb3/3p3n/3P3P/2NBPN2/PPQ2PP1/R3K2R w KQ - 1 15,! Nice move. My h pawn is now stalled and g4 is not possible.
29,Bf5,d3f5,r4r1k/pp1n1pp1/2pqb3/3p1B1n/3P3P/2N1PN2/PPQ2PP1/R3K2R b KQ - 2 15,"?! In retrospect, probably not best. My plan was BxB QxB with heat on his Nh5, but it didn't really occur to me that he would simply ignore my bishop offering and play......."
30,Ndf6,d7f6,r4r1k/pp3pp1/2pqbn2/3p1B1n/3P3P/2N1PN2/PPQ2PP1/R3K2R w KQ - 3 16,Whoa.....slow down there fella. You are supposed to lamely submit to my will and make moves that I intend you to. You are screwing around with my coronation.
31,Ne5,f3e5,r4r1k/pp3pp1/2pqbn2/3pNB1n/3P3P/2N1P3/PPQ2PP1/R3K2R b KQ - 4 16,"?! Ego made this move, pure and simple. And it's not a bad move. It's just not the right move. Better was probably just to go ahead trade off light squared bishops and get closer to an advantageous endgame. After my lapse the last move, I decide to make what I considered to be the most threatening looking move I could to re-establish my dominance in this mental struggle. I continue to think of how cool 4-0 sounds and my grasp of the game at hand starts slipping."
32,Nd7,f6d7,r4r1k/pp1n1pp1/2pqb3/3pNB1n/3P3P/2N1P3/PPQ2PP1/R3K2R w KQ - 5 17,"!? Normally not wise to trade down when behind in material, this move got my leg to shaking. BxB fxB activates his Rf8. NxN trades down, but I lose a beautifully posted knight and his threat on f7 (which may come in handy as I'm still seriously bearing down on his king). So, I decide to start attacking in earnest by playing....."
