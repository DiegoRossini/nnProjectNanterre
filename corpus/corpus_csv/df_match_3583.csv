For instance, all white has to do is to capture on c4 with the bishop, and he has already the threat Qb3. The light squared bishop is poorly placed. In this opening, we will see that simply following the fundamental(and mistakenly called ""beginner"" or ""basic"") principles, we can find the BEST move in each of the positions quickly. Here, black should have played ...Nf6, getting the least active piece. I should also note that without any calculation, this move is not best The bishop was already active, so we shouldn't move it again."
