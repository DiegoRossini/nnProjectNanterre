1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,She starts conventionally
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"We play out the first moves of a main line Sicilian, one of my favourite openings."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"We play out the first moves of a main line Sicilian, one of my favourite openings."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"We play out the first moves of a main line Sicilian, one of my favourite openings."
5,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 3,This is slightly unusual. 3. d4 is normal.
6,d6,d7d6,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"I play this, expecting her to transpose back with 4. d4"
7,Be2,f1e2,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,But she plays this!
8,g6,g7g6,r1bqkbnr/pp2pp1p/2np2p1/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"I played this - and almost immediately regretted it. She could have played 5. d4 and transposed into variations of the Dragon Sicilian, which I am not too familiar with."
9,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkbnr/pp2pp1p/2np2p1/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 5,Bt she played this.
10,Bg7,f8g7,r1bqk1nr/pp2ppbp/2np2p1/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 6,So I stop d4 for now.
11,d3,d2d3,r1bqk1nr/pp2ppbp/2np2p1/2p5/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 6,She continues to develop.
12,a6,a7a6,r1bqk1nr/1p2ppbp/p1np2p1/2p5/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,"And I start to mobilize my queen side, like I usually do."
13,Be3,c1e3,r1bqk1nr/1p2ppbp/p1np2p1/2p5/4P3/2NPBN2/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 1 7,She develops.
14,b5,b7b5,r1bqk1nr/4ppbp/p1np2p1/1pp5/4P3/2NPBN2/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 8,I continue with my queen side advances.
15,d4,d3d4,r1bqk1nr/4ppbp/p1np2p1/1pp5/3PP3/2N1BN2/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 8,And I was now very happy. Surely by playing d3 followed by d4 she has just wasted a move?
16,cxd4,c5d4,r1bqk1nr/4ppbp/p1np2p1/1p6/3pP3/2N1BN2/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 9,So I take.
17,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqk1nr/4ppbp/p1np2p1/1p6/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 9,She takes back.
18,Bb7,c8b7,r2qk1nr/1b2ppbp/p1np2p1/1p6/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 1 10,I protect Nc6.
19,Bf3,e2f3,r2qk1nr/1b2ppbp/p1np2p1/1p6/3NP3/2N1BB2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 2 10,I was very happy when I saw this move. It prevents aggressive thrusts with f3 or f4. Now Rc8 or Ne5 gives black a good game.
20,Nf6,g8f6,r2qk2r/1b2ppbp/p1np1np1/1p6/3NP3/2N1BB2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 3 11,"OK, stop - work out white's best move now."
21,e5,e4e5,r2qk2r/1b2ppbp/p1np1np1/1p2P3/3N4/2N1BB2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 11,"Did you get it? Immediately after playing Nf6?? I saw it. I am now losing a piece, as both knights are attacked."
22,dxe5,d6e5,r2qk2r/1b2ppbp/p1n2np1/1p2p3/3N4/2N1BB2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 12,"And this is the worst way to lose it. Other moves, such as Rc8, Nxe5 mean that at least I get a pawn for it."
