1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"After our first foray into direct competition, Jeff declared right off the bat that he would not annotate this game.  My reply was, ""I will then--the story must be told!""  Here, then, is the telling of the tale...

Like our first game, I began with the Queen's pawn opening..."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Jeff answered in kind.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"I, once again, offer my Queen's bishop pawn as fodder for his attack in hope of gaining the classic double center pawn positional advantage.  Queen's Gambit, by name, and (if accepted) offers white a strong advantage in the opening game."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"Ahh, the Marshall Defense...  So named for Matt Dillon's classic gunfighter's attitude--stand in the middle of the street and dare all would-be legend killers to ""bring it on!""  (Ok, I watch too much TV & study too little chess to be able to accurately relate the origin of the name, but I was suitably determined to test my metal nonetheless.)"
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 3,Always a fan of symmetry--I allow my horse out of the stable in reply.  Not the most aggressive response & will cost me considerable momentum.
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 3 4,"Bringing his entire mounted posse to bear, Jeff brings forth his other Knight."
7,cxd5,c4d5,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3P4/3P4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"I think I was trying to tempt his Queen out early to give me a target at which to start taking potshots, but I don't really recall.  I really didn't want to echo his double Knight approach & wanted to gain back a little control & dictate the attack.  I admit to being more than a little of a control freak when it comes to playing white--sometimes taking an unorthodox approach just to keep my counterpart on his toes.

I also know that Jeff scouts incredibly well & I don't remember ever giving up on a gambit this early."
8,Nxd5,f6d5,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n5/3n4/3P4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Undeterred (and obviously not taking my bait to expose his Queen--solid chess play, not an example of latent prudery) Jeff bravely brings his Knight over in the capture--exposing himself to attack."
9,e4,e2e4,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n5/3n4/3PP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,And attack I do.  Now I have the strong pawn structure I wanted with the original gambit.  Life is good.  I am happy.
10,Ndb4,d5b4,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n5/8/1n1PP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,"Pushing forward, resisting waste of effort by retreating, Jeff invades my territory.  He must pay for his temerity!"
11,d5,d4d5,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n5/3P4/1n2P3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,I push the attack & invite him to do his worst!
12,Bg4,c8g4,r2qkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n5/3P4/1n2P1b1/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,"What?!?  My friend, do you not see that I am attacking your knight?  Such a bold refusal to allow me to control the ebb and flow of attack and retreat.  I am perplexed, confused by his willingness to offer up his knight so early.  I am also jealous that I rarely exhibit such boldness myself.  I must do something unexpected--outrageous enough to make him sorry that he wasn't more traditional in his response."
13,Bd3,f1d3,r2qkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n5/3P4/1n2P1b1/3B1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 7,"So, I make a move that confuses even me--let him figure this one out.  He offered his knight so willingly, so I decide I don't want it."
14,Bxf3,g4f3,r2qkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n5/3P4/1n2P3/3B1b2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"The nerve!  My knight was just sitting there, protecting no one--attacking no one--and he just takes him out like he's nothing.  Jeff exhibits no concern for my knight's family--his wife and 8 small children--just kills him as he rests upon his mighty steed at the edge of the conflict."
15,Qxf3,d1f3,r2qkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n5/3P4/1n2P3/3B1Q2/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 8,"Remember how I wanted to draw Jeff's queen into the fray prematurely?  Now, whose queen left the castle w/o time to even adjust her knickers?  In my desire to be unexpected I have allowed myself to be manipulated.  I'm sure that I will pay."
16,Ne5,c6e5,r2qkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3Pn3/1n2P3/3B1Q2/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 1 9,"My fair lady is under attack.  (I myself always preferred ""Pygmalion""--thinking that most stories flow more easily when you don't have to break out in song every 10 minutes, but that's my own opinion--and has nothing to do with this chess game, or any other for that matter)  I would have probably attacked from d4, but at this point, I'm respecting Jeff's game more than my own.  He has issued a forked attack on both my queen and bishop & I am forced to backpedal.

He's drawn my queen out early.  Offered his knight in an early sacrifice and confused me enough that I didn't even take the proffered piece.  And now he's wrested the momentum from me & is initiating the attack very well.  

I must regroup.  This unprovoked attack in the form of a knight fork has made me seriously regret my revelation to Jeff of my secret fear of knights and their confusing move possibilities."
17,Qe2,f3e2,r2qkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3Pn3/1n2P3/3B4/PP2QPPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 2 9,"Who am I kidding?  This move is a weak attempt to pretend that I can protect my bishop.  My cleric might as well give consume a dose of hemlock or pray for divine deliverance, cause my queen's obviously just there for show."
18,Nbxd3+,b4d3,r2qkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3Pn3/4P3/3n4/PP2QPPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 10,Down a bishop & forced to move my King so that castling is not even a dream.  I've lost the momentum completely.  I have no attack plan in operation.  I am scrambling wildly in total disarray.  Did I really want this story to be told?  I don't think so.
19,Kd2,e1d2,r2qkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3Pn3/4P3/3n4/PP1KQPPP/RNB4R b kq - 1 10,This will scare him.  I bet he's scared that I'll try to take his knight with my king.  Right.  I can see him shaking from here.  I wonder if he'll resign...
20,g6,g7g6,r2qkb1r/ppp1pp1p/6p1/3Pn3/4P3/3n4/PP1KQPPP/RNB4R w kq - 0 11,He certainly is hiding his fear well.  He opens a handy diagonal for his bishop while my mind bounces around like a crack addict in Disneyland wondering if I should try to score from Goofy or if Donald Duck is more likely to be holding.
