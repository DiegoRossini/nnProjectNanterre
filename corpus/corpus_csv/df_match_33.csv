1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Just to explain the time limit - it was 40 moves in 90 minutes each, after which 30 minutes is added the first time a player runs out of time. There is also a 30 second increment per move."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,This time I couldn't really prepare as he sometimes plays 1. d4 or 1. c4.
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,He opts for a Closed Sicilian.

I was quite surprised here that in previous games in this position, black had simply castled. I am not sure why white can't just take twice on c5 in that case. I was also afraid of allowing d4-d5 so I took!"
