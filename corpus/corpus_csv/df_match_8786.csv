4,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p1b2/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,I had never seen this move before so I decided to follow the database. This move seemed pretty nice to me because it attacks the pawns on d5 and b7. On the other hand white has already moved his Queen and if black should manage to hunt the queen while developing his own pieces he might get a huge opening advantage.

6,e6,e7e6,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p1b2/2PP4/1Q6/PP2PPPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"B7 appears to be hanging, but after 4.Qxb7 Nd7 follows 4...Rb8 and black gets open files while having two more pieces in play. I am sure this would be enough compensation for one or two pawns."
7,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p1b2/2PP4/1QN5/PP2PPPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 1 4,"Therefore I decided just to develop, once more attacking d5. However, the next move did kind of shock me."
8,Nc6,b8c6,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/3p1b2/2PP4/1QN5/PP2PPPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 2 5,"Not only d4 is hanging, Nb4 followed by Nc2  must be met somehow, too."
9,cxd5,c4d5,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/3P1b2/3P4/1QN5/PP2PPPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"I decided to take the pawn so that I could play more actively, and because I hardly saw any better possibilities to prevent Nb4 and protect the pawn on d4."
10,exd5,e6d5,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/3p1b2/3P4/1QN5/PP2PPPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"5...Nxd4?? 6.Qh4   -
But it still appears that white is in trouble. First of all d4 is hanging, secondly after e.g. 6.Nf3 black threatens not only 6...Nb4, which would be met with 7.e4 dxe4 8.Ne5 with a nice attack, but could prepare this with 6...Nf6, and white still has difficulties to find something against the fork on c2. I didn`t like 6.Be3, which protects d4, either. It just looked wrong to block the pawn on e2. 
After 6.Qxb7 obviously follows 6...Nxd4.
However, I found a move I do like very much because it looks very pretty and is actually quite strong."
11,Bg5,c1g5,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/3p1bB1/3P4/1QN5/PP2PPPP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 1 6,"6...Qxg5? 7.Qxb7 and I get either the rook or the knight. 
6...Nf6 7.Qxb7 Nxd4 8.0-0-0 and I think white is better.
6...Nxd4 7.Qa4  Bd7 8.Qxd4 Qxg5 9.Nxd5 Bd6 with a difficult position but a white extra-pawn.
6...f6 7.Bf4 Nxd4 8.Qa4  Nc6 9. 0-0-0 and I`ll not only get the d5 pawn but the game will get pretty sharp and the black king is in the middle. 
However, although I would like the positions after 6...Nxd4 and 6...f6, they are still unclear and probably more or less even."
12,Nge7,g8e7,r2qkb1r/ppp1nppp/2n5/3p1bB1/3P4/1QN5/PP2PPPP/R3KBNR w KQkq - 2 7,"I`m not sure about this one. Now white gets time to play Nf3 and protect d4, and Nb4 is not so much of a threat any more. f6 or Nxd4 was probably better."
13,Nf3,g1f3,r2qkb1r/ppp1nppp/2n5/3p1bB1/3P4/1QN2N2/PP2PPPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 3 7,Why not earlier? Now the bishop does not have to care about d4 any more but can choose between the two nice squares f4 and d2.
14,f6,f7f6,r2qkb1r/ppp1n1pp/2n2p2/3p1bB1/3P4/1QN2N2/PP2PPPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 8,Why not earlier? Now the bishop does not have to care about d4 any more but can choose between the two nice squares f4 and d2.

16,a6,a7a6,r2qkb1r/1pp1n1pp/p1n2p2/3p1b2/3P4/1QN2N2/PP1BPPPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 9,"This move made me wonder, too. Nb5 was no real threat, I think 8...Na5 Qa4  Nec6 was far better."
17,g3,g2g3,r2qkb1r/1pp1n1pp/p1n2p2/3p1b2/3P4/1QN2NP1/PP1BPP1P/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 9,"I decided to play the bishop to g2, I thought I`d perhaps get the d5-pawn. I didn`t see that g3 is actually dubious due to 9...Bg4! and d4 is in danger. I think the best move would be 10.Qxb7 Bxf3 (...Rb8 Qxa6) 11.exf3 Nxd4 12.0-0-0 Nxf3 13.Bf4 getting the pawn back."

Actually, it is not so good. 11...b5 would be really annoying, and after 11...Be6 12.Bg2 follows 12...g5 13.Nf3 g4 14.Nh4 b5 15.Qd1 b4 16.Na4 Nxd4."

I didn`t see that, just thought of the game continuation."
