1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

I have been playing in Gothicgirl's mamouth mini-tournament.  In this match I come up against a former International Master.  A few ill-judged exchanges had disastrous consequences for me and I ended up resigning the game on the grounds of ruinous loss of material.  Any attempt to have avoided this loss would have resulted in Henry being buried six feet under.  Here comes a standard Sicilian Defence from the WIM."

Variation A 19. Rxd5 Nxf2 20. Qe2 Nd3+ 21. Kh1 Nxc1 22. Qd1 Nxd5 23. Qxc1. Variation B 19. Rxd5 Nxf2 20. Rxd6 Nh3+ 21. Kh1 Qg1+ 22. Nxg1 Nf2#.  Yup this is where Henry is buried Six Feet Under, a brilliant Smothered Mate.

After this analysis, due to my opponent's OPTIMUM RATING I knew that she would not miss that so I waved the white flag.

I hope I can put up a better show against her as black."
