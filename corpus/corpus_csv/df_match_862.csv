Many authors of opening books will deride this opening, almost as if playing it were a criminal offence.  Well, I found myself on death row at that, before the reprieve came.  It is true the line is very risky, possibly even unsound.  But GM Paul Keres used to recommend this line for developing players in order to exercise the (tactical) imagination.  Every now and then I like to try it on for a tactical blow-out.  Boy, did I get what I asked for!"

5,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3Pp3/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"Probably the most popular response, and a perfectly good one.  Also playable (and good) are 3.Nxe5, and 3.d4!?"
6,Bd6,f8d6,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3b4/3Pp3/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,"This would have been my response to 3.Nxd5 as well.  The bishop is well placed, here, for aggression as well as for defence."
7,d4,d2d4,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3b4/3Pp3/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"Good move, placing Black's centre under early pressure."
8,e4,e5e4,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3b4/3P4/3Pp3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"A glance at the Gameknot (GK) World dataBase indicates that no other move really comes into consideration here.  It will also tell you that Black's record ain't too flash: Win 7, Draw 10, Lose 28."
9,Nfd2,f3d2,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3b4/3P4/3Pp3/8/PPPN1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"Out of the GK World dataBase.  Far more usual is 5.Ne5, to which Black most often responds 5...Nf6."
10,f5,f7f5,rnbqk1nr/ppp3pp/3b4/3P1p2/3Pp3/8/PPPN1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Into the unknown.  White's 5th has been played 9 times on the GK Site dataBase, for 5 wins to 4 - no draws!  But no one played 5...f5, preferring instead 5...Nf6.  But I wanted to get this pawn move in before developing the Knight.  Possibly I was taking more of a risk than I thought!"

Note, by the way, that the doubled d-pawns are a bit of a nuisance for Black, by interfering with his Q-side development."

15,c4,c2c4,rn2k1nr/pppq2pp/3b4/3P1p2/2PPp3/8/PP1N1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,White has obtained a powerful grip on most of the centre and Q-side.

Yet upon examining the position more closely, I came to modify my view.  Black is not having nearly as much fun as I anticipated.  Still, the expected 10.dxc5 Bxc5  11.Nb3 looks good for White."

Aron Nimzovitch used to call such a pair a 'hanging pawn couple'.  Their future is certainly suspenseful!"

But this gives White use of the centre dark squares.  At this point, the GK engine calls it +0.32 (I'll give pluses for White's favour, minuses for Black), but I reckon White is doing better than that!"

Although it might not look so bad, I was already hanging on by my teeth.  Everything depended upon maintaining those advanced pawns, and hope that eventually the threat of promotion might yet save the game for Black.  This was the only way to defend them, but the price comes high!"
