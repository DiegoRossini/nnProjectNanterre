1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"?! The controversial Latvian Gambit. Very rarely seen at high levels, Black gives up a pawn (and usually much more) for a lead in space and development."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"?! The controversial Latvian Gambit. Very rarely seen at high levels, Black gives up a pawn (and usually much more) for a lead in space and development."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"?! The controversial Latvian Gambit. Very rarely seen at high levels, Black gives up a pawn (and usually much more) for a lead in space and development."
4,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"?! The controversial Latvian Gambit. Very rarely seen at high levels, Black gives up a pawn (and usually much more) for a lead in space and development."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"This is a variation I'm not particularly familiar with in the Latvian, standard are 3. Nxe5 or 3. Bc4. Black's main responses here are 4...fxe4 5. Nxe5 Qf6, which can transpose back into the main line after 6. Nc4, or 3. Nf6 4. Bc4 fxe4 5. Nxe5 d5 6. Nxd5 Nxd5 7. Qh5+."
6,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/3p4/4pp2/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"...But I opt for this move, which transposes instead to the Philidor Counter-Gambit, a line favored by Paul Morphy."
7,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/3p4/4pp2/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,We have arrived at the Philidor Counter-Gambit; this position would normally be reached via 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 f5?! 4. Nc3.
8,fxe4,f5e4,rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/3p4/4p3/3Pp3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"This can lead to 5. Nxe4 d5 6. Neg5, which is fairly strong for White (though Jim West has suggested that 6...exd4 7. Nxd4 Qe7+ gives Black good chances). Perhaps better is 4...exd4."
9,Nxe4,c3e4,rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/3p4/4p3/3PN3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,Black continues his aggression.
10,d5,d6d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/8/3pp3/3PN3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,Black continues his aggression.
11,Nxe5,f3e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/8/3pN3/3PN3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"This is not a true sacrifice, merely baiting Black's pawn to an extended, isolated spot on e5. White can win the material back after 6...dxe4 7. Qh5+ g6 8. Nxg6."
12,dxe4,d5e4,rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/8/4N3/3Pp3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,Declining White's sacrifice would be somewhat ungentlemanly.
13,Qh5+,d1h5,rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/8/4N2Q/3Pp3/8/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 1 7,This is somewhat stronger than 8...hxg6 9. Qxh8 Nf6.
14,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/ppp4p/6p1/4N2Q/3Pp3/8/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 0 8,This is somewhat stronger than 8...hxg6 9. Qxh8 Nf6.
15,Nxg6,e5g6,rnbqkbnr/ppp4p/6N1/7Q/3Pp3/8/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 8,This is somewhat stronger than 8...hxg6 9. Qxh8 Nf6.
16,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp4p/5nN1/7Q/3Pp3/8/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 1 9,This is somewhat stronger than 8...hxg6 9. Qxh8 Nf6.
17,Qe5+,h5e5,rnbqkb1r/ppp4p/5nN1/4Q3/3Pp3/8/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 2 9,"The only reasonable move. For an opening Black chose, his position is not looking so good. He must be extremely careful now that he doesn't get his King trapped by White's pieces."
18,Kf7,e8f7,rnbq1b1r/ppp2k1p/5nN1/4Q3/3Pp3/8/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ - 3 10,"The only reasonable move. For an opening Black chose, his position is not looking so good. He must be extremely careful now that he doesn't get his King trapped by White's pieces."
19,Nxh8+,g6h8,rnbq1b1N/ppp2k1p/5n2/4Q3/3Pp3/8/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQ - 0 10,"White pins the Knight, threatening either Qxe4 or Bxf6 and the deadly attack will continue."
20,Kg8,f7g8,rnbq1bkN/ppp4p/5n2/4Q3/3Pp3/8/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ - 1 11,"White pins the Knight, threatening either Qxe4 or Bxf6 and the deadly attack will continue."
21,Bg5,c1g5,rnbq1bkN/ppp4p/5n2/4Q1B1/3Pp3/8/PPP2PPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 2 11,"White pins the Knight, threatening either Qxe4 or Bxf6 and the deadly attack will continue."
22,Be7,f8e7,rnbq2kN/ppp1b2p/5n2/4Q1B1/3Pp3/8/PPP2PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 3 12,"11...Bg7 would put the Bishop in a more comfortable location, but allows an immediate 12. Qxe4. Black is also dearly hoping to be able to develop his Nb8 with tempo by attacking the WQ, but the initiative is still firmly in White's grasp."
23,Bxf6,g5f6,rnbq2kN/ppp1b2p/5B2/4Q3/3Pp3/8/PPP2PPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 0 12,"White's attack has run out of steam for now, though Black is behind in material, underdeveloped, and must be wary of Bd3 followed by Qxh8#."
24,Bxf6,e7f6,rnbq2kN/ppp4p/5b2/4Q3/3Pp3/8/PPP2PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 0 13,"White's attack has run out of steam for now, though Black is behind in material, underdeveloped, and must be wary of Bd3 followed by Qxh8#."
25,Qxe4,e5e4,rnbq2kN/ppp4p/5b2/8/3PQ3/8/PPP2PPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 0 13,"White's attack has run out of steam for now, though Black is behind in material, underdeveloped, and must be wary of Bd3 followed by Qxh8#."
26,Kxh8,g8h8,rnbq3k/ppp4p/5b2/8/3PQ3/8/PPP2PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 0 14,"White's attack has run out of steam for now, though Black is behind in material, underdeveloped, and must be wary of Bd3 followed by Qxh8#."
27,O-O-O,e1c1,rnbq3k/ppp4p/5b2/8/3PQ3/8/PPP2PPP/2KR1B1R b - - 1 14,"White gets his King to safety and reinforces the d-pawn. Black needs to develop his pieces, but the powerful WQ in the center of the board severely limits his choices."
28,Nc6,b8c6,r1bq3k/ppp4p/2n2b2/8/3PQ3/8/PPP2PPP/2KR1B1R w - - 2 15,Allowing the Bc8 to move without endangering the b-pawn.
29,Bd3,f1d3,r1bq3k/ppp4p/2n2b2/8/3PQ3/3B4/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b - - 3 15,"White develops with a critical threat. Another option here was 15. d5, forcing the Black Knight to move again and cramping the Black position further with control of e6."
30,Qg8,d8g8,r1b3qk/ppp4p/2n2b2/8/3PQ3/3B4/PPP2PPP/2KR3R w - - 4 16,"This seems the only sensible way to defend h7. Black is two pawns down, and can't very well afford to trade off his Queen on e7."
31,h3,h2h3,r1b3qk/ppp4p/2n2b2/8/3PQ3/3B3P/PPP2PP1/2KR3R b - - 0 16,"?! White makes plans to storm the pitiful Black castle, while preparing to further restrict Black's LSB's range with g2-g4. 16. d5 might have been more reliable, denying Black the e6 square and getting the d-pawn out of immediate danger."
32,Be6,c8e6,r5qk/ppp4p/2n1bb2/8/3PQ3/3B3P/PPP2PP1/2KR3R w - - 1 17,"Black develops while defending against d4-d5 and threatens to grab a free pawn on the queenside. 16...Nxe4 or 16...Bxe4 are probably also possible here, but if Black wants to stand a chance, he needs to get his pieces mobilized as soon as possible."
33,c4,c2c4,r5qk/ppp4p/2n1bb2/8/2PPQ3/3B3P/PP3PP1/2KR3R b - - 0 17,"? This is either an oversight, or a tactic too deep for me to see the purpose. The Black Bishop is drawn in momentarily, allowing White to repel it while defending his remaining queenside pawns, but it seems to me that 17. b3 followed by 18. c4 would be stronger. Alternately, 17. Rhe1 would be a solid developing move, giving White control of the e-file."
