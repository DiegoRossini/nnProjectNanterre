14,Kd7,e8d7,rn1q1b1r/pp1kpBpp/8/2p3N1/4pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 1 8,This is beginning to prove the most popular choice of king move. 8... Kd6 can be ruled right out (9. Nf7+ and White is winning); 8... Kc7 and after 9. Bxg4 either the king or queen must move to avoid the fork on e6; 8... Ke8 invites 9. Bf7+ and an early draw.

Black, being so much material ahead, gives a pawn back to let his pieces develop. White can even take the exchange with 10. Nf7, but this seems to favour Black, since White's play depends on his minor pieces."

The choice is between 14. Ncxe4 (as in rt4sm vs. enasab, 0-1 in 22 moves) or 14. Ngxe4 (as in cliang vs. rockroy, 1-0 in 36 moves). The fact that White won after 14. Ngxe4 does not necessarily prove this the better move, especially as both of these games were won by the higher-rated player. However, I prefer this capture, as the other allows 14... Qd4+ 15. Kh1 Bxg5, exchanging a pair of pieces."

This move activates the rook and restores the pressure on my f-pawn, though for now it is adequately defended. I feel it would have been better to play this move with the other rook, since Black could then get both rooks to active positions on d8 and f8; on h8 the rook is not doing much."

The downside is that the c5 pawn is lost, which could have been prevented by 18... Rf7 or Rh7. I would then probably have continued by developing my inactive queen's rook, but it would have been difficult to make progress."
