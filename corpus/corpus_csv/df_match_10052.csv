7,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,Here I preferred to sac a p so as to play in gambit style but black doesnt co-operate
8,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk1nr/ppp1bppp/3p4/8/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,If one wants to play without risk then this is o.k - Not committing & developing the piece around 3 ranks! (though this breaks the small rule - Ns before B)
9,Nxd4,f3d4,rnbqk1nr/ppp1bppp/3p4/8/2BNP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"Here I was considering 5.c3 but somewhat felt blacks 5...,Ne4 might give edge to him & so instead played the text"
10,Bd7,c8d7,rn1qk1nr/pppbbppp/3p4/8/2BNP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 6,Now this is too much - Here Blacks violates again the basic principle & though at first sight it seems difficult to exploit the move neverthless Blacks text must be punished & whites attack starts rolling
11,Qh5,d1h5,rn1qk1nr/pppbbppp/3p4/7Q/2BNP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 2 6,"Threatens 7.Qxf7 # & black will find it difficult to find defence or one may say, as the game unfolds,  there is no defence against f7 # except to give up a piece. The point is which piece will black prefer to give his g8N or d7B."
12,g6,g7g6,rn1qk1nr/pppbbp1p/3p2p1/7Q/2BNP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 7,This temporarily blocks the threat but white shifts his Q on d5
13,Qd5,h5d5,rn1qk1nr/pppbbp1p/3p2p1/3Q4/2BNP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 1 7,setting Q-B battery on the diagonal a2-g8 & reinstating the the threat of # on f7 & creating another threat on b7-p.

15,Nxe6,d4e6,rn1qk1nr/ppp1bp1p/3pN1p1/3Q4/2B1P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 8,& now black instead of taking the N he counters whites Q with
16,Nf6,g8f6,rn1qk2r/ppp1bp1p/3pNnp1/3Q4/2B1P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 1 9,"Now white has the choice between Nxd8 - taking the Q & after Black takes the Q, white recaptures the N on d5 with B when he remains a piece up to the good or he has N-g7  & followed by Qxf7, when he has a strong pressure against Blacks K, so he I choose the latter forcing Blacks K to d7"
17,Ng7+,e6g7,rn1qk2r/ppp1bpNp/3p1np1/3Q4/2B1P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 2 9,Ofcourse Black K cant go to f8 due to # from f7

19,Qxf7,d5f7,rn1q3r/pppkbQNp/3p1np1/8/2B1P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 0 10,White prefers taking the f7-p rather than b7 as it mounts strong pressure on blacks K

21,Ne6,g7e6,rnkq3r/ppp1bQ1p/3pNnp1/8/2B1P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 2 11,"White now has lot of good option viz.12.Qg7 attacking the R or 12.Nc5 followed by 13.Be6 trapping blacks Q or as played in the game, developing his N & defending the e4-p"
22,Qd7,d8d7,rnk4r/pppqbQ1p/3pNnp1/8/2B1P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 3 12,"White now has lot of good option viz.12.Qg7 attacking the R or 12.Nc5 followed by 13.Be6 trapping blacks Q or as played in the game, developing his N & defending the e4-p"
