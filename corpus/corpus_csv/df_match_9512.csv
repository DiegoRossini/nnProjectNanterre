I overlook the fact that the a pawn will fall after dxc6 giving white another passer.  As soon as I realised this I threw in the sponge before my opponent replied on the grounds of ruinous loss of material.  Even taking into account my playing history with the Dentist and the 300  point difference in our ratings I felt that there was nothing left to play for.  This was the second time in the space of a week that I lost to U1400 oppo.  I dropped 17 points against cbarracuda.  Luckily this game was unrated so my rating was not affected.  At the time of the resignation my rating was 1679 and my opponent's was 1348.  A sorry tale.  Do you think I under-estimated my opponent here or do you feel I simply played passively and paid in full?  You the jury decide.
