5,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3Pp3/5P2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,I am not even bothering to take the extra pawn. This may or may not be a good idea as it could slow down my castling.

11,O-O,e1g1,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/3b1n2/3P4/2B2p2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 5 6,White is attempting to stay active and keep a pawn majority in the center.

14,Bg4,c8g4,rn1q1rk1/ppp2ppp/3b1n2/3P4/2BP1pb1/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 1 8,White immediately breaks my pin.
15,Qd3,d1d3,rn1q1rk1/ppp2ppp/3b1n2/3P4/2BP1pb1/3Q1N2/PPP3PP/RNB2RK1 b - - 2 8,White immediately breaks my pin.
16,Re8,f8e8,rn1qr1k1/ppp2ppp/3b1n2/3P4/2BP1pb1/3Q1N2/PPP3PP/RNB2RK1 w - - 3 9,This prevents Ne5 with a crushing center.
17,c3,c2c3,rn1qr1k1/ppp2ppp/3b1n2/3P4/2BP1pb1/2PQ1N2/PP4PP/RNB2RK1 b - - 0 9,?! I do not like this move. It seems too passive.
18,Nbd7,b8d7,r2qr1k1/pppn1ppp/3b1n2/3P4/2BP1pb1/2PQ1N2/PP4PP/RNB2RK1 w - - 1 10,White is at a bit of a standstill in development. I am not sure why he does not finish getting the minor pieces out.
19,b4,b2b4,r2qr1k1/pppn1ppp/3b1n2/3P4/1PBP1pb1/2PQ1N2/P5PP/RNB2RK1 b - - 0 10,"Although pushing the pawns can be a good idea, I still think white needs to get his minor pieces in the game. White's light bishop is passive and his knight could easily be captured and cease to exist."
20,Nb6,d7b6,r2qr1k1/ppp2ppp/1n1b1n2/3P4/1PBP1pb1/2PQ1N2/P5PP/RNB2RK1 w - - 1 11,Seems to win a pawn.
21,Bb5,c4b5,r2qr1k1/ppp2ppp/1n1b1n2/1B1P4/1P1P1pb1/2PQ1N2/P5PP/RNB2RK1 b - - 2 11,I like this move. White is seeking to be aggressive to gain the initiative from his lost pawn. I do not like that his minor pieces are still on the back rank. One problem though is that it allows black to do Be2! gaining the exchange or a bishop.
22,Re7,e8e7,r2q2k1/ppp1rppp/1n1b1n2/1B1P4/1P1P1pb1/2PQ1N2/P5PP/RNB2RK1 w - - 3 12,I like this move. White is seeking to be aggressive to gain the initiative from his lost pawn.

27,Nf5,h4f5,r2q2k1/ppp1rppp/3b1n2/1B1n1N1b/1P1P1p2/2PQ3P/P5P1/RNB2RK1 b - - 1 14,Now it is too late for Be2 as white would simply capture the rook with check and take the bishop with the queen.
28,Bg6,h5g6,r2q2k1/ppp1rppp/3b1nb1/1B1n1N2/1P1P1p2/2PQ3P/P5P1/RNB2RK1 w - - 2 15,?? Nxe7 is check. Fail on coolistdude's part.
29,g4,g2g4,r2q2k1/ppp1rppp/3b1nb1/1B1n1N2/1P1P1pP1/2PQ3P/P7/RNB2RK1 b - g3 0 15,"Fortunately, white did not see this. 15. ... fxg3 e.p. is an interesting continuation, although I think it gives better attacking chances for white."
30,c6,c7c6,r2q2k1/pp2rppp/2pb1nb1/1B1n1N2/1P1P1pP1/2PQ3P/P7/RNB2RK1 w - - 0 16,Still not seeing the check in Nxe7

33,gxf5,g4f5,r2q2k1/pp2rppp/2pb1n2/3n1P2/1PBP1p2/2PQ3P/P7/RNB2RK1 b - - 0 17,I am now eyeing his king as his pawns are no longer near him.
34,Ne3,d5e3,r2q2k1/pp2rppp/2pb1n2/5P2/1PBP1p2/2PQn2P/P7/RNB2RK1 w - - 1 18,I am now eyeing his king as his pawns are no longer near him.
35,Bxe3,c1e3,r2q2k1/pp2rppp/2pb1n2/5P2/1PBP1p2/2PQB2P/P7/RN3RK1 b - - 0 18,I don't like this move. I think it was better to move the rook and attempt to cope with the pesky knight until it could be more safely exchanged.
36,Rxe3,e7e3,r2q2k1/pp3ppp/2pb1n2/5P2/1PBP1p2/2PQr2P/P7/RN3RK1 w - - 0 19,The queen has next to no where to go.
37,Qc2,d3c2,r2q2k1/pp3ppp/2pb1n2/5P2/1PBP1p2/2P1r2P/P1Q5/RN3RK1 b - - 1 19,The queen has next to no where to go.
