1,b3,b2b3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi all! This is a game from a while back (actually the sister game to my annotation called Dangerous Deviation) that I flagged for annotation because it showcases a variety of different elements, but revolves around one basic theme: planning. I hope you find it enjoyable and useful! I begin with Larsen's Opening out of a desire to play something new--so White's plan right out of the gate is to fianchetto his QB and reach across the a1-h8 diagonal into the Black kingside."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"Somewhat tame for my tastes, though I'm not overly familiar with any of the lines in this opening. b4 is probably a perfectly acceptable place to put this Bishop, since a2-a3 to drive it away will badly weaken White's queenside at this point."
3,Bb2,c1b2,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/8/1P6/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 2 2,"Somewhat tame for my tastes, though I'm not overly familiar with any of the lines in this opening. b4 is probably a perfectly acceptable place to put this Bishop, since a2-a3 to drive it away will badly weaken White's queenside at this point."
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/8/1P6/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Somewhat tame for my tastes, though I'm not overly familiar with any of the lines in this opening. b4 is probably a perfectly acceptable place to put this Bishop, since a2-a3 to drive it away will badly weaken White's queenside at this point."
5,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2P5/1P6/PB1PPPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"Somewhat tame for my tastes, though I'm not overly familiar with any of the lines in this opening. b4 is probably a perfectly acceptable place to put this Bishop, since a2-a3 to drive it away will badly weaken White's queenside at this point."
6,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/ppppbppp/4pn2/8/2P5/1P6/PB1PPPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"Somewhat tame for my tastes, though I'm not overly familiar with any of the lines in this opening. b4 is probably a perfectly acceptable place to put this Bishop, since a2-a3 to drive it away will badly weaken White's queenside at this point."
7,e4,e2e4,rnbqk2r/ppppbppp/4pn2/8/2P1P3/1P6/PB1P1PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,Taking advantage of the pin on Black's Knight. White's goals for the opening are to control space (especially the center) and develop his pieces to active locations--nothing special there.
8,d6,d7d6,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/3ppn2/8/2P1P3/1P6/PB1P1PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"?! This is a waiting move, with thoughts of supporting a push down the kingside eventually (remember the Bb2's purpose), but probably 5.Nf3 is better, just playing simple, clean developing moves."
9,h3,h2h3,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/3ppn2/8/2P1P3/1P5P/PB1P1PP1/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"?! This is a waiting move, with thoughts of supporting a push down the kingside eventually (remember the Bb2's purpose), but probably 5.Nf3 is better, just playing simple, clean developing moves."
10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/3ppn2/8/2P1P3/1P5P/PB1P1PP1/RN1QKBNR w KQ - 1 6,Threatening ...Nxe4.
11,Nc3,b1c3,rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/3ppn2/8/2P1P3/1PN4P/PB1P1PP1/R2QKBNR b KQ - 2 6,?! With his pawn still on e6 this is okay... but Black must be careful of making his d-pawn backwards and very weak.
12,c5,c7c5,rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/3ppn2/2p5/2P1P3/1PN4P/PB1P1PP1/R2QKBNR w KQ - 0 7,?! With his pawn still on e6 this is okay... but Black must be careful of making his d-pawn backwards and very weak.
13,Nf3,g1f3,rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/3ppn2/2p5/2P1P3/1PN2N1P/PB1P1PP1/R2QKB1R b KQ - 1 7,"White sees the weakened d6 pawn and decides to open the d-file, anticipating potential play against d6 down the road."
14,Nc6,b8c6,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2nppn2/2p5/2P1P3/1PN2N1P/PB1P1PP1/R2QKB1R w KQ - 2 8,"White sees the weakened d6 pawn and decides to open the d-file, anticipating potential play against d6 down the road."
15,d4,d2d4,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2nppn2/2p5/2PPP3/1PN2N1P/PB3PP1/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 8,"White sees the weakened d6 pawn and decides to open the d-file, anticipating potential play against d6 down the road."
16,cxd4,c5d4,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2nppn2/8/2PpP3/1PN2N1P/PB3PP1/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 9,"Preventing a Nb5 incursion, which would threaten d6."
17,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2nppn2/8/2PNP3/1PN4P/PB3PP1/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 9,"Preventing a Nb5 incursion, which would threaten d6."
18,a6,a7a6,r1bq1rk1/1p2bppp/p1nppn2/8/2PNP3/1PN4P/PB3PP1/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 10,"Preventing a Nb5 incursion, which would threaten d6."
19,Nxc6,d4c6,r1bq1rk1/1p2bppp/p1Nppn2/8/2P1P3/1PN4P/PB3PP1/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 10,"?! This seems to bolster the Black d-pawn unnecessarily, without a lot of gain for White. 10.Be2 was probably better."
20,bxc6,b7c6,r1bq1rk1/4bppp/p1pppn2/8/2P1P3/1PN4P/PB3PP1/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 11,"The center will open soon as now White cannot stop ...d5, so he prevents a Queen exchange (as with his limited space a Queen trade would favor Black). White's midgame plan is now taking shape: he will place his pieces behind his pawns for an eventual assault through the center and against the BK, using his slight spacial advantage. Then, when he can, he will play e4-e5 to initiate his attack by activating many pieces at once."
21,Bd3,f1d3,r1bq1rk1/4bppp/p1pppn2/8/2P1P3/1PNB3P/PB3PP1/R2QK2R b KQ - 1 11,"The center will open soon as now White cannot stop ...d5, so he prevents a Queen exchange (as with his limited space a Queen trade would favor Black).

Black wants to let his QB out, but the White squares are pretty well locked down already; it's not going to have any prospects on e6. Better was probably 11...Qc7 in preparation for ...d5. The text makes d6 into a weakness again."
23,O-O,e1g1,r1bq1rk1/4bppp/p1pp1n2/4p3/2P1P3/1PNB3P/PB3PP1/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 12,"With the Black pawn on e5, White will not be able to push his own, so he removes the blockade."

26,exf4,e5f4,r2q1rk1/4bppp/p1ppbn2/8/2P1Pp2/1PNB3P/PB4P1/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 14,Considering a sac on h3 to blow the WK's castle wide open.
27,Rxf4,f1f4,r2q1rk1/4bppp/p1ppbn2/8/2P1PR2/1PNB3P/PB4P1/R2Q2K1 b - - 0 14,Considering a sac on h3 to blow the WK's castle wide open.
28,Qd7,d8d7,r4rk1/3qbppp/p1ppbn2/8/2P1PR2/1PNB3P/PB4P1/R2Q2K1 w - - 1 15,Considering a sac on h3 to blow the WK's castle wide open.
29,Qf3,d1f3,r4rk1/3qbppp/p1ppbn2/8/2P1PR2/1PNB1Q1P/PB4P1/R5K1 b - - 2 15,"White develops, defends h3, and puts some indirect pressure on f7 and c6. White's plan here is still simple: if he can coax Black into playing ...c5, he'll load up on the d file and crush the d6 pawn. However, we must assume the opponent will not weaken himself for us--so we prepare for that eventual e4-e5 push to activate all the White pieces at once."
30,a5,a6a5,r4rk1/3qbppp/2ppbn2/p7/2P1PR2/1PNB1Q1P/PB4P1/R5K1 w - - 0 16,"?! Black aims for some queenside counterplay in an attempt to defuse White's attack. Assuming you're being attacked but not in immediate danger, a counter in another area of the board is a good way to produce complications and ease the pressure. Of course in this case, White can pretty much ignore it as Black has nothing else he can do with that pawn right away."
31,Re1,a1e1,r4rk1/3qbppp/2ppbn2/p7/2P1PR2/1PNB1Q1P/PB4P1/4R1K1 b - - 1 16,"This is White's weakest piece right now, so steps should be taken to better it. It's intending to arrive on f5, via either d4 or g3--and hoping that Nd4 will provoke Black to weaken his d-pawn further with ...c5 along the way. This move also lets White's powerful DSB reach across the board, to e5 and beyond."
32,Rac8,a8c8,2r2rk1/3qbppp/2ppbn2/p7/2P1PR2/1PNB1Q1P/PB4P1/4R1K1 w - - 2 17,"This is White's weakest piece right now, so steps should be taken to better it.

35,Nd4,e2d4,2r1nrk1/3qbppp/2ppb3/p7/2PNPR2/1P1B1Q1P/PB4P1/4R1K1 b - - 5 18,? Mistimed; Black can now force the Knight off the board because the Rf4 is trapped...
36,Bg5,e7g5,2r1nrk1/3q1ppp/2ppb3/p5b1/2PNPR2/1P1B1Q1P/PB4P1/4R1K1 w - - 6 19,"! This is a good shot; Black doesn't fall to the temptation of ...c5, which would probably be a fatal mistake because of the backwards d-pawn on the half-open file. Instead, he forces White to trade off the Knight before it can reach f5."
37,Nxe6,d4e6,2r1nrk1/3q1ppp/2ppN3/p5b1/2P1PR2/1P1B1Q1P/PB4P1/4R1K1 b - - 0 19,"?! With even material but less activity, Black should be looking to trade down to a simpler position with 20...Bf6. Leaving the White Bishops uncontested along their huge diagonals is a very dangerous proposition."
38,Qxe6,d7e6,2r1nrk1/5ppp/2ppq3/p5b1/2P1PR2/1P1B1Q1P/PB4P1/4R1K1 w - - 0 20,"?! With even material but less activity, Black should be looking to trade down to a simpler position with 20...Bf6. Leaving the White Bishops uncontested along their huge diagonals is a very dangerous proposition."
