4,f6,f7f6,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,This is where the lesson begins. This is a o.k move for black. White will show the consequences of this move if black plays poorly.
5,Nxe5,f3e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"White took advantage of black's ""f6"". For those who do not know, the white knight can't be taken OR ELSE.  A good move for black now is Qe7 which will regain the pawn."
6,fxe5,f6e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"And the game is already over if white knows what to do. In this case, white knew."
7,Qh5+,d1h5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4p2Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"A very good move. g6 is horrible (Not the song) because it would lose the rook and a pawn after Qxe5+. Black's only ""good"" option is to move the king."
