He recommends playing e4 only after Black commits to e5, but the white formation is one that English players are often familiar with and rely on.  I believe the my experience with the position will pay off."

Nd5 is routinely played, but it results in trading the knight for black's blockaded bishop.  The center is firmly locked down which allows a kingside assault in certain circumstances."

I think 23.Qxf7 Rf8 24.Qxf8+ Rxf8 25.Rxf8+ Kc7 is a fair bargain for white, but with a queen still on the board, I white has to play fairly carefully.  I actually compelled the trade because knights often do strange things and have considerable power joined with the queen."
