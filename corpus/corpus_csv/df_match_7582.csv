1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi again everyone!

Here is the game I promised you.  This time my opponent is a former Class A player but his rating has just started getting back to what is was.  Thankfully it was against me that he got the blip!  We start off with a double king pawn opening and then I play the Ruy Lopez (3. Bb5).  In the middlegame I get my usual attack of passivitis but guess what, my opponent gets spiked on that hedgehog again and gets his rook trapped.  He must drop the exchange to extricate it.  Henry then survives a mating attack.  I return the exchange and finish two pawns up in a Q and P ending, so how does it become two against one?  Well, read on ....."
