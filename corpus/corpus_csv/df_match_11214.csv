Advice no 2 : The great escape.
One of the obvious things you can check before making the move you have chosen is : If you have a piece that is more advanced in the enemy’s territory, be sure that piece has an escape route, and that it can not be trapped by the opponent’s pieces (or pawns). This is especially true if that piece is your queen.

Of course, this advice can be reversed. You can check if you can trap an enemy piece."

Reason number one for this move : when you are ahead in material, exchange pieces, as Confucius would have said if chess had been invented in his epoch (or was it?). Here, this general principle applies doubly, as the white knight was dangerously placed. And, as a bonus, the white queen no longer threatens, even if inderectly, the weak h6 pawn. But black will still have to be very careful to get his pieces out and come to the rescue of the king."

The idea was to attack the weak h6 pawn while also opening the g file. Excellent plan. But here it falls short because the execution is faulty. It would have been better to first play the king to h1, then put the rook on the g file, and then push the pawns. The problem with the present position is that the queen is alone to try and attack the king, while the black pieces are all relatively well placed to replace the missing pawns in front of the king. But with the rook ready to come in, it would have been a different story. Of course, during all this preparation, black would have had time to regroup. But at least, this leaves a chance for error on the black side, if he does not prepare well to meet white's plan."
