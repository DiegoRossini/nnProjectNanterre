18,Rc8,a8c8,2rqkb1r/1p1bpp1p/p1np1p2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPPQ1PPP/2KR1B1R w k - 2 10,The pieces are set for a direct attack for black as well. Whoever has the fastest attack will prevail.
19,Nf5,d4f5,2rqkb1r/1p1bpp1p/p1np1p2/5N2/4P3/2N5/PPPQ1PPP/2KR1B1R b k - 3 10,"Perhaps this move is not the best one. the e7 seems like a weak point, but for the time being, I don't see any effective way to attack this pawn. Sacrificing the knight on e7 results in the black bishop defending the d6 pawn, which is not really helping. Nd5 is also no longer possible for white due to e6. I personally favour f4, threatening e5 to break open the center, though I did not check this with a chess engine."

The knight is attacking the f7 pawn, but I don't see a fast way to attack that pawn again. Qd5 isn't a viable option because of Be6, making the bishop more active while winning a tempo in the process."

Kb1 Bxa4 16. bxa4 Qxa4 and black wins a pawn, while still having active play against white's king. After Nd5, the game would continue the same way it did right now."

14. cxb3 Qxd2 15. Rxd2 Bxh6 and black is a piece up.
14. a3 bxc2+ 15. Kxc2(15. Qxc2 Bxh6) Qxd2+ and the knight on h6 hangs."
