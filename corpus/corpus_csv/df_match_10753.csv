Black's attack never really gets off the ground (as he goes in for a dubious variation on the 20th move) and the position flirts with disaster for a long time and eventually he solves his immediate problems at the cost of simplifying into an excruciating endgame. White's handling of the position leaves a very strong impression."

Of course b3 is a great defensive square for the bishop, but it is double-edged as the coming pawn storm on the queenside often targets this piece's lack of outpost squares. There are many alternatives.
Alternative variation: [ An interesting sideline is] 11. h4 [ (obviously not 11.g4? as examined previously)] b5 12. Bb3 a5 [ When White has to suck it up and play] 13. Ndxb5 [ (or else the b3 bishop is in serious trouble)] a4 14. Bxa4 [ with 2 pawns and a very sharp position, e.g.] Qa5 15. h5 Ne5 16. hxg6 Bxb5 17. Bxb5 Rxb5 18. Nxb5 Qxa2 19. Nc3 Qa1  20. Nb1 Nc4 21. gxf7  Kh8 22. Qb4 Nd5 [ when White's head has exploded! Of course not all of that is forced, and even in this position it is rather unclear, but certainly White has to solve a lot of problems just to dispel Black's initiative and that is rarely fun for the first player. Unexplored and excessively complicated positions like these are one of the perks of the 'Chinese Dragon.' These sidelines have not been reduced to endgames and forced draws as in more mainstream systems.]"

Black can still play ... b5 and ..Nc4, but now he has other options that White must consider. For instance, ...Nxb3 might be useful at some point, and even ...e5 has some merit (after trading off the Dragon bishop).
Alternative variation: [ Black can also continue more actively with] 11... b5 [but lately] 12. Nxc6 Bxc6 13. Bxa7 [has garnered much attention. It's hard to believe in this for White, but it's basically a favorable variation of the 11. Nxc6?! idea. Concrete analysis seems to show that White can hold the pawn and not suffer too badly for it, and it's not so obvious how Black will generate activity when his pieces have no means to quickly contest the b3 bishop.] Ra8 14.

Since it's hard for White to pressure the d-pawn with his heavy pieces aimed at the kingside, Black reasons that this weakness is less important than the 'here-and-now' considerations of generating active counterplay.
