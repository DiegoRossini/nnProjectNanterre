The ebook however concludes that immediate castling is fractionally better and is a very useful waiting move: White gets time to have a look at how Black intends to deploy his minor pieces.
A game, [Llaneza [2455] - Martinez [2403]; Madrid 2007], illustrates how just a single slip can quickly lead Black into difficulties.
