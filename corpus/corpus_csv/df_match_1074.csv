1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is a very turbulent game played between myself (White, 1615) and harmo (1727).
It is played in the extremely aggressive Muzio Gambit line of the King's Gambit, in which white sacrifices a Knight to develop quickly and attack the black king with dynamic and active (though outnumbered) pieces.
But is that enough?"
