Since publication lighttotheright have commented on a few occasions where my analysis haven't been correct. I have introduced these corrections to the annotation and marked which are lighttotherights."

11,h4,h2h4,rnbqk2r/pppnbppp/4p3/3pP1B1/3P3P/2N5/PPP2PP1/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,"... and here the opening gets the name Alekhine-Chatard version of the French defence. The general idea is to sacrifice the h-pawn to get a swift attack going on the king side. White is hoping for BxB, pxB, Qxp and then either Nh3 or Nf3 forcing the queen to retreat. White now have a half open h-file and can play either Bd3 or Qg4 as a continuation of the attack."
12,c5,c7c5,rnbqk2r/pp1nbppp/4p3/2ppP1B1/3P3P/2N5/PPP2PP1/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,"But Black has other ideas. Challenge the center! This is my first move, but it's still a book move."
13,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk2r/pp1nbppp/4p3/2ppP1B1/3P3P/2N2N2/PPP2PP1/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 7,White defends the pawn.
14,Qb6,d8b6,rnb1k2r/pp1nbppp/1q2p3/2ppP1B1/3P3P/2N2N2/PPP2PP1/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 8,"Black has no plan (at this point) of taking d4 with the pawn. Black instead put more pressure on d4 hoping to intice white to the exchange pxp, Nxp putting the the Black knight on a good square (c5) near the center as well as clearing d7 for the White bishop."
15,Rb1,a1b1,rnb1k2r/pp1nbppp/1q2p3/2ppP1B1/3P3P/2N2N2/PPP2PP1/1R1QKB1R b Kkq - 3 8,"White wastes a move. Black has no intention taking on b2. I was surprised to see White react to this phantom threat. In this opening White usually castles queen side as he has more or less committed to a king side attack. Although not a bad move (lighttotheright analysis), moving the rook takes queen side castling away."
16,Nc6,b8c6,r1b1k2r/pp1nbppp/1qn1p3/2ppP1B1/3P3P/2N2N2/PPP2PP1/1R1QKB1R w Kkq - 4 9,Developing a piece and putting more pressure on d4 (and e5 mind you :-) . I feel confident at this point knowing I will have a good game. White have reacted to my moves and have forgot about his king side attack.
17,b3,b2b3,r1b1k2r/pp1nbppp/1qn1p3/2ppP1B1/3P3P/1PN2N2/P1P2PP1/1R1QKB1R b Kkq - 0 9,White looses another tempo. If he wanted to protect the pawn he should have played this move directly. Better might have been 9. Bxe7 or 9. Na4 (lighttotherights analysis). The king still have two sides on his coffin...
18,cxd4,c5d4,r1b1k2r/pp1nbppp/1qn1p3/3pP1B1/3p3P/1PN2N2/P1P2PP1/1R1QKB1R w Kkq - 0 10,BAM! I see that I can remove a pawn for free and gladly take it. [Annotation corrected after lighttotherights comment].

20,Bc5,e7c5,r1b1k2r/pp1n1ppp/1qn1p3/2bpP1B1/3p3P/1P3N2/P1P1NPP1/1R1QKB1R w Kkq - 2 11,"The black bishop was marked for destruction, only waiting to be taken on e7 (usually the case in the french defence), forcing the king to guard duty and preventing him from castling. Now the bishop guards d4 AND forms a deadly battery along the g1-a7 diagonal."
