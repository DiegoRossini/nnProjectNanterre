5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"personally i dont like having a queen in the middle of the board so early on, however it is a dangerous threat and in this game i ignored it. also look already how black is behind in development! due to not playing kings pawn openings enough myself as white i am a bit of a stranger to the tricks and traps."

8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/8/3QP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 1 5,(better probably was Bd7)
9,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/1B6/3QP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 2 5,"i tink this was a waste of time, though i was unwilling to double pawns on the b file, which with heindsight might have been better."

11,Bxc6,b5c6,r2qkbnr/pppb1ppp/2Bp4/8/3QP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 6,"a bad move by white surely? it looses a tempo and establishes a strong outpost for my white squared buishop, however it does remove any attacks (for now) on the central queen."
12,Bxc6,d7c6,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2bp4/8/3QP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 7,what is the correct move for black here? please someone tell me! i played Nf6 (thinking that it was good for development) is h6 better? followed by the ability to create a queenside castled king in a fianchetto? i think it might be.
13,Nc3,b1c3,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2bp4/8/3QP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 1 7,what is the correct move for black here? please someone tell me! i played Nf6 (thinking that it was good for development) is h6 better? followed by the ability to create a queenside castled king in a fianchetto? i think it might be.
14,Nf6,g8f6,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2bp1n2/8/3QP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 2 8,"look at the positional difference! white has all the space,  black has barely developed at all!"
15,Bg5,c1g5,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2bp1n2/6B1/3QP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 3 8,"look at the positional difference! white has all the space,  black has barely developed at all!"

17,O-O-O,e1c1,r2qk2r/ppp1bppp/2bp1n2/6B1/3QP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b kq - 5 9,"look at the positional difference! white has all the space,  black has barely developed at all!"
18,Qd7,d8d7,r3k2r/pppqbppp/2bp1n2/6B1/3QP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/2KR3R w kq - 6 10,in hope of queenside castleing perhaps? though this is imposible whilst the queen remains threatening the a pawn.
19,Rhe1,h1e1,r3k2r/pppqbppp/2bp1n2/6B1/3QP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/2KRR3 b kq - 7 10,"whites strong central attack is sure to claim some victims here but what moves does black have? perhpas quenside castling would be strong, except for the a pawn, a timely h6 may also have done the trick here followed either by g5 or by establishing a bishop on f6 - though blacks attack here is unfocused, there are no two pieces working in conjunction on a single target."
20,O-O,e8g8,r4rk1/pppqbppp/2bp1n2/6B1/3QP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/2KRR3 w - - 8 11,definately the wrong move.  e5 is now devestating as the queen cannot hold out on d7 without more protection.
21,e5,e4e5,r4rk1/pppqbppp/2bp1n2/4P1B1/3Q4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/2KRR3 b - - 0 11,!

23,gxf3,g2f3,r4rk1/pppqbppp/3p1n2/4P1B1/3Q4/2N2P2/PPP2P1P/2KRR3 b - - 0 12,"perhaps playing c4 would have been more interesting here? or playing the knight onto e8 may have saved something of blacks position, both of which are better than putting the knight on the wing."
24,Nh5,f6h5,r4rk1/pppqbppp/3p4/4P1Bn/3Q4/2N2P2/PPP2P1P/2KRR3 w - - 1 13,finally some counterplay!
