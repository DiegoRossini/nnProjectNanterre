11,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,Black was in two minds to move pawn e6 or e5. Black is rethinking his opening repertoire and moving from Scheveningen (e6) to a more aggressive Najdorf (e5) (pron. Najdorf).  Black also believes a player shouldn't use openings where you have to look up the spelling for.

So Opening books prefer Nb3, for a while I din't understand why the Knight would run so far away from the action (a Knight that's now moved 3 times aswell).  Someone like András Adorján may applaud Nf5.  But on this occasion Black saw that the d1-h5 diagonal was blocked, so attempted to take advantage."
