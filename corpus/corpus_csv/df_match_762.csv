9,Ne5,f3e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/4N3/4PppP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,The white horse moves out of harms way as expected. The black pawn on g4 is now quaking in his boots because the white queen and the white horse are threatening to eat him for lunch.
10,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1p1p/5n2/4N3/4PppP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,"Black develops a horse which threatens the White pawn on e4 and also gives some protection to that scared pawn on g4, but its not enough."

It keeps the white pawn from advancing and therefore takes the pressure off of the f7 pawn.  It also threatens the white horse who stands unprotected at present.

20,Ne4,f6e4,rnbq1rk1/ppp2p1p/8/2bPN3/2B1nppP/8/PPPPQ1P1/RNB2R1K w - - 7 11,"The black horse offers himself up as a sacrifice.  He is hoping that queens like the taste of horse meat.

White examines all his options and decides to resign after only 10 moves.

Black is thinking, wow, I better annotate this thing so I can remember how to do it the next time someone tries the Kings Gambit."
