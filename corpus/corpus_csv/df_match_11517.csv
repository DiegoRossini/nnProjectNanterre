My only guess is that he's opening up the e8-h5 diagonal so that he can get his queen free without giving me the discovered attack."

The next move has to be either Qh6 or Qg4, neither of which is really all that threatening.  He has the option of exchanging bishops and trading his remaining bishop for my knight, but I don't see how that would help.

Right now I'm looking at Nxf2, forking the rooks, but we'll see if I figure out what my opponent is up to."
31,Qh6,h5h6,r3k2r/1bqnb2p/p2pp1pQ/6B1/Bp2n2P/8/PPP1NPP1/2KR3R b kq - 1 16,"As expected.  Now, the question is why did I expect this move, and why on earth did white make it?  It's a horrible move!  Must be something in the water.  I really did not see it until several minutes of staring at the board.  That's twice now in a couple of weeks that I've won a major piece by exploiting an illusionary pin.
The other alternative, Qg4, would have left me scrambling to avoid a mate (which I think I would have, with advantage).  Lucky me."
32,Bf8,e7f8,r3kb1r/1bqn3p/p2pp1pQ/6B1/Bp2n2P/8/PPP1NPP1/2KR3R w kq - 2 17,"With nowhere to go, the best for which white can hope is to claim my bishop in exchange for his queen.  He can forstall the exchange a little by Bxd7, but that only delays the inevitable, and leaves him even more disadvantaged after the queen trade.  White's best move would probably be to break up the rook fork and claim my bishop after the trade.
As I rather expected, though, after this move, white resigned."
