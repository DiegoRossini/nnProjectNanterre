16,h6,h7h6,rnbqkb1r/5pp1/p2ppn1p/1p6/3NP1P1/2N1BP2/PPP4P/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 9,9....... b4 - now it is Freddy's turn to attack a knight on c3!

19,Nce2,c3e2,rnbqkb1r/5pp1/p2ppn1p/8/1p1NP1P1/4BP2/PPPQN2P/R3KB1R b KQkq - 1 10,10. Nce2 - as there is a pawn on e6 going to d5 is not an option here.
20,e5,e6e5,rnbqkb1r/5pp1/p2p1n1p/4p3/1p1NP1P1/4BP2/PPPQN2P/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 11,11. Nb3 - now the d4 horsie is driven back.

23,Rd1,a1d1,rnbqkb1r/5pp1/3p1n1p/p3p3/1p2P1P1/1N2BP2/PPPQN2P/3RKB1R b Kkq - 1 12,12. Rd1 - white piles up on the backward d pawn.  He eschews castling long.  I think he wants to keep his king in the middle for some reason.  It is safe - at least for now.
24,a4,a5a4,rnbqkb1r/5pp1/3p1n1p/4p3/pp2P1P1/1N2BP2/PPPQN2P/3RKB1R w Kkq - 0 13,"12. ...... a4 - maybe this is why he decided not to castle long.  The horsie on b3 must retreat again, so Master Albertwall ensures that it has a reasonable square to retreat to.  It must be noted that in Freddy's other game with Albertwall, he put a knight on c1 with the intent to move it to d3 at a convenient moment."
25,Nbc1,b3c1,rnbqkb1r/5pp1/3p1n1p/4p3/pp2P1P1/4BP2/PPPQN2P/2NRKB1R b Kkq - 1 13,13. ...... Nc6 - development.
26,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/5pp1/2np1n1p/4p3/pp2P1P1/4BP2/PPPQN2P/2NRKB1R w Kkq - 2 14,13. ...... Nc6 - development.

Ng3 - this move gives the knight possibilities of hanging out on h5 or f5 should the knight on f6 should move, or if black's lsb moves off the c8-h3 diagonal.  At the moment white will not want to compromise his pawn structure if he does move that knight to those squares."
28,Qa5,d8a5,r1b1kb1r/5pp1/2np1n1p/q3p3/pp2P1P1/4BPN1/PPPQ3P/2NRKB1R w Kkq - 4 15,14. ...... Qa5 - this queen move gives additional support to the pawns on a4 and b4.

Freddy trades bishop for knight but busts up his opponent's pawn structure as compensation.  Freddy must be wary of the open g file, however, because there is a possibility of white putting his heavies on that file and it could be a little dodgy for Freddy if he chooses to castle on the kingside."
30,Bxf5,c8f5,r3kb1r/5pp1/2np1n1p/q3pb2/pp2P1P1/4BP2/PPPQ3P/2NRKB1R w Kkq - 0 16,"16. gxf5 - that horsie did move to f5.

His king is looking very draughty, do you all agree?   I will talk about the second portent of the purpose of castling, it brings a rook to the centre and this rook ensures that Freddy will win back his pawn.  He has got rid of the weak d6 pawn, which, when I have been on the receiving end of a Sicilian Defence have often snaffled it up when playing with people near my own rating bracket.  The knight on c6 cannot be taken as white will drop his queen for rook and knight and the doubleton c pawn will be rounded up and this exchange will be unfavourable to white.  The pawn on d5 is therefore pinned."
33,exd5,e4d5,r3kb1r/5pp1/2n2n1p/q2PpP2/pp6/4BP2/PPPQ3P/2NRKB1R b Kkq - 0 17,"17. ......... 0-0-0 - a brave decision from Freddy.  He castles into an open position.
