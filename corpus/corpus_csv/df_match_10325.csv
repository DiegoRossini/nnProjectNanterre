6,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1Bb1p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,"Ok this is different. Either my opponent is unfamiliar with this line, or is playing a little known subvariation. Notice two pieces aiming to control the d4 square, one of which can inevitably be bumped away. Another reason to play this could be to develop the black square outside the pawn chain"
7,c3,c2c3,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1Bb1p3/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,"Common Ruy move. Leaves a posy for my white squared friend, and threatens a pawn push to d4"
8,a6,a7a6,r1bqk1nr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/1Bb1p3/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"Better is Bxc6, dxc6, Nxe5"
9,Ba4,b5a4,r1bqk1nr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/2b1p3/B3P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,"Better is Bxc6, dxc6, Nxe5"
10,b5,b7b5,r1bqk1nr/2pp1ppp/p1n5/1pb1p3/B3P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"We are now well and truely out of book. The opening thus far is A70 Ruy Lopez: 3...a6 4 Ba4, Norwegian and Delayed Schliemann, which I can confidently say I have no knowledge of. Black has a eaked out a little queenside space, and fares reasonably well in the development race."
11,Bc2,a4c2,r1bqk1nr/2pp1ppp/p1n5/1pb1p3/4P3/2P2N2/PPBP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"We are now well and truely out of book.

12,d6,d7d6,r1bqk1nr/2p2ppp/p1np4/1pb1p3/4P3/2P2N2/PPBP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,Not sure about this move. His white squared bishop could already be flanked at b7
13,d4,d2d4,r1bqk1nr/2p2ppp/p1np4/1pb1p3/3PP3/2P2N2/PPB2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,Taking control of the center
14,exd4,e5d4,r1bqk1nr/2p2ppp/p1np4/1pb5/3pP3/2P2N2/PPB2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"I now have fairly uncontested control of the majority of the central squares which will be able to use to my advantage in the middle game, if can maintain this formation"
15,cxd4,c3d4,r1bqk1nr/2p2ppp/p1np4/1pb5/3PP3/5N2/PPB2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,"I now have fairly uncontested control of the majority of the central squares which will be able to use to my advantage in the middle game, if can maintain this formation"
16,Bb4+,c5b4,r1bqk1nr/2p2ppp/p1np4/1p6/1b1PP3/5N2/PPB2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 9,developing a further piece
17,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqk1nr/2p2ppp/p1np4/1p6/1b1PP3/2N2N2/PPB2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 9,developing a further piece
18,Bg4,c8g4,r2qk1nr/2p2ppp/p1np4/1p6/1b1PP1b1/2N2N2/PPB2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 3 10,Nice move here... I rather hash up this pin which cannot be thwarted immediately. The threat is Bxf3 removing both defenders from the defense of the D pawn
19,Qd3,d1d3,r2qk1nr/2p2ppp/p1np4/1p6/1b1PP1b1/2NQ1N2/PPB2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 4 10,"Although removes the pin on my queen, this doesnt help my d pawn.. better is Be3"
20,Bxf3,g4f3,r2qk1nr/2p2ppp/p1np4/1p6/1b1PP3/2NQ1b2/PPB2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 0 11,"Doh! Ugly, but necessary to avoid dropping the d pawn."
21,gxf3,g2f3,r2qk1nr/2p2ppp/p1np4/1p6/1b1PP3/2NQ1P2/PPB2P1P/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 0 11,"Doh! Ugly, but necessary to avoid dropping the d pawn."
22,Nf6,g8f6,r2qk2r/2p2ppp/p1np1n2/1p6/1b1PP3/2NQ1P2/PPB2P1P/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 1 12,aiming to castle. Misses the chance to pile up on my vulnerable d pawn with Qf6
23,Bg5,c1g5,r2qk2r/2p2ppp/p1np1n2/1p4B1/1b1PP3/2NQ1P2/PPB2P1P/R3K2R b KQkq - 2 12,responding with a pin of my own. I figured that this would either open his kingside like a tin of sardines or take time to twart. If the later I should have time to castle queenside and create pressure down the g file
24,h6,h7h6,r2qk2r/2p2pp1/p1np1n1p/1p4B1/1b1PP3/2NQ1P2/PPB2P1P/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 13,he responds by clarifying the pin
25,Bh4,g5h4,r2qk2r/2p2pp1/p1np1n1p/1p6/1b1PP2B/2NQ1P2/PPB2P1P/R3K2R b KQkq - 1 13,showing that I'm in for the long haul. g5 appears his only solace.. but at the cost of an overextended pawn position
26,g5,g7g5,r2qk2r/2p2p2/p1np1n1p/1p4p1/1b1PP2B/2NQ1P2/PPB2P1P/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 14,breaks the pin and confides my dark sq bishop to g3.. fairly even chances for both sides at this stage
27,Bg3,h4g3,r2qk2r/2p2p2/p1np1n1p/1p4p1/1b1PP3/2NQ1PB1/PPB2P1P/R3K2R b KQkq - 1 14,"I would assume we're both aiming to castle queenside here. Black should pressurise the weak pawns starting with d4. My plan will be to support my pawn structure castle queenside, and aim to consolidate upon my central advantage"
28,Nh5,f6h5,r2qk2r/2p2p2/p1np3p/1p4pn/1b1PP3/2NQ1PB1/PPB2P1P/R3K2R w KQkq - 2 15,Not sure its worth a move to threaten a correction to my pawn structure
29,O-O-O,e1c1,r2qk2r/2p2p2/p1np3p/1p4pn/1b1PP3/2NQ1PB1/PPB2P1P/2KR3R b kq - 3 15,"With the horsie falling off the edge of the board, provides me with some time to castle"
