The knight will not survive this encounter either, but the bishop COULD HAVE, and in addition WOULD HAVE taken care of business afterwards. Black made a mistake allowing this to happen, but white's sloppy attack plan makes sure it is black that benefits from it. For shame, Hilo! (Watch and see.) [Many players prefer to lose a bishop to a knight, myself included. The bishop's more of a pain in the ass piece to get a use out of come end game {pawns standing on the opposite color as a bishop prove untouchable}, and less tricky/dangerous in the beginning. But these decisions must not be made hastily, instead they must be made according to the situation, and in this situation, the horsie was the piece to lose...as wonderful as horsies are.]"
