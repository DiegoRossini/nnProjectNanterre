5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 3,I just prefer this move to the immediate d4.. I hope to mount a quick attack on f7

16,Nf6,g8f6,r2qkb1r/pppb1pp1/3p1n1p/8/2BQP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 3 9,A good move which threatens to open up the e-file completely

20,Be7,f8e7,r2qk2r/pppbbpp1/5n1p/4Q3/2B5/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 1 11,.... An error I think. This moves ensures I clamp down his position even more
21,Re1,f1e1,r2qk2r/pppbbpp1/5n1p/4Q3/2B5/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1R1K1 b kq - 2 11,!! Excellent... Now the bind becomes stronger as now my opponent can't castle and his queen is tied to the defence of the bishop on e7
22,a6,a7a6,r2qk2r/1ppbbpp1/p4n1p/4Q3/2B5/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1R1K1 w kq - 0 12,"Probably not the best continuation from me but for the mean time, I threaten to win a pawn"

25,Rad1,a1d1,r2qk2r/1p1bbpp1/p1p2n1p/4Q3/2B2B2/2N5/PPP2PPP/3RR1K1 b kq - 1 13,"... And with this move, I pin a 3rd piece (both bishops and the f6 knight)... The f6 knight isn't pinned but it is tied to the defence of g7"
26,b5,b7b5,r2qk2r/3bbpp1/p1p2n1p/1p2Q3/2B2B2/2N5/PPP2PPP/3RR1K1 w kq - 0 14,My opponent should be thinking about how to break one of the pins in his territory instead of kicking my bishop... He should try something like 13. Kf8 releasing both knight and bishop at once
27,Bb3,c4b3,r2qk2r/3bbpp1/p1p2n1p/1p2Q3/5B2/1BN5/PPP2PPP/3RR1K1 b kq - 1 14,I expected a5 from my opponent but instead he played this.. I must say that we had just 60seconds to make a move each and he had about 7seconds left before he played this.. The cool thing is this move helped me form a tactic.....
28,Ra7,a8a7,3qk2r/r2bbpp1/p1p2n1p/1p2Q3/5B2/1BN5/PPP2PPP/3RR1K1 w k - 2 15,I expected a5 from my opponent but instead he played this.. I must say that we had just 60seconds to make a move each and he had about 7seconds left before he played this.. The cool thing is this move helped me form a tactic.....
29,Be3,f4e3,3qk2r/r2bbpp1/p1p2n1p/1p2Q3/8/1BN1B3/PPP2PPP/3RR1K1 b k - 3 15,"My opponent wanted to avoid the loss of the rook but in the process, he allowed me to play........."
30,Rb7,a7b7,3qk2r/1r1bbpp1/p1p2n1p/1p2Q3/8/1BN1B3/PPP2PPP/3RR1K1 w k - 4 16,"My opponent wanted to avoid the loss of the rook but in the process, he allowed me to play........."
31,Bc5,e3c5,3qk2r/1r1bbpp1/p1p2n1p/1pB1Q3/8/1BN5/PPP2PPP/3RR1K1 b k - 5 16,!!!! This ensures my opponent losses a piece by force... Notice how my rook on d1 ensures the Bd7 dosent move in order for the rook to defend Be7
32,O-O,e8g8,3q1rk1/1r1bbpp1/p1p2n1p/1pB1Q3/8/1BN5/PPP2PPP/3RR1K1 w - - 6 17,???? And another error from my opponent... This wasn't the best way to accept the loss of a piece
33,Bxe7,c5e7,3q1rk1/1r1bBpp1/p1p2n1p/1p2Q3/8/1BN5/PPP2PPP/3RR1K1 b - - 0 17,"... Because now, he is forced to also lose the exchange.. At this point, he resigned. Many thanks for reading..."
