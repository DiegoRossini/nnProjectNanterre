I react rather badly to an unfamiliar situation..."

15,h3,h2h3,r1bq1rk1/ppp2pbp/n2p1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2N2N1P/PP2BPP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 8,"?! Aimed at blocking the light-squared bishop. 8. Re1 or 8. Be3 are more regular, but I do not study theory, preferring tactics and endgame technique as being ultimately more rewarding."
16,exd4,e5d4,r1bq1rk1/ppp2pbp/n2p1np1/8/2PpP3/2N2N1P/PP2BPP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 9,"With pressure on e4, the point of the ...Na6 manouvre."

20,Nh5,f6h5,r1bq1rk1/ppp2pbp/3p2p1/2n4n/2PNP3/2N2P1P/PP2B1P1/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 11,Eyeing f4 and g3 and opening the file for the King. White is now losing according to Fritz 8.

22,Ne6,c5e6,r1bq1rk1/ppp2pbp/3pn1p1/7n/1PPNP3/2N2P1P/P3B1P1/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 12,?? This is just suicide although my position sucks.
