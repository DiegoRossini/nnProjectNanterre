Not realising it checks the Black King and I can move straight back to d5 and still keep the threat is probably one of the things that keeps my rating low....just a result of not looking thoroughly before moving. I saw it before he moved Bf7, and yeah grr haha."

Maybe he is setting up b4, threatening the Knight on c3, but that still doesnt seem like the smartest move"
