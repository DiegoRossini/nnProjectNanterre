I was too focused on building towards a queenside attack that I didn't notice a trend that began to be apparent in the next few moves.

I've discovered that this might be a weakness of the dragon...in my past games it has seemed to depend on the pawn structure and bishop remaining in that formation. I might need to think of a defense that can answer this threat if I'm to continue using it."

At this point, I was considering a knight sacrifice for one of the pawns, probably the g4 pawn, to break up the attack, since I've experienced previous games where pawn attacks were devastating.
