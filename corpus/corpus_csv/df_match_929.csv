1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Lately I’ve been playing nothing but the English opening.  I’ve found that not only does it offer white good long-term chances in a drawn-out positional battle, but occasionally it offers relatively quick tactical victories if the opponent obliges."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,Opting for a Catalan style of game (but without black’s d5) rather than a more reserved and less ambitious “traditional” English approach with d3.  I like the space advantage and slightly more tactical opportunities presented.

It’s something I’ve been trying harder to do lately, rather than immediately committing in the center and resolving the tension before advantageous or the opponent's plans emerge."

I had second thoughts about the placement of my dark-squared bishop and didn't want to commit it yet.  It seemed okay where it was for the moment, exerting some influence on the kingside even though still undeveloped."

I was really hoping for this actually, and was surprised my opponent played it.  Perhaps he just didn’t think there was a lot of danger to his kingside, which does appear well-protected with the knight and bishop, but it turns out that he really isn’t as well-defended as might appear and could have used this knight in the defense."

I thought that my opponent would have surely seen the dangers of Bxf6 and might just simply retreat the knight right back to d7 again.  I can’t remember which GM said it, or exactly what he said, but something like “Don’t go looking for baubles on the side of the road when there are more important things going on.”"

Even though it is less forcing, it causes more damage.  Obviously, the bishop can't take the knight because after Qg4 it is mate next move."

Now, if the black bishop doesn’t take the white knight on f5, it’s mate soon after 21. Qg4+.  And, if 20….BxNf5, then after 21. QxBf5, followed by 22. Be4, it’s either mate on h7 or black has to give up his queen (after 20…Qc4 and 21…Qxe4)."
