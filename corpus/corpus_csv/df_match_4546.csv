1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"In opening like Spanish white lays siege on blacks e5 pawn slowly, over a large number of moves, but in KG white starts a storm by attacking it right away. This was a popular opening back in time and many great master used to play this aggressive opening. It could be stated as matter of honor to accept the gambit pawn."

4,exf4,e5f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Here my opponent Wildcat said that he once read that the only way to refute gambit is to accept it! I agree, that this the best move by black. Declining the gambit usually lets white to keep atleast a small advantage in my opinion quite easily. Falkbeer Counter-Gambit(2...e5) is the interesting play by black and those who want to play KG should look for ways to deal with it."
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,I mainly encourage KG players to play this Knight Gambit(3.Nf3) instead of playing Bishop Gambit(3. Bc4). I vary lot between these two in blitz games but I just find it hard to find place for 3.Bc4 in longer games. Knight Gambit prepares to seize the center and keeps the nasty Qh4 check out.
6,h6,h7h6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1pp1/7p/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,Becker Defence. It seems that black wants to hold his f-pawn by playing move 3...h6 and same idea can be seen in some other KG variations(in Becker black just doesn't need to keep the same weaknesses). White usually decides to play move like h4 to undermine blacks pawn chain on kingside.
7,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1pp1/7p/8/3PPp2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,Here white has alternative 4.b3 with idea to stop black from playing ...g5. If you want to vary with your opening then you should give some time analysing 4.b3 aswell. Classical play is to go for 4.Bc4 g5 which is not my personal favourite but you can play it(note that 5.Ne5 doesn't cause any harm as black just play 5....Rh7! in Classical).
8,g5,g7g5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p2/7p/6p1/3PPp2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"In here, I just say that you should play this knight move developing a piece and knight belongs here. 5.h4 is just not good idea as after 5...Bg7 I don't know what white is about to do. Lets say: 6.g3(just a try) g4 7.Ne5 d6 8.Nxf7 Kxf7 9.Bc4+ Ke8 10.gxf4 is not that good for white."
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p2/7p/6p1/3PPp2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"In here, I just say that you should play this knight move developing a piece and knight belongs here. 5.h4 is just not good idea as after 5...Bg7 I don't know what white is about to do. Lets say: 6.g3(just a try) g4 7.Ne5 d6 8.Nxf7 Kxf7 9.Bc4+ Ke8 10.gxf4 is not that good for white."
10,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2p2/3p3p/6p1/3PPp2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"So in here 5...Bb4 idea doesn't work for black 6.h4 g4 7.Ne5 d6 8.Nxg4, white is better. 5...g4 and white does alright after 6.Bxf4 gxf3 7. hxg3 d6 8.0-0-0 knight is sacrificed for lead in development and good position. So if black goes for 5...Bg7(good alternative to ...d6) 6.g3 fxg3 7.hxg3 d6 then you can either go for 8.Bc4 recommended by Joe Gallagher in his book or then go for my move 8.Qd3 as after 8...Nf6 9.Be2 0-0 white can play 10.Nxg5 hxg5 11.Bxg5 Re8 12.0-0-0 with good position."
11,g3,g2g3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2p2/3p3p/6p1/3PPp2/2N2NP1/PPP4P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,White has to do something about blacks pawn chain so this move is logical creating counterplay.
12,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk1nr/ppp2pb1/3p3p/6p1/3PPp2/2N2NP1/PPP4P/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,"I would say that this is the critical move here. 6...g4 fails and it is against Beckers idea to hold kingside with 3...h3. Example: 6...g4 7.Ng1(even 7.Bxf4 is possible with strong attack arising after 7...gxf3 8.Qxf3 Nc6 9.0-0-0) 7...f3 8.h3 is good for white. After 6...fxg3 we can follow the game Fedorov - Notkin, 7.hxg3 Bg7 8.Bc4 Nc6 9.Be3 Bg4 10.0-0 Nf6 11.Qd3 0-0 12.Nxg5 hxg5 13.Bxg5 Nb4 14.Qd2 and white should be doing ok(Fedorov won that game). But I have also encountered someone saying that in here engine would prefer 6...a6?! which looks bad... as white gets strong attack again after 7. gxf4 g4 8.Be3 gxf3 9.Qxf3 Nf6 10.Rg1 Nc6 11.0-0-0 and white is better."

15,Be3,c1e3,rnbqk1nr/ppp2pb1/3p3p/8/3PPPp1/2N1BN2/PPP4P/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 8,Some alternative would be 8. Rg1. I have played the move 8.Ng1 mostly(Gallagher mentions only that move in his book) but there are some problems so lets take a look: 8.Ng1 Qh4+ 9.Ke2 and now Gallagher mentions only the move 9...g3 when 10.Nf3 Bg4 11.Be3 gxh2(11. ..Nc6 12.Kd2 Qh5 13.Be2 g2 14.Rg1 Qh3 15.d5 Nce7 16.Nd4) 12.Kd2 Qg3 13.Be2 Nc6 14.Nxh2 better for white. I say this needs to be updated though as black can just play 9...Nc6 and remain better for example: 10.Be3 Bd7 11.d5 Nce7 12.Bd4 Rh7! 13.Bxg7 Rxg7 14.Qd4 Nf6 15.Bg2 Ng6 and black is better.

20,f5,f7f5,rnbqk1nr/ppp3b1/3p4/5p1p/3PPP2/2N1BQ1P/PPP5/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 11,Lets take a look at other examples so to find out why this is reasonable choice: 10...Bh6 11.0-0-0 Ne7 12.Rg1 is good for white. 10...c5 11.0-0-0 cxd4 12. Bxd4 Bxd4 13.Rxd4 Nc6 14.Rd2 Rh6 15.f5 a6 16.Qf4 Ne5 17.Be2 is also good for white. 10...c6 11.0-0-0 b5 12.Rg1 Bh6 13.a3 a5 14.d5 b4 15.dxc6 bxc3 16.Bb5 cxb2+ 17.Kxb2 again good for white. So 10...f5 is a good try to fight against strong center of white.
21,e5,e4e5,rnbqk1nr/ppp3b1/3p4/4Pp1p/3P1P2/2N1BQ1P/PPP5/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 11,This push gains space and taking the pawn would be suicidal.

24,Rh7,h8h7,rnbqk3/ppp1n1br/3p4/4Pp1p/3P1P2/2N1BQ1P/PPP5/R3KBR1 w Qq - 3 13,Protecting bishop and 12...Rg8? is a mistake as it leaves h-pawn without protection. Black has a bit cramped position here.
25,O-O-O,e1c1,rnbqk3/ppp1n1br/3p4/4Pp1p/3P1P2/2N1BQ1P/PPP5/2KR1BR1 b q - 4 13,! The best move in this position by black. Keeping any d4-d5 plans away and trying to delay whites attacking plans.
26,d5,d6d5,rnbqk3/ppp1n1br/8/3pPp1p/3P1P2/2N1BQ1P/PPP5/2KR1BR1 w q - 0 14,! The best move in this position by black. Keeping any d4-d5 plans away and trying to delay whites attacking plans.
27,Bf2,e3f2,rnbqk3/ppp1n1br/8/3pPp1p/3P1P2/2N2Q1P/PPP2B2/2KR1BR1 b q - 1 14,This is really important move here. It might look that white has other plans aswell but they just fail to create nothing more than drawn positions. I am not going to put here a wall of text from my analysis as it would be huge mess and I really mean it. This is also logical move(14.Bf7) and not hard to find as the idea is to place it on better square h4.
