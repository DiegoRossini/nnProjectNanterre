5,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3P4/8/1P6/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"After the exchange usual development occurs, white places a central pawn, but this blocks their Bishop if they procede to place it at b2. Nf6 strikes at the centre, defends d4 against the c4 threat, and helps prepare the Kingside for castling."

9,Bb2,c1b2,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/1P6/PBP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 2 5,In my opinion the fiancetto is wasted and accomplishes nothing with d4 blocked. I further build the pressure on e5.
