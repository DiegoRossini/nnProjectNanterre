1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

It is really nice to follow up my epic draw with the Master Mater with a victory that has pushed my rating within touching distance of Class A 1800+ status.  This victory was against a Class C player by the name of Steve.  Steve wasn't doing too badly until he left a pawn en prise which allowed Glenda to wreak mayhem in his camp.  Steve was aware that his b pawn was en prise but he thought he could trap Glenda.  Unfortunately for him, he only realised I had a saving resource after he hit the submit button - I know the feeling there, Steve, just look at my 50th game against the Master Mater on Move 11 when I thought I was gonna win Freddy's rook, but then instead found myself bereft of Fou Lenoir.  Sadly Steve's game went downhill after that.  Anyhow, Gameknot analysis is provided for this game:  Please look in my past games profile dated 7.11.10 for the game."
