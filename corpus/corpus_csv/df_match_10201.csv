1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,1. Nf3 - this is the Reti Opening and is very strong because the knight on f3 controls the centre and prepares e4 but also keeps his opponent guessing as to what follow up is to come.
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,1. ........ d5 (a standard reply possibly converting into a Queen's Pawn Opening)
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,2. ........ d x c4 (Wayne hits out at my pawn on d4 with c4 - I take it - I did consult the 1900 database and it appeared to have a good win percentage - perhaps this opening is transposing into a QGA - Queens' Gambit Accepted)
4,dxc4,d5c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2p5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,2. ........ d x c4 (Wayne hits out at my pawn on d4 with c4 - I take it - I did consult the 1900 database and it appeared to have a good win percentage - perhaps this opening is transposing into a QGA - Queens' Gambit Accepted)

Comment: (apastpawn) This is the original way Reti handled the gambit. I have tried using Nc3 but it has drawbacks. A knight on c4 brings up many possibilities.

6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/8/2p5/N4N2/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,3. ........ Nc6 ( I decide to develop a piece but I am wondering in hindsight whether c5 was a better move - especially due to the fact that Wayne piles up on that unfortunate pawn later on)
7,Nxc4,a3c4,r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/8/2N5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,4. ........ Nf6 - if the knight had been on c3 instead of c4 it would be a weird kind of  four knights opening without the pawns in the centre!!

Bb4  after a few pawn moves I make the following decision based on the fact that I would like to castle kingside.  However I did not want my knight on f6 to be harassed by the usual bishop pin so I decided to develop my bishop with check on b4.  I know it may help black develop (Wayne queried this move on this basis) but at least it eliminates his dark square bishop and this kind of annoying pin.  After the bishops are exchanged I castle immediately so I at least keep apace in the development stakes - not bad for black I thought.

If instead your N at c6 moves elsewhere then Ng5 triples on the h7 pawn and doubles on the f7 pawn.
If R to d6 guarding the c6 N (thinking white can exchange once then the seond capture would be with the white queen and costly): then Ng5 again.
If Q to d6 or d7 guarding the N then the combination at c6 still works for white: NxN, BxN, QxB, QxQ, RxQ with white winning the exchange."
