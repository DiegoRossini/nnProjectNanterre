Q on g5 (or h4 for that mater), N on d4 (""semi - dominating"" on white queen), if f2 pawn moves (or disappears) some discover tactic possible. f pawn ready to march on a king side backed up by a rook.. 
a crap :) 
why did i take the pawn with night.."

it was my ""original plan"", what? well it's not like i am a grand master of chess lol
Why you smile :) so, what would you play instead? Nd4? Bd4? axb4? Qg5? 
(lol all are better than my move)"

probably other moves are better but i decided to exchange pawns now, play Bd4 (maybe force a exchange of rooks on a-file or gain control on a-file), than if i move K from f-file i have a nice play on f2... feels like i am doing good"

46,d5,d6d5,q4r2/1p4k1/2p3pp/3ppn2/1PPbN1B1/3P4/5PPP/3QR1K1 w - - 0 24,"i relay had time to think what to do on move 23.
but now i ask my self why not Qa3?
23.	Ne4	Qa3
24.	Bxf5	Rxf5
25.	Nxd6	Bxf2+
26.	Kh1	Bxe1
27.	Nxf5+	gxf5
28.	Qxe1	(and it is bad game for black)
Well i was to much focused with the idea to take the f pawn with the Bishop that i couldn't see a simple Rook can take and i gain a move because the black king has to move ..

Also why is d5 bad?"
