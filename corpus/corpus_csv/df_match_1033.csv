1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Not a classic Indian defense. No idea why I did it, but thought it was going to be fun, and that´s why we are here, aren´t we!?"

6,a5,a7a5,rnbqkb1r/1ppppp1p/5np1/p7/1PPP4/8/P3PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,And the fun commences!
7,Bb2,c1b2,rnbqkb1r/1ppppp1p/5np1/p7/1PPP4/8/PB2PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,"This was the idea, after all. No need for that pawn when you can load your bishop against K castling (future)"
8,axb4,a5b4,rnbqkb1r/1ppppp1p/5np1/8/1pPP4/8/PB2PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,With the idea to support e4 and also bringing it closer to the King´s side.
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/1ppppp1p/5np1/8/1pPP4/5N2/PB2PPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,With the idea to support e4 and also bringing it closer to the King´s side.
10,d6,d7d6,rnbqkb1r/1pp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/1pPP4/5N2/PB2PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,With the idea to support e4 and also bringing it closer to the King´s side.
11,Nbd2,b1d2,rnbqkb1r/1pp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/1pPP4/5N2/PB1NPPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,With the idea to support e4 and also bringing it closer to the King´s side.
12,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/1pp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/1pPP4/5N2/PB1NPPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 7,"All most logical, now the idea for black would be to attack on his queen´s (obviously, with that extra pawn and the whole column open) while wrestling on his king´s"
13,e4,e2e4,rnbqk2r/1pp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/1pPPP3/5N2/PB1N1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"All most logical, now the idea for black would be to attack on his queen´s (obviously, with that extra pawn and the whole column open) while wrestling on his king´s"
14,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/1pp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/1pPPP3/5N2/PB1N1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 1 8,"All most logical, now the idea for black would be to attack on his queen´s (obviously, with that extra pawn and the whole column open) while wrestling on his king´s"
15,Bd3,f1d3,rnbq1rk1/1pp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/1pPPP3/3B1N2/PB1N1PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 2 8,"White´s, on the other side is basically betting on attacking on the castling and holding both his left wing and the center (considering even maintaining the king there)"
16,c5,c7c5,rnbq1rk1/1p2ppbp/3p1np1/2p5/1pPPP3/3B1N2/PB1N1PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 9,Consolidates the superiority on the queen´s side but also fixes somehow the center and opens the a1-h8 highway for white to attack.
17,d5,d4d5,rnbq1rk1/1p2ppbp/3p1np1/2pP4/1pP1P3/3B1N2/PB1N1PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 9,"Maybe uneeded, considering  next move, but I thought I was gaining one time (which in the end was not that useful at all). Maybe Qc2 woould have yielded better results."
18,Bg4,c8g4,rn1q1rk1/1p2ppbp/3p1np1/2pP4/1pP1P1b1/3B1N2/PB1N1PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 1 10,"Maybe uneeded, considering  next move, but I thought I was gaining one time (which in the end was not that useful at all). Maybe Qc2 woould have yielded better results."
19,h3,h2h3,rn1q1rk1/1p2ppbp/3p1np1/2pP4/1pP1P1b1/3B1N1P/PB1N1PP1/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 10,"Maybe uneeded, considering  next move, but I thought I was gaining one time (which in the end was not that useful at all). Maybe Qc2 woould have yielded better results."
20,Bd7,g4d7,rn1q1rk1/1p1bppbp/3p1np1/2pP4/1pP1P3/3B1N1P/PB1N1PP1/R2QK2R w KQ - 1 11,"As I said, it seems for white to have gained one time, but now B can return to his post and defend, along with Nf6 the h5 spot. Didn´t like what I had, I was stalling somehow."
21,h4,h3h4,rn1q1rk1/1p1bppbp/3p1np1/2pP4/1pP1P2P/3B1N2/PB1N1PP1/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 11,"As I said, it seems for white to have gained one time, but now B can return to his post and defend, along with Nf6 the h5 spot. Didn´t like what I had, I was stalling somehow."

23,Qc2,d1c2,rn1q1rk1/1p2ppbp/3p1np1/2pP4/1pP1P1bP/3B1N2/PBQN1PP1/R3K2R b KQ - 2 12,With the idea to remove B in g4 using Nh2 and advancing pawns on that side.
24,Bh6,g7h6,rn1q1rk1/1p2pp1p/3p1npb/2pP4/1pP1P1bP/3B1N2/PBQN1PP1/R3K2R w KQ - 3 13,"As mentioned before, I thought black would be developing his pieces and attacking on my queen´s side, but instead it came out with an interesting counterattack I did not predict at all. And in a blitz game that might be half a game won."
25,Nh2,f3h2,rn1q1rk1/1p2pp1p/3p1npb/2pP4/1pP1P1bP/3B4/PBQN1PPN/R3K2R b KQ - 4 13,Sticking to my plan.
26,Qa5,d8a5,rn3rk1/1p2pp1p/3p1npb/q1pP4/1pP1P1bP/3B4/PBQN1PPN/R3K2R w KQ - 5 14,"Now the queen comes to the first line. Didn´t see (or at least the whole chain of movements) the next 14...b3, and as I liked my N in d3, I did not consider to defend with Nb3. I think I was wrong."
27,f3,f2f3,rn3rk1/1p2pp1p/3p1npb/q1pP4/1pP1P1bP/3B1P2/PBQN2PN/R3K2R b KQ - 0 14,"I continued with the attack. I had confidence that after ...b3 I could recover the pawn without major loss, since B in g4 is now threatened."
28,b3,b4b3,rn3rk1/1p2pp1p/3p1npb/q1pP4/2P1P1bP/1p1B1P2/PBQN2PN/R3K2R w KQ - 0 15,"...but then I saw (or thought) that if 15.axb3, then Bxd2+ I was going to exchange my rooks for the queen (which is not that bad at all, considering I keep my Bb2 and the queen, and also the threat in g4 -which didn´t seem clear during the game-) and felt like not doing it."
29,Qc3,c2c3,rn3rk1/1p2pp1p/3p1npb/q1pP4/2P1P1bP/1pQB1P2/PB1N2PN/R3K2R b KQ - 1 15,"So I thought about defending better, which is a mistake, but a safer approach (at least at that time)"
30,Qxc3,a5c3,rn3rk1/1p2pp1p/3p1npb/2pP4/2P1P1bP/1pqB1P2/PB1N2PN/R3K2R w KQ - 0 16,"Now again, since Bg5 is threatened, black cannot either gain the ""sacrificed"" pawn by bxa2."
31,Bxc3,b2c3,rn3rk1/1p2pp1p/3p1npb/2pP4/2P1P1bP/1pBB1P2/P2N2PN/R3K2R b KQ - 0 16,"This makes things easier, since now both rooks will be connected. Now 17.Bxd2? would be a grave mistake, because of Rxa2"
32,Bxd2+,h6d2,rn3rk1/1p2pp1p/3p1np1/2pP4/2P1P1bP/1pBB1P2/P2b2PN/R3K2R w KQ - 0 17,"This makes things easier, since now both rooks will be connected. Now 17.Bxd2? would be a grave mistake, because of Rxa2"

A run for a better place will take place, but white´s rooks seem to have the upperhand on a-column, and the pair of bishops might be more efficient here if I can attack on f5."
34,Bd7,g4d7,rn3rk1/1p1bpp1p/3p1np1/2pP4/2P1P2P/1pBB1P2/P2K2PN/R6R w - - 1 18,"and my pawn is back. Both BBb8 and WBh2 seem to be ill-positioned.
