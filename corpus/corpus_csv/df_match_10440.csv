I have more arrows in my quiver, and I play a more quieted pace and watch the board more calmly which provides me with better options...often times the first option is not the best.

Let us rest, for in rest we may see another option......

Please enjoy this game. --Capt_Rook"

Started with the basic King Pawn's open....I wasn't quite sure what to do with the bishop coming out...was thinking the Ruy was coming...so I just stuck to the plan and deveoped my Knight.  If the queen were to follow I was hoping for the basic king queen fork, or king rook fork that so often you can get when someone tries the scholars mate."

I did see the possible Queen coming out, but figured it would cost to much (loss of Knight) do be affactive...the Queen on its own while a menace, is rarely fatal.

As Captain BigPaul pointed out this is a triple threat..even as I look at it I just see Queen and Rook...someone is going down.

But when backed into a corner, sometimes you just have to start swinging.  I didn't expect the end result that I got here, but figured maybe I could get our of this with only a small flesh wound.

A few favorite tatics of mine come out in this game...the discovered check is one of the best...I knew I had a free move, but wasn't exactly sure what to do with it...I figure maybe I get one more point back....  [personal scared level = HIGH]  I still haven't removed the Rook/Queen fork...and I know I can't keep him in perpetual check....or can I.....  :)

10 Nxe4  or Ng4  were the only moves that saved my Rook.  Just a discoved check wouldn't of saved my dear friend...and we all know how I love my Rooks."

This is a little victory for me here, both of my forked comrades are now free...that knight is now all alone.  I must confess, my focus here became revenge on the knight...I was thinking of discovered checks that would get me to take down the knight..........thankfully I resisted."

Nice and simple...you work back and forth round and round with your Rook and Queen (or normally a bishop) and you get to take just about any piece you want.....pace your self the windmill is meal served over many courses."

A very fun game in the end because I was able to keep looking at the board and see something that I hadn't seen before.

Thanks for readying....I hope you enjoyed it, and enjoyed a bit of my humor.  I tip my hat to my good friend and opponent Meskalander.....he saw the shot and took it, no fault in that.  We've had a few games together now and he is a truly worthy advesary."
