As white, i generally fair pretty well, but something about this line has for some reason confused me and i'm 0-4 as white from here and 0-3 as black from here as well.  I'll probably create a mini tournament at some point starting from here to try to address that.

This is known as the benoni defence (A65)."

Already moving into unfamiliar territory.  
D5 is the main line, which prevents for now the exchange of pawns.  This line is poor for white because black can develop with tempo after the pawn exchange."
