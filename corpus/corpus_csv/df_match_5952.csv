1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"White is a little known player from Azerbaijan, he seems very fond of the line in the game. I have no idea who Black is, couldn't find this particular game on two game databases I looked, originally I saw it in an older book of mine. Perhaps it was removed from newer databases because the line in question is no longer relevant."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The Rossolimo variation. White doesn't want to enter the Sveshnikov and as such, postpones playing d4 for the time being."

Rfe1+ Kf7 15. d6 Bf8 (again forced, or else Black gets mated) 16. Rac1 and Black is caged in the back two rows of the board. Black just wants to push the intruding White pieces back."

The truth is that the White pieces were putting too much pressure on Black's position and preventing the Black army from joining the battle.
