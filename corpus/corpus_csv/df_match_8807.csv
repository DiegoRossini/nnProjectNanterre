1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Starting out with 1.d4, wich happens to be my favorite opening move too."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,I wanted to go for the Nimzowich defence with 3...Bb4
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,I wanted to go for the Nimzowich defence with 3...Bb4
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,I wanted to go for the Nimzowich defence with 3...Bb4
5,a3,a2a3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/P7/1P2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,But I must have telepathically send this to my opponent....White immediately eliminates the possibility of a pinned knight on c3.
6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/P7/1P2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Going for the center, with the idea of playing c5 soon.
Maybe 3...b6 is also good, and then fianchettoing the bishop to b7."
7,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/P3P3/1P3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"Not the most ambitious move. White has played 4 pawn moves and has yet to develop a piece, but he's in no hurry, black has no serious advantage.."
8,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/P3P3/1P3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"Just developing and trying to go for quiet, positional play."
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/P1N1P3/1P3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 5,Attacking the white center. Maybe castling first is better. That's what most Game DB suggest.
10,c5,c7c5,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/4pn2/2pp4/2PP4/P1N1P3/1P3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,Attacking the white center. Maybe castling first is better. That's what most Game DB suggest.
11,dxc5,d4c5,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/4pn2/2Pp4/2P5/P1N1P3/1P3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,"The strongest move. Now the d-file is opened up to the white queen and the capture cxd5 is coming, somewhat weakening the black center. After the recapture ....exd5, black has an isolated pawn on d5. Still, the position is about equal with correct play."
12,Bxc5,e7c5,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2bp4/2P5/P1N1P3/1P3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,"I considered castling first, but I didn't like the thought of 7.b4, though again Black is still ok after 7...a5, with 8...b6 etc."
13,b4,b2b4,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2bp4/1PP5/P1N1P3/5PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 7,"I didn't expect this move, but something like 7.cxd5 or 7.Nf3. Then again, both moves are still possible since I have to move my Bishop again. Here I thought quite some time about 7...Bd6. After 8.cxd5 exd5 white cannot take the d5 pawn of course, 9.Nxd5?? Nxd5 10.Qxd5 Bxb4  and the white Queen is lost. But I discarded the idea knowing my opponent would never fall for such a cheap trick."
14,Be7,c5e7,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/4pn2/3p4/1PP5/P1N1P3/5PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 8,"3 out of the 4 last moves with the Bishop, but somehow its compensated by the fact that White is behind in piece development."
15,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/4pn2/3p4/1PP5/P1N1PN2/5PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 8,"White must also have sensed this, so instead of capturing on d5 he wisely developed his knight."
16,dxc4,d5c4,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/4pn2/8/1Pp5/P1N1PN2/5PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 9,Ok..an important moment in the game. It shows how occupied I was with the whole d5 issue. 8...O-O 9.cxd5 Nxd5 10.Nxd5 exd5 gives white a pleasant position. But my 'solution' to the problem unfortunately isn't good enough. 9. Qxd8  Bxd8 10. Bxc4 O-O is also good for white; The poor black Bishop must move again and it's white who is better developed.
17,Bxc4,f1c4,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/4pn2/8/1PB5/P1N1PN2/5PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 9,Luckily my 80-year old opponent decided to develop first.
18,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/4pn2/8/1PB5/P1N1PN2/5PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 1 10,"But now I missed the best continuation. 9...Qxd1  10.Nxd1 O-O, with equal play. In the words of Danish GM Bent Larsen: ""If black equalizes then he's already better."""
19,O-O,e1g1,rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/4pn2/8/1PB5/P1N1PN2/5PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 2 10,Now white is better developed and his pieces are active.
20,Qc7,d8c7,rnb2rk1/ppq1bppp/4pn2/8/1PB5/P1N1PN2/5PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 3 11,"Attacking the bishop, wich can't move ofcourse, because of 11...Qxc3."
21,Qb3,d1b3,rnb2rk1/ppq1bppp/4pn2/8/1PB5/PQN1PN2/5PPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 4 11,To play b5 and develop my Bishop to b7.
22,a6,a7a6,rnb2rk1/1pq1bppp/p3pn2/8/1PB5/PQN1PN2/5PPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 0 12,To play b5 and develop my Bishop to b7.
23,Bb2,c1b2,rnb2rk1/1pq1bppp/p3pn2/8/1PB5/PQN1PN2/1B3PPP/R4RK1 b - - 1 12,Intending to play Ra-c1.
24,b5,b7b5,rnb2rk1/2q1bppp/p3pn2/1p6/1PB5/PQN1PN2/1B3PPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 13,Defending the knight on f3.
25,Be2,c4e2,rnb2rk1/2q1bppp/p3pn2/1p6/1P6/PQN1PN2/1B2BPPP/R4RK1 b - - 1 13,Defending the knight on f3.
