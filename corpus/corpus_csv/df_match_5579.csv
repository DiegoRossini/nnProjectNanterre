1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I am a king-pawn player, although I am thinking of switching to Nc3.

This move is very powerful and is one of the most common played moves. The goal of this is to get a fast paced game, attack, and a decent starting position by controlling the center."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"This is the Sicilian Defense. The goal of this opening is to smash the enemy with an eventual d5, b5 or something of the sort. This minimally controls the center, but has very complex lines that white is not supposed to know very well."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Standard stuff here. I am controlling the center and preparing for an eventual d4 pawn push.
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,This is the initial Dragon Variation setup. An eventual g6 is expected.
5,Bb5+,f1b5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 3,"I commence the Sicilian Moscow. This was the opening I was testing. Unlike an Open Sicilian by playing d4, I trade off white bishops for a solid game as well as stop a few of the plans for the Dragon.

If Nc6 or Nd7, I will castle and things turn out fine for me because if a6, then I can trade off my bishop which will eventually become bad."
6,Bd7,c8d7,rn1qkbnr/pp1bpppp/3p4/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 4,"A little off the main line. I wanted to try the Moscow Gambit which is 4. ...Qxd7 5.c4 Qg4 6.O-O Qxe4 7. d4.

Well, this is playable. As main line goes alike with Qxd7, I played c4 to further control the critical square, d5."
7,Bxd7+,b5d7,rn1qkbnr/pp1Bpppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,"A little off the main line. I wanted to try the Moscow Gambit which is 4. ...Qxd7 5.c4 Qg4 6.O-O Qxe4 7. d4.

Well, this is playable. As main line goes alike with Qxd7, I played c4 to further control the critical square, d5."
8,Nxd7,b8d7,r2qkbnr/pp1npppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"A little off the main line. I wanted to try the Moscow Gambit which is 4. ...Qxd7 5.c4 Qg4 6.O-O Qxe4 7. d4.

Well, this is playable. As main line goes alike with Qxd7, I played c4 to further control the critical square, d5."
9,c4,c2c4,r2qkbnr/pp1npppp/3p4/2p5/2P1P3/5N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,Preparing for a d5 pawn push and giving room for development. Looks like the Dragon is off!
10,e6,e7e6,r2qkbnr/pp1n1ppp/3pp3/2p5/2P1P3/5N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,Preparing for a d5 pawn push and giving room for development. Looks like the Dragon is off!
11,d3,d2d3,r2qkbnr/pp1n1ppp/3pp3/2p5/2P1P3/3P1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"I have no white bishop anymore, so I am free to develop my bishop like this. This is also support for c4 and e4 if ever necessary."
12,Ngf6,g8f6,r2qkb1r/pp1n1ppp/3ppn2/2p5/2P1P3/3P1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 7,I honestly do not know the main line of this opening very well...
13,Be3,c1e3,r2qkb1r/pp1n1ppp/3ppn2/2p5/2P1P3/3PBN2/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 2 7,I honestly do not know the main line of this opening very well...
14,Be7,f8e7,r2qk2r/pp1nbppp/3ppn2/2p5/2P1P3/3PBN2/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 3 8,"This move happens in all Sicilians. This protects the deadly Nb5 if ever going to pose a threat and revs up a b5 push sometime, as the goal is to attack on the queen-side."
15,Nc3,b1c3,r2qk2r/pp1nbppp/3ppn2/2p5/2P1P3/2NPBN2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 4 8,"This move happens in all Sicilians. This protects the deadly Nb5 if ever going to pose a threat and revs up a b5 push sometime, as the goal is to attack on the queen-side."

20,Ng4,f6g4,r2q1rk1/1p1nbppp/p2pp3/2p5/2P1P1n1/2NPBN2/PP3PPP/R2QR1K1 w - - 2 11,Black does not want bishops in the Sicilian. They are generally too deadly.

22,Nge5,g4e5,r2q1rk1/1p1nbppp/p2pp3/2p1n3/2P1P3/2NPBN2/PP1Q1PPP/R3R1K1 w - - 4 12,Black wants to attack the center with his knights.

24,Nxe5,d7e5,r2q1rk1/1p2bppp/p2pp3/2p1n3/2P1P3/2NPB3/PP1Q1PPP/R3R1K1 w - - 0 13,I wanted to eventually go for a b4 pawn push. This also protects b4 from a knight outpost.
25,Bf4,e3f4,r2q1rk1/1p2bppp/p2pp3/2p1n3/2P1PB2/2NP4/PP1Q1PPP/R3R1K1 b - - 1 13,I wanted to eventually go for a b4 pawn push. This also protects b4 from a knight outpost.

I wanted to attack on the king-side with my rook."
29,Re3,e1e3,1r1q1rk1/1p2bppp/p1npp3/2p5/2P1PB2/P1NPR3/1P1Q1PPP/R5K1 b - - 2 15,"An awful move. I lose my rook for a bishop after 15. ...e5 Bg3 16. Bg5. Things get worse now that d4 is wide open to a knight outpost.

31,Rh3,e3h3,1r1q1rk1/1p3ppp/p1npp3/2p3b1/2P1PB2/P1NP3R/1P1Q1PPP/R5K1 b - - 4 16,"Now that I've already made a mistake of moving my rook there, I might as well do something with it!"

Ne5, on the other hand, gets protection ready for my king-side attack."
