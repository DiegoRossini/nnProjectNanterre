5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,d3 is usally a better move
6,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"In this position, White's two knights prove very strong, especially the d4-knight controlling the centre. Black should play e5 sending back the knight and developing his DSB."

10,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p1np1/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Very popular move after the Silican defence, as I explained."
11,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p1np1/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"White's move is one that I have not encountered previously. That is because he is following a diffrent plan this time: he intends to castle Queen side. He therfore mobilizes his Queen-side forces more rapidly than he would ordinarily, when contemplating King-side castling."
12,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 7,Supporting the bishop and preparing for Queenside castling (O-O-O)

16,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPPQ1PPP/2KR1B1R w - - 6 9,"We have now reached a point where we can fruitfully inquire into the logic behind White's Queen-side castling. As we have seen earlier, the possibility of Pawn captures and recaptures is a very important factor in planning the course of a game. These captures and recaptures result in  line-opening. And this line-opening in turn creates highways for the movements of our forces in an aggressive mood. In this case, White's basic tactical idea is to play h4, followed by h5, then PXP, taking advantage of the fact that Black's King pawn is at g6. Once white has playe h5, he is certain of opening the h-file, and having Black's address he will muster his heavy artukkery ib the newly-opened King Rook file to operate agianst Black's King."
17,Nb3,d4b3,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/6B1/4P3/1NN5/PPPQ1PPP/2KR1B1R b - - 7 9,"This is the usual move made by White to avoid any tactical tricks due to the fact that White's knight at d4 was directly attacked by Black's Knight at c6 and indirectly attacked by the ""Dragon Bishop"" at g7."
18,Be6,c8e6,r2q1rk1/pp2ppbp/2npbnp1/6B1/4P3/1NN5/PPPQ1PPP/2KR1B1R w - - 8 10,And here is such an inexact move. Black should first play Re8!! so that he can answer 10. Bh6 with 10....Bh8!!! retaining the Dragon Bishop without any collisions
19,Kb1,c1b1,r2q1rk1/pp2ppbp/2npbnp1/6B1/4P3/1NN5/PPPQ1PPP/1K1R1B1R b - - 9 10,"But White is inexact too. Expoliting Black's last move, he should play 10....Bh6!!!! forcing the removal of Black's precious Dragon Bishop (Obviously, 10......Bh8? is answered by 11.BxR winning the exchange) The text has its points though. By playing Kb1, the white king protects the a2 pawn with another piece."
20,Rc8,a8c8,2rq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2npbnp1/6B1/4P3/1NN5/PPPQ1PPP/1K1R1B1R w - - 10 11,"Again Black is wrong. Intent on prosecuting his counterattack, he neglects to preserve his Dragon Bishop by playing Re8."

Where's h4? If White has not begun to play h4, then what use is g4? Well, we'll see as the game gets on. Anyhow, Black can now play 13....Nc4, but instead he hints in a much more effective move....."

This is bound to be disatouras for White. Another useful point is that the Dragon Bishop is pointing directly for action against White's king!"
27,Bh6,g5h6,2rqr1k1/pp1nppbp/3pb1pB/4n3/4P1P1/1NN2P2/PPPQB2P/1K1R3R b - - 4 14,"Too Late! The Dragon Bishop can now reatreat to two squares (h8 or f6, and not f8!)"
