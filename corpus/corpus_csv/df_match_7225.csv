went with e6 first in case white replies with e4"
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,4. Bb5+  c6 - White's Bb5 surprised me a little.  I had planned to play c6 anyway to reinforce the d5 pawn.

8,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp4pp/2p1p3/1B1p1p2/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,5. Nf6 will strengthen my claim on e4

11,Bd2,c1d2,rnbqkb1r/pp4pp/2p1pn2/3p1p2/3P4/3BPN2/PPPB1PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 3 6,"White's Bd2 means I don't have to worry too much a exchange involving the black square bishop.   Suppose he could do a3 followed by Bb4.  Plan is to back the Bishop up with Queen, especially if I see a3 on move 7.  I prefer to castle on move 7"
12,Bd6,f8d6,rnbqk2r/pp4pp/2pbpn2/3p1p2/3P4/3BPN2/PPPB1PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 4 7,Continuing with Stonewall development.  Plan is to castle next unless there is a threat to the Bishop
13,Qe2,d1e2,rnbqk2r/pp4pp/2pbpn2/3p1p2/3P4/3BPN2/PPPBQPPP/RN2K2R b KQkq - 5 7,"Is White thinking of some kind of Kingside attack - Ng5 followed by Qf3 then Qh3.  I have got to keep the N on f6 as it guards the h pawn.  Looking ahead, I could begin the process of moving the white square bishop over - Bd7, Be8, Bg6.  If on move 8, White does Ng5, I am ruling out h6 - at least for now."

However, advancing to c5 would cause me to retreat the Bishop to either e7 or c7, neither of which appeal to me.  b6 will prevent the c5 advance, at least for now."
16,b6,b7b6,rnbq1rk1/p5pp/1ppbpn2/3p1p2/2PP4/3BPN2/PP1BQPPP/RN2K2R w KQ - 0 9,"Starting the zig-zag - I am a little worried about Ne5, plan is Be8, then Nd7
Also considering Ne4, but in a closed game, Knights are better than Bishops and I think that could lead to Knight for a Bishop exchange.  On the plus, White would be forced to move the Knight on f3.  It also open up the F file for the rook."

I remember losing one game because I allowed White to push pawns far down Queenside.  I think a5 would stop the attack.  If he pushes the pawn to b4, then my reply is axb4.  If he takes with a pawn, then I get the Rook.  If he captures with Bishop, I will reluctanly take the bishop Bxb4+.  If he retakes with the pawn, then I get the Rook.  If he blocks the check with Knight - Nd2, then my best course is to retreat the Bishop to a5, keeping the white Knight pinned for now.  Bc3 attacking the Rook can be easily defeated by moving the Rook. When I look closer, Bc3 could force a Rook move, allowing Rxa3, guarding the Bishop."

I still have a Knight that hasn't moved yet.  King is relatively safe.  Going to push the c pawn.  Considered Be8 but it seems passive.

I will also have to defend the e6 pawn after white recaptures (persumely with e3 pawn).  cxd4 also opens a black square so the bishop has a little more room.  How would I defend the e6 pawn?  Re8, Qe8, or Ne4?  I am also thinking that if White moves the Knight, the Ng4 allows a threat to White's h pawn."

Be5 looks interesting for the next move.  At some point I should also consider Ne4.  With no pawn on d4, I can also consider Ne5"
