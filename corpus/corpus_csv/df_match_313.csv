6,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,This is quite playable too. Now 4. d4-d5 leads to Benoni systems.
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,But white doesn't go for that.
8,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/8/2Pp4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,And Black prevents the pawn advance.
9,Qxd4,d1d4,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/8/2PQ4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"I personally think this is the wrong way to recapture, as it allows black to develop the Nb8 with an attack on the white queen, gaining time."
10,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/8/2PQ4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 1 6,Like this. I think this looks a bit like an English opening now.
11,Qd1,d4d1,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/8/2P5/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 6,"The queen returns to base, but Qf4 or Qh4 could well have been considered too."
12,d5,d7d5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/3p4/2P5/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"Black advances in the centre, gaining space."
13,cxd5,c4d5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/3P4/8/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,White takes.
14,exd5,e6d5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/3p4/8/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,Black takes back.
15,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/3p2B1/8/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 8,This is a mistake. White has to prevent further advance of the d pawn with e3.
16,d4,d5d4,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/6B1/3p4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 9,This gives black an advantage.
17,Bxf6,g5f6,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n2B2/8/3p4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 9,White reduces the black fire-power.
18,Qxf6,d8f6,r1b1kb1r/pp3ppp/2n2q2/8/3p4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 10,"The correct way to recapture, as to not compromise the king side pawns."
19,Ne4,c3e4,r1b1kb1r/pp3ppp/2n2q2/8/3pN3/5N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 10,"10. Nb5 was played instead in paulatica (1537) vs. fromluxembourg (1915), but white also lost. I don't think 10. Nb5 is an improvement."

21,Nfd2,f3d2,r1b1k2r/pp3ppp/2n2q2/8/1b1pN3/8/PP1NPPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 3 11,White blocks.
22,Qe5,f6e5,r1b1k2r/pp3ppp/2n5/4q3/1b1pN3/8/PP1NPPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 4 12,Threatening the knight as the other knight is pinned.
