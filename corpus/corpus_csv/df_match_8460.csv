1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone,

Here I played against Chris who is our Gameknot Youtube Annotator.  We ended up playing the Four Knight's Opening.  With the popularity of the Sicilian and the Ruy Lopez this opening is not so widely played, although a year ago Coach Ion played the Belgrade Gambit against me in a game I have still not been able to bring myself to annotate.  That is because in my bid to exchange down to an equal ending I made a very stupid blunder, walked Fou Leblanc into a pin and Ion took full advantage of this.  One day I may annotate it under the Blunderfest Series but not now.  I do however have a link to that game, it is:- http://gameknot.com/list-games.pl?mode=h&u=jstevens1&opp=ionadowman.  Anyhow this is me playing the white side of it!  I kick off with e4."
