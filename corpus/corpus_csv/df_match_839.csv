6,a6,a7a6,rnbqkbnr/1p2pppp/p1p5/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,The previous comment was so that I note why here I couldn't find much sense in the a6 move. So I didn't knew what to play.
7,Bf4,c1f4,rnbqkbnr/1p2pppp/p1p5/3p4/3PPB2/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,I decided just to develop. Nf3 didn't seem the best cause it lets the black bishop to go on g4. So Bf4 seemed better.
8,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/1p2pp1p/p1p3p1/3p4/3PPB2/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"That surprised me and scared me at the same time. It's surprising because for the first four moves black only plays with his pawns. So I'm much further in development. However, I thought that by attacking on d4, black would make me play e5 at some time. That would leave the f5 square for him."
9,h4,h2h4,rnbqkbnr/1p2pp1p/p1p3p1/3p4/3PPB1P/2N5/PPP2PP1/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"I'm prety sure this is not a theory, but I still find the h4 move really precise. It's idea is playing early h5. It wouldbe badfor black's pawn structure, cause after me taking on g6 he would most certainly have to take with the f pawn. So the kingside would be easier to be attacked later. Usually there is a knight on f6, who prevents the h5 move. But now if black plays 5... Nf6 I'll play 6. e5 on the spot and still be able to play h5 in a while."
10,h5,h7h5,rnbqkbnr/1p2pp2/p1p3p1/3p3p/3PPB1P/2N5/PPP2PP1/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,So that's the solution my opponent found. Of course I've seen it. I knew that later I would better attack h5 with g4. Now that isn't possible cause the c8 bishop keeps the g4 square. So my immediate plan is to block that c8 bishop.

The move that I didn't see, but now seems good for me is 7.... Be6"

14,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/1p3p2/p3p1p1/3p3p/3P1B1P/2N2Q2/PPP2PP1/R3KBNR w KQkq - 0 8,The the bishop is blocked. Now I can play g4 but I also noticed that the black squares of my opponent are weak.
15,Be5,f4e5,rnbqkbnr/1p3p2/p3p1p1/3pB2p/3P3P/2N2Q2/PPP2PP1/R3KBNR b KQkq - 1 8,So I decided to interfere his development first.

17,Nh3,g1h3,rnbqkbn1/1p3p1r/p3p1p1/3pB2p/3P3P/2N2Q1N/PPP2PP1/R3KB1R b KQq - 3 9,"Seemed like would do some problems for the black, but I didn't see the following ..."

32,Qb4,e7b4,r1b1k1n1/5p1r/p1n1p1p1/1p1p2P1/1q1P1B1p/2NBQ3/PPP2P2/R3K2R w KQq - 1 17,A little problem for me. It looked like I'll have to let another pawn go.
