24,Bxd5,e6d5,r2qkb1r/5p1p/p1np4/1p1bpp2/4P3/N2B4/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 13,The standard Sveshnikov structure. White could claim a significant edge if his Knight wasn't so poorly placed.

27,Nxb5,a3b5,r2qkb1r/4np1p/p2p4/1N1Ppp2/8/3B4/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 14,"A pretty rare move. White wins a pawn with the intention of rerouting the Knight to a better square. The downside is that it opens up lines on the Q-side and my Bf8 will be much stronger on the long diagonal. 14. c3 is the more popular move, clearing c2 for the Knight or Bishop, and shutting the long diagonal for the Black Bishop."
28,Bg7,f8g7,r2qk2r/4npbp/p2p4/1N1Ppp2/8/3B4/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 1 15,14...axb5?? 15. Bxb5+ and White wins the Queen for two pieces. Now axb5 is a serious threat and the Knight has to retreat.
29,Nc3,b5c3,r2qk2r/4npbp/p2p4/3Ppp2/8/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 2 15,The only place to go but it's good enough. Trying to go back to a3 with the idea of c3 fails to e4 and Bxb2.
30,e4,e5e4,r2qk2r/4npbp/p2p4/3P1p2/4p3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 16,Clearing the diagonal with tempo and forcing the Bd3 to a much less active square.

32,Qa5,d8a5,r3k2r/4npbp/p2p4/q2P1p2/4p3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 2 17,Putting immediate pressure on the Nc3. White's problem is that he can't shake the pressure easily and needs to play quite reserved for a few more moves.
33,Rb1,a1b1,r3k2r/4npbp/p2p4/q2P1p2/4p3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/1R1Q1RK1 b kq - 3 17,"Still in theory. A multi-purpose move. The Rook removes itself from the long diagonal, is poised to become active in case of Bxc3 and aims to drive off the annoying Black Queen with b4."
34,O-O,e8g8,r4rk1/4npbp/p2p4/q2P1p2/4p3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/1R1Q1RK1 w - - 4 18,"A rather poor move but my idea was to keep more pieces on the board. I had drawn a few recent games simply because I exchanged too many pieces and the resulting positions were simple enough for my opponents to defend. It was a risky gamble and by looking at the end result it paid off. If I were to play this line again, I'm sure I would go for the stronger 17...Bxc3 18. bxc3 Qxc3 19. Rb7 (if 19. Rb3 Qe5 with ideas of f4 and attacking on the K-side) Rg8 (a quiet move that forgoes castling in order to activate the Rook on a very dangerous file)."

36,Qc7,a5c7,r4rk1/2q1npbp/p2p4/3P1p2/1P2p3/2N5/P1P1BPPP/1R1Q1RK1 w - - 1 19,"The pressure on the Q-side evaporated and White has ideas of c4-c5, creating a very dangerous passed pawn. I had to think of something fast. If I play slowly White will certainly convert his extra material. I knew my chances lay on the K-side and that I had to generate initiative there. Notice the opposite colour Bishops. This is a very dangerous middlegame to play and unlike its counterpart in the endgame very much not drawish. The side that can seize the initiative usually wins since the defending Bishop cannot cover the opposite colour squares."
37,Na4,c3a4,r4rk1/2q1npbp/p2p4/3P1p2/NP2p3/8/P1P1BPPP/1R1Q1RK1 b - - 2 19,"The pressure on the Q-side evaporated and White has ideas of c4-c5, creating a very dangerous passed pawn.

It clears the f8 square for the Bishop so it may cover c5 and defend against the pawn push, and it also has ideas of a5, activating the Ra8 and using the a-file for counterplay, since White cannot contest that file."
39,c4,c2c4,rr4k1/2q1npbp/p2p4/3P1p2/NPP1p3/8/P3BPPP/1R1Q1RK1 b - - 0 20,"White carries on with his plan and rightfully so. If there is a good and straightforward plan in a given position that is enough to win, don't bother looking for other subtler ideas. Let your opponent bother with that."
40,Ng6,e7g6,rr4k1/2q2pbp/p2p2n1/3P1p2/NPP1p3/8/P3BPPP/1R1Q1RK1 w - - 1 21,Activating the Knight which now aims for f4 or e5. Still White has a considerable edge here and I'm barely holding on. I just don't have enough counterplay on the K-side to balance the pawn avalanche on the Q-side.
