1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game was a relatively short one with mistakes from both sides. I was white, and my opponent was black. In this game, I decided to play 1. e4 in order to free diagonals for my bishop and queen, and to place a pawn in the center. This pawn, as seen in many games, can be a hindrance to Black's offensive play because this is the first move that takes control of the center."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"This is the Alekhine Defense for those who are not familiar with it.

In many top-tier games, the key square is d5; whichever side that fully takes control of d5 is generally considered to have the advantage. My moves will reflect upon the aforementioned, but my opponent in this game does not do the same.

Viable alternatives for Black are e5, d5, e6, c5, or any other ""proved"" opening."
3,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 2,"This is not the best move because Black gets a development lead after 2. ...Nxe4 3. Bxf7+ Kxf7 4. Qh5+ g6 5. Qd5+ d6 6. Qxe4. At this stage, White's pieces are chatting on the back rank while Black already has a semi-secure king and lines for his pieces to develop. In addition, a Queen in the center is not a good thing.

When I played this move, I wanted to see what would happen. In tournament situations, nine times out of ten I would play 2. e5.

Viable Alternatives: e5, Nc3, and others which are proven."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pppppppp/2n2n2/8/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 3 3,"I suppose this is an okay move. I myself have never witnessed this, but it seems like Black wants to play a system. Black likely knew that the e4 pawn was a gambit.

Viable Alternatives: e5, d5, e6, or other sound moves."
5,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/pppppppp/2n2n2/8/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 4 3,"I played this to protect the e4 pawn. Since I had never seen this before, I wanted to keep the game calm and retain my ever-so-loved e4 pawn."
6,e5,e7e5,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 4,"The game enters a Giuoco Piano-like system. I personally play the Vienna Gambit or the Ruy Lopez, so I went for a Vienna Gambit-like game play.

This move that Black made shows effort in claiming the center. For more passive play, e6 or d6 would be better."
7,f4,f2f4,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 4,"I overlooked Nxe5 with this move. After 4. ...Nxe4 5. Nxe4 d5!, the ""Fork Trick"", my e4 pawn is lost, and I am left with a clumsy f4 pawn. It would have proved to be hard to recover from.

Viable Alternatives: d3, Nf3"
8,exf4,e5f4,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/2B1Pp2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,"This move was my expected outcome. Black loses his center pawn, and I can freely play d4. The idea of leaving my king-side diagonal exposed appalled me, so I remedied that."
9,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/2B1Pp2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,"This move takes control of the center, seals up the imaginary exposed diagonal, an prevents most future movements of the Black f4 pawn. In the King's Gambit and other similar openings, this move is infrequently omitted.

Viable Alternatives: d3 and d4 possibly"
10,Bd6,f8d6,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2nb1n2/8/2B1Pp2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 6,"Was this move to protect the f4 pawn? The rest of Black's moves from here on out were not the best. In this case, although the bishop is developed, Black gets to castle, and the f4 pawn is protected, it is dangerous to have a bishop and knight abreast to a semi-open file with a pawn that is ready to fork them. In addition, the d7 pawn is blocked. Without having to remove the bishop from d6, the only way the c8-bishop can develop is with ...b6, and this is deemed slow in King's Pawn Openings."
11,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2nb1n2/8/2B1Pp2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 3 6,"I knew that Bd6 was not a very sound move, so I decided to play safe. This move gets the king safer, and is one step closer to the connection between the rooks.

Viable Alternatives: d3, d4"
12,Nxe4,f6e4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2nb4/8/2B1np2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,"This was a mistake by Black. He loses the ""Alekhine Knight"". Better would have been Be7 or O-O."
13,Nxe4,c3e4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2nb4/8/2B1Np2/5N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,"Beware of Greeks bearing gifts. I was sure that this was not one of those.

I might have played Qe2 or Re1, but a winning exchange is a winning exchange. In my mind, there was no reason to take chances."
14,Rf8,h8f8,r1bqkr2/pppp1ppp/2nb4/8/2B1Np2/5N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQ1RK1 w q - 1 8,"Was that a move to castle? On the bright side, Rf8 prepares for an eventual f5 pawn push. This never happened in the game.

On the dark side, this move clusters the king, and this was the reason why I won in a meager nine moves."
15,Qe2,d1e2,r1bqkr2/pppp1ppp/2nb4/8/2B1Np2/5N2/PPPPQ1PP/R1B2RK1 b q - 2 8,"This was an inaccuracy by me. I should have played Nxd6 to get Black double-isolated-d-pawns, and finally play those moves to crush the king. I considered it, but I decided to take a chance. Besides, I was already up a knight."
16,g6,g7g6,r1bqkr2/pppp1p1p/2nb2p1/8/2B1Np2/5N2/PPPPQ1PP/R1B2RK1 w q - 0 9,"This is an excellent move as it prepares for a defended f5 pawn push. This push will retreat my knight and the king-side pawns will eventually smother White.

This would have been an excellent move under different circumstances in a different game. As of now, this is a blunder as it lets me checkmate in two ways."
17,Nxd6#,e4d6,r1bqkr2/pppp1p1p/2nN2p1/8/2B2p2/5N2/PPPPQ1PP/R1B2RK1 b q - 0 9,"I chose the foreman, winning the bishop.

I understand that this was not the most instructive game due to the four mistakes Black had played in succession, but for novices, this game might teach a little about the opening and center control.

For more advanced players, I don't think this helped too much, but more experience leads to stronger play, right? I hope you all enjoyed, and a belated Happy New Year!"
