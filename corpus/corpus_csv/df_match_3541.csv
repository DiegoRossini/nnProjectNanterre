1,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"So f4, an offbeat opening i have never played against it. My main goal is to built up a strong and solid defence on my king's side and then attacking on white's kingside."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,I choose Nf6 though the main reply is d5. Also some play c5 and even f5 which seems really worthless to me (f5).
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/5P2/5N2/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 2,Developing the knight behind the f4 pawn.
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/5P2/5N2/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"King's side fianchetto with g6, though i am not really experienced to those positions but i decided to try it out!"
5,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/5P2/4PN2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"In order to support the pawn, seems logical to the opening."
6,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/5P2/4PN2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,My plan as i said was a solid defence for my King.
7,d4,d2d4,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/3P1P2/4PN2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,d4 and challenging both e5 and c5 squares.
8,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppppppbp/5np1/8/3P1P2/4PN2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R w KQ - 1 5,0-0 and now the job is done for my King. I don't really like his centre's pawn structure and anyway.
9,b4,b2b4,rnbq1rk1/ppppppbp/5np1/8/1P1P1P2/4PN2/P1P3PP/RNBQKB1R b KQ - 0 5,b4? Why is that? At least Bc4 or b3 would be better.
10,d6,d7d6,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/1P1P1P2/4PN2/P1P3PP/RNBQKB1R w KQ - 0 6,I think it's like i am playing the King's Indian Defence.
11,Bb2,c1b2,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/1P1P1P2/4PN2/PBP3PP/RN1QKB1R b KQ - 1 6,Bb2 is ok but still he's back in development.
12,c5,c7c5,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2p5/1P1P1P2/4PN2/PBP3PP/RN1QKB1R w KQ - 0 7,c5 a thematic move to most of the defences against d4 for black.
13,bxc5,b4c5,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2P5/3P1P2/4PN2/PBP3PP/RN1QKB1R b KQ - 0 7,He took the pawn.
14,dxc5,d6c5,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/5np1/2p5/3P1P2/4PN2/PBP3PP/RN1QKB1R w KQ - 0 8,I took it too.
15,c3,c2c3,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/5np1/2p5/3P1P2/2P1PN2/PB4PP/RN1QKB1R b KQ - 0 8,c3 to support the d4 pawn. But this move is blocking DS Bishop's view.
16,Qb6,d8b6,rnb2rk1/pp2ppbp/1q3np1/2p5/3P1P2/2P1PN2/PB4PP/RN1QKB1R w KQ - 1 9,It's time for my Queen to move to threat the b2 square and support c5.
17,Ba3,b2a3,rnb2rk1/pp2ppbp/1q3np1/2p5/3P1P2/B1P1PN2/P5PP/RN1QKB1R b KQ - 2 9,Ba3 is hitting c5 square. I know that if i am going to lose my pawn there's a hole in b2.
18,Nc6,b8c6,r1b2rk1/pp2ppbp/1qn2np1/2p5/3P1P2/B1P1PN2/P5PP/RN1QKB1R w KQ - 3 10,So Nc6 instead of Nd7 which is blocking my LS Bishop.
19,Bxc5,a3c5,r1b2rk1/pp2ppbp/1qn2np1/2B5/3P1P2/2P1PN2/P5PP/RN1QKB1R b KQ - 0 10,Not the greatest choise here for white. His King is still exposed to possible threats.
20,Qb2,b6b2,r1b2rk1/pp2ppbp/2n2np1/2B5/3P1P2/2P1PN2/Pq4PP/RN1QKB1R w KQ - 1 11,Qb2 is good move both threatening a1 and c3 squares.
