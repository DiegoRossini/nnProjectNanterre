1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Well, surely not the high-quality game of the day, as both sides commit severe mistakes, but hopefully a entertaining one."

9,Be2,f1e2,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3p4/6b1/3P1N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 5,Black does not fear this manoeuvre as his light-squared bishop is not a very precious piece in the Caro-Kann.

14,Bxe2,g4e2,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/3pN1B1/8/3P4/PPP1bPPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"White might consider taking on c6 here, leaving black with a backward pawn on the c-file."

21,Qd1,e2d1,2rqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/3pN1B1/3n4/3P4/PPPN1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b k - 6 11,"A silly move! If you play one of the pet openings of former world champion Anatoly Karpov, you should also follow his rule not to engage serious actions before having finished the development of your pieces. Once again Bd6 was the right move here. Even taking with the knight seems to be better than the text: ...Nxc2, and 12. Rc1  Kb4 (or Kd4), 13. Qa4+ Nc6, 14. Nxc6 Qd7, 15. Qxa7 might follow."
