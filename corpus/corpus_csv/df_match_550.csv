1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Not the usual knight move in the Sicilian but is very transpositional in nature. Still I do think Nf3 ultimately give white the best winning chances. In the current position black has no trouble equalizing.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Not the usual knight move in the Sicilian but is very transpositional in nature. Still I do think Nf3 ultimately give white the best winning chances. In the current position black has no trouble equalizing.
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,Not the usual knight move in the Sicilian but is very transpositional in nature. Still I do think Nf3 ultimately give white the best winning chances. In the current position black has no trouble equalizing.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,developing the knight and preparing for the exchange on d4.
5,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 3,"The most direct approach, denying the white knight the ability to jump to d5."
6,e6,e7e6,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"The most direct approach, denying the white knight the ability to jump to d5."
7,Be2,f1e2,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,Establishes a forward position for the knight and creating exchange threats on f3 and e2 if it is beneficial for black at some point. The strategic idea is to create a long term structural pawn weakness that can be exploited later on
8,Nd4,c6d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/3nP3/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,Establishes a forward position for the knight and creating exchange threats on f3 and e2 if it is beneficial for black at some point.

9,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/3nP3/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 3 5,utility move that threatens b7-b5 at some point while limiting the influence of the LSB and white knight.
10,a6,a7a6,r1bqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p3p3/2p5/3nP3/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 6,utility move that threatens b7-b5 at some point while limiting the influence of the LSB and white knight.
11,b3,b2b3,r1bqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p3p3/2p5/3nP3/1PN2N2/P1PPBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 6,"a great move that opens up all kinds of deadly possibilities along the dark diagonal. So much so, black is kinda forced to develop his DSB to a less than ideal spot."
12,Bd6,f8d6,r1bqk1nr/1p1p1ppp/p2bp3/2p5/3nP3/1PN2N2/P1PPBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 1 7,with the up coming Bb2 e5 will be come a hot spot on the board so I play Bd6 to get some control and protection on it. Part of being a higher class player is being able to accurately predict what your opponent plans to do in the future and do something about it before it becomes a problem. Most chess players only respond to current threats not latent threats.
13,Bb2,c1b2,r1bqk1nr/1p1p1ppp/p2bp3/2p5/3nP3/1PN2N2/PBPPBPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 2 7,The knight is going to g6 where it can help in the fight for control of e5.
14,Ne7,g8e7,r1bqk2r/1p1pnppp/p2bp3/2p5/3nP3/1PN2N2/PBPPBPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 3 8,The knight is going to g6 where it can help in the fight for control of e5.
15,Bd3,e2d3,r1bqk2r/1p1pnppp/p2bp3/2p5/3nP3/1PNB1N2/PBPP1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 4 8,Interesting move that allows white to play Ne2 clearing the way for the DSB. White plans to exchange the strong black knight for his weaker one. While at the same time creating a weak pawn on d4 that is easy to attack.
16,Qc7,d8c7,r1b1k2r/1pqpnppp/p2bp3/2p5/3nP3/1PNB1N2/PBPP1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 5 9,Developing and anticipating to meet the knight exchange by playing Bxh2 creating a weakness of my own.
17,Nxd4,f3d4,r1b1k2r/1pqpnppp/p2bp3/2p5/3NP3/1PNB4/PBPP1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 9,attacking the weak d-pawn.
18,cxd4,c5d4,r1b1k2r/1pqpnppp/p2bp3/8/3pP3/1PNB4/PBPP1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 10,attacking the weak d-pawn.
19,Ne2,c3e2,r1b1k2r/1pqpnppp/p2bp3/8/3pP3/1P1B4/PBPPNPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 1 10,attacking the weak d-pawn.
20,Bxh2+,d6h2,r1b1k2r/1pqpnppp/p3p3/8/3pP3/1P1B4/PBPPNPPb/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 11,regaining the pawn before I loss it. While at the same time creating a critical weakness in the king position. This weakness becomes important later on
21,Kh1,g1h1,r1b1k2r/1pqpnppp/p3p3/8/3pP3/1P1B4/PBPPNPPb/R2Q1R1K b kq - 1 11,Now black has the great f4 outpost.
22,Bd6,h2d6,r1b1k2r/1pqpnppp/p2bp3/8/3pP3/1P1B4/PBPPNPP1/R2Q1R1K w kq - 2 12,Now black has the great f4 outpost.
23,Nxd4,e2d4,r1b1k2r/1pqpnppp/p2bp3/8/3NP3/1P1B4/PBPP1PP1/R2Q1R1K b kq - 0 12,Now black has the great f4 outpost.
24,Ng6,e7g6,r1b1k2r/1pqp1ppp/p2bp1n1/8/3NP3/1P1B4/PBPP1PP1/R2Q1R1K w kq - 1 13,heading to f4 but white has a great tactical reply
25,Qh5,d1h5,r1b1k2r/1pqp1ppp/p2bp1n1/7Q/3NP3/1P1B4/PBPP1PP1/R4R1K b kq - 2 13,"at first glance it looks like white will loss tempo against ...Nf4 but white can play for the exchange of queens and deny black the ability to castle. All of this is enough compensation for the threat of ....Nf4. However, black does get to create a further pawn structure weakness on d3. Which could prove difficult to defend if we end up in a rook+bishop endings."
26,Nf4,g6f4,r1b1k2r/1pqp1ppp/p2bp3/7Q/3NPn2/1P1B4/PBPP1PP1/R4R1K w kq - 3 14,next few moves are forced.
27,Qg5,h5g5,r1b1k2r/1pqp1ppp/p2bp3/6Q1/3NPn2/1P1B4/PBPP1PP1/R4R1K b kq - 4 14,next few moves are forced.
28,Nxd3,f4d3,r1b1k2r/1pqp1ppp/p2bp3/6Q1/3NP3/1P1n4/PBPP1PP1/R4R1K w kq - 0 15,threatening b7 and regrouping the knight to e3 maybe?
29,cxd3,c2d3,r1b1k2r/1pqp1ppp/p2bp3/6Q1/3NP3/1P1P4/PB1P1PP1/R4R1K b kq - 0 15,threatening b7 and regrouping the knight to e3 maybe?
30,Qd8,c7d8,r1bqk2r/1p1p1ppp/p2bp3/6Q1/3NP3/1P1P4/PB1P1PP1/R4R1K w kq - 1 16,threatening b7 and regrouping the knight to e3 maybe?
31,Qxd8+,g5d8,r1bQk2r/1p1p1ppp/p2bp3/8/3NP3/1P1P4/PB1P1PP1/R4R1K b kq - 0 16,threatening b7 and regrouping the knight to e3 maybe?
32,Kxd8,e8d8,r1bk3r/1p1p1ppp/p2bp3/8/3NP3/1P1P4/PB1P1PP1/R4R1K w - - 0 17,threatening b7 and regrouping the knight to e3 maybe?
33,Nc2,d4c2,r1bk3r/1p1p1ppp/p2bp3/8/4P3/1P1P4/PBNP1PP1/R4R1K b - - 1 17,threatening b7 and regrouping the knight to e3 maybe?
34,f6,f7f6,r1bk3r/1p1p2pp/p2bpp2/8/4P3/1P1P4/PBNP1PP1/R4R1K w - - 0 18,defending b7 and limiting the influence of the white bishop. You always want to make sure that you have a firm control in the centre. Game are won and lost when players give up to much control in the center.
35,f4,f2f4,r1bk3r/1p1p2pp/p2bpp2/8/4PP2/1P1P4/PBNP2P1/R4R1K b - - 0 18,excellent move that really puts pressure on e5 that will be very hard to resist
36,Rf8,h8f8,r1bk1r2/1p1p2pp/p2bpp2/8/4PP2/1P1P4/PBNP2P1/R4R1K w - - 1 19,I plan to deflect that battle away from e5 and on to f6 where I am stronger. Placing the rook on f8 supporting f6 and deflecting my bishop to e7 will ensure I have equality.
