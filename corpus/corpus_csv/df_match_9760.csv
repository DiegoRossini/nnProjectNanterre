1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Antijogo (1582) vs. stringplayer92 (annotator) (1682)

Some very sloppy opening mistakes, but then I capitalize on his capturing of a poison pawn.  An easy example of the power of the initiative.  This tactic reminds me of the old ""see-saw"" tactic with the rooks...

Hope you enjoy."
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I like this move because of the flexibility.  I can transpose into either the French or Sicilian, both are openings I play.  Sometimes these ""different"" move orders will throw-off the players that simply copy opening books such as MCO."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Here I made the choice to offer to transpose into the sicilian.  Though my main opening is the French, I get tried of playing against the exchange variation all the time.  Against the 1500-1600 range many players play the exchange.  Psychologically, I know that they are probably wanting to go into a simple game that is not in the main lines."
