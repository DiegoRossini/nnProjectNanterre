2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,The O'Kelly or Paulsen variation.

5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/1p1ppppp/p7/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"Compare this with the position after 2...Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 d6, another typical variation in the Sicilian.  You'll notice that the bishop on f8 now has more freedom to move.  And so in many variations the bishop can be placed actively on b4 or c5."

14,d5,d7d5,r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1n2n2/3pp1N1/2B1P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"Black sacrifices a pawn, making way for the bishop on c8."
15,Bxd5,c4d5,r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1n2n2/3Bp1N1/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,This is where the players leave the Game DB. The continuation 8.exd5 Nd4 9.c3 gave white the advantage in 'cormac (1600) vs. homunculi (1604) 1-0' and 'elmewi (1762) vs. ilpo (1637) 1-0' (Gameknot)
16,Nxd5,f6d5,r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1n5/3np1N1/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,Black now has the bishop pair.

18,Nb4,c6b4,r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p7/3Pp1N1/1n6/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 10,"?? Defends the pawn, but gives away the advantage. 10.a3!? Qxd5 11.axb4 Bxb4  12.c3 Qxg2 13.Qf3 Qxf3 14.Nxf3 and white is obviously better. (10....Nxd5 11.Nc3! gives white an edge because of threats like 12.Qxd8  Kxg8 13.Nxf7 )"
19,c4,c2c4,r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p7/3Pp1N1/1nP5/8/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 10,"?? Defends the pawn, but gives away the advantage. 10.a3!? Qxd5 11.axb4 Bxb4  12.c3 Qxg2 13.Qf3 Qxf3 14.Nxf3 and white is obviously better. (10....Nxd5 11.Nc3! gives white an edge because of threats like 12.Qxd8  Kxg8 13.Nxf7 )"
20,Bf5,c8f5,r2qkb1r/1p3ppp/p7/3PpbN1/1nP5/8/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 11,! Now black is winning. Attacking squares c2 and d3 simultaneously.
21,Na3,b1a3,r2qkb1r/1p3ppp/p7/3PpbN1/1nP5/N7/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 11,"If white tries 11.0-0?, then 11...Nc2 would give black serious advantage."

23,Kf1,e1f1,r2qkb1r/1p3ppp/p7/3PpbN1/2P5/N2n4/PP3PPP/R1BQ1K1R b kq - 4 12,"?? Unfortunately not the best move here.  Ofcourse black is threatening mate on f2, but too bad he missed this perfect opportunity to play 12....Bc5!, because black is simply winning after 13.Qf3 Qf6."
24,Qb6,d8b6,r3kb1r/1p3ppp/pq6/3PpbN1/2P5/N2n4/PP3PPP/R1BQ1K1R w kq - 5 13,"?? Unfortunately not the best move here.  Ofcourse black is threatening mate on f2, but too bad he missed this perfect opportunity to play 12....Bc5!, because black is simply winning after 13.Qf3 Qf6."
25,Qa4+,d1a4,r3kb1r/1p3ppp/pq6/3PpbN1/Q1P5/N2n4/PP3PPP/R1B2K1R b kq - 6 13,! With this check white can just save himself. The bishop on f5 is lured away.

27,Qc2,a4c2,r3kb1r/1p1b1ppp/pq6/3Pp1N1/2P5/N2n4/PPQ2PPP/R1B2K1R b kq - 8 14,Only move. The position is about equal again.

31,Re1,c1e1,r3k2r/1p1b1ppp/pq6/2bPp1N1/2P5/N7/PPQ2PPP/4RK1R b kq - 2 16,It might be tempting to play 16.Nxh7? but 16...Qh6 17.Re1 f6 wins for black. (Not 17.Qxh7?! because 18.Rxe5  Kf8 19.Qxh7 Rxh7 20.Nxb1 wins for white.)
32,f6,f7f6,r3k2r/1p1b2pp/pq3p2/2bPp1N1/2P5/N7/PPQ2PPP/4RK1R w kq - 0 17,The next move came as quite a surprise to me!
