1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,It starts off with the kings pawn Opening
2,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,Now My opponent comes out with his knight first which is fatal for my plan
3,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 2,and i follow
4,e5,e7e5,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,then he brings out his kings pawn
5,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,and my knight
6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,then his knight so it basically starts off with a 4 knights opening
7,Nxe5,f3e5,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4N3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,Now Here is where the Halloween's Gambit starts out by me sacrificing my knight to gain the middle
8,Nxe5,c6e5,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4n3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,Naturally he is gonna take it
9,d4,d2d4,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4n3/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,Then I push his knights back
10,Nc6,e5c6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,And here there are other places he could have gone and this opening still works but this is the easiest
11,d5,d4d5,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/3P4/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,so I kep chaseing the Knight away
12,Ne5,c6e5,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/3Pn3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,Then he comes back to where my pawn was...
13,f4,f2f4,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/3Pn3/4PP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,and I push again
14,Ng6,e5g6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5nn1/3P4/4PP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,So then he moves to the other side I could keep chasing but it would not do me any good
15,e5,e4e5,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5nn1/3PP3/5P2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,So here i chase the other knight and push him back to his original spot
16,Ng8,f6g8,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/6n1/3PP3/5P2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 9,OK at this point i have complete control of the middle of the board
17,d6,d5d6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/3P2n1/4P3/5P2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 9,and so now i want to box him in so he will take with the pawn on C7
18,cxd6,c7d6,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/3p2n1/4P3/5P2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 10,and then i will counter with my pawn
19,exd6,e5d6,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/3P2n1/8/5P2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 10,now he is boxed in now there are other moves that could be made but there are also other counters for the opening as well but this is what you usually end up with after the Halloween's gambit but since it worked out so well let me show you the rest of the game. Now look and my opponent has basically no position at all.
20,Qb6,d8b6,r1b1kbnr/pp1p1ppp/1q1P2n1/8/5P2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 11,Here of course he brings his queen out to try and get rid of the pawn so i will counter once again
