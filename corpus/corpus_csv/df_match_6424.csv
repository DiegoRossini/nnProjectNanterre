Because of the structure of the pawns at the center, his other bishop seems also weak. Usually white wins when he is able to build strong center when the game is short. In the long games black might have better chances at the end game, since after many exhanges the white pawns will remain at distance from his King's protection."

But Ne8 seems better to me as his other Knight would still have more room to move. With the move in the game he limits the movement capability of his other Knight and I am using this opportunity at once.
