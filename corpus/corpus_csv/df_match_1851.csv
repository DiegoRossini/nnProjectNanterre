1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I played as black in this game. I'm still trying to learn the basics of the Kings Indian, and won this game because of sheer luck. Of course, I'd rather not like to win this way, and would like any input you guys can give."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"A flexible response. I can still go d5 and transpose if I wish, as well as do many other things."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"I'm not grabbing the center, so he is."
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Preparing Bg7.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"Here, he can't play e5, because after the exchanges, his knight will have had to move backward, losing time."
6,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"Here, he can't play e5, because after the exchanges, his knight will have had to move backward, losing time."
7,e4,e2e4,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"Here, he can't play e5, because after the exchanges, his knight will have had to move backward, losing time."
8,d6,d7d6,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"Here, he can't play e5, because after the exchanges, his knight will have had to move backward, losing time."
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"I debated Bg4 here. However, White could just kick it away with h3, since Bh5 loses the Bishop."
10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 2 6,This seemed more natural to me.

12,e5,e7e5,rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/3p1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 7,"While it looks like this loses a pawn, I don't think it does because after dxe5, dxe5, Nxe5, Nxe4! With a discovered attack on the e5 Knight."
13,dxe5,d4e5,rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/3p1np1/4P3/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 7,"This came as a shock to me. I think the best move here would have just been to move the rook, seeing what happened."
