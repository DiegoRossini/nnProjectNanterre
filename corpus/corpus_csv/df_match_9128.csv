Probably this is a mistake. Too passive. Black usually fights for the control of the c-file with Rc8 and then Qc7. Rb8 sustains the b-pawn, but I can fight about my plan with tranquillity."

The change of Knights was forced, I think. My Nd5 was too strong and it was ruining the position of black. But now maybe I should have played 17. Bxd5 cause my Queen will be attack many times... not a good choice."

Another imprecision! Why to wait for 18. Qd2? The threat on e6? My opponent is not blind and with the simple Rc7 it can defend the pawn and prepare the square c8 for the b-Rook."

This wouldn't happened if I had played 17. Bxd5. My previous choices are bringing me towards oblivion."

Again, 20. Qd2 was more accurate, but now there is no imminent attack against Queen in this central square. The problem is that my c2 pawn will be more weak."

What is this?? Another Queen's move? If you look at my previous 10 moves, you will note that I've moved my lady 6 times!! She's a lady, not Rambo! And again, now her movements are limited to the diagonals. The poor pawn e7 was a goal to avoid!

Remember, don't play like me in this game. Never go for something you will never have."
