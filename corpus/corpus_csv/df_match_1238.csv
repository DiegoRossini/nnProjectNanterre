5,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 3,The variation played by white is called the Schlechter variation.
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3PP3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 4,"After Nf6, e5, Nfd7 was play, this position reminds me of Steinitz variation, but instead the knight on c3, white has the bishop on d3"

9,Qg4,d1g4,rnbqkb1r/pppn1ppp/4p3/3pP3/3P2Q1/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 2 5,"Qg4, At the first glance, I thought this move is weird, why would white develop the queen so early in the opening? (I'm not sure if this is the main line) then I had a good look, realized that this move is not bad, because it stops me from developing my dsb, the queen also is now defending d4 and I can't really chase her away successfully, h5 would weaken my kingside."
