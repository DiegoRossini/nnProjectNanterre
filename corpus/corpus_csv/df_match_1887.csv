1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

This game started off as a Dutch Defense in a thematic mini-tournament.  This resulted in closed positional play right until the latter part of the middlegame where I managed to win a pawn and go into an endgame with a pawn up.  You would think this ought to have been a straightforward win, wouldn't you?  Well, not quite - let's throw some opposite coloured bishops into the mix and things were not as straightforward as they seemed, even when I increased the advantage to that of two pawns the graffiti on my wall was reading ""Low Draw"".  However, before hitting that Offer Draw button, I decided to have one last throw of the dice but did it pay off?  Well, in order to find out you will have to read on ......"
