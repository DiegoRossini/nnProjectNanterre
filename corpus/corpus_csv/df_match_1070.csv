1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"First off, thank you for watching my game.   this is the third game i will be posting with this gambit. the 2 previous ones had very uncommon replies on move 3. This third game had a more classical development and i wanted to show a possible result and also save this game >< i hope you enjoy."
2,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"if you've seen my other annotated games, it comes to no surprise i like to play the nimzowitsch and is a reason i like annotating these games because i rarely see them played,"
3,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 2,and of course my favorite but very dangerous f5 for the whites who know the lines.
4,f5,f7f5,r1bqkbnr/ppppp1pp/2n5/5p2/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,and of course my favorite but very dangerous f5 for the whites who know the lines.
5,exf5,e4f5,r1bqkbnr/ppppp1pp/2n5/5P2/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"gambit accepted. i think this is the first one i post where the gambit is accepted,

its meant to undermine whites middle and take it for yourself. the proper reply is d5 to take middle and recapture the pawn with your WSB"
6,d5,d7d5,r1bqkbnr/ppp1p1pp/2n5/3p1P2/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"this is one of the most common and aggressive replies by white,"
7,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/ppp1p1pp/2n5/1B1p1P2/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"this is one of the most common and aggressive replies by white,"
8,Bxf5,c8f5,r2qkbnr/ppp1p1pp/2n5/1B1p1b2/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"followed by recapturing the pawn,   some whites will double pawn you here immediately if they dont know the lines well and to avoid further black shannanigans, a double pawn situation is acceptable and very playable for the black as this opening makes for a strong king side attack and apart from getting double pawned it might be the only time you play on the queen side of the board."
9,d3,d2d3,r2qkbnr/ppp1p1pp/2n5/1B1p1b2/8/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"it is wiser for white to go d4 immediately over d3, this will help me gain time and be prepared for his counter assault."
10,e6,e7e6,r2qkbnr/ppp3pp/2n1p3/1B1p1b2/8/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,e6 is the proper reply. if white takes out the DSB. you block with your DSB. if he promotes his knight to e5 you defend with your queen on d6.
11,Ne5,f3e5,r2qkbnr/ppp3pp/2n1p3/1B1pNb2/8/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,my oponent decided to play the knight now. you see the importance of d4 over d3 last move it will gain me time to reinforce my other knight and have no possible double bishop pins
12,Qd6,d8d6,r3kbnr/ppp3pp/2nqp3/1B1pNb2/8/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 7,my oponent decided to play the knight now. you see the importance of d4 over d3 last move it will gain me time to reinforce my other knight and have no possible double bishop pins
13,d4,d3d4,r3kbnr/ppp3pp/2nqp3/1B1pNb2/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,a move too late my friend ><
14,Nge7,g8e7,r3kb1r/ppp1n1pp/2nqp3/1B1pNb2/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 8,now all is left is to kick the bishop away or force the entire exchange as i like to do
15,O-O,e1g1,r3kb1r/ppp1n1pp/2nqp3/1B1pNb2/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 2 8,"it was either castle, playing his knight or his DSB, but he is now a move behind all because of his d3"
16,a6,a7a6,r3kb1r/1pp1n1pp/p1nqp3/1B1pNb2/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 9,kick
17,Bxc6+,b5c6,r3kb1r/1pp1n1pp/p1Bqp3/3pNb2/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 9,my oponent decides to not retreat and open up the game its desired
18,Nxc6,e7c6,r3kb1r/1pp3pp/p1nqp3/3pNb2/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 10,here he probably knows that on my following move i will trade off knights and try to gain a pawn with my queen and he decides to swap out knights instead of reinforcing the position i think this was a mistake.
19,Nxc6,e5c6,r3kb1r/1pp3pp/p1Nqp3/3p1b2/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 10,"now if we look at the board on move 10. he has 3 passive pieces top right side. with 1 middle pawn gone. black has center control and is 2 moves from full development and onwards king side attack,
the bearing down on the c3 pawn is also supposed to force my oponent into defending it thus giving me more time. my play simple develop bishop to d3, king side castle having the open file from my f5 move,"
20,Qxc6,d6c6,r3kb1r/1pp3pp/p1q1p3/3p1b2/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 11,"now if we look at the board on move 10. he has 3 passive pieces top right side. with 1 middle pawn gone. black has center control and is 2 moves from full development and onwards king side attack,
the bearing down on the c3 pawn is also supposed to force my oponent into defending it thus giving me more time. my play simple develop bishop to d3, king side castle having the open file from my f5 move,"
21,Nc3,b1c3,r3kb1r/1pp3pp/p1q1p3/3p1b2/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 11,"his most anticipated reply but i love this because it solidifies whites thinking that the c2 pawn is safe.

white players is c3 a better move?"
22,Bd6,f8d6,r3k2r/1pp3pp/p1qbp3/3p1b2/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 12,take my favorite diagonal for my DSB
23,Qh5+,d1h5,r3k2r/1pp3pp/p1qbp3/3p1b1Q/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 3 12,"he decided to pull a queen check now it is too late he had to do it way earlier when he still had his other knight. he missed his left side opurtunity for counter tricks, 

to defend this it is very important not to use your pawns keep em aligned as long as possible having lost the F file pawn"
24,Bg6,f5g6,r3k2r/1pp3pp/p1qbp1b1/3p3Q/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 4 13,"here if the queen doesnt retreat to e2 or d1 i will take that c3 pawn i was eyeing earlier and that false sense of security he got with his knight,"
