1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I played a pretty (but probably not very sound) knight sacrifice, getting two pawns and a dangerous pawn roller. Then I won a piece, and the rest was just endgame technique. (not very good technique, because I allowed a pawn fork in time-trouble)
