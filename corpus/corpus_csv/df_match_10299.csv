1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone, has anybody ever offered a draw to somebody only to analyse the game with a buddy (albeit a much higher rated buddy) and find that you may well have won some material if you had carried on playing.  Well, this was one of my worst draw offers in Gameknot history.  The only think I can say in mitigation that it was near the end of my Big Slump which happened fairly early on in my gameknot career which saw my rating go down to 1525 - I just wanted to end a losing run so I took a low draw - I was that desperate man!  Thankfully a few months later, after playing 2 months of unrated games non-stop I was on the up.  But here is the pits."

Your last move was a very good one indeed to attack Black's tangle of pieces in the centre. You might not have realised it, but Black's bishop was going to take some extricating! 23...exd4 lost the bishop outright after 24.e5! (Bxe5 25.Nxe5 Qf4 26.cxd4 etc). 23...Nc6 and ...Ng6 were no help owing to 24.dxe5. Black could have saved his piece only by this wriggle: 23...c6 24.dxe5 Qa7ch 25.Kh1 Bb8 (...Bc7 looks too risky after Rd7). After that 26.e6 seems to give White the initiative at least and maybe an edge as well.

So there you have it.  I was guilty of underestimating my position and mistakenly thought that my opponent had the edge - oh dear!"
