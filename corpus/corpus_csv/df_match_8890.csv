1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Alekhine's Defence again.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,Alekhine's Defence again.
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"!? I momentarily forget myself and thrust the d pawn forward, rather than the usual e-pawn.  As it wasn't deliberate, I can't really take credit for this gambit, but it works rather well."
4,Nxe4,f6e4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/8/3Pn3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"immediately undermining the N's support, using the same method I usually employ in the Petroff"
5,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/8/3Pn3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 3,"immediately undermining the N's support, using the same method I usually employ in the Petroff"
6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3Pn3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 4,"immediately undermining the N's support, using the same method I usually employ in the Petroff"
7,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PPn3/3B4/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 4,"immediately undermining the N's support, using the same method I usually employ in the Petroff"
8,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PPn3/3B4/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,"an option not available to Black in the Petroff.  This seems a sensible response, though it does block Black's WSB in."
9,Ne2,g1e2,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PPn3/3B4/PP2NPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,Preparing Nc3 so that I don't necessarily get doubled pawns. Also preparing castling.
10,Bb4+,f8b4,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/1bPPn3/3B4/PP2NPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 6,so now I either give up castling or submit to doubled pawns or a big swap off: not ideal when I've given up a pawn.
11,Nbc3,b1c3,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/1bPPn3/2NB4/PP2NPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 6,retaking with the pawn to gain a tempo.  Doubled pawns can soon be sorted out and I've spotted a great square for the N.
12,Nxc3,e4c3,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/1bPP4/2nB4/PP2NPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,retaking with the pawn to gain a tempo.  Doubled pawns can soon be sorted out and I've spotted a great square for the N.
13,bxc3,b2c3,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/1bPP4/2PB4/P3NPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,retaking with the pawn to gain a tempo.  Doubled pawns can soon be sorted out and I've spotted a great square for the N.
14,Be7,b4e7,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/2PB4/P3NPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 8,sorting out my pawns and preparing my next manoeuvre
15,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4p3/3P4/3P4/2PB4/P3NPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,sorting out my pawns and preparing my next manoeuvre
16,exd5,e6d5,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/8/3p4/3P4/2PB4/P3NPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,Preparing to occupy the open file and tucking my K away.
17,O-O,e1g1,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/8/3p4/3P4/2PB4/P3NPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 9,Preparing to occupy the open file and tucking my K away.
18,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qk2r/ppp1bppp/8/3p4/3P2b1/2PB4/P3NPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 10,"pinning the N, which delays my planned move to f4 but I have a useful move already prepared."
19,Re1,f1e1,rn1qk2r/ppp1bppp/8/3p4/3P2b1/2PB4/P3NPPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq - 3 10,getting out of the way of potential pins and preparing to contest the e-file
20,O-O,e8g8,rn1q1rk1/ppp1bppp/8/3p4/3P2b1/2PB4/P3NPPP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 4 11,getting out of the way of potential pins and preparing to contest the e-file
21,Qc2,d1c2,rn1q1rk1/ppp1bppp/8/3p4/3P2b1/2PB4/P1Q1NPPP/R1B1R1K1 b - - 5 11,unpinning the N and setting up my first attack on the K's position.
22,h6,h7h6,rn1q1rk1/ppp1bpp1/7p/3p4/3P2b1/2PB4/P1Q1NPPP/R1B1R1K1 w - - 0 12,"with the N ready to go to f4, perhaps not the best response.  11... g6 also looks unappealing, though, with White's QB ready to go to h6.  11...f5 is even less appealing when W can hit the Bg4 with 12. h3 and then pick off the f-pawn."
23,Nf4,e2f4,rn1q1rk1/ppp1bpp1/7p/3p4/3P1Nb1/2PB4/P1Q2PPP/R1B1R1K1 b - - 1 12,threatening to win back the pawn with Nxd5 followed by Rxe7
24,c6,c7c6,rn1q1rk1/pp2bpp1/2p4p/3p4/3P1Nb1/2PB4/P1Q2PPP/R1B1R1K1 w - - 0 13,"so Black plays a natural defensive move, the drawback being that it deprive the Nb8 of its natural square"
25,h3,h2h3,rn1q1rk1/pp2bpp1/2p4p/3p4/3P1Nb1/2PB3P/P1Q2PP1/R1B1R1K1 b - - 0 13,forcing Black into an awkward choice: where to move the B?  Only d7 or c8 look safe but d7 deprives the N of another square and c8 is completely undeveloping.
26,Bd7,g4d7,rn1q1rk1/pp1bbpp1/2p4p/3p4/3P1N2/2PB3P/P1Q2PP1/R1B1R1K1 w - - 1 14,Now Black has a serious problem trying to complete his development and White's kingside attack is almost ready.
27,c4,c3c4,rn1q1rk1/pp1bbpp1/2p4p/3p4/2PP1N2/3B3P/P1Q2PP1/R1B1R1K1 b - - 0 14,inviting ...
28,dxc4,d5c4,rn1q1rk1/pp1bbpp1/2p4p/8/2pP1N2/3B3P/P1Q2PP1/R1B1R1K1 w - - 0 15,pinning the f-pawn and threatening Ng6
29,Bxc4,d3c4,rn1q1rk1/pp1bbpp1/2p4p/8/2BP1N2/7P/P1Q2PP1/R1B1R1K1 b - - 0 15,pinning the f-pawn and threatening Ng6
30,Bb4,e7b4,rn1q1rk1/pp1b1pp1/2p4p/8/1bBP1N2/7P/P1Q2PP1/R1B1R1K1 w - - 1 16,"after a long think, removing the sting from the planned fork and attacking my R, which wants to move anyway ... Hang on, I still need to develop my DSB.  Now's my ideal opportunity, connecting my Rs"
