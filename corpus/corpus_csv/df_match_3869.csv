1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

This game was part of the Sicilian Pelikan themed MT started by Concordborn.  It was a victory against an opponent with an optimum rating of 1903.  This is a long game spanning 69 moves.  I managed to be a pawn up in a Q & P ending and to shepherd my extra pawn to Glendadom.  Meanwhile, Henry had to run the gauntlet from the Wicked Witch of the West.  He did this by using an enemy pawn as a Human Shield.  After that, his two wives then covered him, aaaah!  Once the checks ran out my opponent waved the white flag.  Here is how it happened, folks - firstly here is the Gameknot Analysis.   http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17526707&rnd=0.10930306846589815"
