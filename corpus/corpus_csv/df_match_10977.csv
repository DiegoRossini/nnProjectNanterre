5,Bb5+,f1b5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/1BppP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 3,Offering a clean bishop exchange in preparation for 0-0.
6,Bd7,c8d7,rn1qkbnr/pp1bpppp/8/1BppP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 4,Black accepts the idea.
7,Bd3,b5d3,rn1qkbnr/pp1bpppp/8/2ppP3/8/3B4/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 3 4,"? Having already offered to trade light squared bishops, white renegs on the deal and chooses to move the bishop for a second time in a game only four moves old. Notice that addition to breaking that ""rule"", he has chosen the worst possible square to move it to. Bad idea.  Black wants to take advantage of white's backward d pawn."
8,c4,c5c4,rn1qkbnr/pp1bpppp/8/3pP3/2p5/3B4/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,Black sees the tempo gaining expansion move.
9,Bf1,d3f1,rn1qkbnr/pp1bpppp/8/3pP3/2p5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 1 5,White is now WAY behind in development.
10,Bf5,d7f5,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3pPb2/2p5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 2 6,"This bishop is now safe to move outside the pawn chain, where it can exert more influence."
11,d3,d2d3,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3pPb2/2p5/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,White now tries to deal with his backward pawn.
12,cxd3,c4d3,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3pPb2/8/3p4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,?! Not too sure about this one. Perhaps cxd was better.
13,Bxd3,f1d3,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3pPb2/8/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 7,?! Not too sure about this one. Perhaps cxd was better.
14,Bxd3,f5d3,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3pP3/8/3b4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 8,"Unbelievable. After such suspect opening play, white has established a very solid position."
15,cxd3,c2d3,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3pP3/8/3P4/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 8,"Unbelievable. After such suspect opening play, white has established a very solid position."

18,Bb4+,f8b4,rn1qk1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/3pP3/1b1P4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 10,"At this point, black realizes that he probably just screwed up that opening advantage. He intends to position himself for the most advantageous endgame position as quickly as possible. He shoots for a fast few skirmishes that hopefully will result in a R & P endgame."
19,Nd2,b1d2,rn1qk1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/3pP3/1b1P4/8/PP1N1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 2 10,"? Again, I question that move. It further restricts the dark squared bishop. Perhaps Bd2 was better."

26,Nxd4,c6d4,r3k2r/pp2nppp/4p3/q2pP3/1b1n1P2/P7/1P1N1KPP/R1BQ2NR w kq - 0 14,Black launches the attack.
