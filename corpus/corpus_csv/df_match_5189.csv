1,h4,h2h4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/7P/8/PPPPPPP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Now, those who have a slightest idea about chess have probably already assumed that this game is going to be intolerable!"
2,a5,a7a5,rnbqkbnr/1ppppppp/8/p7/7P/8/PPPPPPP1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,It seems as though as if black has chosen one of the worst ever tactics; copycat. Especially when white has not played a great move.
3,b4,b2b4,rnbqkbnr/1ppppppp/8/p7/1P5P/8/P1PPPPP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,eh? it seems white wants to threaten black but forgot to defend the pawn!
4,a4,a5a4,rnbqkbnr/1ppppppp/8/8/pP5P/8/P1PPPPP1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Now black has felt threatened and basically avoided it!
5,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/1ppppppp/8/8/pPP4P/8/P2PPPP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,This game is now suspiciosly looking like a game to do with just pawns
6,b6,b7b6,rnbqkbnr/2pppppp/1p6/8/pPP4P/8/P2PPPP1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,I have no clue what so ever why someone would do that move unless they wanted to play the modern opening  but I doubt it would be very effective now!!
7,Qxa4,d1a4,rnbqkbnr/2pppppp/1p6/8/QPP4P/8/P2PPPP1/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"Oh! Now I get it. White must have played c4 to earn that pawn. However, it is difficult to comprehend how a pawn for a queen would be of any benifit."
8,b5,b6b5,rnbqkbnr/2pppppp/8/1p6/QPP4P/8/P2PPPP1/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 0 5,I guess black missed its chance and basically blundered its rook.
9,Qa5,a4a5,rnbqkbnr/2pppppp/8/Qp6/1PP4P/8/P2PPPP1/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 1 5,Maybe not; white still seems willing to give up its queen.
10,Ba6,c8a6,rn1qkbnr/2pppppp/b7/Qp6/1PP4P/8/P2PPPP1/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 2 6,How clever of black; it stopped white's queen taking its rook and protected its pawn but maybe RXa5 would have been simpler.
11,e4,e2e4,rn1qkbnr/2pppppp/b7/Qp6/1PP1P2P/8/P2P1PP1/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 0 6,Probably whites best move yet!
12,c5,c7c5,rn1qkbnr/3ppppp/b7/Qpp5/1PP1P2P/8/P2P1PP1/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 0 7,"Black seems to be hoping that white does not note that surprise attack on the queen, though in most people's opinion black should have taken the queen for free when it had its chance."
13,Qb6,a5b6,rn1qkbnr/3ppppp/bQ6/1pp5/1PP1P2P/8/P2P1PP1/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 1 7,White really does seem determine to give up its queen
14,d5,d7d5,rn1qkbnr/4pppp/bQ6/1ppp4/1PP1P2P/8/P2P1PP1/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 0 8,Maybe black wants to gain control of the center finally!
15,exd5,e4d5,rn1qkbnr/4pppp/bQ6/1ppP4/1PP4P/8/P2P1PP1/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 0 8,But white has mastered the art of taking!
16,e6,e7e6,rn1qkbnr/5ppp/bQ2p3/1ppP4/1PP4P/8/P2P1PP1/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 0 9,Black cannot bear such a shame and retorts with another lousy attack.
17,dxe6,d5e6,rn1qkbnr/5ppp/bQ2P3/1pp5/1PP4P/8/P2P1PP1/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 0 9,"White's pawn trundles on, bashing through black's defences!"
18,Nf6,g8f6,rn1qkb1r/5ppp/bQ2Pn2/1pp5/1PP4P/8/P2P1PP1/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 1 10,Ah! Black has decided that now is a pleasant time to get more control of the center! (bad timing)!
19,exf7+,e6f7,rn1qkb1r/5Ppp/bQ3n2/1pp5/1PP4P/8/P2P1PP1/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 0 10,How amazing! white'spawn has now reached to the king unharmed. Maybe a queen is likely
20,Kd7,e8d7,rn1q1b1r/3k1Ppp/bQ3n2/1pp5/1PP4P/8/P2P1PP1/RNB1KBNR w KQ - 1 11,Black was limited to a few squares but surely it should've taken the pawn!
