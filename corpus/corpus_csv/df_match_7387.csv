1,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This was an interesting game that had me extremely pressured and on the defence despite being a whole piece ahead. White begins the game with the Bird's Opening
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"nothing special so far...Black has slightly better control of the centre, while White could have an opportunity for a future kingside attack - nothing decisive so far"
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/5P2/5N2/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"nothing special so far...Black has slightly better control of the centre, while White could have an opportunity for a future kingside attack - nothing decisive so far"
4,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/5P2/5N2/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"nothing special so far...Black has slightly better control of the centre, while White could have an opportunity for a future kingside attack - nothing decisive so far"
5,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/5P2/4PN2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"nothing special so far...Black has slightly better control of the centre, while White could have an opportunity for a future kingside attack - nothing decisive so far"
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/2pp4/5P2/4PN2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,"nothing special so far...Black has slightly better control of the centre, while White could have an opportunity for a future kingside attack - nothing decisive so far"
7,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/1Bpp4/5P2/4PN2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 4,pinning the knight...
8,Bd7,c8d7,r2qkbnr/pp1bpppp/2n5/1Bpp4/5P2/4PN2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 3 5,but that is easily averted. I now look at queenside castling
9,c3,c2c3,r2qkbnr/pp1bpppp/2n5/1Bpp4/5P2/2P1PN2/PP1P2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"?! I'm not sure what the point of this move is, especially since it blocks the c3 square for White's knight. 5.d4 or 5.Nc3 would have been better alternatives"
10,Qb6,d8b6,r3kbnr/pp1bpppp/1qn5/1Bpp4/5P2/2P1PN2/PP1P2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 6,attempting to force the bishop away....
11,Na3,b1a3,r3kbnr/pp1bpppp/1qn5/1Bpp4/5P2/N1P1PN2/PP1P2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 6,"but White would like the bishop to stay. The defending knight, however, isn't going to be as safe as it would like to be...."
12,e6,e7e6,r3kbnr/pp1b1ppp/1qn1p3/1Bpp4/5P2/N1P1PN2/PP1P2PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"the start of a pawn chain, and a chance to get up a piece. Will White see it?"
13,Ne5,f3e5,r3kbnr/pp1b1ppp/1qn1p3/1BppN3/5P2/N1P1P3/PP1P2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,nope - White instead advances his other knight. Better would have been to retreat the bishop to stop Black's next move...
14,c4,c5c4,r3kbnr/pp1b1ppp/1qn1p3/1B1pN3/2p2P2/N1P1P3/PP1P2PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"! the threat here is 8...Bxa3 9.bxa3 Qxb5, with the added bonus of doubled pawns on the a file. White sees this and tries to stop the threat...."
15,b4,b2b4,r3kbnr/pp1b1ppp/1qn1p3/1B1pN3/1Pp2P2/N1P1P3/P2P2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq b3 0 8,and it should have been enough to stop Black getting a material advantage...
16,Nxe5,c6e5,r3kbnr/pp1b1ppp/1q2p3/1B1pn3/1Pp2P2/N1P1P3/P2P2PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,"? were it not for this move. White should have played Bxd7 first, and now Black wins a piece..."
17,fxe5,f4e5,r3kbnr/pp1b1ppp/1q2p3/1B1pP3/1Pp5/N1P1P3/P2P2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 9,"? were it not for this move. White should have played Bxd7 first, and now Black wins a piece..."
18,Bxb5,d7b5,r3kbnr/pp3ppp/1q2p3/1b1pP3/1Pp5/N1P1P3/P2P2PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 10,like this. Now it should just be a simple matter of trading down material to have an endgame advantage for Black
19,Nxb5,a3b5,r3kbnr/pp3ppp/1q2p3/1N1pP3/1Pp5/2P1P3/P2P2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 10,like this. Now it should just be a simple matter of trading down material to have an endgame advantage for Black
20,Qxb5,b6b5,r3kbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/1q1pP3/1Pp5/2P1P3/P2P2PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 11,like this. Now it should just be a simple matter of trading down material to have an endgame advantage for Black
21,a4,a2a4,r3kbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/1q1pP3/PPp5/2P1P3/3P2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 11,chasing my queen away....
22,Qd7,b5d7,r3kbnr/pp1q1ppp/4p3/3pP3/PPp5/2P1P3/3P2PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 12,and the queen makes sure that White doesn't get any more attacks on her
23,a5,a4a5,r3kbnr/pp1q1ppp/4p3/P2pP3/1Pp5/2P1P3/3P2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 12,White's a and b pawns could turn out to be pretty dangerous....
24,O-O-O,e8c8,2kr1bnr/pp1q1ppp/4p3/P2pP3/1Pp5/2P1P3/3P2PP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 1 13,so maybe castling wasn't the best option here. Better would have been 12...a6
25,d4,d2d4,2kr1bnr/pp1q1ppp/4p3/P2pP3/1PpP4/2P1P3/6PP/R1BQK2R b KQ d3 0 13,now White chooses to shut off the queenside. I'm not worried - all my pieces are on the kingside.
26,f5,f7f5,2kr1bnr/pp1q2pp/4p3/P2pPp2/1PpP4/2P1P3/6PP/R1BQK2R w KQ f6 0 14,"hoping to provoke an en passant capture, to allow my pieces some breathing room (e.g 14.exf5 e.p Nxf6 with Bd6 next move)"
27,O-O,e1g1,2kr1bnr/pp1q2pp/4p3/P2pPp2/1PpP4/2P1P3/6PP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 14,White will have none of it!
