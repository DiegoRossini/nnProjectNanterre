1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

After the last match against Master Freddy at least I knew one thing!  I couldn't do much worse against him could I?  Well, if you are a fan of the eighties pop group Yazz you will know that ""The Only Way is Up, Baby ......."""
2,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"2. ....... f5 - Well, this game, although I eventually lose it, is a bit of an improvement.  First of all, Freddy does not give me a head start, at least I think he doesn't!  He kicks off with 1. d4 and I respond with f5, the Dutch Defense.  Now the reason I decided to go Dutch is the buzzword ""Stonewall"".  I like it, because that, I feel, is the best way to deal with the Master Mater - Stonewall him!!!!!"
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"4. h4 - I am beginning to get accustomed to Freddy's little pawn pushes down that h file.  Watch out for that one.  The purpose of this is, if I put a pawn on g6 he will play h5, undermining that pawn chain one way or another."

I think the downside of this though is that Fou Leblanc becomes a bad bishop.  I have an uneasy feeling of deja vu here.  I played the Dutch against Ion and I lost that game due to Fou Leblanc's severely restricted movements.
