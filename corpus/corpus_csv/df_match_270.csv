https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Indian_Defence,_S%C3%A4misch_Variation"
10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2P2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR w KQ - 1 6,The usual moves.
11,Be3,c1e3,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N1BP2/PP4PP/R2QKBNR b KQ - 2 6,The usual moves.
12,Nc6,b8c6,r1bq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/2np1np1/8/2PPP3/2N1BP2/PP4PP/R2QKBNR w KQ - 3 7,"Panno Variation: 6...Nc6 
The Panno line, named after Oscar Panno, is a sharp and highly theoretical system which can lead to very complicated play. Black holds back the c-pawn for the time being, and aims to put the knight on d4. The immediate plan is to prepare queenside counterplay with ...a6, ...Rb8 followed by ...b5."
13,Nge2,g1e2,r1bq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/2np1np1/8/2PPP3/2N1BP2/PP2N1PP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 4 7,"This is the usual reply, so that if 7.....e5 8. d4 black can't play Nd4, which is a very strong sacrifice if say 7. Qd2 e5 8. d4 Nd4 white shouldn't grab the pawn with 9. Bxd4 exd4 10. Qxd4 because of 10....Nxe4!! with advantage to black."
14,e5,e7e5,r1bq1rk1/ppp2pbp/2np1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2N1BP2/PP2N1PP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 8,7.... a6 may be stronger.
15,d5,d4d5,r1bq1rk1/ppp2pbp/2np1np1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N1BP2/PP2N1PP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 8,So close the centre.
16,Ne7,c6e7,r1bq1rk1/ppp1npbp/3p1np1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N1BP2/PP2N1PP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 1 9,Knight drops back.
17,Qd2,d1d2,r1bq1rk1/ppp1npbp/3p1np1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N1BP2/PP1QN1PP/R3KB1R b KQ - 2 9,"Now I do the usual queen move, maybe playing Bh6 at some stage as part of a king-side attack and/or 0-0-0."
18,Ne8,f6e8,r1bqnrk1/ppp1npbp/3p2p1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N1BP2/PP1QN1PP/R3KB1R w KQ - 3 10,He prepares the thematic f7-f5 break.
19,g4,g2g4,r1bqnrk1/ppp1npbp/3p2p1/3Pp3/2P1P1P1/2N1BP2/PP1QN2P/R3KB1R b KQ - 0 10,So basically I am saying - well if you do play f7-f5 I will at least open the g file against your king.
20,f5,f7f5,r1bqnrk1/ppp1n1bp/3p2p1/3Ppp2/2P1P1P1/2N1BP2/PP1QN2P/R3KB1R w KQ - 0 11,But he plays it anyway.
21,gxf5,g4f5,r1bqnrk1/ppp1n1bp/3p2p1/3PpP2/2P1P3/2N1BP2/PP1QN2P/R3KB1R b KQ - 0 11,I take.
22,gxf5,g6f5,r1bqnrk1/ppp1n1bp/3p4/3Ppp2/2P1P3/2N1BP2/PP1QN2P/R3KB1R w KQ - 0 12,"He takes back. Here I had a mental aberration. I wanted to play 12. Bh3 but thought that he could win a piece with 12......f4, because if I play 13. Bxc8 I was afraid of him playing fxe3 attacking my queen. It was only after I castled I realised that I had 14. Be6+ saving my light squared bishop and going a pawn up. However later I found out that 0-0-0 is in fact the most widely played move here."

25,Bf2,e3f2,r1bqnrk1/ppp1n1bp/3p4/3Pp3/2P1Pp2/2N2P2/PP1QNB1P/2KR1B1R b - - 1 13,Bishop drops back.
26,Ng6,e7g6,r1bqnrk1/ppp3bp/3p2n1/3Pp3/2P1Pp2/2N2P2/PP1QNB1P/2KR1B1R w - - 2 14,With ideas of going to h4 to attack f3.
27,Qe1,d2e1,r1bqnrk1/ppp3bp/3p2n1/3Pp3/2P1Pp2/2N2P2/PP2NB1P/2KRQB1R b - - 3 14,So I stop that.
28,Nf6,e8f6,r1bq1rk1/ppp3bp/3p1nn1/3Pp3/2P1Pp2/2N2P2/PP2NB1P/2KRQB1R w - - 4 15,The other knight comes up.
