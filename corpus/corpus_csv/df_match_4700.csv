3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,An unusual position here.. I actually expected this since he did it in one of his previous games in the Mini-tournament.

18,Bg7,f8g7,r1bqk2r/p2p1pbn/p1p1p2p/4N1p1/3PPP2/P1N5/1PP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 10,"Here, I actually thought about sacrificing my knight with Nxf7 then Qh5+, followed by fxg5 which could look promising. But I decided it was too risky since he can easily defend his king with Qe7, and placing his king @ g8. I know I would have had a much stronger position at that point, but I thought it wasn't worth the risk. So I decided to break his center instead so that I can have my a rook help with the attack later on."
