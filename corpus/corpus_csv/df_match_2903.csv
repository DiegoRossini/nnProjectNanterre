1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is a long draw where I think we both missed a lot of chances, so hopefully it will be instructive to analyse it.  This is a fast ladder game against a tricky opponent against whom I have an uneven record ...We open with his usual brand of Sicilian, characterised by 2...Nc6."
