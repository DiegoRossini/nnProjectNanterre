1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,My usual opening.
2,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"An unusual but flexible response: it could lead to an Old Indian, King's Indian, Sicilian or any number of 1.e4 e5 type openings."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"I don't like this move: it blocks up Black's position, though it has potential for varied knight activity."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p1n2/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"I don't like this move: it blocks up Black's position, though it has potential for varied knight activity."

7,f4,f2f4,r1bqkb1r/pppnpppp/3p1n2/8/3PPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,I adopt an aggressive approach to limit Black's scope for activity.
8,g6,g7g6,r1bqkb1r/pppnpp1p/3p1np1/8/3PPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"So now we're in Robatsch territory, which I've always enjoyed attacking."
9,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkb1r/pppnpp1p/3p1np1/8/3PPP2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"Continuing my development as qucikly and aggressively as I can.  The B points at the potentially weak square, f7."
10,Bg7,f8g7,r1bqk2r/pppnppbp/3p1np1/8/3PPP2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,"Continuing my development as qucikly and aggressively as I can.  The B points at the potentially weak square, f7."

13,e5,e4e5,r1bq1rk1/pppnppbp/3p1np1/4P3/2BP1P2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 7,"Now I seize the opportunity to disrupt Black's plans with a quick central thrust before I have castled, reasoning that my King is safe for now and Black needs to respond accurately or suffer."
14,Ne8,f6e8,r1bqnrk1/pppnppbp/3p2p1/4P3/2BP1P2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 1 8,"? Black retreats the N passively to e8, overlooking White's response.  He should have swapped on e5 immediately."
