1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Although statistically and theoretically, e4 and d4 are of equal strength, e4 is the most ambitious first move, since it opens up lines to develop the kingside, while d4 is safer and more solid. I prefer the crazy tactical games that arise from 1.e4, like this one."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"This is the most aggressive move against e4. Although e5 appears to be more accurate, it simply matches me in the centre, and symmetrical positions are good for the player with the tempo."
3,c3,c2c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"I prefer this move, rather than the customary Nf3 followed by d4. When I play d4, I prefer to recapture with a pawn, which strengthens my centre, instead of with a knight, which moves the piece twice in the opening, and gives up a centre pawn for a c-pawn."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"This is the sharpest move against 2.c3, since White cannot defend the pawn properly with Nc3. I think 2...d5 is slightly more common since it's easier to play, but most variations of that opening favor White."
5,e5,e4e5,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p1P3/8/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,Any other move will reach an incredibly boring game.
6,Nd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/8/2pnP3/8/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"Ne4 puts Black's knight out of play for good, and it is likely to get trapped without any escape squares, like with d3."
7,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/8/2pnP3/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,The point of c3.
8,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/8/3nP3/3p4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"Developing a piece is slightly more accurate than immediately recapturing, since Black cannot take on c3. I've also been experimenting with 5.f4, which gives my slightly-overextended pawn extra protection."
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/8/3nP3/3p4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"Developing a piece is slightly more accurate than immediately recapturing, since Black cannot take on c3. I've also been experimenting with 5.f4, which gives my slightly-overextended pawn extra protection."
10,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4p3/3nP3/3p4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"5...d3 is a move untalented players play to avoid super-sharp dynamic crazy tactical positions. It's still good for White, but annoying to play against. Most sharp players will play the text move, d6, or Nc6."
11,cxd4,c3d4,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4p3/3nP3/3P4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,Most players play d6. I think now Black has given me a slight advantage due to this inaccuracy.
12,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/3nP3/3P4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,Most players play d6. I think now Black has given me a slight advantage due to this inaccuracy.
13,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/3nP3/3P4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 7,Threatening to weaken Black's pawn structure.
14,Nxc3,d5c3,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/4P3/3P4/2n2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,"Wasting a tempo moving the knight again will give me a lead in development, while this move strengthens my centre. Either way, I have a microscopic advantage I must use wisely."
15,bxc3,b2c3,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/4P3/3P4/2P2N2/P4PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,"Better moves for Black are 8...d6 and 8..d5, in which I would play 9.exd6 against either moves, and I'd have hanging pawns in the centre, which would at least give Black a target sometime near the endgame. Although my ""weak"" pawns would be strong since they are controlling the centre."
16,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/pp1pbppp/2n1p3/4P3/3P4/2P2N2/P4PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 9,"Better moves for Black are 8...d6 and 8..d5, in which I would play 9.exd6 against either moves, and I'd have hanging pawns in the centre, which would at least give Black a target sometime near the endgame.

17,Bd3,f1d3,r1bqk2r/pp1pbppp/2n1p3/4P3/3P4/2PB1N2/P4PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 9,The correct square for my light bishop since it aims at Black's kingside and seems snug within my pawns.
18,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp1pbppp/2n1p3/4P3/3P4/2PB1N2/P4PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 3 10,"Now that Black has castled, I have a target."
19,h4,h2h4,r1bq1rk1/pp1pbppp/2n1p3/4P3/3P3P/2PB1N2/P4PP1/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 10,"Some may question this move since I'll be slightly weakened if I castle kingside, but I don't need to castle yet (if at all) and I am preparing for an attack against Black's king, which I carried out brilliantly within the next few moves."
20,b6,b7b6,r1bq1rk1/p2pbppp/1pn1p3/4P3/3P3P/2PB1N2/P4PP1/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 11,"???????????? A totally losing blunder, even though it seems natural. You'll see why 10...h6 is a much better move for Black, since it would've avoided my brilliant tactics."
21,Bxh7+,d3h7,r1bq1rk1/p2pbppB/1pn1p3/4P3/3P3P/2P2N2/P4PP1/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 11,"Now Black is completely lost. If he declines my sacrifice, then he'll be down a pawn with a weak king position, and once he accepted, he got mated quickly."
22,Kxh7,g8h7,r1bq1r2/p2pbppk/1pn1p3/4P3/3P3P/2P2N2/P4PP1/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 12,"This attack was so simple, yet so brilliant."
23,Ng5+,f3g5,r1bq1r2/p2pbppk/1pn1p3/4P1N1/3P3P/2P5/P4PP1/R1BQK2R b KQ - 1 12,"This attack was so simple, yet so brilliant."
24,Bxg5,e7g5,r1bq1r2/p2p1ppk/1pn1p3/4P1b1/3P3P/2P5/P4PP1/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 13,"This move gets mated immediately. Black could've held on longer with Kh6, (or Kg6 h5  Kh6), but I'll win his queen with discovered check, and Black may as well resign anyway."
