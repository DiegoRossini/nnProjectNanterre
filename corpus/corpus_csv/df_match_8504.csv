1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"A recently finished game in my mini-tournament, which is set to automatically start each game with the Gruenfeld Defence. In this game, I go into the endgame a pawn up, and then a series of THREE TACTICS wins me a rook, and the game."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"This is the Gruenfeld Defence. Black offers White the chance to create an imposing Classical pawn centre with 4.cxd5 Nxd5 5.e4 Nxc3 6.bxc3 but can then put terrific pressure on it with ...Bg7, ...c5 and ...Nc6 - this is the very sharp Exchange Variation. If White can maintain his powerful pawn centre, however, he can expect to hold a positional advantage."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"This is the Gruenfeld Defence.

If White can maintain his powerful pawn centre, however, he can expect to hold a positional advantage."

7,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3P4/3P4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"White's other option is to bypass sharp lines with the slower 4.Nf3, the Three Knights Variation, or with 4.Bf4. However, I have great faith in my ability to hold onto an advantage in central space, and as usual I play the Exchange Variation."
8,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3P4/3P4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"(?) Not the main Exchange Variation move. Quite apart from allowing me to shore up a powerful pawn centre, this loses a pawn!"
9,e4,e2e4,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3P4/3PP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"White has a powerful, well-defended pawn centre and is ready to start cramping Black's position. The only problem is the backward and weak d4-pawn, but the extra pawn is more than enough to conpensate."
10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3P4/3PP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQ - 1 6,"Not a particularly active post for my bishop, but I wanted to make way for castling on the kingside - sharpening the game up with 0-0-0 would be foolhardy considering I am already up by a pawn and lots of space control."
