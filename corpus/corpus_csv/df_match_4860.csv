1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I was only trying to play the Queen's pawn game, but Black decided to take Long Ave. and play this move resulting in the Queen's Pawn (A40), English Defence.
This opening gives me, playing as white, an option to double check for tricks, or develope the wrong piece and lose."

3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/1p6/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Definitely not 3.Nc3.
4,Bb7,c8b7,rn1qkbnr/pbpppppp/1p6/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,This move was an inaccurate move. It does not pin the knight and Nc6 Blocks the Bishop's entire usage. Analysis recommended 2...Nf6 (Why did analysis consider this inaccurate when anyone playing this opening plays this line)? I think we should ignore the analysis's opinion because I see both sides of the argument.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qkbnr/pbpppppp/1p6/8/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 3,"Another mistake (as remarked from computer analysis). Better was 3...Nf6 (as of mow, I really don't see much of a problem with this move, but it can relatively cause queenside weakness later)."
6,c5,c7c5,rn1qkbnr/pb1ppppp/1p6/2p5/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Another mistake (as remarked from computer analysis). Better was 3...Nf6 (as of mow, I really don't see much of a problem with this move, but it can relatively cause queenside weakness later)."
7,dxc5,d4c5,rn1qkbnr/pb1ppppp/1p6/2P5/8/2N2N2/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,Computer analysis predicted this after Black's 3rd move was classified as a mistake. (I'm not sure that Black wanted this to happen or to play 5...Qa5).
8,bxc5,b6c5,rn1qkbnr/pb1ppppp/8/2p5/8/2N2N2/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,Computer analysis predicted this after Black's 3rd move was classified as a mistake. (I'm not sure that Black wanted this to happen or to play 5...Qa5).
9,e4,e2e4,rn1qkbnr/pb1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,I reboot and start another attempt to gain central control.
10,a5,a7a5,rn1qkbnr/1b1ppppp/8/p1p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,I wonder why Black did not try 5...Qa5?
11,Bb5,f1b5,rn1qkbnr/1b1ppppp/8/pBp5/4P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"I didn't really like this move, for Black can counterattack. Yet, I cleared way to castle safely."
12,Nf6,g8f6,rn1qkb1r/1b1ppppp/5n2/pBp5/4P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 7,"I'm still questioning Black's tactic for this opening, but the next two moves I play poison my position slightly. However, I'm not going to end up as mashed potatoes for Black."
13,Be3,c1e3,rn1qkb1r/1b1ppppp/5n2/pBp5/4P3/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 3 7,I'm bewildered about the moves played in an unusual opening: Why is Black not paying attention to his winning threat and is more focused on my queenside threat? I really think I shouldn't have played moves 7 and 8.
14,e6,e7e6,rn1qkb1r/1b1p1ppp/4pn2/pBp5/4P3/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 8,I'm bewildered about the moves played in an unusual opening: Why is Black not paying attention to his winning threat and is more focused on my queenside threat? I really think I shouldn't have played moves 7 and 8.

16,Bxe4,b7e4,rn1qkb1r/3p1ppp/4pn2/pBp5/N3b3/4BN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 9,"Black's Bishop (not his knight) took my e-pawn, and now we're going to get even with each other."
17,Bxc5,e3c5,rn1qkb1r/3p1ppp/4pn2/pBB5/N3b3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 9,"10...Qb6, in my opinion, has more meaning than this move."

27,Qd3,d1d3,rn2k2r/3p1pp1/1q5p/pB2p3/3Nn3/3Q4/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b kq - 1 14,This move didn't seem right once I played it. I lose a tempo and forcefully lose a knight.
28,Nc5,e4c5,rn2k2r/3p1pp1/1q5p/pBn1p3/3N4/3Q4/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w kq - 2 15,"Flimsy Blunder loses knight by force. I wished I had played 15.Qe3. No wonder why 14.Qd3 didn't seem right at first glance! From now on, I wanted myself to play more cautiously to win, and this isn't even half of the mistakes!"

31,Qxd4,c4d4,rn2k2r/3p1pp1/1q5p/pBn5/3Q4/8/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b kq - 0 16,I think I lost my train of thought because I disobeyed my beloved king! Analysis recommended 16.Rae1+.
32,f6,f7f6,rn2k2r/3p2p1/1q3p1p/pBn5/3Q4/8/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w kq - 0 17,I think Black thought that My Queen was a knight because he did not take my free Bishop!
