1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I play e4. I am looking forward to playing aggressive for example danish gambit.
The game is only 5minutes for each so we are playing with a lot of mistakes. But this game shows how bad it is to be too greedy or materialistic..."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,E5
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,D4 - good looking move :)
4,f6,f7f6,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4p3/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,He plays f6. I can't remember playing against f6 but it seems to be interesting.
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,Nf3- attacking
6,Nh6,g8h6,rnbqkb1r/pppp2pp/5p1n/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,I don't understand why he played this move! Can anyone tell me what intentions he could have had?
7,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkb1r/pppp2pp/5p1n/4p3/2BPP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 4,"Bc4 Allowing myself to castle king side and also bishop is on a very important line.
But maybe i should have sacrificed my knight playing Nxe5 fxe5; Bxh6 gxh6; Qh6+ Ke7; Qxe5+ wining a rock and opponent's king would be in the middle of the board. 
I believe that it would have been better move than Bc4 because my opponent was greedy enough to fall in the trap."
8,d6,d7d6,rnbqkb1r/ppp3pp/3p1p1n/4p3/2BPP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"So, he plays d6 - a good move. Don't agree? than write your comments and explain."
