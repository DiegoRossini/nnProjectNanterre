1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

It's not just beginners who develop their queen too early in the opening, I got suckered into commiting that sin by committing another sin called Pawn Grabbing.  You would think I would have learnt from my last game with him wouldn't you.  Well, to be fair to myself, I was not facing a mid-game mating attack here and making it even easier (pardon the pun) for Master Freddy.  Here we are talking about an opening called the Centre Game where the queen does come out early.  I start off with the move 1. e4."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,2. d4 - this move characterises the Centre Game.  Black's usual reply is exd4 but Freddy tries an unusual gambit with 2. ......d5.
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,2. d4 - this move characterises the Centre Game.  Black's usual reply is exd4 but Freddy tries an unusual gambit with 2. ......d5.
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,4. Qxd4?! - I think this is where I start to go wrong.  This is where I bring out the queen too early in order to try and hold on to the gambit pawn.  It is gonna backfire on me big time because Freddy gains some important tempi that will prove disastrous for yours truly.
5,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3Pp3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,4. Qxd4?! - I think this is where I start to go wrong.

8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3P4/3Q4/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 1 5,5. Nc3 - now follows some sensible development but little do I know that I have already left it too late.

11,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkb1r/pppn1ppp/5n2/3P4/2BQ4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 4 6,6. Bc4 - developing to defend my d5 pawn at the same time.

15,Bg5,c1g5,r1bq1rk1/pppn1ppp/5n2/2bP2B1/2B5/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK1NR b KQ - 8 8,8. Bg5 - I decide to pin the knight and have decided that if Freddy should give me Re8+ then I would respond with Nge2 blocking the check and I would then play 0-0 next move .....
16,Re8+,f8e8,r1bqr1k1/pppn1ppp/5n2/2bP2B1/2B5/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK1NR w KQ - 9 9,9. ...... Bxf2+!! - ...... but Freddy has a powerful move which scuppers my plans to castle for good.  I decided to take the bishop.  Freddy said at the time that Kf1 would have been the lesser evil.  I would still be a pawn down and unable to castle but at least I would not be facing an attack quite so soon.

I know I should have put Henry on g1 but then I would be effectively a whole rook down because of the rook shut in on h1.  Still, I suppose there are other ways to develop a rook.  Henry would have lived a lot longer though."
