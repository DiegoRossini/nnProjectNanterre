1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The Queen's Pawn Open I did with Blitzkov (aka Well Water, or, on a more personal note, William Campbell).
This game was initiated by an unnamed individual who wanted us to play a ""mini tournament"" against each other. 
The genre was ""Top Puzzlers"" and I sort of hated being asked to participate but I did. 

With research into Blitzkov as my challenge as me being White I felt it was best to do the Queen's Game (that I learned from Boris Spassky back in the much earlier days against Bobby Fischer) for maneuverability and immediate Classical play (I could have used e4 open but after reviewing the history of William Campbell I felt a Queen's Game would ""stretch"" his ability to respond) and so CLASSICAL I PLAY. 
What will Blitzkov do now? I don't really care. I am already in Classical position by pushing d4!"
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,The expected response from anyone in Black against the d4 White open.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 2,"Usually it should have been c4 here, but often I like to make moves that go astray from the usual to gain position. This is a good response but I am wandering away from the usual path here.  I know William (blitzkov) does his own extensive research. I am not satisfied with the usual route in dealing with him."
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,A sort of Nimzo move here without e6 prior.
5,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"My decision to finally show c4, which is common in this attack."
6,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"His decision to go King's Indian Defense instead of Nimzo Attack....
He will fianchetto and to date blitzkov seems to like fianchettos."
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3p4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"Now we are back to the Classical formation after some dilly dallying to get there. This knight usually comes out after c4 where it is in the Queen's open. 
To me, Black is now doing a King's Indian Defense here. It appears later in the game but it dissolves into classical formation(s). 
I've always said pay attention to the Classical Opens and Classical Defenses.  All the rest digest back into Classical Chess. 
There is no such thing as anything new that was developed after the Classical. 
William is doing fine here."
8,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3p4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,The expected fianchetto.
9,Qb3,d1b3,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3p4/2PP4/1QN2N2/PP2PPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 3 5,Developing my Queen out of sitting and doing nothing.
10,dxc4,d5c4,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/5np1/8/2pP4/1QN2N2/PP2PPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 0 6,exchange time
11,Qxc4,b3c4,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/5np1/8/2QP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 6,Queen forward. Again. Instead of sitting. Or getting trapped into submission. Never treat a lady that way!
12,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/5np1/8/2QP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ - 1 7,"I believe, personally, it is a problem when you castle your king under a fianchetto. It is formed by breaking the ""box"" the King in a 0-0 should be safe in. It will lead to problems."
13,e4,e2e4,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/5np1/8/2QPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQ - 0 7,"Infantry (LIGHT) moving forward. IN (LIGHT) are designed to ""fix and kill"" in the US Army."
14,a6,a7a6,rnbq1rk1/1pp1ppbp/p4np1/8/2QPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ - 0 8,"Not his queen or bishop or knight but a foot pawn (IN (LIGHT)) that he moves on the edge of the board as if it is a safe thing to do instead of a ""fix and kill"" for the noble pawn."
15,Be2,f1e2,rnbq1rk1/1pp1ppbp/p4np1/8/2QPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 1 8,I am clearing house for 0-0.
16,b5,b7b5,rnbq1rk1/2p1ppbp/p4np1/1p6/2QPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 0 9,He attacks my Queen which is the most powerful piece on the board. The Queen loves a fight. Treat your ladies that way and you'll be married to a Queen!
17,Qb3,c4b3,rnbq1rk1/2p1ppbp/p4np1/1p6/3PP3/1QN2N2/PP2BPPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 1 9,"I retreat her. There is nothing wrong with this move. She can go a lot of places here or just ""sit"" to threaten."
18,Nc6,b8c6,r1bq1rk1/2p1ppbp/p1n2np1/1p6/3PP3/1QN2N2/PP2BPPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 2 10,A knight comes out and I can see the threat to attack my maneuverable Queen.  No problem.
19,d5,d4d5,r1bq1rk1/2p1ppbp/p1n2np1/1p1P4/4P3/1QN2N2/PP2BPPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 0 10,I advance IN (LIGHT) to push that knight to either attack or retreat.  I don't care what that knight wants to do. In the meantime I am pushing my noble pawns (LIGHT INFANTRY) forward to fix and kill.
20,Na5,c6a5,r1bq1rk1/2p1ppbp/p4np1/np1P4/4P3/1QN2N2/PP2BPPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 1 11,"As expected. You must always anticipate ahead of time. You must always see where a knight or bishop (especially in the ""middle game"" or earlier) can go.  Just spend a bit of time and don't get spooked."
