1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The English Opening; i had never used it before and had not enough time to study it, but i wanted to try it out first.This is to try to claim the d5 square from the wing.This also prevents the reply d4, leading to the Nimzo-Indian and Grunfield defences.Thus, i saw this as a flexible choice for a start."
2,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,2.d4 is what white usually plays in the English opening. 1...g6 is preparing for a fianchetto of the king's bishop.
3,b4,b2b4,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/1PP5/8/P2PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"I immediately played b4 to be able to bring my C-pawn ahead, which was not well played in my opinion.It can also attack a Knight when developped. This leads to a loose game which brought some difficulty. b4 also allows fianchetto attacking my rook."
4,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/8/1PP5/8/P2PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"As said before, a fianchetto is on its way!"
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/8/1PP5/2N5/P2PPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 3,"This seemed the best move for white. Somehow, this turned into my advantage due to black refusing the center."
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk1nr/ppppppbp/2n3p1/8/1PP5/2N5/P2PPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 3 4,Nc6 tries to retake the center.Fortunately the B-pawn is here to scare off the knight.
7,b5,b4b5,r1bqk1nr/ppppppbp/2n3p1/1P6/2P5/2N5/P2PPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,The knight has to look for refuge and e5 seems a safer place.
8,Ne5,c6e5,r1bqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/1P2n3/2P5/2N5/P2PPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,The knight has to look for refuge and e5 seems a safer place.
9,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/1P2n3/2P5/2N2N2/P2PPPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,Nf3?! i was looking for an early exchange but did not realise that c4 was unprotected.I also did not develop another pawn that will weaken my structure.
10,Nxc4,e5c4,r1bqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/1P6/2n5/2N2N2/P2PPPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"In the end, c4 turns out a bait."
11,e3,e2e3,r1bqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/1P6/2n5/2N1PN2/P2P1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,e3 opens diagonals for the queen as well as bishop.This as an immediate response and i don't know if this move was good.
12,Nh6,g8h6,r1bqk2r/ppppppbp/6pn/1P6/2n5/2N1PN2/P2P1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,"Black does not see the threat and develops another knight.After thinking for some while, i deduce that it's not intentionally played.The bishop captures the knight."
13,Bxc4,f1c4,r1bqk2r/ppppppbp/6pn/1P6/2B5/2N1PN2/P2P1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,2-point advantage.
14,Nf5,h6f5,r1bqk2r/ppppppbp/6p1/1P3n2/2B5/2N1PN2/P2P1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 8,"I was lost at this move.King safety first, so i castle.I knew he was trying  Nd6 but i would be able to counter."
15,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk2r/ppppppbp/6p1/1P3n2/2B5/2N1PN2/P2P1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 2 8,Exactly what i had imagined! Queen to d4 protected both pieces and it was protected.
16,Nd6,f5d6,r1bqk2r/ppppppbp/3n2p1/1P6/2B5/2N1PN2/P2P1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 3 9,Exactly what i had imagined! Queen to d4 protected both pieces and it was protected.

23,Qa6,a4a6,r2qk2r/pnppppbp/Qp4p1/1P6/8/2N1PN2/P2P1PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 1 12,"If the rook moves,i take the pawn. If it doesn't, i take the knight.Queen to c8 or b8 would seem better but this would bring too many pieces to the queen side of the board.So Black retreats to c5."
24,Nc5,b7c5,r2qk2r/p1ppppbp/Qp4p1/1Pn5/8/2N1PN2/P2P1PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 2 13,This is an unquestioned move if i want to save my queen.
