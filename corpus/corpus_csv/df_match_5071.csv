1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game features a new signing for the England team, redka, aka Anna against a lady from IHS team ITALIA in a little mini-international. White starts off conventionally enough"
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"And black replies with d5, the Centre Counter defence"
3,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"White takes, probably the best move."
4,Qxd5,d8d5,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"And black re-captures, the most usual move, although Nf6 is perfectly playable."
5,Qe2,d1e2,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/8/PPPPQPPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"This move is odd. White should be developing the minor pieces, bishops and knights. Nc3 attacking the Qd5 is the most logical. This wastes a move, and also blocks in the Bf1."
6,e5,e7e5,rnb1kbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3qp3/8/8/PPPPQPPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"For some strange reason, the Gameknot post-match computer database gives this as a mistake, but I think it is a sound opening move. It grabs central control and opens up a diagonal for the Bf8."
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1kbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3qp3/8/2N5/PPPPQPPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 1 4,"An excellent move, even better if played the move earlier."
8,Qe6,d5e6,rnb1kbnr/ppp2ppp/4q3/4p3/8/2N5/PPPPQPPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 2 5,"I'm not happy with this retreat. Qa5 or Qd8 are the normal squares the queen moves to in this variation, and I am sure that they are the best moves here too. Gameknot computer doesn't criticize it though!"
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnb1kbnr/ppp2ppp/4q3/4p3/8/2N2N2/PPPPQPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 3 5,Another excellent move by our heroine! White is developing and making threats - the best way to develop. Two pieces now attack the Pe5.
10,Bd6,f8d6,rnb1k1nr/ppp2ppp/3bq3/4p3/8/2N2N2/PPPPQPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 4 6,"So black defends it again, but Nc6 is better, because now white has d4"
11,d4,d2d4,rnb1k1nr/ppp2ppp/3bq3/4p3/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1QPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"Which she correctly plays. Black is already on the back foot. White has 2 pieces on e4, so black can't play e4. Black can't play Nc6 because white replies with d5."
12,f6,f7f6,rnb1k1nr/ppp3pp/3bqp2/4p3/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1QPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"This weakens the black king side, doesn't help development. I think Nd7 or Pxd4 were better moves, although the Gameknot computer doesn't criticize this move."
13,d5,d4d5,rnb1k1nr/ppp3pp/3bqp2/3Pp3/8/2N2N2/PPP1QPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"Not bad, gaining space and attacking the black queen, but I quite like the look of Pxe5 or the immediate g3 too."
14,Qf5,e6f5,rnb1k1nr/ppp3pp/3b1p2/3Ppq2/8/2N2N2/PPP1QPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 1 8,"Wrong square in my view, the queen can just be attacked again."
15,Nh4,f3h4,rnb1k1nr/ppp3pp/3b1p2/3Ppq2/7N/2N5/PPP1QPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 2 8,Which white correctly does so!
16,Qd7,f5d7,rnb1k1nr/pppq2pp/3b1p2/3Pp3/7N/2N5/PPP1QPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 3 9,The only safe square for the queen.
17,g3,g2g3,rnb1k1nr/pppq2pp/3b1p2/3Pp3/7N/2N3P1/PPP1QP1P/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 9,Preparing to develop the bishop to g2
18,Bb4,d6b4,rnb1k1nr/pppq2pp/5p2/3Pp3/1b5N/2N3P1/PPP1QP1P/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 1 10,"I don't like this move, as I think black needs to develop her other pieces, she can't really afford to move a piece which has already moved once again. Ne7 and 0-0 screams out to me. Gameknot computer doesn't criticize this move (or any of the others since 5...Bd6), but I don't like it!"
19,Bg2,f1g2,rnb1k1nr/pppq2pp/5p2/3Pp3/1b5N/2N3P1/PPP1QPBP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 2 10,"I think this is best. The Gameknot computer prefers Bd2 to prevent the doubling of the white c pawns, but I don't think this is too much to worry about. The position is reasonably open, so the bishops are probably worth slightly more than the knights. The white centre would be stronger by the exchange and white would have the semi-open b file for a rook."
20,Ne7,g8e7,rnb1k2r/pppqn1pp/5p2/3Pp3/1b5N/2N3P1/PPP1QPBP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 3 11,This would be my first choice of move. GK computer prefers g5 which to me is not a developing move and weakens the black king side terribly. I'm coming to the conclusion that the GK computer is very weak! Do you agree dear reader?
