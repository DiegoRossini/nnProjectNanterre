1,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Here, for the OPENING white chooses to play e3. Is this a BEST move? when selecting a BEST move we seek out the CANDIDATE with the most ATTRIBUTES preferably with an ATTACKING ATTRIBUTE if available. If there is no ATTACKING ATTRIBUTE we then seek out a BEST position.

Since COMMON CHESS SENSE would recommend that the CENTRE is one of the most important places on the board then e4 and d4 would be a better placement for the pawn on this turn. In other words, I consider this a PASSIVE move which allows White's opponent to choose freely without any challenge, the response of his choice."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Black makes a BEST by taking CONTROL of the CENTRE.
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"White now CHALLENGES black in the CENTRE. However, if White had originally played e4 or d4 on Move 1 he would not have to CHALLENGE for the CENTRE because he would be FORCING Black to make that play.

Black has a decision to make: Exchange pawns, DEFEND the pawn or move the pawn forward."
4,e4,e5e4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3Pp3/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Black has chosen to use a second TEMPI on the pawn. COMMON CHESS SENSE councils that a player should refrain from moving a piece twice if possible in the OPENING phase of the game.

Since the PURPOSE of the OPENING phase is to DEVELOP pieces as quickly as possible to prepare for the MID-game, then TIME or TEMPI is of the essence. Since each move uses TIME then moving a piece twice has used two TEMPI which means that completing the OPENING phase will take more TIME.

Therefore, for this turn EXCHANGING pawns which maintains PARITY with White and EQUALIZES the CENTRE or playing Nc6 or even d6 are more in keeping with the idea of DEVELOPING pieces as quickly or TIMELY as possible."
5,f3,f2f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3Pp3/4PP2/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"Black's pawn is extended into White's territory. Here White has chosen to quickly CHALLENGE Black's advanced pawn. The problem with this move is that it unnecessarily weakens the king-side 0-0 position and takes away a BEST square for the king-side knight.

C4 would have been a better move because it is DEVELOPING; places another pawn in the CENTRE and discourages d5, the SUPPORT pawn for the e4."
6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3Pp3/4PP2/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Black plays d5 which is DEVELOPING and influences the uncontested CENTRE d5 square while SUPPORTING e4. Black also has opened both DIAGONALS for his bishops.
7,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/2PPp3/4PP2/PP4PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,White must decide whether to take e4 or ATTACK the SUPPORT pawn on d5 and he chooses the latter.
8,b6,b7b6,rnbqkbnr/p1p2ppp/1p6/3p4/2PPp3/4PP2/PP4PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"Here, Black errs and loses TEMPI. B6 neither ATTACKS nor DEFENDS. I do not think Black is planning to FIANCHETTO which is a two TEMPI play so he must have another motive in mind.

Better would have been Nf6 as it is DEVELOPING and DEFENDS both CENTRE pawns e4 and d5."
9,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqkbnr/p1p2ppp/1p6/3P4/3Pp3/4PP2/PP4PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,White takes Black's SUPPORT pawn in the CENTRE thereby weakening Black's influence in the CENTRE.
10,Bd6,f8d6,rnbqk1nr/p1p2ppp/1p1b4/3P4/3Pp3/4PP2/PP4PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,Black misplays. Better would have been Nf6 because it DEFENDS e4 and ATTACKS d5 or Qxd5 which RECAPTURES the pawn and DEFENDS e4. This is another loss of TEMPI for Black.
11,Bb5+,f1b5,rnbqk1nr/p1p2ppp/1p1b4/1B1P4/3Pp3/4PP2/PP4PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 6,"White's GOOD bishop is DEVELOPED and places the Black king in CHECK. 

The obvious DEFENCE for Bb5+ is Bd7 which either FORCES white to EXCHANGE bishops or RETREAT. If White RETREATS then Bb5+ was a wasted TEMPI. The EXCHANGE of bishops loses a perfectly GOOD bishop with good prospects since it has open access to the white squares.

More to the point would have been Nc3 because it is DEVELOPING, ATTACKS e4 and DEFENDS d5."
12,Nd7,b8d7,r1bqk1nr/p1pn1ppp/1p1b4/1B1P4/3Pp3/4PP2/PP4PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 3 7,"Black BLOCKS the White bishop CHECK with the knight; however, by doing so Black PINS the knight and BLOCKS movement of the white-squared bishop.

The better move would have been Bd7 FORCING white to make a decision: EXCHANGE or RETREAT. Instead Black fences himself in."
13,fxe4,f3e4,r1bqk1nr/p1pn1ppp/1p1b4/1B1P4/3PP3/4P3/PP4PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 7,White takes Blacks' other UNDEFENDED CENTRE pawn and takes complete CONTROL of the CENTRE. White is also up two pawns. Things are looking good for White.
14,Qh4+,d8h4,r1b1k1nr/p1pn1ppp/1p1b4/1B1P4/3PP2q/4P3/PP4PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 8,Black COUNTERS and puts the White king in CHECK and hopes to RECAPTURE e4 (which wouldn't be possible if White had played Nc6 earlier instead of Bb5+). Here the consequence of prematurely moving f3 becomes apparent as White will now lose his ability to CASTLE.
15,Kf1,e1f1,r1b1k1nr/p1pn1ppp/1p1b4/1B1P4/3PP2q/4P3/PP4PP/RNBQ1KNR b kq - 2 8,"Another error by Black. Black ATTACKS the bishop creating further weakness on his queenside. Further he ignored the opportunity to TAKE e4 and ATTACK g2 and d5 while placing his queen in a CENTRE position.
-----
White's response to a5 should be Bc6 which places the white-squared bishop on a POST maintaining the PIN on the knight and ATTACKING the rook at a8.

A further in-depth reasoning on my analysis:
-----
The BEST move for this turn was Qxe4. a TEMPI was expended on the black queen as she took advantage of the kingside vulnerability and placed the White king in CHECK. As such, this was a BEST move for Black with Maximum TEMPI for that turn. White was FORCED to expend a TEMPI and move the king, also a BEST move. As such no gain in TEMPI for either player. Of course since we know the king is not to be MATED then the real PURPOSE of Qh4+ was to reclaim the White pawn at e4. So this is really a 2 part move sequence if you will, that justifies the expenditure of using two TEMPI on the queen. Keep in mind that COMMON CHESS SENSE warns against moving the queen out in the game early, not just because it becomes an object of ATTACK by lesser pieces but following the idea of TEMPI, reveals that each TIME a piece is moved another TEMPI is expended; and the queen can become a target of multiple ATTACKS and consequently ends up moving several times at the expense of DEVELOPING other pieces. This also goes back to the other COMMON CHESS SENSE warning that a player should refrain as much as possible from moving a piece more than once in the OPENING stage of the game. --- Keeping in mind that all moves in chess have a PURPOSE we are actively seeking out the BEST CANDIDATE for move selection on each turn. I can speculate why Black chose to play a3 however we have to first ask if a3 has as many positive ATTRIBUTES as Qxe4. Yes, a3 ATTACKS the White bishop thereby FORCING white to REACT however the negative of that move is that it allowed White to improve the bishop's position without White having to expend a TEMPI of his own (because it was a FORCED move) and it created a further weakness in Black's position. Therefore, due to Black choosing a Less than BEST move and White responding with a BEST move, White gained a further increase in TEMPI = INITIATIVE = ATTACK."

Board Overview:

Black cannot move the king-side knight; the queen-side knight is PINNED. The white-squared bishop is TRAPPED and unable to move; The black-squared bishop must RETREAT; the queen is out of position. It's only Move 10 and Black is in trouble.

On the other side, white has an exposed king, Two DOUBLED CENTRE pawns and with the exception of the white-squared bishop has no other pieces DEVELOPED. However, because Black lacks TEMPI he cannot take advantage of White's weaknesses."

The only reason I can see for this move is that White plans to play e6 with the plan of winning Black's PINNED knight. However it leaves the White king without a strong protector while the Black queen remains unmarked.

At this point has has control of the game and he would have been well advised to DEVELOP some minor pieces before moving the queen out. Ideally Nc3 or Nf3 would have been better choices for this turn."
