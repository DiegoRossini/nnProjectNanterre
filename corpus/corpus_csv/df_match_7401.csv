1,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

About 48 hours after getting Freddied again I had a more pleasant surprise from Gameknot as I woke up this morning.  I had set up two conditional moves, both of them led to my opponent copping Old Matey and my opponent had played into one of them.  I may ask you, the Inquest Jury, to spot the other one and e-mail me the answer on a postcard.  This is the Annotations Project Part 2 and my second victory with the white pieces.  We start the action on move 8 where my opponent plays the virtually standard Kc6."
