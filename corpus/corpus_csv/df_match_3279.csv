1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,One of the worst moves.
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,One of the worst moves.
3,d3,d2d3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,One of the worst moves.
4,dxe4,d5e4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/4p3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Whites realizes it is not good to exchange, so tries another strategy."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/4p3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"Whites realizes it is not good to exchange, so tries another strategy."
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/8/4p3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"Exchanging the pawn will only favour his developement, so I choosed this one instead."
7,dxe4,d3e4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/8/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,Strangely enough.
8,Qxd1+,d8d1,rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/8/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BqKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"White saves the castilng right at a cost of a central pawn. This is very interesting, and should provide black an edge. Let's see..."
9,Nxd1,c3d1,rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BNKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"White saves the castilng right at a cost of a central pawn. This is very interesting, and should provide black an edge. Let's see..."
10,Nxe4,f6e4,rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/8/8/4n3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BNKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,Maybe wrong. Nc4 would have prevented my own pawn or dsb to get there. But maybe this was a wrong approach to the position.
11,f3,f2f3,rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/8/8/4n3/5P2/PPP3PP/R1BNKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,Maybe wrong. Nc4 would have prevented my own pawn or dsb to get there. But maybe this was a wrong approach to the position.
12,Nf6,e4f6,rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/8/8/5P2/PPP3PP/R1BNKBNR w KQkq - 1 7,Maybe wrong. Nc4 would have prevented my own pawn or dsb to get there. But maybe this was a wrong approach to the position.
13,Ne3,d1e3,rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/8/8/4NP2/PPP3PP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 2 7,Just ok.
14,e5,e7e5,rnb1kb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/4p3/8/4NP2/PPP3PP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 0 8,"And this was maybe a mistake. I've seen no point in developing while my dsb was caught in, and castling was near. And I didn't like e6 because it blocks my own bishop."
15,Bd3,f1d3,rnb1kb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/4p3/8/3BNP2/PPP3PP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 1 8,"If I can provoke c3, maybe he will find difficult to develop his dsb."
16,Bb4+,f8b4,rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/4p3/1b6/3BNP2/PPP3PP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 2 9,"If I can provoke c3, maybe he will find difficult to develop his dsb."
17,c3,c2c3,rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/4p3/1b6/2PBNP2/PP4PP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 0 9,"Chasing me. I thought it was ok, since he opens his king too. I was wrong."
18,Bc5,b4c5,rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/2b1p3/8/2PBNP2/PP4PP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 1 10,"Chasing me. I thought it was ok, since he opens his king too. I was wrong."

22,Bxf5,c8f5,rn2k2r/ppp2ppp/1b3n2/4pb2/1P6/2PB1P2/P5PP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 0 12,"Not a nice thing to do, but I thought that it was the best, under the circumstances. But in an open position like this, the bishop pair was far more important that I thought. I was far to think my Nb8 wouldn't have been able to develop for so many moves on."
23,Bxf5,d3f5,rn2k2r/ppp2ppp/1b3n2/4pB2/1P6/2P2P2/P5PP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 0 12,"This was a mistake, because my dsb can't defend the king. I thought about it, but I believed that with no support in sight, this wouldn't have been a problem for me. I was wrong."

I overlooked my own attacking possibilities instead. Castling, as I often remember to myself, is a loss of time. It may be convenient, but not always. In this case, 1) the ""threat"" Bg5 would only have helped me to develop my other knight. No need to castle. 2) the Bh6 prevents me from castling, but I could have thought about the game with both kings in the center - always interesting., with Ke7 (Bg5, Nd7 should hold). 3) I had to develop. Piece developement, I mean. The rook that cames out of castling is ok, but the knight has to came out soon. 4) I had my own attack too! I told I accepted my bishop chase because I wanted him to weaken his pawns. So why not Nd5 at once, before he can go a3? White has to defend with the bishop (in b2 by force, or Ne3), and I have a tempo to spend improving my position."

28,Rd8,f8d8,rn1r2k1/ppp2p1p/1b3npB/4p3/1P6/2PB1P2/P5PP/R3K1NR w KQ - 4 15,"Another mistake, since white can defend by castling. It was necessary to coordinate the rook with the Nd4 plan. Now, think that I talk about Nd5 in spite of: Be4 because in that case, c6 (and not Nxc3?, Bxb7!). This would have been good for me, a fight instead of a much more terrible ""lock""."
