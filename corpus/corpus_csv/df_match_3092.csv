7,dxe6,d5e6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4Pn2/8/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"Two pieces out for a central pawn... hardly a bargain, but let's see."

11,Bd3,f1d3,r2qkb1r/pppn1ppp/4bn2/8/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 6,"I considered that in order to take some advantage of my superior developement it was a nice idea to... spend a pawn's move in order to ""squeeze"" white's position a little."

14,c4,c5c4,r2qkb1r/pp1n1ppp/4bn2/8/2pP4/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"It would be difficult for white to create a battery of Q and B against h7. Now I considered b5, in order to further block white's pieces developement, but then white would have had some countergame with a4. Better to concentrate in keeping ahead in developement."

16,Bd6,f8d6,r2qk2r/pp1n1ppp/3bbn2/8/2pP4/2P2N2/PPB2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 9,I don't want the white's dsb to set on f4.
17,O-O,e1g1,r2qk2r/pp1n1ppp/3bbn2/8/2pP4/2P2N2/PPB2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 3 9,"My battery is armed. It's not a very whorty one, but with the bishop and the kinght, conditions for attack are given."
18,Qc7,d8c7,r3k2r/ppqn1ppp/3bbn2/8/2pP4/2P2N2/PPB2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 4 10,"My battery is armed. It's not a very whorty one, but with the bishop and the kinght, conditions for attack are given."
19,Re1,f1e1,r3k2r/ppqn1ppp/3bbn2/8/2pP4/2P2N2/PPB2PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq - 5 10,"Now white is threatening d5, because the bishop is pinned. Time to castle... on what side, dear reader?"
20,O-O,e8g8,r4rk1/ppqn1ppp/3bbn2/8/2pP4/2P2N2/PPB2PPP/RNBQR1K1 w - - 6 11,"This was the wrong one. I feared a counter attack by white with b3, opening the queenside, thus moving the game on the side of the castled king. But I shouldn't. You'll see why."
21,Nbd2,b1d2,r4rk1/ppqn1ppp/3bbn2/8/2pP4/2P2N2/PPBN1PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - - 7 11,"The normal attack was Ng4, hitting h2... but after h3, it goes nowhere. Instead, if I would have castled queenside, after h3 I can confidently play the sac h5!, and if hxN, hxg would have recovered the piece and played a risky but strong attack. Now, I realize that the only way to disrupt white's fortress is to throw in some pawns... uncovering my king. But no way: I cannot play without looking for an attack. And this move covers g5, which is good anyway."

24,Nxe4,f6e4,r4rk1/ppqn1pp1/3bb2p/8/2pPn3/2P2N2/PPB2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 0 13,"...but remember: avoid to exchange piece when you have superior developement, or you'll easily lose it. This way, white owns a very nice diagonal, and supports the lethal d5. I had to act quickly, or the game will return to be even. So I dared, pretty irresponsibly..."

26,f5,f7f5,r4rk1/ppqn2p1/3bb2p/5p2/2pPB3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 0 14,"If d5, fxB, dxB, exNf3, exNd7, Bxh2+, and black has a winning attack. But I overlooked the simple 14. Bxb2!, QxB, RxBe6 (who has became undefended when the f pawn was moved!). Instead, the more normal and calm Nf6 leads to 14. d5, Bd7. White has blocked his good white diagonal, and he has to retire or exchange his lsb. It was not a bad result for me. So I played with enthusiasm more than calculation, and this is a very common mistake at chess."
27,Bc2,e4c2,r4rk1/ppqn2p1/3bb2p/5p2/2pP4/2P2N2/PPB2PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - - 1 14,"White chooses to retire. Probably he is happy having my own f pawn blocking my lsb's action. And, of course, I have to take care of my lsb, but this is not a problem:"

29,h3,h2h3,r4rk1/ppqn2p1/3b3p/3b1p2/2pP4/2P2N1P/PPB2PP1/R1BQR1K1 b - - 0 15,"Ha ha, this was the very elegant way white defended: just moving the attacked pawn. Very, very smart. I can lose the bishop's pair, give my check and... nothing. I have to be tricky."
30,g5,g7g5,r4rk1/ppqn4/3b3p/3b1pp1/2pP4/2P2N1P/PPB2PP1/R1BQR1K1 w - - 0 16,"I choosed the wrong way, but as I said: all my game was based on a quick attack, so I went for it. My own pieces, although well placed, are impotent without a pawn's break. And I have to count on a tempo loss to place the rook behind it, as it should... and, finally, for beginners: this move opens the way for the white Queen to h5. And the white knight can go to e5, because if I exchange it, I cannot retake the white pawn in e5 because I have to spend a tempo defending the bishop."
