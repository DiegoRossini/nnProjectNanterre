14,Qd4,d8d4,rn2kb1r/pp2pNpp/8/2p5/2BqpPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 1 8,Expected. Now I can't castle because the Queen is attacking the g1 square and also attacking my Bishop on c3.
15,h3,h2h3,rn2kb1r/pp2pNpp/8/2p5/2BqpPn1/7P/PPPP2P1/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 8,What was I thinking here? c3 probably would have been a better move here as now the black Queen can capture my Bishop and attack my Night on f7.
16,Qxc4,d4c4,rn2kb1r/pp2pNpp/8/2p5/2q1pPn1/7P/PPPP2P1/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 9,Expected.
17,Nxh8,f7h8,rn2kb1N/pp2p1pp/8/2p5/2q1pPn1/7P/PPPP2P1/RNB1K2R b KQq - 0 9,Again I feel this might have been a bad move as blacks Night is still sitting on g4 and dangerous. I feel that hxNg4 would have been a better move here and blacks Queen would have captured my Night on f7 giving me some breathing room to develop.
18,Nh6,g4h6,rn2kb1N/pp2p1pp/7n/2p5/2q1pP2/7P/PPPP2P1/RNB1K2R w KQq - 1 10,Expected.

20,Nf5,h6f5,rn2kb1N/pp2p1pp/8/2p2n2/2q1pP2/2P4P/PP1P2P1/RNB1K2R w KQq - 1 11,Black is bringing is Night back into the action.
21,Na3,b1a3,rn2kb1N/pp2p1pp/8/2p2n2/2q1pP2/N1P4P/PP1P2P1/R1B1K2R b KQq - 2 11,Again probably another pointless move trying to chase the queen away.
22,Qd3,c4d3,rn2kb1N/pp2p1pp/8/2p2n2/4pP2/N1Pq3P/PP1P2P1/R1B1K2R w KQq - 3 12,Expected.
23,Nb5,a3b5,rn2kb1N/pp2p1pp/8/1Np2n2/4pP2/2Pq3P/PP1P2P1/R1B1K2R b KQq - 4 12,"At this point I know the game is lost and start making pointless moves. Here I am trying to fork blacks King and Rook, but that plan never happened."
24,Ng3,f5g3,rn2kb1N/pp2p1pp/8/1Np5/4pP2/2Pq2nP/PP1P2P1/R1B1K2R w KQq - 5 13,Expected.
25,Kf2,e1f2,rn2kb1N/pp2p1pp/8/1Np5/4pP2/2Pq2nP/PP1P1KP1/R1B4R b q - 6 13,Trying to escape.
26,Nxh1+,g3h1,rn2kb1N/pp2p1pp/8/1Np5/4pP2/2Pq3P/PP1P1KP1/R1B4n w q - 0 14,But it never worked.
27,Kg1,f2g1,rn2kb1N/pp2p1pp/8/1Np5/4pP2/2Pq3P/PP1P2P1/R1B3Kn b q - 1 14,I moved my King here so I can capture blacks Night if blacks Queen captures my Night on b5.
28,Qxb5,d3b5,rn2kb1N/pp2p1pp/8/1qp5/4pP2/2P4P/PP1P2P1/R1B3Kn w q - 0 15,"Yep, just as expected."
29,Kxh1,g1h1,rn2kb1N/pp2p1pp/8/1qp5/4pP2/2P4P/PP1P2P1/R1B4K b q - 0 15,And now I can capture blacks Night.
30,Qf1+,b5f1,rn2kb1N/pp2p1pp/8/2p5/4pP2/2P4P/PP1P2P1/R1B2q1K w q - 1 16,Expected.
31,Kh2,h1h2,rn2kb1N/pp2p1pp/8/2p5/4pP2/2P4P/PP1P2PK/R1B2q2 b q - 2 16,Trying to escape again.
32,Qxf4+,f1f4,rn2kb1N/pp2p1pp/8/2p5/4pq2/2P4P/PP1P2PK/R1B5 w q - 0 17,Expected and I don't succeed in escaping.
