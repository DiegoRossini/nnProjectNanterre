1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I spend the first half of the game slowly picking apart his defenses on the right hand (with even trades) not gaining any leeway points-wise, but making  slow progress toward opening  up the castle, and snatching the throne. But in the  end a dang horse shifts the balance of the game, with a rather magnificent fork on the part of my opponent, which is immediately compounded by a stupid greedy move on my part, resulting in a queen for queen trade. When the dominoes fall nothing is left for me. (Thanks ionadowman for helping me analyze my many mistakes.)"

the thematic push White is looking for against the Pirc is e4-e5. this becomes much harder after White plays d4-d5.

Thanks, I'll give that a try, if I can even recognize the Pirc next I see it. (Had to look it up to understand what you were talking about.) lol...could probably stand to study a lil more chess in general."
