Qa4  was tempting, but black might be able to weasel out with 5. ... c6, although one feasible continuation seems to be 6. Bd2 b6 7. Bxa5 bxa5 8. Qxc6  Bd7 9. Qxc4 leaving white ahead by a pawn, and black's doubled pawns on the a-file will do him no favors."

Black might have wanted to consider alternatives to early development of his queen, as well as consider the precarious and ineffective position of his knight on the edge of the board with no safe move. 5. ... b6 would be a consideration here, as would be 5. ... c6 or 5. ...

White has 3 pieces developed to black's 1. In addition, white has dominated the center and is poised to castle to bring his rooks to bear. On the other hand, black cannot easily develop his bishop or his kingside rook. The black pieces and pawns are getting in each others' way. And let's not overlook black's hopeless pawn structure. It's clearly time for white to attack."

It's useful to observe that white now has 4 pieces developed to black's 2, and calling black's rook on c8 ""developed"" is generous - it has nowhere to go and is tied to defending the blocked c7 pawn against the inevitable Nb5 that white is just itching to play."
