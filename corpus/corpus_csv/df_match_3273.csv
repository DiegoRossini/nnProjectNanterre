Black could have defended the pawn with a6, or he can even thought about to sac it with b4 at once, while axb will be followed by d5, with no tempo loss because white has to care about his b4 pawn."
13,Bxb5,f1b5,rnbqk2r/p1pnbppp/3pp3/1B6/3PPB2/P4N2/1PPN1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 7,Of course.

Bc4, and I prevent black to advance the d or the f pawn. Good. and 9. Bd3, and the bishop is aiming to h7. Good. So it is one of the most difficult moves to do: which is the best? What I am not seeing?"
17,Bd3,b5d3,rnbq1rk1/2pnbppp/p2pp3/8/3PPB1P/P2B1N2/1PPN1PP1/R2QK2R b KQ - 1 9,"Black is already half-cramped. Ba4 is kind of ""naive"". Black can move Bb7, Nc6, and that's it. Bc4 has to cope with Nb6... Ba2 or b3, and black wins a tempo to untangle himself. Is tempting, true, to keep control on the diagonal against the king."

But the knight has to be in that square, so hxg5 doesn't work. Bxg5, BxB, hxg5 is ok. I choose the risky way, just for fun and for testing my intuition."
