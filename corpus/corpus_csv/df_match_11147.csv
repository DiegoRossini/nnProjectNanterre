1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"This is a lightly annotated game which features an English-type setup against an Old Indian Defense.  The game starts as a slow positional maneuvering battle but turns tactical around move 22, when I offer an exchange sacrifice for the chance to cement two knights on the 6th rank!"
2,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,2. e4 could transpose into the Pirc or Modern.

4,Nd7,b8d7,r1bqkbnr/pppnpppp/3p4/8/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 3,Another possibility is 2...Bg4 followed by this move.
5,g3,g2g3,r1bqkbnr/pppnpppp/3p4/8/2P5/5NP1/PP1PPP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,This move gives Black pawn control of d5 and also prepares a later break in the center.

9,Bg2,f1g2,r1bqkbnr/pp1n1ppp/2pp4/4p3/2P5/2N2NP1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,"Not a very popular opening these days, the move 6...Be7 makes the Black position more passive than the Fianchetto.  Still, Blacks position is solid and without any weakness and his plan of a center break with ...d5 is straightforward and good."

14,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp1nbppp/2pp1n2/4p3/2P5/2NP1NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 8,"Here, I wasn't too sure how to proceed, as I am not too booked up on the Old-Indian.  The best way to play this, is 8. e4, which not only prevents Black's ...d5 break in the center, but leads to a Botvinnik setup where Black's knights are misplaced.  ***FYI*** the Black knights need to be on c6 and e7.  White then proceeds with h3 and Be3, with a better game and the plan of queenside expansion."

17,b4,b2b4,r1b2rk1/ppqnbppp/2pp1n2/4p3/1PP5/2NP1NP1/P3PPBP/1RBQ1RK1 b - - 0 9,"Since I have defaulted to the standard English queenside counterplay, I have to stick with the plan and play consistently.  A decent plan now is better than the best plan later."

It seems that I can now hold up the ...d5 advance and Black's passive position will become rather uncomfortable."
19,Qb3,d1b3,r1b1r1k1/ppqnbppp/2pp1n2/4p3/1PP5/1QNP1NP1/P3PPBP/1RB2RK1 b - - 2 10,"The Black setup has left the light-squared bishop at home to defend the queenside, so the only benefit to this move is to hold up ...d5.  My plan of advancing the queenside pawns to create weaknesses is the quickest active plan for White as it follows logically from my 8th and 9th moves.  The only problem with this is that it's rather easy for Black to stop, as he does in the game, by routing the queen's knight to e6, via f8."
20,Nf8,d7f8,r1b1rnk1/ppq1bppp/2pp1n2/4p3/1PP5/1QNP1NP1/P3PPBP/1RB2RK1 w - - 3 11,"A standard plan in these positions, the knight will come to e6, where it will exert pressure on the d4-square.  Here, Black opts to keep the light-squared bishop at home, often times, due to the lack of space, Black will play ...Bg4 followed by ...Bxf3, to weaken the d4-square and create more breathing room for his pieces.  Only then will the knight come to e6, when Black is doing fine."

Black has held up my queenside expansion, however, I still have a slight plus due to the space advantage on the queenside and the initiative provided by holding up Black's counterplay.
