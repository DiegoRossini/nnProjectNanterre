Qf3 is not as sharp and not well-explored; the computer doesn't give it a terrific evaluation but I think it's pretty reasonable since it takes the game into unexplored territory, develops the queen early but to a reasonably stable place where it won't be harassed much, and pretty much forces black to accept a distinct lag in development in exchange for that pawn.  A typical and plausible gambit idea."
8,Nf6,e4f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B5/2N2Q2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 2 5,"Black is thinking: Get as strong as possible in the center, since white's given up a central pawn, don't fall any further behind in development, and don't start any conflicts or exchanges until the center is strong and king is safe.  And of course don't allow the game to end with an ignominious 5.  Qxf7."

13,Be3,c1e3,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4p3/2B5/2NPBQ2/PPP1NPPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 1 7,"With the white queen on f3 and bishop on c4, black's knight is tethered to its f6 square, and not available to do any work, since the f7 square is exposed if it moves away.  7...Bg4 forces the white queen off the f file, and allows black to catch up one step in development.

At least it's not demonstrably bad and consistent with black's strategic goals, and I don't see anything really better.  I think black has to be patient here."

My instinct was to reply with 10...d5 and the computer says that's tactically the best thing here.  But the variations are complicated (well, to me they are!) and I found a lot of pits that I could fall into; probably one of the reasons for O-O-O was that it does put the white rook on the same file as the black queen, which has little room to move, and pawn exchanges in the center could lead to a discovered attack.

Black's pieces are cramped for the moment, but there's the option of castling on either side and with good pawn advances, the pieces should come alive."

22,Nh5,f6h5,r3k2r/pppqbppp/2npb3/1B2p2n/8/2NPBPQ1/PPP1N1PP/2KR3R w kq - 5 12,"I thought a long time about the order of operations here.  The bishop on b5 can be pushed back with ...a6 and ...b5, which is clearly the right thing to do to it.  That means castling short is most attractive to black.  However, 10...Be7 did leave the black g-pawn vulnerable to capture by the queen.  By itself, that isn't a too-serious problem because it would be offset by a subsequent time-wasting (for white) retreat of the queen.  But pushing pawns on the queenside (hemming in the white bishop and advancing on white's castled position) means I would rather keep my pawns on the kingside intact.  Nh5 seemed the best way to get both a good kingside castled position and the queenside pawn advance."
