1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I start with the usual
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,No surprise here
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,I continue
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,So is he going to a King's Indian or maybe an Grunfeld Defence?
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,I continue
6,c6,c7c6,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppp1p/2p2np1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"What is this? Maybe he will follow up with d6, going back to main lines?"
7,e4,e2e4,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppp1p/2p2np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,So I take the centre
8,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/2p2np1/3p4/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"So this is what he planned. He was about 20 minutes for the match. I spent that on working out the best reply to this, over the next few moves, I moved a lot slower, so by move 10 we were more or less level in time"
9,e5,e4e5,rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/2p2np1/3pP3/2PP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"I found out later on the Gameknot Opening Databases, this was played in the 2 games on the database of world matches."
10,Ne4,f6e4,rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/2p3p1/3pP3/2PPn3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,"This is more or less forced. Now of those two games, Kasparov, Garry (2800) vs. Kamsky, Gata (2640) continued with Bd3 and white won. After the game my opponent said he felt that he felt this was the strongest continuation for white, but I am not convinced. The other game continued with Be3 and ended in a draw, - Kurhinen Boris (2140) vs. Timchenko Aleks… (2100) I chose another move, which looks quite logical"
11,Nxe4,c3e4,rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/2p3p1/3pP3/2PPN3/8/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,This was played in 3 Gameknot games
12,dxe4,d5e4,rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/2p3p1/4P3/2PPp3/8/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,"He naturally takes back. Now on Gameknot database, there are three games from this position, g3 ended ½-½ iin tesomator (1824) vs. vandy (1939)
f3 ended 1-0 in old_kondor (1835) vs. super-tee (1673)
Be3 ended 0-1 vicit (1824) vs. watbot3000 (1705)"
13,Be3,c1e3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/2p3p1/4P3/2PPp3/4B3/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 1 7,"My first ideas were to play this followed by Qc2, with the idea of not allowing him to play Bf5 followed by e4-e3, but I changed my mind...."
14,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/4P3/2PPp3/4B3/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 2 8,He continues development.
15,Qd2,d1d2,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/4P3/2PPp3/4B3/PP1Q1PPP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 3 8,"With dreams of a king side attack. The other game ended with 8.	Qc2	Bf5
9.	Ne2	c5 10.	O-O-O	Nc6 11.	dxc5	Qa5 12.	b3	Nb4 13.	Qb2	Nd3+ 14.	Rxd3	exd3 15.	Ng3	Qe1#. Very weak play by white!"
16,c5,c6c5,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/6p1/2p1P3/2PPp3/4B3/PP1Q1PPP/R3KBNR w KQkq - 0 9,So he hits the centre
