Normally the bishop on e6 is a factor into this but really the Black control of the centre means that he is the only one who can ever realistically build up a successful attack

The only way White can utilise the advanced h pawn to his advantage will be to get the f pawn in support or break up the centre which there wont be time to do

In this sort of position if a side is making defensive moves they are normally struggling but the key point is that Black can make these moves without conceding tempo. For example Bd7 forced White to take action concerning the attack on c3 and now Qc7 makes White go on the defensive without building up his attack at the same time. This all comes from Black's pieces being better placed and coordinated to combine attack and defense
