1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,A flexible opening move that can transpose to a c4 or d4 opening.  I started playing this move more frequently recently simply to avoid e5 in response to c4--the so-called Reverse Sicilian by black.
2,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 2,"The ""Mustang Defense"".  Certainly a playable move, but Nc6 here seems to me to not be the most flexible move order, depending on what white does.  By blocking his c-pawn, black has limited many of his options and might be forced to waste time moving the knight again in order to get in c5, which can be a key break for black in many c4 or d4 openings.  Also, after 2. e4, black is more or less committed to playing 2...e5, again limiting his options."
3,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,"This seemed a bit awkward to me.  Black seems to be getting a little tied up, and I looked hard for a way to perhaps take advantage of it.  It turns out that I could initiate a series of exchanges which highlighted the weaknesses of both Nc6 (meaning the immobilization of the c-pawn) and the bishop sitting on d7."
