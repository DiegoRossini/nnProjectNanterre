1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"A little unusual, but invites white to overextend."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"A little unusual, but invites white to overextend."
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 2,!? A fun little transposition to the Vienna Gambit.
4,e5,e7e5,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,!? A fun little transposition to the Vienna Gambit.
5,f4,f2f4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,!? A fun little transposition to the Vienna Gambit.
6,exf4,e5f4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/8/4Pp2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"?! Taking the pawn is not advisable in the Vienna Gambit, because of the vulnerability of the knight on f6 and the lack of the threat Qh4+."
7,e5,e4e5,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4P3/5p2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"Slightly preferable is Qe7, but Ng8 opens the d8-h4 diagonal for the queen."
8,Ng8,f6g8,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/5p2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"Slightly preferable is Qe7, but Ng8 opens the d8-h4 diagonal for the queen."
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/5p2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,Stops the check on h4.
10,f6,f7f6,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4P3/5p2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Black needs to start developing, and this isn't much help. This attempts to entice 6. exf6 Nxf6, but white has other ideas."
11,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4P3/3P1p2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,Natural and strong. White may be down in material but the lines of attack are wide open.
12,g5,g7g5,rnbqkbnr/pppp3p/5p2/4P1p1/3P1p2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"Trying to hang on to all his material, black again fails to focus on development."
13,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp3p/5p2/4P1p1/2BP1p2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,Many moves look good here; it's hard to go wrong with bringing another piece into the fray.
14,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp3p/2n2p2/4P1p1/2BP1p2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 8,"Finally, a little development!"
15,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkbnr/pppp3p/2n2p2/4P1p1/2BP1p2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 3 8,"There aren't many good squares for the knight, but can black afford to go after material?"
16,g4,g5g4,r1bqkbnr/pppp3p/2n2p2/4P3/2BP1pp1/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 9,"There aren't many good squares for the knight, but can black afford to go after material?"
17,Bxf4,c1f4,r1bqkbnr/pppp3p/2n2p2/4P3/2BP1Bp1/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 9,!? Sacrificing the knight for an overwhelming developmental lead.
18,gxf3,g4f3,r1bqkbnr/pppp3p/2n2p2/4P3/2BP1B2/2N2p2/PPP3PP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 10,"Pretty much forced, or all the kingside pawn moves were for naught. But still not good."
19,Qxf3,d1f3,r1bqkbnr/pppp3p/2n2p2/4P3/2BP1B2/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/R4RK1 b kq - 0 10,"Okay, let's take stock here. Black's kingside is a mess, his only developed piece is the Nc6, and all he's got to show for it is a slight edge in material. White has five active pieces and a clear target: the black king.

Does black even have a prayer here?"
20,Nxd4,c6d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp3p/5p2/4P3/2Bn1B2/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/R4RK1 w kq - 0 11,"? Pretty much equivalent to giving up, but it's hard to find a better move. White's response is a killer."
21,Qd5,f3d5,r1bqkbnr/pppp3p/5p2/3QP3/2Bn1B2/2N5/PPP3PP/R4RK1 b kq - 1 11,"Threatening mate on f7 and to win back all the sacrificed material with a huge positional advantage. Black is busted, but Qh5+ would have been even stronger, forcing Ke7 and mate next. You can't expect to see it all with just 5 minutes per game."
22,Nxc2,d4c2,r1bqkbnr/pppp3p/5p2/3QP3/2B2B2/2N5/PPn3PP/R4RK1 w kq - 0 12,"Giving up, but neither Ne2+, Nh6 nor Qe7 -- the only ways to prolong the game -- offer much better."
23,Qf7#,d5f7,r1bqkbnr/pppp1Q1p/5p2/4P3/2B2B2/2N5/PPn3PP/R4RK1 b kq - 1 12,A fun little miniature. No wonder they don't play with me at work very often. :-(
