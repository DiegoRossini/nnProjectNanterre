1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,So he starts with the usual
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,As I do
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,He signifies a preference for a Closed Sicilian
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,And I develop
5,f4,f2f4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"Usual in this variation, although g3 is more popular (see my annotated game http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/kidderminstervhalesowenbd1?gm=42465)"
6,e6,e7e6,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/4PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,And I adopt a similar set up as I did in that game.
7,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/4PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,He develops
8,g6,g7g6,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1p1p/2n1p1p1/2p5/4PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,And so do I
9,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1p1p/2n1p1p1/1Bp5/4PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,He hits the knight
10,Nge7,g8e7,r1bqkb1r/pp1pnp1p/2n1p1p1/1Bp5/4PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 6,And I prevent the doubling of pawns.
11,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkb1r/pp1pnp1p/2n1p1p1/1Bp5/4PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 3 6,He castles
12,Bg7,f8g7,r1bqk2r/pp1pnpbp/2n1p1p1/1Bp5/4PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 4 7,I develop
13,d3,d2d3,r1bqk2r/pp1pnpbp/2n1p1p1/1Bp5/4PP2/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,and so does he
14,a6,a7a6,r1bqk2r/1p1pnpbp/p1n1p1p1/1Bp5/4PP2/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,"I put the question to his bishop, although later I found out that Nd4 actually scores very well for black. 0-0 seems to be better too."
15,Bxc6,b5c6,r1bqk2r/1p1pnpbp/p1B1p1p1/2p5/4PP2/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,So he takes
16,Nxc6,e7c6,r1bqk2r/1p1p1pbp/p1n1p1p1/2p5/4PP2/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 9,"I take back. Now this is an interesting position. After the game my opponent said that he couldn't decide between e5 and f5 and he eventually played e5, and he wasn't sure that this was right. I replied that I thought e5 was stronger, but he made a mistake in not maintaining the pawn on e5, supporting it with Re1 and maybe Qe2, rather than exchanging it. I see on the Gameknot World database, there is one game with e5 Rendle Thomas (2397) vs. Kakkanas Evange… (2064) which ended in a draw, and one with f5, Lalic, Susan (2320) vs. Makropoulou, Ma… (2305) which white won. However I still think e5 is stronger!"
17,e5,e4e5,r1bqk2r/1p1p1pbp/p1n1p1p1/2p1P3/5P2/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 9,"and now I think I must hit this pawn as soon as possible. As I have two bishops I want to open up the position for my bishops. Rendle Thomas (2397) vs. Kakkanas Evange… (2064) continued with 9......d5, but why head into a blocked position where his knights are better than my knight and bishop?"
18,d6,d7d6,r1bqk2r/1p3pbp/p1npp1p1/2p1P3/5P2/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 10,"The search engine ""Shredder"" now suggests 10. Ne4 as best for White, with a slight advantage for white. I think the move he played was a mistake."
19,exd6,e5d6,r1bqk2r/1p3pbp/p1nPp1p1/2p5/5P2/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 10,Shredder thinks it is equal now.
20,Qxd6,d8d6,r1b1k2r/1p3pbp/p1nqp1p1/2p5/5P2/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 11,So I take back.
