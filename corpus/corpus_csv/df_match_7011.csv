1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

After inflicting a pawn stab which stole Steve's knight and 10 rating points off him, I had to hand them back after this game which was the Traxler Mini Tournament.  I drew with Steve with the white pieces - in fact I never got round to annotating that particular game - I really must rectify this - but I was not so lucky here.  I thought my joblock fortress was really watertight but Steve managed to ensure that it sprung a leak somewhere!  So, how did this happen?  Well, after the forced moves, 4. .... Bc5 we pick up the action on move 5."
