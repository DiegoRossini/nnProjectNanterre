1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game is one I should have lost, probably twice.  I was fortunate to escape with a draw as I played poorly.  There are a lot of good things to take out of our mistakes in the game.  Appreciate your comments and suggestions for improved play."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,To help protect the f pawn as well as allow options for harassing my knight.
3,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,To help protect the f pawn as well as allow options for harassing my knight.
4,exf4,e5f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,To help protect the f pawn as well as allow options for harassing my knight.
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,To help protect the f pawn as well as allow options for harassing my knight.
6,g5,g7g5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/6p1/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,To help protect the f pawn as well as allow options for harassing my knight.
7,h4,h2h4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/6p1/4Pp1P/5N2/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"Although this is the book play for KGA, I almost never play it.  I prefer Bc4 to help develop my attacks more quickly.  Since this was an unrated training game I decided to give it a go."
8,g4,g5g4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/8/4PppP/5N2/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,Continuing with the attack
9,Ne5,f3e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/4N3/4PppP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"This move is better than Ng5, because it centralizes the knight and threatens the g pawn."
10,Nh6,g8h6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1p1p/7n/4N3/4PppP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,I would prefer Nf6 because it simultaneously threatens the e pawn and a knight on the side of the board is normally less useful than a knight in the middle.
11,Nxg4,e5g4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1p1p/7n/8/4PpNP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,Regaining pawn parity.
12,Nxg4,h6g4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1p1p/8/8/4PpnP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,Another option is d6
13,Qxg4,d1g4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1p1p/8/8/4PpQP/8/PPPP2P1/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 7,I think either Nc6 or d6 would be better
14,Bh6,f8h6,rnbqk2r/pppp1p1p/7b/8/4PpQP/8/PPPP2P1/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 1 8,I think either Nc6 or d6 would be better
15,d4,d2d4,rnbqk2r/pppp1p1p/7b/8/3PPpQP/8/PPP3P1/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 8,Nc3 would have been much better... even d3 would have probably been better.
16,d6,d7d6,rnbqk2r/ppp2p1p/3p3b/8/3PPpQP/8/PPP3P1/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 9,I still think it's better to bring the knight out.  Getting your power pieces in play early are important to allow you to quickly respond to advanced threats.
17,Qf3,g4f3,rnbqk2r/ppp2p1p/3p3b/8/3PPp1P/5Q2/PPP3P1/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 1 9,"Qh5 (followed by 9.... Bg7, 10. c3) was a much stronger play, keeping the pressure on Black and forcing a bishop move and helping me dictate moves.  If you ever find yourself retreating early in a KGA, then you have made a poor choice leading up to or in the move at hand.  Gambits are about exchanging pieces for fast development and attacks.  I took a timid approach and some future compounding errors will severely impact my position."
18,Qf6,d8f6,rnb1k2r/ppp2p1p/3p1q1b/8/3PPp1P/5Q2/PPP3P1/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 2 10,Good positional play for black.
19,c3,c2c3,rnb1k2r/ppp2p1p/3p1q1b/8/3PPp1P/2P2Q2/PP4P1/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 10,"ugh... this was one of those moves that I made and instantly regretted.  While it does help shore up the central pawns, it cedes all initiative to Black.  Instead of dictating the flow (as White should in KGA) I am now reactive.  Nc3, and giving up the d pawn, would have been better."
20,Rg8,h8g8,rnb1k1r1/ppp2p1p/3p1q1b/8/3PPp1P/2P2Q2/PP4P1/RNB1KB1R w KQq - 1 11,"Good development by Black, bringing extra pressure on my kingside."
21,e5,e4e5,rnb1k1r1/ppp2p1p/3p1q1b/4P3/3P1p1P/2P2Q2/PP4P1/RNB1KB1R b KQq - 0 11,"Instead of playing pawn games, I should have brought my knight into the game either at Na3 or Nd2.  Black has the ability to reach deep into my territory with a rook at g3, so I need more pieces for defensive and counterattack options.  Rookie tip: if you're ever uncertain what to do, and you still have power pieces in their starting positions, get them in the game.  As a potential side benefit moving my knight would have potentially given me a chance to castle queenside and connect my rooks.  I can already feel this game slipping away."
22,dxe5,d6e5,rnb1k1r1/ppp2p1p/5q1b/4p3/3P1p1P/2P2Q2/PP4P1/RNB1KB1R w KQq - 0 12,Getting some positional leverage for my queen and preventing the e pawn from capturing my d pawn.
23,Qe4,f3e4,rnb1k1r1/ppp2p1p/5q1b/4p3/3PQp1P/2P5/PP4P1/RNB1KB1R b KQq - 1 12,Getting some positional leverage for my queen and preventing the e pawn from capturing my d pawn.
24,Rg7,g8g7,rnb1k3/ppp2prp/5q1b/4p3/3PQp1P/2P5/PP4P1/RNB1KB1R w KQq - 2 13,"I'm assuming Black did this to protect his h pawn.  It's an acceptable sacrifice at this point.  If Black can get some more of his pieces in play, he can seriously give me the run around.  Get that knight and bishop going!"
25,Bb5+,f1b5,rnb1k3/ppp2prp/5q1b/1B2p3/3PQp1P/2P5/PP4P1/RNB1K2R b KQq - 3 13,I should have taken dxe5 and have no justifiable reason not to.  The LSB was doing me some good at f1.
26,Nc6,b8c6,r1b1k3/ppp2prp/2n2q1b/1B2p3/3PQp1P/2P5/PP4P1/RNB1K2R w KQq - 4 14,Probably blocking with a pawn or a bishop was better.
