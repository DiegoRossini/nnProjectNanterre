5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"White chooses to let Black capture the c4 square. In exchange, he develops a piece and weakens the d5 square. Plus if I choose to take, my pawn is isolated."
6,dxc4,d5c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/2pP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,In blitz I usually prefer to take an aggressive approach. So why not start it early?

10,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/8/1bBP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 1 6,An aggressive play. In a real game c5 or Nc6 would be considered here. I pin the knight and open the line to castle.
11,Nge2,g1e2,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/8/1bBP4/2N1P3/PP2NPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 6,"My queen side is under developed at this point, but at least I can safely move to c6 without worrying about a pin."

16,Be7,b4e7,rnbq1rk1/p1p1bppp/1p2pn2/8/2BP4/P1N1P3/1P2NPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 9,I decide it is best not to trade.
17,Qc2,d1c2,rnbq1rk1/p1p1bppp/1p2pn2/8/2BP4/P1N1P3/1PQ1NPPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 2 9,White flanks my kingside with his queen. This file will become more important as the game proceeds.
18,Bb7,c8b7,rn1q1rk1/pbp1bppp/1p2pn2/8/2BP4/P1N1P3/1PQ1NPPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 3 10,"May the war of the flanks commence! In hindsight, c5 is also a playable option here."

21,Rfe1,f1e1,r2q1rk1/pbpnbppp/1p2pn2/8/2BP4/P1N1P3/1PQBNPPP/R3R1K1 b - - 6 11,This move I did not understand. Perhaps someone with a broader understanding can help me out?
22,c5,c7c5,r2q1rk1/pb1nbppp/1p2pn2/2p5/2BP4/P1N1P3/1PQBNPPP/R3R1K1 w - - 0 12,"Remember what I said about the c-file! Patience is a virtue. I asked later why white did not advance b4 to which he responded: ""Why did you not push c5 earlier? It's all about preparation."""
23,Rad1,a1d1,r2q1rk1/pb1nbppp/1p2pn2/2p5/2BP4/P1N1P3/1PQBNPPP/3RR1K1 b - - 1 12,"Whatever he is preparing, I can not see. But I'm not the GM."

25,Nxd4,e2d4,r2q1rk1/pb1nbppp/1p2pn2/8/2BN4/P1N1P3/1PQB1PPP/3RR1K1 b - - 0 13,"This move does not have the same potency as before, but I did still want to connect my rooks as well. Also taking aim at white's king, who has nothing on that side."
26,Qc7,d8c7,r4rk1/pbqnbppp/1p2pn2/8/2BN4/P1N1P3/1PQB1PPP/3RR1K1 w - - 1 14,"This move does not have the same potency as before, but I did still want to connect my rooks as well. Also taking aim at white's king, who has nothing on that side."
