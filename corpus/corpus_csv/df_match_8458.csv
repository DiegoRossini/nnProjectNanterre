1,b4,b2b4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/1P6/8/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"b4 is considered as one of the 'weird openings' and so swindon has played it. It has a few names, such as the Polish, Sokolsky and the Orangutan. The name 'orangutan' comes from Polish GM Saviely Tartakower (you must have heard of him), and he was trying to think of a queenside thrust while at the zoo, and he saw an Orangutan..."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/1P6/8/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Black (me) has lots of playable answers, but the most promising is the obvious and logical 1...e5, grabbing the center, and creating an immediate threat against b4, from the f8 bishop, which suddenly gets involved."
3,Bb2,c1b2,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/1P6/8/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"This was always the original plan for white, grabbing queenside space and fianchettoing his Bishop on the long b2-h8 diagonal. On the negative side the b4 is hanging dry and ready to get killed as it is undefended."
4,Bxb4,f8b4,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/1b6/8/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Black has given up the important central e-pawn for the white b-pawn. This exchange makes white happy, since now he owns a central majority of pawns."
5,Bxe5,b2e5,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/4B3/1b6/8/P1PPPPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"Black has given up the important central e-pawn for the white b-pawn. This exchange makes white happy, since now he owns a central majority of pawns."
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4B3/1b6/8/P1PPPPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,Black has a nice lead in development and blocks his weak g7 pawn. Note now the black Queen is protecting the knight.
7,g4,g2g4,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4B3/1b4P1/8/P1PPPP1P/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"(?!) Dubious move, as white is trying to launch a kingside attack on black. This however, completely weakens White's kingside defense. White also would like the knight to take g4 so he can pick off g7, a key square for the King's defense."
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4B3/1b4P1/8/P1PPPP1P/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,Simple developing move and adding pressure to the Bishop on e5. Black is a lot further ahead on developing his minor pieces.
9,Bxf6,e5f6,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2B2/8/1b4P1/8/P1PPPP1P/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,(?) Bishop is on a lovely diagonal - why lose it?
10,Qxf6,d8f6,r1b1k2r/pppp1ppp/2n2q2/8/1b4P1/8/P1PPPP1P/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,White exchanges his good well-developed Bishop for a not as well developed Knight.
11,c3,c2c3,r1b1k2r/pppp1ppp/2n2q2/8/1b4P1/2P5/P2PPP1P/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,"White escapes the big threat on the rook on a1, and causing pressure to the bishop on b4."
12,Bc5,b4c5,r1b1k2r/pppp1ppp/2n2q2/2b5/6P1/2P5/P2PPP1P/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 1 7,"Bishop retreats to c5, and an obvious checkmate is on f2. It is basically a reversed Scholar's mate. I had a good plan here though. If white played 7.d4, adding pressure to the bishop, and central squares control, 7...Nxd4! 8.cxd4 Bxd4, the white rook is trapped and lost."
13,Bg2,f1g2,r1b1k2r/pppp1ppp/2n2q2/2b5/6P1/2P5/P2PPPBP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 2 7,"Bg2 (??) obvious checkmate, and he must be embarrassed to have missed it."
14,Qxf2#,f6f2,r1b1k2r/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b5/6P1/2P5/P2PPqBP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 0 8,Now we learnt today- DON'T DO WEIRD OPENINGS LIKE B4!!!
