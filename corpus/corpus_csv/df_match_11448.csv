Not the most common way to play the Sicilian at present, but a player like Bent Larsen have used it quite often throughout his career. One big difference from the ""normal"" Dragon is, that Black hasn�t played his pawn to d6 yet. In some lines this gives the opportunity to play it to d5 directly - like in this game. If you want to study this opening, I can recommend the book ""The Sicilian Accelerated Dragon"" by GM Peter Heine Nielsen and Carsten Hansen."
