1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I've always played at my best with e4. In serious play, I've yet to deviate from this. His preferred opening with White was a variation normally seen in Queen's Gambit Declined, where White plays d4, supports with e3, and then after playing c4, would push for c5 and immediately support with b4. I rarely encounter these games when Black, and I found it a bit difficult to play accurately with my camp so cramped up from the Queenside. I would pull through from the opening frequently, I'd even take an advantage for a good bit of time, but I got blindsided enough for him to come back and win the overall game both times."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"As Black, he's an e5 player, something I've seen far too often and always enjoy fighting against."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"I play this, hoping he plays Nc6. Actually, I think he even did, our first match, where I was able to launch into a Ruy Lopez, but perhaps it was a different player, as his next move this match was what I remembered as his most astonishing characteristic..."
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"d6. So we have ourselves a fan of the Philidor's Defense. I openly herald this opening as a passive opening for Black, as it immediately does White the favor of trapping the bishop on f8. It's rather easy, I find as White, to grab hold of the center almost right away and launch early attacks, as Bb4 is not a problem to worry about most of the match. However, he handles this defense well when in a Blitz match, and I'll show you how this happens."
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"Main line for White. Philidor himself, when he invented this opening, believes that the opening is best played for Black to now attempt f5, with a counter-threat on e4 and a nice diagonal on the light bishop. Opening theorists have ultimately decided that should White play carefully, however, none of these lines result in equal positions, but rather an advantage for White as the color ultimately gets the first attack."
6,f6,f7f6,rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/3p1p2/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"But, this is my opponent's twist on the opening. f6, blocking the knight. Black welcomes White to try to seize the light squares, while Black tries to capitalize on his own patience and the dark squares."
7,Be3,c1e3,rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/3p1p2/4p3/3PP3/4BN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"Black normally exchanges the pawn on d4, but I know that there will be a bishop on g4 eventually, and I'd rather my position be ready for the inevitable exchange about to head my way. Also, Nbd2 is a much stronger move now, a move we tried in one of our earlier games, but didn't quite get to this time around."
8,Ne7,g8e7,rnbqkb1r/ppp1n1pp/3p1p2/4p3/3PP3/4BN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,"This was new for him, eyeing the f5 square, and bringing some fight to d5 as well."
9,d5,d4d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1n1pp/3p1p2/3Pp3/4P3/4BN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"White could exchange, but with all of Black's developed pieces on dark squares, the weakness on e6 is something that he will have to deal with for much of the match. With such a strong outpost, Black must defend very carefully."
10,c6,c7c6,rnbqkb1r/pp2n1pp/2pp1p2/3Pp3/4P3/4BN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Black plays this, a surprisingly strong pawn while never quite making the overall intention of the move clear. If White takes the pawn, it's simply replaced by the b7 pawn, or either knight could grab it as well. I'd rather keep the outposts my pawn offers me, so..."
11,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pp2n1pp/2pp1p2/3Pp3/2P1P3/4BN2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"...I respond with this, forfeiting whatever power a minor piece on b5 could grant me, in exchange for my control of e6. White's plan here is immediately clear and obvious, though."
12,c5,c6c5,rnbqkb1r/pp2n1pp/3p1p2/2pPp3/2P1P3/4BN2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"Black's, on the other hand, was not. If Black played c5 at once, then the outposting done against my dark bishop would have been much more obvious, and the idea to then capture en passant could have been far more justified on my end. Even so, with an extra pawn move spent, Black sacrifices tempo for discrepancy, forcing me to respond in a way that makes me question the tactical or strategic motivations behind his movements. The idea here still is not quite yet done, either..."
13,a4,a2a4,rnbqkb1r/pp2n1pp/3p1p2/2pPp3/P1P1P3/4BN2/1P3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"I don't want to give up my control of b5, so this was a plan to deter a6-b5 by Black. A preemptive move... possibly premature, given what Black does next."
14,Qa5+,d8a5,rnb1kb1r/pp2n1pp/3p1p2/q1pPp3/P1P1P3/4BN2/1P3PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,"So, ultimately, the move 5 ...c6 provokes White into playing c4, strengthening this check, where I have to carefully consider where I want my pieces to go while he starts to exploit the dark squares he can pin on my queenside. Overall, I still like my position here, but the amount of counterplay Black has here is not to be taken lightly either."
15,Bd2,e3d2,rnb1kb1r/pp2n1pp/3p1p2/q1pPp3/P1P1P3/5N2/1P1B1PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 2 8,"I had a bit of a think here, the choice of two developed or two non-developed pieces to pick to block the check. In the end, I decided I wanted him to spend more time moving his queen than making other decent developing moves."
16,Qb6,a5b6,rnb1kb1r/pp2n1pp/1q1p1p2/2pPp3/P1P1P3/5N2/1P1B1PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 3 9,"Still, the greatest solution to this move here would probably involve me moving my bishop again to c3, which I really didn't want to waste time by doing. Black's moves seem rather predictable for now, but I'm not fully sure if I was playing the best way for White to have dealt with this line."
17,b3,b2b3,rnb1kb1r/pp2n1pp/1q1p1p2/2pPp3/P1P1P3/1P3N2/3B1PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 9,"Move the pawn, move the Queen, or move the Bishop. This move caused me the least amount of grief in my own mind, though it does become a weakness as the Queen is its only defender."
18,Bg4,c8g4,rn2kb1r/pp2n1pp/1q1p1p2/2pPp3/P1P1P1b1/1P3N2/3B1PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 1 10,"This move finally appears, developing a virtually useless bishop given my pieces occupy mostly the light squares. Black hardly has much other use for it at this time."
19,Be2,f1e2,rn2kb1r/pp2n1pp/1q1p1p2/2pPp3/P1P1P1b1/1P3N2/3BBPPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 2 10,"I play this, though I'm still not overly too sure about how I want my kingside to look once I've castled. I couldn't make up my mind between me wanting the knight on h4, or to just force the exchange by pushing h3. I was searching for the exact combination of moves, but..."
20,Ng6,e7g6,rn2kb1r/pp4pp/1q1p1pn1/2pPp3/P1P1P1b1/1P3N2/3BBPPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 3 11,"...this threw a wrench into my thinking. I see Black gaining power with a knight on f4, while stopping my own Nh4. I didn't want to sacrifice my dark bishop should Black play ...Nf4 either, because I figured I had a better space advantage. Therefore, my dark bishop was stronger than his light bishop, which he was likely going to exchange in a moment."
