The Cochrane Gambit is a swashbuckling remnant of the bygone Romantic age of chess, but still retains a good deal of punch. Indeed, it is still occasionally essayed at the highest levels of chess--Topalov managed a draw with it against Kramnik at Linares in 1999. In my experience, black does well if he can weather the initial onslaught, activate his KR, and get his king to safety...but against a strong player those are three very big ""ifs."""

This, I reasoned, would also put my queen in a position to parry threats white's Q might make from the center. As it happens, though, the computers are unhappy with my choice. Instead, they favor 9. ...d5, which further disrupts white's pawn-rolling potential. In retrospect, I concur with this analysis, especially as it is consistent with the thought behind 5. ...c5.

Better moves for black are not easy to find, however. 13... Ne5 could be considered here, especially since the attempt to drive the N immediately away via 14. f4 fails against 14. ...Nc4!"
