1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I was White in this game played at a Gambito, which is a weekly tournament at San Diego Chess Club"
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The Sicilian Defense is the most common response to e4, but I think Nf6 is strongest"
3,c3,c2c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"If you want to play the customary Nf3 followed by d4, then it requires loads of studying because of Black's MANY possible defenses. Playing a c3-d4 boost is a simple way to avoid studying Sicilian lines"
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,This is the easiest line to play against c3. More complicated is Nf6.
5,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pP4/8/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"Pretty much forced, since e5 is overextensive and leaves Black with a good pawn structure."
6,Qxd5,d8d5,rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pq4/8/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"A sharper move is Nf6, because if White wins a pawn with c4, then e6 dxe6 Bxe6 is fine for Black even though he's down a pawn, White has a major weakness on d4, a weak d-pawn, and is behind in development. This variation usually yields White a small advantage."
7,d4,d2d4,rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pq4/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,The point of c3
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2pq4/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,A logical developing move.
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2pq4/3P4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,Another logical developing move
10,cxd4,c5d4,rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3q4/3p4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Black avoids me playing dxc5 later, but I wouldn't have since that line is so complicated."
11,cxd4,c3d4,rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3q4/3P4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"Nxd4 moves the same piece twice in the opening, and Qxd4 lets Black trade queens and go into a theoretically drawn endgame.
Although I have an isolated pawn, it isn't weak at the moment, and controls a lot of the centre."
12,e6,e7e6,rnb1kb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/3q4/3P4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"When your opponent has an isolated pawn, it's good to control the square in front of it, like my opponent is doing."
13,Bd3,f1d3,rnb1kb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/3q4/3P4/3B1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,"This is the best place for my bishop, because it aims toward the kingside. I would only play Be2 if Black had played Bg4 earlier."
14,Nc6,b8c6,r1b1kb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/3q4/3P4/3B1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 8,This DOESN'T threaten to win a pawn.
15,O-O,e1g1,r1b1kb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/3q4/3P4/3B1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 3 8,"My queen is really defending the pawn also, because I can reveal it with Bb5  if Black tries to win a pawn."
16,Be7,f8e7,r1b1k2r/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/3q4/3P4/3B1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 4 9,Tempo
17,Nc3,b1c3,r1b1k2r/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/3q4/3P4/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 5 9,Tempo
18,Qd8,d5d8,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/8/3P4/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 6 10,"Qd6 is a much deeper and more strategic move, while my opponent's choice was just simple."
19,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/6B1/3P4/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 7 10,"If Black moves his knight, I can trade my bad bishop for Black's good bishop."
20,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/6B1/3P4/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 8 11,This castles into my future attack
21,Rc1,a1c1,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/6B1/3P4/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/2RQ1RK1 b - - 9 11,"This was sort of a weak move. I wanted to play Bb1 Qd3 to threaten mating tactics, and didn't want my rook stuck on a1, but that would've been fine since my rook isn't needed at the moment."
