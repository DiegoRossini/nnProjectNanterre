9,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4bn2/8/8/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"Still uncompromising the center with d4, in the believing that ""this was just what I expected him to do"". Like ""wait and see"". But not ""really"" bad. But think: the move involves the decision to let c2 where it is, and this doesn't help white to make black feel painfully his central power with d4 and c4."
10,Qe7,d8e7,rn2kb1r/ppp1qppp/4bn2/8/8/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,"This is thematic, and white is not really in any dangers, but it makes white play ""at my pace"". In this scheme, I plan to develop the dsb through fianchetto, in closed lines, or I accept to lose a tempo later relocating my queen. I won't win the fight for the e column, that will be left to white."
11,a4,a2a4,rn2kb1r/ppp1qppp/4bn2/8/P7/2N2N2/1PPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"A total loss of tempo, since I have no piece to put on b5. Of course, white here decides not to worry about the discovered check, and he was right. But why not d3 instead? Or Bb5+ at once, leaving the bishop the possibility to relocate on b3, undermining black's crucial point e6."
12,Bc4+,e6c4,rn2kb1r/ppp1qppp/5n2/8/P1b5/2N2N2/1PPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,"Another way for black to play this could have been Nd5 first, where NxN, BxN+, Qe2, BxN, forcing white to double its pawn - a doubtfully desirable objective, but something to work on."
13,Be2,f1e2,rn2kb1r/ppp1qppp/5n2/8/P1b5/2N2N2/1PPPBPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 7,I played simple here. I just wanted to test the opening in its purest state (a pity for a4).
14,Bxe2,c4e2,rn2kb1r/ppp1qppp/5n2/8/P7/2N2N2/1PPPbPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,I played simple here. I just wanted to test the opening in its purest state (a pity for a4).
15,Nxe2,c3e2,rn2kb1r/ppp1qppp/5n2/8/P7/5N2/1PPPNPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,"!? The mainline suggests g6 instead, but I wanted to try this one. I bet I'll find time to castle short asap."

17,O-O,e1g1,rn2kb1r/pp2qppp/5n2/2p5/P7/5N2/1PPPNPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 9,"Grabbing the last tempo. I still think on a long casting here, since it throws my rook just where it hurts, in front of white's queen. This factor, that may be seem so remote, did actually pay a strong role in the game, and it is the main reason I am annontating this game."
18,Nc6,b8c6,r3kb1r/pp2qppp/2n2n2/2p5/P7/5N2/1PPPNPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 10,"Grabbing the last tempo.

19,Re1,f1e1,r3kb1r/pp2qppp/2n2n2/2p5/P7/5N2/1PPPNPPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq - 3 10,"Here it comes, of course."
20,O-O-O,e8c8,2kr1b1r/pp2qppp/2n2n2/2p5/P7/5N2/1PPPNPPP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 4 11,Just as a ballet. Now let's see where will go that knight...
21,Nc3,e2c3,2kr1b1r/pp2qppp/2n2n2/2p5/P7/2N2N2/1PPP1PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - - 5 11,A pity. Nd4 would have been much more funny.
22,Qd7,e7d7,2kr1b1r/pp1q1ppp/2n2n2/2p5/P7/2N2N2/1PPP1PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 6 12,"Not Qc7, Nb5..."
23,d3,d2d3,2kr1b1r/pp1q1ppp/2n2n2/2p5/P7/2NP1N2/1PP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - - 0 12,"Finally. Of course d4 just loses the pawn, and this is a kind of defeat for white in the opening. Let's me explain. Here, as black, I want to prepare a battery on h2. This is my most likely plan while developing. My enemy is the Nc3 (not all that bad move, after all), but I don't want to lose a tempo playing a6. So, I plan to let him put the knight there to kick my bishop, that will go to b8. After it, I'll kick the kinght with a6, and he would have to retreat the knight, and I am not losing a tempo. Moreover, I'll have the queen in front of the battery, and this implies a different way to attack (probably Ng4, that must be supported by h5 against the queen... a nice tactic play). The participation of white's dsb, which this moves abilitates, will help in stopping the nasty plan only if g3 is played, to support Bf4, and accepting a weak kingside."
24,Bd6,f8d6,2kr3r/pp1q1ppp/2nb1n2/2p5/P7/2NP1N2/1PP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 1 13,Here it goes step number one. The bishops is supposed to be kicked back to b8.
25,a5,a4a5,2kr3r/pp1q1ppp/2nb1n2/P1p5/8/2NP1N2/1PP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - - 0 13,"White tries another plan, I didn't see before. Very smart, but with an incredible side-effect."
26,a6,a7a6,2kr3r/1p1q1ppp/p1nb1n2/P1p5/8/2NP1N2/1PP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 0 14,"Now I've got the tempo to block his knight out of b5, but..."

28,Qc7,d7c7,2kr3r/1pq2ppp/p1nb1n2/P1p5/N7/3P1N2/1PP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 2 15,"If white goes Nb6+, I'll go Kb8, and that's it... for the moment!"
29,Be3,c1e3,2kr3r/1pq2ppp/p1nb1n2/P1p5/N7/3PBN2/1PP2PPP/R2QR1K1 b - - 3 15,"White attacks c4, a good idea. Now, take into account black coud play c4, since white cannot take dxc4 or loses the queen to the rook after Bxh2+. Unfortunately, black can't play c4 because of Bb6). But for a similar reason, white can't play d4. Still, I felt in trouble. How to get out of it?"
