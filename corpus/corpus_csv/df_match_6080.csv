1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I am going to annotate a game played in the 70s by Kasparov, the strongest player in chess history. This consisted of a pawn sacrifice(pure) in the opening. the compensation black gets is not very clear, and white gets an edge, but Kasparov uses his skill to win back the material and after some more tactics, he emerges with a decisive material advantage."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"after this, we can predict Kasparov will go for a gruenfeld or king's indian."

7,e4,e2e4,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"the standard opening strategy here. Black fights for the center with pieces, and white occupies it with pawns."
8,d6,d7d6,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,restraining white's pawn center.

Right now, these center pawns decide the strategy for black and white. Black has more space on the kingside, and he should attack there, which he usually does with a pawn storm. White should try to make gains on the queenside."
14,Nh5,f6h5,rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/3p2p1/3Pp2n/2P1P3/2N1B2P/PP3PP1/R2QKBNR w KQ - 1 8,very logical. Black immediately plans ...f5

However, the compensation he gets is unclear. he averts time loss by not retreating the knight, but a closed position like time has little meaning. He does gain the bishop pair, and he can make the remaining white bishop very passive. These factors may compensate him, as they are long term advantages in this closed position."
