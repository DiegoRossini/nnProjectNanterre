Yes, but my plan is to attack strongly on the kingside, so I need to have the queenside completely locked. 
Of course, all this holds in a blitz game where I more or less know my opponent's way of playing."

5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppppp2p/6p1/5p2/3P4/2P2N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"The caracteristic move for white (""my way""). Bg5 is a waste of time, since Nf6 unpins the e pawn for black. 
Moreover, now black can have either a N or a B in g5 at any moment. He can kick them out very easily (h6), but weakening the kingside, and you know, a moment can be enough."
