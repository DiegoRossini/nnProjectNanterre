1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was one of my better if not my best game. It's pretty short, but I developed pieces well and didn't fall into attacking too soon like I usually do. So I annotated this mostly to remind myself what can happen when you just develop pieces with some patience."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,This may become my pet starting point from now on. It works great if you carefully develop pieces.
3,c3,c2c3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,This may become my pet starting point from now on. It works great if you carefully develop pieces.

21,Qd8#,d1d8,rnbQk1nr/pp3ppp/2p1q3/4b1B1/1P2P3/2P2N2/P4PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 1 11,"My queen has been long given a pathway to d8 after he captured my e5 with his pawn. My queen is protected by bishop on g5. His bishop on c7 was obstacle. But when he captured my knight, it was checkmate. This was a good game on my part. But black also made some bad moves by exposing his power pieces too soon. But in whatever situation, developing pieces early makes attacking late much more effective and gives you much more options, too. Obviously everyone knows that, but way too often I don't go by that. The lure of attacking is too much sometimes. this game is a way to remind myself to resist it and diligently develop pieces."
