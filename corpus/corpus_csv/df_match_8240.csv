1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This is the last move of the gambit.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,This is the last move of the gambit.

6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,This is the best response to the gambit that I have seen so far. Black declines Nxe4 and instead calmly develops and maintains control instead of losing development time by chasing a pawn and exchanging a knight after many moves.
7,c3,c2c3,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,"!? Playing against d4, takes away ...Bc5 or ...Bb4 and it leaves room for the c4 bishop to escape a knight attack. Its not aggresive, it does offer e4 with the idea of attempting to gain an edge in development."
8,Nxe4,f6e4,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1n3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,White has to suffer this move in an attempt to obtain a long term positional advantage.

11,Bb3,c4b3,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/3pp3/4n3/1BP2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 6,Black continues development with plans for 0-0.

13,d4,d2d4,r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/2n5/3pp3/3Pn3/1BP2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,Just breaking up the center to reduce the pawn presence.
14,exd4,e5d4,r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/2n5/3p4/3pn3/1BP2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,"Suffering an isolated pawn, but black almost has the same because of the knight on c6. The pawn is not under serious attack, and plans for white are to keep black busy defending pieces so to keep the d4 pawn out of immediate consideration."
15,cxd4,c3d4,r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/2n5/3p4/3Pn3/1B3N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,"Suffering an isolated pawn, but black almost has the same because of the knight on c6.

16,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/ppp1bppp/2n5/3p4/3Pn3/1B3N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 1 9,With the idea of f3 to push back the knight.

18,Be6,c8e6,r2q1rk1/ppp1bppp/2n1b3/3p4/3Pn3/1B6/PP3PPP/RNBQNRK1 w - - 3 10,"Just a developing move, does not give white any problems. White is suffering from some serious developmental issues, but the plan is to attack, expand, develop for a positional attack."
19,Kh1,g1h1,r2q1rk1/ppp1bppp/2n1b3/3p4/3Pn3/1B6/PP3PPP/RNBQNR1K b - - 4 10,"Prevents a pin on the f pawn in the future - in the event of losing d4. Just a precaution. Perhaps unecessary, but I felt it was wise."
20,Nb4,c6b4,r2q1rk1/ppp1bppp/4b3/3p4/1n1Pn3/1B6/PP3PPP/RNBQNR1K w - - 5 11,?! Its not a good move because the knight can be chased back losing tempo. Although it has to take a number and wait while I chase the e4 knight.
21,f3,f2f3,r2q1rk1/ppp1bppp/4b3/3p4/1n1Pn3/1B3P2/PP4PP/RNBQNR1K b - - 0 11,Catching up a little on development because the knight at b4 is no great worry. It will be chased away.

24,Nc4,d6c4,r2q1rk1/ppp1bppp/4b3/3p4/1nnP4/1BN2P2/PP4PP/R1BQNR1K w - - 3 13,"Not an encouraging formation of knights from whites perspective, but they will be chased back to less useful positions while white consolidates pieces."
25,a3,a2a3,r2q1rk1/ppp1bppp/4b3/3p4/1nnP4/PBN2P2/1P4PP/R1BQNR1K b - - 0 13,Eyeing h7.

29,f4,f3f4,r2q1rk1/ppp2ppp/2n1b3/3p2b1/2nP1P2/P1N5/1PB3PP/R1BQNR1K b - - 0 15,I decide this pawn can gain some positional pluses so decide to push it.

34,Nb6,c4b6,r1bq1rk1/ppp1bppp/1nn5/3p1P2/3P4/PPN5/2B3PP/R1BQNR1K w - - 1 18,?! A risky decision which is not altogether certain in its prospects. Sacrificing a pawn to attempt an attack.
