1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"!!! Yes, I give my 1. e4 a triple exclam !!! Why, you may ask? Here'e the deal - I didn't discover OTB until 1991, when I played in my first tournament. My second tournament wasn't until 2006, and since then I've played in almost 100 OTB tourneys. That's roughly 500 rated games, meaning roughly 250 with white. I had NEVER played 1. e4 during all that time. Doug, a loooooong time nemesis, is well aware of this fact. I am 1-0-6 against him in rated play (yes, you read that right). He wants me BAAAAD. When I whipped out 1. e4, he looked JUST LIKE robertor's newest pic:) He spent almost 7 minutes on his first move:)"
