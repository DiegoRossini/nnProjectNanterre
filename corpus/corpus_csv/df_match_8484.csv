1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Picture the scene - you are in a single piece ending, you have a bishop, your opponent has a knight.  You are a pawn up.  Then the game ends in a draw and for me a low draw at that.  You wonder - how did it all go wrong.  Well here goes.  After facing many Sicilians I now get a Petrov.  This is when black plays 2...... Nf6 instead of Nc6."
