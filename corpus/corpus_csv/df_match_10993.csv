1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I first saw this game on www.chessgames.com as it was game of the day sometime back and took a liking to it as I was studying the Guico Piano at the time.1.e4 The most common opening move and in my opinion the best as I have stated in most of the game that I have annotated.. However it's stats are falling because the surge of the sicilian monster!
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Siezes space in the centre like white has done.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Attacks the e5 pawn, a pretty standard move."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,Defends it. Also standard!
5,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,"The Italian game. An old opening that is now thought to be rather dull and boring. Black now has two main options here 3....Bc5 the Giuoco Piano or 3... Nf6 The Two Knight's Defence. The Italian game can evolve into the romantic Evans Gambit if 3...Bc5 then 4. b4!?(This is a very nice gambit which I have a few annotated games of ""Naval Intelligence"" a very nice little game!.)"
6,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,"The Guicco Piano. This is less agressive than the Two Knight's defence. Tartakower now has the chance to play my fave as I have already mentioned, the Evan's Gambit 4.b4!?"
7,c3,c2c3,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,"THis prepares d4, however has the setback of weakening the e4 pawn as the natural Nc3 to defend the e4 pawn is now impossible. The other main option is 4.b4?! the Evan's Gambit which you can see in the game titled 'Naval Intelligence'"
8,Bb6,c5b6,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/1bn5/4p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 5,This is an old fashioned approach to this opening. This move is an early retreat from the inevitable d4 advance attacking the bishop. The better and more modern approach would be 4... Nf6 attacking the e4 pawn.
9,d4,d2d4,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/1bn5/4p3/2BPP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,The d4 advance seizing space in the centre aiming for the typical Italian centre.
10,Qe7,d8e7,r1b1k1nr/ppppqppp/1bn5/4p3/2BPP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 6,This seems a strange move because most people would play 5... d6 here however the chosen move is still adequate.
11,O-O,e1g1,r1b1k1nr/ppppqppp/1bn5/4p3/2BPP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 2 6,Getting his king in a safe place before embarking on attacking the enemy king.
12,d6,d7d6,r1b1k1nr/ppp1qppp/1bnp4/4p3/2BPP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,This secures the e5 pawn.
13,h3,h2h3,r1b1k1nr/ppp1qppp/1bnp4/4p3/2BPP3/2P2N1P/PP3PP1/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,"This prevents Bg4 pinning the knight, these kind of moves are often under rated but they can prove very effective for preventing pesky pins."
14,Nf6,g8f6,r1b1k2r/ppp1qppp/1bnp1n2/4p3/2BPP3/2P2N1P/PP3PP1/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 8,"Standard development, preparing for castling."
15,Re1,f1e1,r1b1k2r/ppp1qppp/1bnp1n2/4p3/2BPP3/2P2N1P/PP3PP1/RNBQR1K1 b kq - 2 8,Tartakower decides to centralize his rook which increases his massive grasp on the centre. Note that while White's position looks formidable Black's position is still solid and hard to break down.
16,O-O,e8g8,r1b2rk1/ppp1qppp/1bnp1n2/4p3/2BPP3/2P2N1P/PP3PP1/RNBQR1K1 w - - 3 9,"This is a typical position from the Giuoco Piano well atleast it would have been in theory 50 years ago. At this point whites position is more agressive in the centre but, but is hard to make progress as Black can retain his central strong point at e4."
17,Na3,b1a3,r1b2rk1/ppp1qppp/1bnp1n2/4p3/2BPP3/N1P2N1P/PP3PP1/R1BQR1K1 b - - 4 9,"! I think this is a good move because it starts the knight on a long journey Nc2-e3-d5, where it proves to do a very effective job."
18,Nd8,c6d8,r1bn1rk1/ppp1qppp/1b1p1n2/4p3/2BPP3/N1P2N1P/PP3PP1/R1BQR1K1 w - - 5 10,"This move anticipates white moving his knight to d5, it allows ...c6 if White's Knight moves to d5."
19,Bf1,c4f1,r1bn1rk1/ppp1qppp/1b1p1n2/4p3/3PP3/N1P2N1P/PP3PP1/R1BQRBK1 b - - 6 10,This looks like a backwards move although it has to move so the Knight can move to c4. it does have the positive that it can prove as a useful defender of the Kingside! However you'll see that Tartakower didn't have the same opinion of the bishop defending the King-side.
20,Ne8,f6e8,r1bnnrk1/ppp1qppp/1b1p4/4p3/3PP3/N1P2N1P/PP3PP1/R1BQRBK1 w - - 7 11,??This looks like a backwards move and it is inferior as you've probably guessed but its plan itself is not bad. The plan is to support e4 by ...f6.  a better plan would have been 10... exd4 11.cxd4 Nxe4.
