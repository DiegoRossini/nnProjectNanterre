7,Ng5,f3g5,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p1N1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 5 4,"A controversial advance by the knight in order to place pressure upon the f7-pawn.  As it transpires, Black does find certain contortions are needed to stay on level terms.  For instance, 4...d5 5.exd5 Nxd5?! 6.Nxf7! and Black is already fighting for his life.  Usual, then is to let the pawn go (5...Na5) after which Black gets a very active game."
8,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p1N1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 6 5,"But this move - the signature move of the Traxler Variation (a.k.a. the Wilkes-Barre) - allows White to conquer f7, and even win the h8-rook if he so chooses, with a view to obtaining a powerful counterattack."
9,Bxf7+,c4f7,r1bqk2r/pppp1Bpp/2n2n2/2b1p1N1/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"Self-restraint.  White is content with the small gain of a pawn plus disruption to the Black king.  The knight capture 5.Nxf7 Qe7 6.Nxh8 has a tendency to bring on the storm: 6...Bxf2+ and it's all on.  White can also hold back either capture for the moment by playing 5.d4, hoping a more opportune moment will occur."
10,Ke7,e8e7,r1bq3r/ppppkBpp/2n2n2/2b1p1N1/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 1 6,"The generally preferred retreat, allowing the rook to reach f8.  Instead, 5...Kf8 has been tried (against me) in order to keep open the Queen's diagonal d8-h4."
11,Bd5,f7d5,r1bq3r/ppppk1pp/2n2n2/2bBp1N1/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQ - 2 6,"One of the two usual retreats, the other being 6.Bb3.  For some reason, the books are silent on 6.Bc4, nor is it much played."
12,Rf8,h8f8,r1bq1r2/ppppk1pp/2n2n2/2bBp1N1/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 3 7,"The most usual, obviating the fork altogether at f7.  If instead, 6...h6, then 7.Nf7 Qf8? 8.Nxh8 Nxd5?? 9.Ng6+, forking K and Q.  Nor has 6...d6 much to recommend it after 7.c3! (though White might be tempted into 7.Nf7?! Qf8 8.Nxh8 Nxd5 and the knight is stranded at h8) 7...Rf8 8.d4 exd4 9.Bxc6 bxc6 10.o-o! h6 11.cxd4 Bb6 12.e5 and White has a slight edge, according to Yakov Estrin."
13,O-O,e1g1,r1bq1r2/ppppk1pp/2n2n2/2bBp1N1/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 4 7,"The most usual here.  For a while, 7.Nf3 became popular after the game Belov vs Matsukevic (1962) in which Black responded 7.(Nf3) d6 8.c3 Bg4 9.Bxc6 bxc6 10.d4 Bb6 11.Qd3 exd4 12.cxd4  Kd7 13.Be3 and White seems to have the better of it.  Nor did moving the Q to e8 help in the 1959 game Elpidinsky vs Shkurovich-Hazin: 7.Nf3 d6 8.c3 Qe8 9.d4 exd4 10.cxd4 Bb4+ 11.Nc3 Nxd5 12.exd5 Kf7+ 13.Be3 Ne7 14.Qb3 Ba5 15.0-0 is also good for White.  Much more promising for Black is: 7.Nf3 Nd5!? and if 8.Nxe5 Nxd5 9.exd5 d6 with dangerous threats.  Instead 7.Nf7 Nd5!? 8.Nxd4 Bxd4 9.0-0 Nxd5 10.exd5 and White retains the advantage according to Estrin.  After 10...Kf7 11.c3 Bc5 12.d3! ... (Not the risky 12.Qh5+ Kg8 13.Qxe5 Qh4! and Black has the initiative) 12...Kg8 13.Nd2 'Black had no compensation for his pawn' in the game Jovcic vs Sapundzhiev (1969).  However, I followed this exact line with Black in a correspondence game in about 1974-5, and went on to win with a piece, followed by a double rook sacrifice in a King hunt(unfortunately, I don't have a score of that game)."
14,d6,d7d6,r1bq1r2/ppp1k1pp/2np1n2/2bBp1N1/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 0 8,"Instead 7...h6 could transpose into the game line, but White could improve after 8.Nf3 d6 9.h3! Qe8 10.c3 with this possible continuation: 10...Qh5 11.d4 and [a] 11...Bb6 12.Be3 Nd8 13.dxe5 or [b] 11...Bxh3 12.Bxc6! bxc6 13.gxh3 - neither line looking very good for Black."
