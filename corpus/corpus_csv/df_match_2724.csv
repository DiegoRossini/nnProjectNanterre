1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

After my loss against Etienne (A-Random-Guy), Coach Ion's kind remarks on Etienne's and my summing up about when to switch from attack to defense if an attack runs out of steam certainly rings true in this particular game.  One thing is for sure, when mounting a mating attack, Glenda cannot do this on her own despite the powers she has been given.  She needs assistance.  Another example of this is my Latvian game with Coach Ion many moons ago when, although Glenda on her own managed to net a rook in Ion's pos, that was all she got and because of the concentration of force that Ion's queen together with other pieces, Henry ended up getting chased around - Glenda, who remained on h1 for the rest of the game never even got the chance to hit back - and eventually I resigned on the grounds of unavoidable mate.  Later on, Glenda did eventually end that losing streak against Ion with a perpetual - but the emphasis is, GLENDA NEEDS ASSISTANCE!  In that game Glenda had assistance from Fou Lenoir and that made all the difference.

Now, in this game, Glenda tries to attack on her own but to no effect.  She ends up being shut off from the action and Henry ends up castling into it.  Ken, my opponent then exploits that mistake by launching a powerful mating attack on Henry.  Fortunately for me, an untimely bishop check on Ken's part leads to Henry escaping to the kingside and Ken's attack runs out of steam and he eventually ends up losing both his rook and bishop and resigning on the grounds of Ruinous Loss of Material.  So, how does this happen?  Well, let's start at the beginning.  After a double king pawn opening I end up playing against the Philidor's Defense which is as ......."
