1,g4,g2g4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/6P1/8/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Grob's Attack.
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/6P1/8/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,According to Wiki (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grob%27s_Attack) 1. e5 is a significantly better try and this move opens the gate to many traps
3,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/6P1/8/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,Compounding the issue by falling further into the trap but part of me was curious to learn the dangers.
4,Bxg4,c8g4,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/6b1/8/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 3,Compounding the issue by falling further into the trap but part of me was curious to learn the dangers.
5,c4,c2c4,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2P3b1/8/PP1PPPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 3,Not a good move but white is threatening Qb3 and eventually Qa4+ along with other dangers
6,Be6,g4e6,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/4b3/3p4/2P5/8/PP1PPPBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 4,Not a good move but white is threatening Qb3 and eventually Qa4+ along with other dangers
7,Qb3,d1b3,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/4b3/3p4/2P5/1Q6/PP1PPPBP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 2 4,Attacking the b-pawn along with the light squared Bishop on the long diagonal should Black's d-pawn ever move which is fairly well forced
8,Nd7,b8d7,r2qkbnr/pppnpppp/4b3/3p4/2P5/1Q6/PP1PPPBP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 3 5,Trying to save my rook from the coming invasion by the Bishop
9,cxd5,c4d5,r2qkbnr/pppnpppp/4b3/3P4/8/1Q6/PP1PPPBP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 0 5,I'm trying to develop pieces here as best as possible forgetting about the loss of the pawn
10,Bg4,e6g4,r2qkbnr/pppnpppp/8/3P4/6b1/1Q6/PP1PPPBP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 1 6,I'm trying to develop pieces here as best as possible forgetting about the loss of the pawn
11,Qxb7,b3b7,r2qkbnr/pQpnpppp/8/3P4/6b1/8/PP1PPPBP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 0 6,I'm trying to develop pieces here as best as possible forgetting about the loss of the pawn
12,Ngf6,g8f6,r2qkb1r/pQpnpppp/5n2/3P4/6b1/8/PP1PPPBP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 1 7,I'm trying to develop pieces here as best as possible forgetting about the loss of the pawn
13,d6,d5d6,r2qkb1r/pQpnpppp/3P1n2/8/6b1/8/PP1PPPBP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 0 7,This sets up a discovered attack on the Rook at a1
14,Nb6,d7b6,r2qkb1r/pQp1pppp/1n1P1n2/8/6b1/8/PP1PPPBP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 1 8,Now I protect the Rook although at the cost of another pawn.
15,dxc7,d6c7,r2qkb1r/pQP1pppp/1n3n2/8/6b1/8/PP1PPPBP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 0 8,I'm hoping for the Queen trade at this point because I at least save my Rook and hope to pick up the pawn fairly quickly thereafter thus escaping the mess with only minor damage
16,Qc8,d8c8,r1q1kb1r/pQP1pppp/1n3n2/8/6b1/8/PP1PPPBP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 1 9,I'm hoping for the Queen trade at this point because I at least save my Rook and hope to pick up the pawn fairly quickly thereafter thus escaping the mess with only minor damage
17,Qxc8+,b7c8,r1Q1kb1r/p1P1pppp/1n3n2/8/6b1/8/PP1PPPBP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 0 9,9. Qc6+ Bd7 and Black is at least partially ok
18,Rxc8,a8c8,2r1kb1r/p1P1pppp/1n3n2/8/6b1/8/PP1PPPBP/RNB1K1NR w KQk - 0 10,While this delays my development that c-pawn must go
19,d3,d2d3,2r1kb1r/p1P1pppp/1n3n2/8/6b1/3P4/PP2PPBP/RNB1K1NR b KQk - 0 10,While this delays my development that c-pawn must go
20,Rxc7,c8c7,4kb1r/p1r1pppp/1n3n2/8/6b1/3P4/PP2PPBP/RNB1K1NR w KQk - 0 11,While this delays my development that c-pawn must go
21,Be3,c1e3,4kb1r/p1r1pppp/1n3n2/8/6b1/3PB3/PP2PPBP/RN2K1NR b KQk - 1 11,Now I'm trying to get my pieces out and make an active game for myself
22,e6,e7e6,4kb1r/p1r2ppp/1n2pn2/8/6b1/3PB3/PP2PPBP/RN2K1NR w KQk - 0 12,Now I'm trying to get my pieces out and make an active game for myself
23,Nd2,b1d2,4kb1r/p1r2ppp/1n2pn2/8/6b1/3PB3/PP1NPPBP/R3K1NR b KQk - 1 12,I'm not sure that White shouldn't try something like 12. h3 forcing Black to move about but there seems to be nothing wrong with this move
24,Bb4,f8b4,4k2r/p1r2ppp/1n2pn2/8/1b4b1/3PB3/PP1NPPBP/R3K1NR w KQk - 2 13,Giving up the right to castle rather cheaply. While the Knight is pinned Black cannot swoop in as it is well protected. I thought 13. Ngf3 Rc2 14. 0-0 Bxd2 15. Bxd2 wasn't better
25,Kd1,e1d1,4k2r/p1r2ppp/1n2pn2/8/1b4b1/3PB3/PP1NPPBP/R2K2NR b k - 3 13,Giving up the right to castle rather cheaply. While the Knight is pinned Black cannot swoop in as it is well protected. I thought 13. Ngf3 Rc2 14. 0-0 Bxd2 15. Bxd2 wasn't better
26,Nbd5,b6d5,4k2r/p1r2ppp/4pn2/3n4/1b4b1/3PB3/PP1NPPBP/R2K2NR w k - 4 14,I'd love to be rid of that dark squared Bishop and with the Queens off the board I was planning on bringing the Rook directly into play without a castle
27,Bd4,e3d4,4k2r/p1r2ppp/4pn2/3n4/1b1B2b1/3P4/PP1NPPBP/R2K2NR b k - 5 14,"Trying to get my Rooks lined up and, while it is early to centralize my King I felt like I needed as many pieces in play as possible"
28,Ke7,e8e7,7r/p1r1kppp/4pn2/3n4/1b1B2b1/3P4/PP1NPPBP/R2K2NR w - - 6 15,"Trying to get my Rooks lined up and, while it is early to centralize my King I felt like I needed as many pieces in play as possible"
29,Be5,d4e5,7r/p1r1kppp/4pn2/3nB3/1b4b1/3P4/PP1NPPBP/R2K2NR b - - 7 15,Blocking down the c-file
30,Rc6,c7c6,7r/p3kppp/2r1pn2/3nB3/1b4b1/3P4/PP1NPPBP/R2K2NR w - - 8 16,Blocking down the c-file
31,Nc4,d2c4,7r/p3kppp/2r1pn2/3nB3/1bN3b1/3P4/PP2PPBP/R2K2NR b - - 9 16,Blocking down the c-file
32,Bc5,b4c5,7r/p3kppp/2r1pn2/2bnB3/2N3b1/3P4/PP2PPBP/R2K2NR w - - 10 17,I'm trying to be as active as possible to keep White from marshalling an attack
33,Bg3,e5g3,7r/p3kppp/2r1pn2/2bn4/2N3b1/3P2B1/PP2PPBP/R2K2NR b - - 11 17,I like to avoid putting the Knight in positions like this but I thought the f4 square looked awfully choice for my Knight and this proves to be accurate
34,Nh5,f6h5,7r/p3kppp/2r1p3/2bn3n/2N3b1/3P2B1/PP2PPBP/R2K2NR w - - 12 18,I like to avoid putting the Knight in positions like this but I thought the f4 square looked awfully choice for my Knight and this proves to be accurate
