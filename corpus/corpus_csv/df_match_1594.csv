4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"This must be still theory, but I can't study any chess nor I have access to the database anymore, so I can't see what was played before. A pity. Now, the normal e6 (the Icelandic gambit itself) doesn't work since after the exchange my e pawn will stand pitifully isolated in the center, against a well developed white open e column... of course not!"

6,Nxd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3n4/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 4,"It can't be bad. My queen will stand out in the center, but she has a lot of room to fly on, some threat and a well-known plan Qa5-Qc7."
7,Bxd5,c4d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3B4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 4,"Nf3 is more dangerous because of Bg4 at once, scrambling white's kingside. This is sensible, but I overlooked a fun and dangerous trick based on Bg4!, and if fxB, Qxg2. Now, this fails to Qf3, and I lost my bishop for nothing. So it was better to overlook it! :-)"

10,e5,e7e5,rnb1kb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3qp3/8/5P2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,"This deprived my queen from e4+, that must be considered. Even Qg5 (threatening g2 again) was playable, and probably better. But I sensed that the fight for the center was important, and that my dsb was ready to pin the black knight on c3 after (if ever) d3. The Qe4+ is naive and pointless."
11,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1kb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3qp3/8/2N2P2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 6,"The second step for the queen's path to c7. Now, white has to think a little about how to develop, since moving the d pawn pins the knight. White can do well about this, but he will give tempo to black to..."

13,a3,a2a3,rnb1kb1r/ppp2ppp/8/q3p3/8/P1N2P2/1PPP2PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 7,"Note that black can't play b4, or Bxb4, since after axB, QxR, devastating white. I can even think about Bb4 now, but it has no point while the knight is defended by the two pawns. White would move the Ra1 and that will mean to retire or exchange (which I didn't want to). So bad plan."
14,c6,c7c6,rnb1kb1r/pp3ppp/2p5/q3p3/8/P1N2P2/1PPP2PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 8,"The right time for this move. Even if it seem to slow down my developement, it provides a safe square for the queen (she will be soon effectively kicked away), and stops any white's ideas of jumps with the knight soon after. My pieces, then, will develop in total harmony."
15,d3,d2d3,rnb1kb1r/pp3ppp/2p5/q3p3/8/P1NP1P2/1PP3PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 8,"Accepting Bg4 because of Bd2 solves all problems for white. Again, the threat is better than the execution. Up to now, I have white ""controlled"". He can't do much apart of the forseeable moves. Can you see the psychological advantage? (or maybe I am wrong, and black is worse! What do you think?)"
16,Be6,c8e6,rn2kb1r/pp3ppp/2p1b3/q3p3/8/P1NP1P2/1PP3PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 1 9,"Normally, I have this bishop on f4, but now it was biting on granite, so no point. I'll wait for white to castle or to kick my queen, and fight for the black diagonal."
17,Bd2,c1d2,rn2kb1r/pp3ppp/2p1b3/q3p3/8/P1NP1P2/1PPB2PP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 2 9,"White choosed for kicking the queen (Ne2 and o-o was the other option, maybe preferable. The bishop's place is e3, making it difficult for black to occupy the black diagonal (g1-a7) with Bc5. Black's pawn in e4, will stay defended at least once at all times, and every black move strenghten black's position (Nd7, Bc5, f6, and black can even castle either sides. BUT maybe this won't sustain an expert opinion. I think white can threaten black on the kingside and try to force black playing defensively based on Qe2 - f4. A very interesting game will spread."
18,Qc7,a5c7,rn2kb1r/ppq2ppp/2p1b3/4p3/8/P1NP1P2/1PPB2PP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 3 10,"!? This is necessary, since if Bc4 inmediately, b4 forks B and Q. No countertrick. If Qb6 (occupying the diagonal), white had Na5, and my queen must choose Qa6, threatening the knight and avoiding c3 (that makes the N defended by the Q), because of Qxd3. But white can dare to play c4!?, with an interesting position."
19,Nge2,g1e2,rn2kb1r/ppq2ppp/2p1b3/4p3/8/P1NP1P2/1PPBN1PP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 4 10,"? This is a mistake. White must have taken the tempo to occupy the diagonal, with Be3, now that Bb4 is not a threat anymore. This contains black's game. This way, white leaves black free to develop the more annoying way."
20,Bc5,f8c5,rn2k2r/ppq2ppp/2p1b3/2b1p3/8/P1NP1P2/1PPBN1PP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 5 11,"White can't castle. Of course, my bishop is not secure, but when it will be exchanged by the white knight, my Queen will take its place, with the same function. White can't play d4, and I can castle on an empty kingside."
21,b4,b2b4,rn2k2r/ppq2ppp/2p1b3/2b1p3/1P6/P1NP1P2/2PBN1PP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 11,"If a4, a6..."

23,Na4,c3a4,rn2k2r/ppq2ppp/1bp1b3/4p3/NP6/P2P1P2/2PBN1PP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 2 12,I just take the tempo to develop! I don't want to retake the bishop with the kinight. The pressure on the diagonal is most important because it maked difficult for white to develop coherently and attackingly. White has just one very powerful resource... can you see it?
24,Nd7,b8d7,r3k2r/ppqn1ppp/1bp1b3/4p3/NP6/P2P1P2/2PBN1PP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 3 13,I just take the tempo to develop! I don't want to retake the bishop with the kinight.

This leaves d3 unprotected, so I can think about Qd6, Bf3 (defending d3 and preparing d4...), but it didn't convinced me (if I can say so in English). Now, c5 is playable, but after b5!, the diagonal is blocked for me and again, Qd6 seems not strong enough."
26,a6,a7a6,r3k2r/1pqn1ppp/pbp1b3/4p3/NPP5/P2P1P2/3BN1PP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 14,"So I went for this one. I'll take the challenge. Go on, block the diagonal. I'll have b5."
