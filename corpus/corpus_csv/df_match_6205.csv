8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 3 5,"The only real advantage of the early retreat is it leaves black unsure of how white will setup his pieces, but black already seems equal to me."
9,Bd3,f1d3,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/4P3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 4 5,"Indeed if we look at development, black has placed three minor pieces while white has placed 2 and a pawn, but the development is far from equal.  Black's pieces are well placed where they are.  White's bishops will move.  White is getting farther behind in development.  In essence black is calling Bg5 as nothing more than bluff and bluster.  He says, ""Yes, please!  I want that diagonal.""  Should black foolishly play e6 or e5, then the move becomes powerful, but white did nothing to induce either move."

13,Bd2,g5d2,r1bqk2r/pp1pppbp/2n2np1/8/4P3/3B4/PPPB1PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 3 7,"There are some times when Fritz is excellent, but here Fritz offers, ""Black has a cramped position. Black's piece can't move: c8.""  The bishop is not free to move, but neither is a1 or h1.  The black position is very dynamic and surely that is enough compensation for a cramped bishop."
14,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp1pppbp/2n2np1/8/4P3/3B4/PPPB1PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQ - 4 8,"Fritz offers the note to white's previous move as 7. Nc3 d5.  On some level, Fritz must understand that this move wastes time and is not worth the payoff."

16,d5,d7d5,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2n2np1/3p4/4P3/2BB4/PPP2PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQ - 0 9,And black mischeiviously gives white a glimmer of hope that his plan has merit.

26,Qd8,d5d8,r1bq1rk1/4ppbp/2n2np1/p7/1pB5/2B2N2/PPPN1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 2 14,Worth the think:  14.Bb5 bxc3 15.Bxc6 cxb2! 16.Rb1 (White has no appetite for 16.Bxa8 because it invites 16...bxa1=Q! when black injects panic into the white position) and white gets at least a file for the diagonal.
27,Bxf6,c3f6,r1bq1rk1/4ppbp/2n2Bp1/p7/1pB5/5N2/PPPN1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 14,Worth the think:  14.Bb5 bxc3 15.Bxc6 cxb2! 16.Rb1 (White has no appetite for 16.Bxa8 because it invites 16...bxa1=Q! when black injects panic into the white position) and white gets at least a file for the diagonal.
