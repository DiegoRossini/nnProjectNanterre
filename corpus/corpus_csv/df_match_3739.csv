Now black has 3 main candidate moves. 14...dxe5 15.Bxc5 is easy. 14...Nxe5 15.gxf4 with a double attack on the rook and the knight. 14...fxe3 gives white a choice. A)15.Bxc6 and now black has a choice. A1)15...exd2 16.exf6 Bxf6 17.Bxa8 Bxh3(or 17...Bxb2 first) 18.Bg2 white has some advantage. A2)14...dxe5 15.Bxa8 exd2 gives black the advantage. He is getting many pawns for the exchange, as well as active pieces. By the way, there were more variations that needed to be calculated. I am just listing a few. Therefore, white needs to play B)15.exf6 Bxf6 16.Bxc6 Bxh3! 17.Bxa8 Qxa8 18.Ne4 Bxb2 with a advantage to black, but nothing winning. Just listing these few variations makes my head start really hurting:). And these were just the main lines that we needed to calculate! To calculate the variations properly, you really needed to slow down, during each half move, and ascertain ALL the new candidate moves for each side, keep track of the material properly, and avoid fainting at the same time, and much more! Certainly, black could have gotten an advantage with taking 14...fxe3. However, the resulting position is still complex. Maybe black missed the variation. That would be possible, considering the difficulty of the calculation here. Absolutely crazy position! However, this is just the beginning! Black now chooses to take up the complexity up another level(!) and plays a dubious, extremely complicated move."

In fact, I will not attempt to calculate many lines. I will just find the candidate moves for each side for each ply. Ready? Now white can play 15.gxf4,Bxc6, g4. After 15.gxf4, black has Bb7 only, as it is clearly the best move. But then there are not many tactics. As a last judgement, the h5 knight is misplaced. 16.Ne4 looks accurate. OK, but after 15.Bxc6, black can play 15...Bxh3,fxe3,. After 15...Bxh3, white can play 16.Bxa8 Qxa8 with complex position. Also, white can play 16.Nxf4 with also complex position. So many different moves at each ply. Actually, IM Lilov told me he spent almost half an hour calculating the variations in this position. Unfortunately, the position is very complex, and he made an oversight."

When you look at this move here, it seems so very simple to find this move for black. However, to tell the truth, it is very very difficult. There was no way for white to know that this was the key line when there were many other side variations that needed to be calculated. Some of them had multiple branching points at every half move, leading to dozens of variations. It is calculation at the highest level! By the way, most calculations an master makes in his games will never look anything close to this. There are usually few branching points in the simpler variations, so we can calcualte them easily. Now, the critical moment has passed, and black has a winning advantage. However, Nevednichy, the GM, is confused and blunders the advantage right back!"
