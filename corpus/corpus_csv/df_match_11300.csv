5,e3,e2e3,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P2b1/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,One assumes that White is planning to break through the centre or financhetto his dark square bishop.
6,Nf6,g8f6,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P2b1/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,Apparently the light square bishop is enough trouble to drive back one square but white does not feel he has time to persue with the Knight's pawn.  Perhaps he was concerned about the pawns being pushed so far forward at such an early point in the game and developement took priority instead.

10,e6,e7e6,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p3b/3P4/3BPN1P/PPP2PP1/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,A well planned castle.  It would seem that h3 was to provide his king with a breathing square whilst forcing black to waste a tempo retreating his bishop.  Cunning.
11,O-O,e1g1,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p3b/3P4/3BPN1P/PPP2PP1/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 6,A well planned castle.  It would seem that h3 was to provide his king with a breathing square whilst forcing black to waste a tempo retreating his bishop.  Cunning.
12,Bd6,f8d6,rn1qk2r/ppp2ppp/3bpn2/3p3b/3P4/3BPN1P/PPP2PP1/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 7,Black does not advance his bishop further as it would become vulnerable to counter attacks and the diagonal it controls is an important one.
13,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qk2r/ppp2ppp/3bpn2/3p3b/3P4/2NBPN1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 3 7,Providing a spring board for a pawn counter on the queen side and restricting Black's bishop's activity on that diagonal.  However one wonders whether White would have done better to bring his dark square bishop to protect the knight.
