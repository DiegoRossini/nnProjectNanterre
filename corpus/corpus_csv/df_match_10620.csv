1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was round 4, at which point I had 2 wins and a draw.  I felt pretty confident up to this point as I had outplayed my opponents in every game.  I was a little surprised to see 1. d4 as most everyone in the premier was playing 1. e4."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"The Nimzo-Indian, seeking to control e4 with pieces is my workhorse against 1. d4."

7,Qc2,d1c2,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PPQ1PPPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 3 4,"The Classical variation.  White's other options are 4. a3, 4. f3, 4. Nf3, 4. e3, 4. Qb3 and 4. Bg5."
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n1pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PPQ1PPPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 4 5,The most common continuation is 4...d5.  This move immediately attacks the weakened d-pawn.  This variation is known as the Milner-Barry or the Zurich.
9,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n1pn2/8/1bPP4/2N2N2/PPQ1PPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 5 5,The most flexible move.  5. e3 is too passive.
10,d6,d7d6,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2nppn2/8/1bPP4/2N2N2/PPQ1PPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 0 6,Preparing to erect a dark-squared center after the exchange on c3.
11,Bd2,c1d2,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2nppn2/8/1bPP4/2N2N2/PPQBPPPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 1 6,White wants to recapture with the Bishop as to increase pressure on e5.
12,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2nppn2/8/1bPP4/2N2N2/PPQBPPPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 2 7,"This move is a little suspect.  The standard continuation is 7. a3 Bxc3 8. Bxc3 Qe7, when White has his choice of 4 different continuations.  9. g3, 9. e3, 9. e4, or 9. b4."
13,e3,e2e3,r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2nppn2/8/1bPP4/2N1PN2/PPQB1PPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 0 7,"This move is a little suspect.  The standard continuation is 7. a3 Bxc3 8. Bxc3 Qe7, when White has his choice of 4 different continuations.  9. g3, 9. e3, 9. e4, or 9. b4."
14,Qe7,d8e7,r1b2rk1/ppp1qppp/2nppn2/8/1bPP4/2N1PN2/PPQB1PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 1 8,This is a little passive also.
15,Be2,f1e2,r1b2rk1/ppp1qppp/2nppn2/8/1bPP4/2N1PN2/PPQBBPPP/R3K2R b KQ - 2 8,This is a little passive also.
16,e5,e6e5,r1b2rk1/ppp1qppp/2np1n2/4p3/1bPP4/2N1PN2/PPQBBPPP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 9,No reason to wait.  Black should be equal here.
17,d5,d4d5,r1b2rk1/ppp1qppp/2np1n2/3Pp3/1bP5/2N1PN2/PPQBBPPP/R3K2R b KQ - 0 9,"Gaining space, but closing the center and imprisoning his light-squared bishop.  9. de Nxe5 is followed by ...b6 and ...Bb7, with a good game for black."
18,Nb8,c6b8,rnb2rk1/ppp1qppp/3p1n2/3Pp3/1bP5/2N1PN2/PPQBBPPP/R3K2R w KQ - 1 10,"Preparing to reroute the knight via a6 to c5.  I am behind in development, but there is no way for white to open the position quick enough to exploit his lead."
19,e4,e3e4,rnb2rk1/ppp1qppp/3p1n2/3Pp3/1bP1P3/2N2N2/PPQBBPPP/R3K2R b KQ - 0 10,"Looks imposing,, but this just gives me a hook on f5 and a target to take aim at."

22,Bxc3,b4c3,r1b2rk1/ppp1qppp/n2p1n2/3Pp3/2P1P3/P1b2N2/1PQBBPPP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 12,"Now the knight takes up a passive defense.  After 13 moves, Black has not only equalized, but is better."

While it is true that Black's most natural plan is to play ...Ne8 or ...Nh5 followed by ...f5 and a kingside attack, White ignores the fact that his most dynamic play will be on the queenside.  Here is trying to drum up kingside play and allows me time to target the weakened queenside.  White's king is more vulnerable on the queenside and my solid defensive formation on the kingside wont be easy to crack.  Especially with the two bishops and the knight placed passively."
28,Bd7,c8d7,r4rk1/1ppbqppp/3p1n2/p1nPp3/2P1P3/P1B5/1PQNBPPP/2KR3R w - - 2 15,"Intending ...Ba4; b3 Bd7!; followed by ...a4.  If I am allowed to exchange the a-pawn for the b-pawn, the a-file will open up for my heavy pieces and the White king will be under rapid attack."
