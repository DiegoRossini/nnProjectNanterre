I really hated to play the final move. Remohgramps is a friend, and he played this game quite well. Had he seen the checkmate and prevented it, white could probably still get a draw by chasing the black king around and looking for ways to get the white queen on a1. Or maybe not. Maybe black could tuck his king away and promote his pawn, then win with two queens to white's one. I really hoped Remohgramps would see white's little trap and play something like 43. ... Qb8, or 43. ... Ke8. Instead, he played 43. ... a1=Q??? (how often does a pawn promoting to queen get ???). Now that black had the two queens, white is faced with winning or losing - no chance of a draw now. My hand was forced, but I hated playing the move."
