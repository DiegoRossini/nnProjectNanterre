1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Another Low Draw but at least this time it is against a fellow Class A player.  This is part of a double king pawn opening mini tournament in which I have scored a disappointing 3.5 points out of 11 games so far.  Still, if you look at the oppo, including 2 Experts, it may be a little more understandable.  This game becomes the Exchange Variation of the Ruy Lopez.  A bishop pin on g4 leads to a sac opening up the h column to the Wicked Witch of the West supported by a rook on h8.  Where there is that line up, look out for Old Matey!  Here is how the story unfolds."
