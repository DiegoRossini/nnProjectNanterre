4,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"Kaufman chooses to play a Queen's Gambit with colors reversed, in response."

7,Bxb8,f4b8,rBbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3p4/3p4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"The immediate QxP would give Alekhine 3 developed pieces to Kaufman's 0, but he chooses to postpone it."
8,Rxb8,a8b8,1rbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3p4/3p4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQk - 0 5,Forced.

10,b6,b7b6,1rbqkbnr/p3pppp/1p6/3p4/3Q4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN2KB1R w KQk - 0 6,"The alternatives were ...P-QR3 or ...R-R1, neither of which appears significantly better than the text move."
11,e4,e2e4,1rbqkbnr/p3pppp/1p6/3p4/3QP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN2KB1R b KQk - 0 6,"Alekhine, with his advantage in development, wishes to open the board up further."

Alekhine threatens 9 N-B6 ch forking K and QR, and 9 NxP ch forking K and KR. 8...K-K1 is countered by 9 B-N5 ch forcing the King back to Q1 and allowing the ""shakrukh"". [Interposing with 9...B-Q2 doesn't help, as 10 BxB ch still forces the K back to Q1.] Well played by Alekhine."
