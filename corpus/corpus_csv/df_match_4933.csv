1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Another open challenge, this is one example of how important a bishop on a nice diagonal can be."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Queen's gambit, one of my preferred openings as white"
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Queen's gambit, one of my preferred openings as white"
4,dxc4,d5c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2pP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Accepted, in my games playing this I haven't seen it accepted that often."
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2pP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"I'm not keen on this response from black though I think it's still within book, I don't like that it restricts the knight"
6,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/2pP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"I'm not keen on this response from black though I think it's still within book, I don't like that it restricts the knight"
7,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/2pP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,This is a bit more passive than my usual Nc3 or e4 but I don't think its bad
8,b5,b7b5,rnbqkbnr/p3pppp/2p5/1p6/2pP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,Again I am not keen on this move as it renders blacks lsb pretty useless.
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/p3pppp/2p5/1p6/2pP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,Again I am not keen on this move as it renders blacks lsb pretty useless.
10,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/p4ppp/2p1p3/1p6/2pP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,Again I am not keen on this move as it renders blacks lsb pretty useless.
11,b3,b2b3,rnbqkbnr/p4ppp/2p1p3/1p6/2pP4/1PN1PN2/P4PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,This move took us out of the Gameknot database. I wanted to break up the black pawn structure a little and give my dsb access to b2 and a3 as black was now going to have to castle king side.
12,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk1nr/p4ppp/2p1p3/1p6/1bpP4/1PN1PN2/P4PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,This move from black pretty much forces me to make a move I wanted to make anyway i.e. Bb2
13,Bb2,c1b2,rnbqk1nr/p4ppp/2p1p3/1p6/1bpP4/1PN1PN2/PB3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 2 7,"This bishop stays on this lovely diagonal for the rest of the game. Note that although the diagonal is blocked by a couple of pawns, there are no black pawns to stop my pawn on d4 advancing and opening the diagonal further. This proves significant later in the game as we will see."
14,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqk2r/p4ppp/2p1pn2/1p6/1bpP4/1PN1PN2/PB3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 3 8,regains the gambitted pawn and gives my lsb a little more room to maneouvre
15,bxc4,b3c4,rnbqk2r/p4ppp/2p1pn2/1p6/1bPP4/2N1PN2/PB3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,regains the gambitted pawn and gives my lsb a little more room to maneouvre
16,a6,a7a6,rnbqk2r/5ppp/p1p1pn2/1p6/1bPP4/2N1PN2/PB3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 9,"As well as shifting the bishop, my queen now has an eye on the a2-g1 diagonal"
17,Qb3,d1b3,rnbqk2r/5ppp/p1p1pn2/1p6/1bPP4/1QN1PN2/PB3PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 1 9,"As well as shifting the bishop, my queen now has an eye on the a2-g1 diagonal"
18,Qe7,d8e7,rnb1k2r/4qppp/p1p1pn2/1p6/1bPP4/1QN1PN2/PB3PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 2 10,"Doesn't really defend the bishop as I have the option of c5, though I am not going to take that option. I'd like to keep my pawn on c4 but won't complain if bxc4 as then Bxc4 leaves my queen and bishop lined up with where I am expecting the black king to soon be i.e. on g8 after castling"
19,a3,a2a3,rnb1k2r/4qppp/p1p1pn2/1p6/1bPP4/PQN1PN2/1B3PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 10,"Preparing to castle but also commanding the diagonal b1-h7, again attacking the area around where the black king will be after he castles."

23,O-O,e1g1,r1b1k2r/3nqppp/p1p1pn2/bp6/2PP4/PQNBPN2/1B3PPP/R4RK1 b kq - 4 12,All according to plan. note that the black dsb is now out of place and doesn't really have any good options. In addition the black lsb can only move to b7

25,Ng5,f3g5,r1b2rk1/3nqppp/p1p1pn2/bp4N1/2PP4/PQNBP3/1B3PPP/R4RK1 b - - 6 13,This was to encourage black to create weaknesses in his pawns around his king
26,h6,h7h6,r1b2rk1/3nqpp1/p1p1pn1p/bp4N1/2PP4/PQNBP3/1B3PPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 14,and he obliges.
27,Nge4,g5e4,r1b2rk1/3nqpp1/p1p1pn1p/bp6/2PPN3/PQNBP3/1B3PPP/R4RK1 b - - 1 14,"I think I would have taken with the knight here, however I think black is planning c5, opening the diagonal for his lsb"
28,Bb7,c8b7,r4rk1/1b1nqpp1/p1p1pn1p/bp6/2PPN3/PQNBP3/1B3PPP/R4RK1 w - - 2 15,"I think I would have taken with the knight here, however I think black is planning c5, opening the diagonal for his lsb"

32,cxb5,c6b5,r4rk1/1b1n1pp1/p3pq1p/bp6/3P4/PQNBP3/1B3PPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 17,"I think this is a poor move from black, to me Bxd5 looks much stronger. With that pawn where it is blacks lsb is obstructed"
33,d5,d4d5,r4rk1/1b1n1pp1/p3pq1p/bp1P4/8/PQNBP3/1B3PPP/R4RK1 b - - 0 17,"I think this is a poor move from black, to me Bxd5 looks much stronger. With that pawn where it is blacks lsb is obstructed"
