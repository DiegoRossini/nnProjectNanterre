The Dragon isn't in my regular repertoire but after this experience I might give it a future look, my results with it were quite satisfactory. And on the whole, the defense isn't really a defense, it's more of a full-blown attack with Black."

It has overshadowed the old main line, the Yugoslav attack, in modern practice and for good reason.

The c-file is a little less useful for the attack than the b-file. Combined with a possible pawn on c4, White will have more trouble defending b2, compared to c2.
