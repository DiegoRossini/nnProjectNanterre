1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi all! Just a quick, spirited blitz game. As usual, open files and energetic piece deployment are the order of the day. Enjoy!"
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"?! The Latvian Gambit. Black trades material (sometimes quite a lot of it) for open lines on the kingside. It's quite dubious and basically never seen in master play, but can be strong against unprepared opponents--and in blitz, everyone considers everyone else unprepared!"
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"?! The Latvian Gambit. Black trades material (sometimes quite a lot of it) for open lines on the kingside. It's quite dubious and basically never seen in master play, but can be strong against unprepared opponents--and in blitz, everyone considers everyone else unprepared!"

6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/2n5/4pP2/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,3...e4 is more common.
7,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/2n5/4pP2/2B5/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 4,Gaining space for development with tempo.

11,Bb5,c4b5,r1bqkb1r/ppp3pp/2n2n2/1B1ppP2/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 6,"The e-file, and the e-pawn in general, will be vulnerable until the BK can vacate it, usually to the queenside. Opposite-flank castling tends to favor whichever side has more midgame attacking possibilities, and with the half-open f file, the situation looks like it would favor Black at the moment (as it very often does in this opening)."

14,Bxf5,c8f5,r2qk2r/ppp3pp/2nb1n2/1B1ppb2/8/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,"More pins on the Black Knights. Development is just about even, though White is playing more aggressively whereas Black has a better central presence, but more threats to respond to. I think 8.Bxc6 was worth a look though; opening up Black's queenside."
15,Bg5,c1g5,r2qk2r/ppp3pp/2nb1n2/1B1ppbB1/8/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 1 8,"More pins on the Black Knights.

16,Qd7,d8d7,r3k2r/pppq2pp/2nb1n2/1B1ppbB1/8/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 2 9,"Unpinning one Knight momentarily, though it still can't really go anywhere if Black wants to castle queenside. This move also has the advantage of defending the Knight that needs defending--now White can no longer break open the BK's fortress with Bxc6."
17,Re1,f1e1,r3k2r/pppq2pp/2nb1n2/1B1ppbB1/8/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QR1K1 b kq - 3 9,Allowing White to win the e5 pawn if he desires and setting up the desirable opposite-wings castling situation.
18,O-O-O,e8c8,2kr3r/pppq2pp/2nb1n2/1B1ppbB1/8/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QR1K1 w - - 4 10,Allowing White to win the e5 pawn if he desires and setting up the desirable opposite-wings castling situation.
19,Nc3,b1c3,2kr3r/pppq2pp/2nb1n2/1B1ppbB1/8/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 b - - 5 10,Wisely (I believe) choosing to continue his development instead of 10.Nxe5 etc.
20,Rde8,d8e8,2k1r2r/pppq2pp/2nb1n2/1B1ppbB1/8/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 w - - 6 11,"?! Sacrificing the d-pawn for development and general center control. This also unpins the Nf6, and leaves the Rh8 free to relocate to the f file or whatever other file needs its presence in the forthcoming attack on the WK."
21,Bxf6,g5f6,2k1r2r/pppq2pp/2nb1B2/1B1ppb2/8/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 b - - 0 11,White accepts the proffered pawn.

23,Bxg7,f6g7,2k1r2r/pppq2Bp/2nb4/1B2pb2/3p4/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 b - - 0 12,"I think it would have been better to just move the Bishop back to g5, rather than opening the g-file for Black's heavy pieces."
24,Qxg7,d7g7,2k1r2r/ppp3qp/2nb4/1B2pb2/3p4/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 w - - 0 13,"Let's take a second to analyze. Black has the bishop-pair (though his DSB is pretty worthless at the moment) and some beautiful open lines against the WK. His center is decent and he has better activity, but he'll have trouble in an endgame due to his worse pawns. White, on the other hand, lags in development but has a solid position and a very strong Knight at e4. His other, more lackluster pieces can also be quickly activated by initiating a queenside attack. I'd give Black a very slight edge here, but only if he can convert his activity quickly."
25,Bxc6,b5c6,2k1r2r/ppp3qp/2Bb4/4pb2/3p4/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 b - - 0 13,"Let's take a second to analyze.

28,Bh3,f5h3,2k1r2r/p1p3qp/2pb4/4p3/3pN3/3P1N1b/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 w - - 2 15,"? A few moments after this move, I decided it was probably a mistake. It's intended to provoke 15.g3, but 15.Ng3 is a far superior way to eliminate the threat; forcing Black to move the Bishop again and clearing e4 for a Queen or Rook. I'm not sure what the correct move for Black was in this situation--14...Rhg8 15.Ng3 e4 looks interesting--but I'm pretty sure the text is inferior."
29,Nxd6+,e4d6,2k1r2r/p1p3qp/2pN4/4p3/3p4/3P1N1b/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 b - - 0 15,"? Not only trading a good Knight for a bad Bishop, but also forcing his own hand as to the response to the Kingside threat. As I said above, 15.Ng3 was much better, allowing pressure on the backwards e5 pawn and gaining tempo. This move is where it all goes south for White."
30,cxd6,c7d6,2k1r2r/p5qp/2pp4/4p3/3p4/3P1N1b/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 w - - 0 16,"Tying the Queen to the defense of the Knight, and putting indirect pressure on the very weak f2 pawn. This also threatens to win material outright with ...Bg4! White's choice to trade off his Knight has left him struggling to find enough material to defend against Black's onslaught down the open files."

33,Nh4,f3h4,2k2r1r/p5qp/2pp4/4p3/3p3N/3P2Pb/PPP2P1P/R2QR1K1 b - - 2 17,"Basically forced, although 17.Nd2 was worth a look, aiming for the e4 outpost."
