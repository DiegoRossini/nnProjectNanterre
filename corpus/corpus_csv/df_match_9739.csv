1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game comes from a mini-tournament that I created.
The positions that came out of the games between tag1153 and I were all very interesting, and I will be annotating both of our games.
I hope to annotate games from this tournament that don't involve me, so watch for them!

And as always, if you see any errors, in logic or in spelling, don't hesitate to contact me!"

10,e6,e7e6,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/5b2/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,Black's Bishops are now ready to criss-cross White's position with pins. White should seriously consider playing a3 to cut down Black's dark-squared Bishop's scope.
11,Nf3,g1f3,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/5b2/3P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,There's the first pin.

It's not going to lead any mating attacks right away, but it controls the center and allows Black to play ...c5 or ...e5 later. Coupled with a Knight on f6, Black has a strong grip on the center."
14,Nd7,b8d7,r2qk1nr/pp1n1ppp/2p1p3/5b2/1b1P4/2N2N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 4 8,"This Knight is surprisingly strong here.

So far, Black is doing a good job of nurturing his advantage into something larger. Black is slowly placing a stranglehold on the center, and leaving White cramped. Black can play ...b5 whenever he wants, or even Nb6, which adds support to the future idea of blockading the d-pawn."
16,Ngf6,g8f6,r2qk2r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/5b2/1bBP4/2N2N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 6 9,"White needs to gain space and get rid of the pin. If he waits around much longer, Black will start taking aim at his favorite targets and White will have to keep making less than satisfactory moves like Bc4."

This way Black keeps tension in the center, and can continue to nurture his small advantage (at 9. a3 Fritz estimates Black's advantage as about 1/10 of a pawn but after ...Bxc3 at 0)."

This on was just to hold on to his precious Bishop pair. Of course, there's no point in ruining your position to save an intangible advantage like that."
