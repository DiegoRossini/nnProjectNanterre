1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"My opponent played well, but in the end played for a draw when a win was inevitable for White in a R&K vs. K ending.  The strategy will be explained when we get down to R&K vs. K.
As a B/C player, I stick to a few openings, only experimenting when playing against players that I know I dominate.  Here, I chose my standard Scandinavian.  The idea is to challenge White from the very first move."

5,Bb5+,f1b5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/1B1P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 3,White develops with check.  It is a book move.
6,Bd7,c8d7,rn1qkb1r/pppbpppp/5n2/1B1P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 3 4,"This, though, is bad.  White has made two moves with a piece that is now about to vanish from play.  A waste of time.  After Black retakes, he'll have two pieces developed to White's none."

8,Nbxd7,b8d7,r2qkb1r/pppnpppp/5n2/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,I'm pretty sure a master would find fault with these moves.  But Black is wanting to recapture the piece and control the center.  Black also worries a bit about getting castled.

12,Nbxd5,b6d5,r2qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3n4/8/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 7,Black makes this move to give his opponent an ugly pawn formation.  The isolated a pawn and the doubled c pawns are liabilities that can provide dividends in the end game.
