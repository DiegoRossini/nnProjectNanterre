It will not damage white, but he'd have to play defensively. So I'd suggest Nxd4 instead. Of course, it lets the way open for e5-d5 from black's side."

I though on f5, hoping in exf6, and the chanche to move my e pawn, even sacrifying it for the sake of activating my lsb. But I didn't dare: on a blitz, it was too risky. g7-Ba6 was another plan, but it only aimed to getting along, nothing more."

30,b5,b7b5,r1b1k2r/4bp2/p1n1p2p/qp1pP1p1/3P4/P1NB1N1P/1P1Q1PP1/2R2RK1 w kq - 0 16,?? I overlooked here a tactic I would have certainly seen being the white player: Nc6 is undefended after Nxb5 or Nxd5.
