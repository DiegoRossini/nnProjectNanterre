1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Hello everybody...This is a game that i played with a mate from Australia!!! This was our third game and i won the previous two... Well his rating is around 950 and mine is around 1420...But a huge mistake of mine showed that he's gonna win... Well i started with e4.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,He played e5..
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Opening my knight.
4,b6,b7b6,rnbqkbnr/p1pp1ppp/1p6/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,Well he played b6 which was quite worthless i think.
5,Nxe5,f3e5,rnbqkbnr/p1pp1ppp/1p6/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,So i took his e5 pawn.
6,f6,f7f6,rnbqkbnr/p1pp2pp/1p3p2/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,f6 was not the greatest defence..
7,Nf3,e5f3,rnbqkbnr/p1pp2pp/1p3p2/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,So i put it  back.
8,Nh6,g8h6,rnbqkb1r/p1pp2pp/1p3p1n/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,He opened his knight in a awkard square instead of doing something different to develop his pieces in better squares.
9,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkb1r/p1pp2pp/1p3p1n/8/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 5,I played typical with my bishop..
10,c6,c7c6,rnbqkb1r/p2p2pp/1pp2p1n/8/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,c6 he played. I think Bc5 would be better...
11,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/p2p2pp/1pp2p1n/8/2BPP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,So i tried to take the space in the centre..
12,Ba6,c8a6,rn1qkb1r/p2p2pp/bpp2p1n/8/2BPP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 7,He wanted to exchange our bishops...
13,Bxa6,c4a6,rn1qkb1r/p2p2pp/Bpp2p1n/8/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,So i took it...
14,Nxa6,b8a6,r2qkb1r/p2p2pp/npp2p1n/8/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,And he took mine..Still he's quite back in development.
15,Nc3,b1c3,r2qkb1r/p2p2pp/npp2p1n/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 8,I opened the other knight as well.
16,f5,f6f5,r2qkb1r/p2p2pp/npp4n/5p2/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,f5 is quite risky i think.
17,e5,e4e5,r2qkb1r/p2p2pp/npp4n/4Pp2/3P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 9,But i replied with e5 instead of taking the pawn.
18,Bb4,f8b4,r2qk2r/p2p2pp/npp4n/4Pp2/1b1P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 10,Now he's pushing my knight.
19,Bg5,c1g5,r2qk2r/p2p2pp/npp4n/4PpB1/1b1P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 2 10,And i pushing his queen..
20,Qc7,d8c7,r3k2r/p1qp2pp/npp4n/4PpB1/1b1P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 3 11,Protection..
