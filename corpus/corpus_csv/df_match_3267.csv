1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"My opponent is White from The Team Scotland Forever. I play the Highland Bagpipes and my favorite to play is ""Flower of Scotland"" along with ""Scotland the Brave"" and ""Mist Covered Mountains.""
My esteemed opponent uses kmcl as his monicker; but like my own monicker we have reasons to choose a monicker when playing in GK!
Kmcl is better known as Ken McLean. He is from the Isle of Islay in the United Kingdom. He is 55 and I am 54 (until I go 55 on the 17th of December).  Go to Ken's Player profile and see him across a board of chess and the pint of the best! 

Ken opens e4 according to Scotland the Brave! E4 is my preference for being bold and to the point. It is also brave because who ever is across the board has the Ruy or Sicilian or French or Alekhine's or Caro-Kann or others to respond. E4 is brave because it means knowing how to respond to ALL of the above for success. 

I like Ken and feel with his history and profile we are of kin. I like him just by looking at his profile. I review his history. 
In the review I feel I can use my favorite Black Defense against e4 White Open: The Caro-Kann (which I learned in Seminary after playing against a blind seminarian who used it against me! note: pay attention to the opposition's defense against YOUR favorite open--I did and learned more from that game than most games I've played. And my opponent was BLIND)."
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"This seems such an insignificant move in response to the e4 open. I had not really encountered it before and when this happened to me I thought my blind seminarian was perhaps behind the grand Sicilian and the vaunted French Defense and the common slow Ruy Lopez.  I felt sorry for him after he made that move in seminary but now I know why the Blind Man knew some things I needed to learn; mainly, the Caro-Kann Defense. 
I am not blind and move Caro-Kann."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Expected.
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,The usual progression for Black.
5,Nd2,b1d2,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3PP3/8/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,Ken is using a slightly different response here but in the end the Caro is simple and well defined to deal with contingency problems.
6,dxe4,d5e4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/3Pp3/8/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Just take the pawn as the Caro-Kann sets up for. 
I just follow the simple rules in Caro-Kann. No complications here at all."
7,Nxe4,d2e4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/3PN3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,Expected.
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/8/3PN3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,This is one of a few branches of Caro-Kann.
9,Nxf6+,e4f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2N2/8/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,A trade. Which pawn should I stack?
10,exf6,e7f6,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p2p2/8/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"I stack AWAY from the center. Toward the center has less freedom.  The Caro is a freeing defense with many branches of opportunity; plus, you will readily foresee if you are in trouble and you will have the means to respond rapidly. 
I guess this is why the blind man (who introduced me to it) liked it. The year we played this game was in 1984!"
11,c3,c2c3,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p2p2/8/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,White has to defend and block a diagonal and horizontal against his King.
12,Bd6,f8d6,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/2pb1p2/8/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 7,It's a safe time to be safe with my King. Bobby Fischer's first look on any chessboard was to the safety of his King. In Caro-Kann you can develop either way to 0-0 or 0-0-0 depending upon the development. Oftentimes when it is time to castle a Caro-Kann just decides which side to castle. Here it is obvious to 0-0.
13,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/2pb1p2/8/3P4/2PB4/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 2 7,White could have done any number of moves.  His infantry is set up well.
14,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/2pb1p2/8/3P4/2PB4/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQ - 3 8,I fear the Infantry more than the pieces unless the piece is a Queen!
15,Qc2,d1c2,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/2pb1p2/8/3P4/2PB4/PPQ2PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQ - 4 8,"There she goes to send a bishop into a nice threat. 
Well, she couldn't just sit there to get pinned behind a 3 point piece. White can't keep the King where he is."
16,g6,g7g6,rnbq1rk1/pp3p1p/2pb1pp1/8/3P4/2PB4/PPQ2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQ - 0 9,To alleviate the threat by the doubled Queen/Bishop on h7.
17,h4,h2h4,rnbq1rk1/pp3p1p/2pb1pp1/8/3P3P/2PB4/PPQ2PP1/R1B1K1NR b KQ - 0 9,A counter threat!
18,c5,c6c5,rnbq1rk1/pp3p1p/3b1pp1/2p5/3P3P/2PB4/PPQ2PP1/R1B1K1NR w KQ - 0 10,"I'll wait for White to organize an attack on my ensconced King and try to open back rank pieces to get into action on the Q side...
Remember; the chess board can be divided into two fields of hostile fire. Just cut the line vertically to divide the Q side and the K side.  Investigate timing and threats on either side individually from either side. Then look at timing...."
19,Be3,c1e3,rnbq1rk1/pp3p1p/3b1pp1/2p5/3P3P/2PBB3/PPQ2PP1/R3K1NR b KQ - 1 10,"White elevates (ordains) the bishop to keep his file, defend the IN Black (LIGHT INFANTRY) attack, And (AND) clears the way for 0-0-0! Scotland Forever is Brave and Bold! I like Ken even MORE!"
20,cxd4,c5d4,rnbq1rk1/pp3p1p/3b1pp1/8/3p3P/2PBB3/PPQ2PP1/R3K1NR w KQ - 0 11,"I am bold and brave to as Scotland! I will not retreat! Especially with my BAGPIPES playing behind the INFANTRY to engage the Enemy! 
Ever hear the Highland Bagpipes in Battle? They make the IN inspired to be Bold and Brave. The Pipes are sending them into ACTION at the cost of life limb sorrow suffering and what ever else is associated with being Bold and Brave. 
You either Love the Pipes or you Hate them.  I love them!"
