1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is the French Defence. Few Grandmasters play it regularly, but at amateur level, it is a great opening. The strategic ideas are simple if you known them. In many variations, the position becomes closed, which might not be such a good idea against a weaker opponent."

3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,White plays the traditional line so far.
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,White plays the traditional line so far.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,White plays the traditional line so far.
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,White plays the traditional line so far.
7,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p2B1/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 3 4,White plays the traditional line so far.
8,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p2B1/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 4 5,But now comes the big surprise! More common is 5. e5 Nd7 and 6. Bxe7 Qxe7 7. f4 O-O or the gambit line 6. h4 Bxg5 7. hxg5 Qxg5. White is giving up the bishop pair for nothing.
9,Bxf6,g5f6,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pB2/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,But now comes the big surprise! More common is 5. e5 Nd7 and 6. Bxe7 Qxe7 7. f4 O-O or the gambit line 6. h4 Bxg5 7. hxg5 Qxg5. White is giving up the bishop pair for nothing.
10,Bxf6,e7f6,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pb2/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"Here I actually thought about 5...gxf6 increasing control of the centre and opening up the g-file for the rook, but 6. exd5 exd5 looks too ugly."
11,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pb2/3p4/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,This is fine. After 6. e5 I had planned 6...Bg5 and then if 7. Nf3 Bh6.
12,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/4pb2/3p4/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 2 7,"Keeping it simple. I cannot do anything to prevent e5 kicking the bishop back. 6...dxe4 7. Nxe4 is not any better. Since I probably will castle kingside anyway, this is the least commiting developing move."
13,e5,e4e5,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/4pb2/3pP3/3P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 7,Here it comes!
14,Be7,f6e7,rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 1 8,"And this is practically forced, since I do not want to lose my better bishop."
15,Bd3,f1d3,rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 2 8,"This is logical and looks a bit intimidating, but as far as my bishop protects g5, there are no nasty sacrifices beginning with Bxh7+."
16,Nd7,b8d7,r1bq1rk1/pppnbppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 3 9,"I want to play the thematic break move c5 at some point, so Nc6 would be wrong. In addition, I might need the knight's support on the kingside."
17,O-O,e1g1,r1bq1rk1/pppnbppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 4 9,Still simple developing moves.
18,c5,c7c5,r1bq1rk1/pp1nbppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 10,Now I take advantage of the fact that White cannot protect d4 with a pawn. This will seriously undermine White's pawn centre. This is also the move that any French player knows by heart.
19,Ne2,c3e2,r1bq1rk1/pp1nbppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/3B1N2/PPP1NPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 10,Over-protecting d4 and making c3 possible.
20,cxd4,c5d4,r1bq1rk1/pp1nbppp/4p3/3pP3/3p4/3B1N2/PPP1NPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 11,"I take before it is too late. Usually Black wants to keep the tension in the centre as long as possible, but now c3, protecting d4, was the strategic threat."
21,Nexd4,e2d4,r1bq1rk1/pp1nbppp/4p3/3pP3/3N4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 11,Forced.
22,a6,a7a6,r1bq1rk1/1p1nbppp/p3p3/3pP3/3N4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 12,"This was probably not strictly necessary, but I wanted to rule out the possibility of Nd4-b5-d6 manouver."
23,Re1,f1e1,r1bq1rk1/1p1nbppp/p3p3/3pP3/3N4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 b - - 1 12,"At the moment, the rook is only protecting the e-pawn. Later, if I want to play the other break move f6, White will exchange at f6, after which the rook will aim at the e6-pawn. Combined with the knight on d4, this practically prevents the f6-idea."
24,Qb6,d8b6,r1b2rk1/1p1nbppp/pq2p3/3pP3/3N4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 w - - 2 13,"Since I cannot easily develop other pieces, the queen might do something useful and give room for the rook on the back rank."
25,Rb1,a1b1,r1b2rk1/1p1nbppp/pq2p3/3pP3/3N4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/1R1QR1K1 b - - 3 13,Simple and effective.
26,Nc5,d7c5,r1b2rk1/1p2bppp/pq2p3/2npP3/3N4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/1R1QR1K1 w - - 4 14,"Since there is no hope of getting rid of the e5-pawn, the knight does not have to pressure that square. Hitting the strong-looking bishop is the idea here. White either retreats the bishop or allows it to be exchanged with the knight."
