4,f6,f7f6,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"A mistake by Black. White may take the pawn with 3. Nxe5 because retaking with 3. ... fxe5 would result in 4. Qh5+ g6 5. Qxe5+ Qe7 6. Qxh8 or an attack after 4. ... Ke7 5. Qxe5+ Kf7 6. Bc4+, with the rest of White's pieces coming out over time.
2. ... d5 is the best move. There are quite a few other moves, but, in the end, the only chance for Black after White plays 3. Nxe5 that does not lose instantly is 3. ... Qe7, but White has a big advantage after 4. Nf3 Qxe4+ 5. Be2 because of his huge lead in development."
