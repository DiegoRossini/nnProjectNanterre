1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone - nice just to write about a win for a change.  I was playing against a guy called Andy who had a similar rating to myself.  Andy played very well but somehow I managed to get a rook onto his second rank and that piggish rook made slop of one of his pawns and eventually more and more material dropped, until I was able to crown my a pawn.  Andy resigned on the grounds of ruinous loss of material but Freddy, who looked at this game said I had a mate in 3 - more on that later.  Anyhow - I face the Sicilian and I play an unusual 3rd move, Bc4 instead of the standard pawn exchange on d4."
