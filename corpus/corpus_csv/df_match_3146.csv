It appears at a glance that Black has guarded against White's threats and safely escaped the pin, but this actually does lose a pawn: 9.Bxf6 gxf6 10.Nxd4! where Black cannot take the Bishop after all: 10...Qxb5?? 11.Nc7+ wins the Queen."
15,Nc3,b1c3,r2qkb1r/pp1b1ppp/2n2n2/1B1pp1B1/8/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 5 8,"? Not as strong as it looks.

18,gxf6,g7f6,r3kb1r/pp1b1p1p/1qn2p2/1B1pp3/8/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 10,"? This move is meant to give an escape space to the LSB (on a2) and foreshadow a queenside attack, but it really just doesn't get much done. Best was 10.Nxd5, as I mentioned above."
