1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

In this game I was the exchange and a pawn up.  You would think that it would have been a gift from heaven from Freddy, wouldn't you?  A real chance for me to get that elusive victory against Expert opposition and earn myself the username TheBlackQueen.  The reality was different.  Passivitis set in and allowed Freddy to mass all his pieces around Henry.  My own pieces were fairly close to Henry but were very poorly co-ordinated in defense.  When playing Freddy and Ion I am sometimes caught between two stools, to be aggressive prematurely - i.e. to use Glenda as a Lone Wolf or to dig in and become passive and hopefully ride out the storm.  I tried to get aggressive with Freddy and put Glenda on a4, preparing a possibility of a queenside mating attack.  Unfortunately this move was a waste of tempo and Glenda would have been better served on h1 to enable Henry to get sanctuary on the queenside and to stop the Wicked Witch and her henchmen pouring in via the kingside.  I will let you, the Inquest Jury decide how I should have prevented this invasion and converted my material advantage to victory.  But before you decide, here is how the action unfolded."

So, four pieces were enough to weave a mating net around Henry.  Oh well, there will always be another game and in fact I am currently playing him as white.  At least until the outcome of that game, TheBlackQueen must wait."
