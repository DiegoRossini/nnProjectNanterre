The threat on White's knight is not intimidating, for instance. Perhaps g7 is worthy of consideration, and White will consider Qd5 to which there are clear answers.  Also worthy of consideration is Qe7, whereupon White will have to castle.  [Note, Black's knight has lost a flight square, Black's two bishops have yet to move, both hemming in Black's rooks. In contrast, White can quickly bring at least one rook into play. etc. etc.]"

This move alone perhaps consigns Black to hoping for a draw.  Compared to White, Black is under-developed, and so long as White's king sticks to black squares [Black's white square bishop can otherwise enter the game without cost, whereas his other bishop has no part to play for now] Black will run out of checks. The White king will be chased to the 3rd rank and onto the Queen's side, where he finds sanctuary behind White's developed pieces. The remaining White knight undoes the sequence of checks, and covers several very important squares. White's defence (and attack) comprise entirely in maintaining the initiative from this point on."

That said, Black's position is unwelcome and I'm unsure if there is a very satisfactory reply. Perhaps Kd8 right away is best, moving off the dangerous e-file. Even so, there are still some unwelcome features -- for example Black very much wants to use the a1h8 diagonal to attack White's King. In the text, Black next plays Ke7, though he may have done so without delay here."
