Bg4 ? I dontlike it too much since it gives him time to develope his Bishop to e2 and at the same time he will be ready to castle
Lets prepare my castle with g6"

a pawn on c5 will be nice ,,, and a bishop on b7 will also be nice- that means it's time for b6!"

I'm not too worried about that since my king is well protected 
so lets go on with the plan Bb7"

on the other end it gives me time to strenghten my pawn structure even more in the queen side with a6

I'll block with my Bishop
Bc6"

now I think d4 will be a good idea 
problem is that it will create an isolated d pawn 
how about Rg5 ... 
then d4 in the next move will gain tempo with the threat Rxg2+ 
if he'll see that and paly e4 then I will play d4 and lock his Bishop on b2"
