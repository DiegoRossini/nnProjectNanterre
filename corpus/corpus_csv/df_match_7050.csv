1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"Hi everyone!

As you are no doubt aware, I have been falling victim to several pin motifs lately.  However, I do remember that I did take full advantage of a pin in this game.  This is against my buddy Steve.  Steve has come on really well over the past year or so and has got his rating up from the 1500s to the mid-high 1700s and has floored me with a couple of overload tactics in a couple of my games, and as black in Dynamic_dv's Training Tournament broke through my Joblock with disastrous results for me - so I did get a little revenge here!  Steve starts off with the Reti Opening which is 1. Nf3."
