1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"! This was a huge surprise for me, because my opponent played exclusively 1.d4 in all the games I could find. Now I pretty much knew that this was prepared for me, while my own preparations were completely futile. It is worth noting that my opponent was a 2200 ELO player 7 years ago, but his rating gradually slipped due to lack of competitive playing (it is hard to defend the rating if you are not playing regularly). I know him as a strong positional player, but also pretty good tactically - certainly a respectable opponent."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I wasn't too worried though - I have been playing the Sicilian for 11 years so I have grown quite familiar with it and I have a solid repertoire for most of White systems. Besides, I know which of my games are available in databases, so I know how to avoid previous tricky positions :)"
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"This is the beginning of Grand Prix Attack, my favourite variation. I am scoring very heavily against this system due to the fact that it is usually employed against me by weaker players, who play 'schematically' and tend to make small tactical mistakes in the middlegame."
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"This is the beginning of Grand Prix Attack, my favourite variation.

6,a6,a7a6,rnbqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p3p3/2p5/4PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Recently I started playing this move instead of my previous favourite 3...d5, because it stops early exchanges via Bb5. This is probably what my opponent had primarily prepared for (judging from the developments in the opening)."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p3p3/2p5/4PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"!? This is an interesting move - White switches to open Sicilian lines. Usually people play d3, g3, Bg2, 0-0 etc. with standard GPA play."
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p1n1p3/2p5/4PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,"!? This is an interesting move - White switches to open Sicilian lines. Usually people play d3, g3, Bg2, 0-0 etc. with standard GPA play."
9,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p1n1p3/2p5/3PPP2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"!? This is an interesting move - White switches to open Sicilian lines. Usually people play d3, g3, Bg2, 0-0 etc. with standard GPA play."
10,cxd4,c5d4,r1bqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p1n1p3/8/3pPP2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"This move defines Black's opening intentions - I am proposing mainline classical Scheveningen. I used to play a lot of these, but not recently - it seems that it has gone out of fashion, most likely due to Kasparov's efforts. White can still castle long, but this is slightly more risky and I felt that this is not likely considering my opponent's style of play and the way he opened the game (it is a long way mentally from closed 2.Nc3 systems to castling long in the open Sicilian)."
11,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p1n1p3/8/3NPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"This move defines Black's opening intentions - I am proposing mainline classical Scheveningen.

13,Be3,c1e3,r1bqkbnr/1p3ppp/p1npp3/8/3NPP2/2N1B3/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 7,"I wanted to avoid closing of the c file in case of 8.Nc6, bc6. Black kingside is lagging in development but White can't exploit this immediately."
14,Bd7,c8d7,r2qkbnr/1p1b1ppp/p1npp3/8/3NPP2/2N1B3/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 8,"I wanted to avoid closing of the c file in case of 8.Nc6, bc6. Black kingside is lagging in development but White can't exploit this immediately."
15,Be2,f1e2,r2qkbnr/1p1b1ppp/p1npp3/8/3NPP2/2N1B3/PPP1B1PP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 3 8,"This move finally defines the opening - classical Scheveningen it is. I usually play 8.Qf3 with 9.0-0-0 in similar positions, which is more aggressive but also more risky."
16,Nf6,g8f6,r2qkb1r/1p1b1ppp/p1nppn2/8/3NPP2/2N1B3/PPP1B1PP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 4 9,"Black has to hurry with kingside development, because in a few moves White will be ready to start active operations. The main question is - where?"
17,O-O,e1g1,r2qkb1r/1p1b1ppp/p1nppn2/8/3NPP2/2N1B3/PPP1B1PP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 5 9,"In this position White has a lot of different moves/plans, I will just mention the typical ones: 1) 10.a4 stops Black's counterplay based on b5 for a long time, and allows for play in the centre and possibly on the kingside. 2) 10.Nb3, b5; 11.a3 avoids exchange on d4 while retaining control over the centre 3) 10.Qe1 is probably the strongest, preparing the transfer to g3 and creating some threats on the kingside 4) 10.Kh1 is a useful waiting move, postponing the decision regarding the placement of other pieces 5) 10.Bf3, which usually indicates White's intention to focus on the queenside, but can also support kingside pawn storm"
18,Be7,f8e7,r2qk2r/1p1bbppp/p1nppn2/8/3NPP2/2N1B3/PPP1B1PP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 6 10,"In this position White has a lot of different moves/plans, I will just mention the typical ones: 1) 10.a4 stops Black's counterplay based on b5 for a long time, and allows for play in the centre and possibly on the kingside. 2) 10.Nb3, b5; 11.a3 avoids exchange on d4 while retaining control over the centre 3) 10.Qe1 is probably the strongest, preparing the transfer to g3 and creating some threats on the kingside 4) 10.Kh1 is a useful waiting move, postponing the decision regarding the placement of other pieces 5) 10.Bf3, which usually indicates White's intention to focus on the queenside, but can also support kingside pawn storm"

20,Qc7,d8c7,r3k2r/1pqbbppp/p1nppn2/8/3NPP2/2N1BB2/PPP3PP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 8 11,"Since White did not threaten the kingside yet, I decided to delay castling for 1-2 moves and first overprotect e5, c6 and b7."
21,Qd2,d1d2,r3k2r/1pqbbppp/p1nppn2/8/3NPP2/2N1BB2/PPPQ2PP/R4RK1 b kq - 9 11,!? This was a surprise - usually the Queen doesn't define its place so soon (I expected it to go to d3 later). I expected 11.a4 or 11.Nb3 first.
22,O-O,e8g8,r4rk1/1pqbbppp/p1nppn2/8/3NPP2/2N1BB2/PPPQ2PP/R4RK1 w - - 10 12,"In any case, castling needs to be done eventually, so this is as good a moment as any. Black position is rock solid and very flexible, the small center ready to advance as needed."
23,g4,g2g4,r4rk1/1pqbbppp/p1nppn2/8/3NPPP1/2N1BB2/PPPQ3P/R4RK1 b - - 0 12,"?! Another surprise, but this time I considered it slightly dubious. White is not nearly prepared to overrun Black kingside, and this move opens his King greatly. His central cluster of pieces prevents any mating counterattack right now, but how permanent is this remains to be seen. I would recommend 12.Kh1, which is always a useful move in Scheveningen."
24,Nxd4,c6d4,r4rk1/1pqbbppp/p2ppn2/8/3nPPP1/2N1BB2/PPPQ3P/R4RK1 w - - 0 13,"! Following the old rule - on wing action react in the centre. This move also (if necessary) allows Bd7 to move to c6 and allow Nf6 to retreat on d7 after White pushes g5. --- In my experience, generally for Black the best moment to counterstrike is right after White commits his pawn structure to the kingside attack."
25,Qxd4,d2d4,r4rk1/1pqbbppp/p2ppn2/8/3QPPP1/2N1BB2/PPP4P/R4RK1 b - - 0 13,"Better than 13.Bd4, due to having more options after the following 13...e5."
26,e5,e6e5,r4rk1/1pqbbppp/p2p1n2/4p3/3QPPP1/2N1BB2/PPP4P/R4RK1 w - - 0 14,"! Forcing favourable simplifications, while simultaneously picking on g4 pawn."
27,Qd1,d4d1,r4rk1/1pqbbppp/p2p1n2/4p3/4PPP1/2N1BB2/PPP4P/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 14,"Practically best. White does not have many good options here: A) 14.fe5!?, de5; 15.Qb6, Qb6; 16.Bb6, Bg4; 17. Bg4, Ng4; 18.Nd5, Bd8 and B) 14.Qb6, Qb6; 15.Bb6, ef4 and C) 14.Qd2, ef4; 15.Bf4, Bg4; 16. Bg4, Ng4 leave Black with a clear extra pawn, but white can fight for a draw, while D) 14.Nd5??, ed4; 15.Nc7, de3; 16.Na8, Ra8 loses outright."
28,exf4,e5f4,r4rk1/1pqbbppp/p2p1n2/8/4PpP1/2N1BB2/PPP4P/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 15,"?! Here I decided against objectively best 15...Qb6; 16.Kg2, Qb2; 17.Bd2 because now Black has to either give up the b7 pawn or allow 18.g5. The reason is that I liked the (objectively equal) position after 15...Bc6 - it is very safe and still gives plenty of opportunity for long-term advantage, due to the safer King and slightly better pawn structure (less weaknesses). This decision is a direct result of the competitive situation (explained in introduction)."
29,Bxf4,e3f4,r4rk1/1pqbbppp/p2p1n2/8/4PBP1/2N2B2/PPP4P/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 15,"?!

31,Kh1,g1h1,r4rk1/1pq1bppp/p1bp1n2/8/4PBP1/2N2B2/PPP4P/R2Q1R1K b - - 2 16,"A defensive move - White makes sure that any future Qb6 will not be with check. Moves like 16.Qd2!? (16...Qb6?!; 17.Be3, Qb2??; 17.a3!) and 16.g5 were also good options here."
