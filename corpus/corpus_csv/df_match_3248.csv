1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Stalhandske challenged me to a dual because in a early annotated game in which he was played the Alekine defense I made the pompous statement that Alekine defense was dead and a guaranteed win for white in all lines. So he challenged me to walk the talk and prove it.  FYI if there are many grammar and spelling mistake please excuse them as this was done in a rush.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"Black tempts white into advancing the e-pawn beyond the 4th rank in order to prove some time in the near future that white's ""big"" center is weak not strong."
3,e5,e4e5,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/4P3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Of course I do not believe that and say, ""my pawn shall crush you!"""
4,Nd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/3nP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,black has now wasted tempo by moving the knight twice. This is perfectly ok because White done the same thing by pushing the e-pawn and not developing pieces.
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/3nP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,White defends the e-pawn and tries to hang onto his space advantage in the center.
6,d6,d7d6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p4/3nP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"This is the key that unlocks all of black's ""perceived"" problems. Now there is now way that white can hold onto the e-pawn which at once equalizes for black."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p4/3nP3/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,This is the modern approach to the Alekine. The traditional space hungry grab 4. c4 has fallen out of favor because white's already over extended pawn structure is over extended even more.
8,dxe5,d6e5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3np3/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,Objective complete! Black has eliminates white's center superiority and the game is equal. I am not a fan of the main alternative 4. ...Bg4 5. Be2 e6 6. 0-0 in my view is more pleasant for white.
9,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3np3/2PP4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,This in hindsight was not as good as I thought. While it gains space at the expense of the knight it makes defending the d-pawn extremely difficult for white.
10,e4,e5e4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3n4/2PPp3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,I like this move a lot!  Black counters white's threat with threatening to eliminate a key defender of d4 and allowing white to double up his pawns on the d-file.
11,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3P4/3Pp3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,Maybe this is not the best move but it still leaves me in charge in the center. The gameknot engine suggested 6. Ne5 as best. But here are my thoughts. I have already resigned to the fact that white has gained absolutely nothing from the opening. At this point I am visualizing how I might be able to make something happen on the king side. I see that first I must strengthen the D-pawn my last bastion in the center. Then I see the glimmer of excitement when I have a bishop on c2 and the queen on d3. But this is not enough in of itself. I must provoke black into making some positional concessions on the king side. So maybe Bg5 with the help of h4-h5 will be often to break the dead lock.
12,exf3,e4f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3P4/3P4/5p2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,White still controls the center but has major positional weakness.
13,Qxf3,d1f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3P4/3P4/5Q2/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 7,White still controls the center but has major positional weakness.
14,c6,c7c6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p5/3P4/3P4/5Q2/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 8,Again black continues to pound away at white's center. I love the beautiful simplicity of black's strategic plan.
15,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p5/3P4/3P4/2N2Q2/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 1 8,With d4 being so weak the last thing I want to do is help black build pressure up against it. 8. dxc6 Nxc6 is in my view better for black this is what the gameknot engine suggested.
16,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3P4/3P4/2N2Q2/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 0 9,Now black threatens to solidify his stake in the center with ...cxd5. So this forces white to expose d4.
17,dxe6,d5e6,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1P3/8/3P4/2N2Q2/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 9,"Since I have a choose on which piece black will develop I am going to choose the one that puts less pressure on d4. The gameknot engine disagrees slightly by suggesting that 9. dxc6 nxc6 10.d5!? is slightly in whites favor. This maybe true objectively but I am sensing that Stalhandske would do quite well in such open positions. Feeling this I decide to play the possibly inferior dxe6 in order to steer the game into where quiet positional maneuvering is required. I therefore, make this move confidently that my positional skills are superior to Stalhandske's rewarding me with the mating opportunity that I dream about."
18,Bxe6,c8e6,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1b3/8/3P4/2N2Q2/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 0 10,"Stalhandske commented at this point during the game that he felt he had succeeded in proving that the Alekine defense is not dead. Myself of course with a lump in my throat had to agree. It is in my opinion that in this current position black is slightly better. He has no serious pawn weaknesses, his pieces are able to mobilize freely and quickly. the only real drawback for black is that he has no real prospects of attack. This however, did not discourage me, I will continue on executing my term plans and rely on my strong positional skills to create some magic. I intend to do a dance(the shuffle) to reorganize my pieces put pressure on the king side. My fingers are crossed that Stalhandske will assist me by playing moves like ...h6 and maybe if I am so lucky ...g6."

20,Nd7,b8d7,r2qkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1b3/8/3P4/2N1BQ2/PP3PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 2 11,This knight is quite strong here where it eyes c5 and e5 and can possible go to d5 via b6 or f6
21,h3,h2h3,r2qkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1b3/8/3P4/2N1BQ1P/PP3PP1/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 11,This is the beginning of my attacking scheme. I continue to dream that one day this pawn will forcing black into playing g6 or h5
22,Bb4,f8b4,r2qk2r/pp1n1ppp/2p1b3/8/1b1P4/2N1BQ1P/PP3PP1/R3KB1R w KQkq - 1 12,"Now the game takes on a very masterful feel where both sides make small moves that have long term significant. It is important to note that neither side is looking for knock out blows( this is in stark contrast to amateur games where one side will make a ration move looking for that quick strike). it is here where the position is absolutely level where master games are won and lost. It is imperative to be patient, make small improvements and make no weaknesses. With that said we can see that while 11. ...Bb4 is good it is not ideal because it is short sighted in that the pin on c3 is of no real consequence. So what is can black do to gain something down the road. Maybe the answer is 11. ...Bd6!? controlling the b8-h2 diagonal which will become really important 10 moves from now."
