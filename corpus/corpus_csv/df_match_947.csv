In contrast I play rather quickly, trying to gain a small time edge while I still can as I knew my opponent is a long thinker."

9,Be3,c1e3,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/8/3NP3/4B3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,"Not the main line, but an understandable choice. That being said, the dark squares of Black's position are usually very weak and in the e6 Sicilians a common theme for White is to take advantage of that. I can't say that this move accomplishes this. He doesn't have to be afraid of Nxd4 either since it was protected by his queen. Nc3 would have been played had we followed the main lines."
10,Qc7,d8c7,r1b1kbnr/ppqp1ppp/2n1p3/8/3NP3/4B3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 3 6,"Slightly confusing my opponent. This particular opening is called the Taimanov variation of the Sicilian defense and sadly not a lot of Sicilian players play it as they tend to favor either d6 variations of the Sicilian or play the Khan Sicilian. The Taimanov and the Khan share very similar ideas, but the queen on c7 can sometimes become a weakness rather then an asset after Nb5. It's pointless to play this now as after 6. Nb5 Qb8 7. Nc3 a6 8. Nd4 black is fine and it can even be said to be a better position. The queen on c7 controls the b8-h2 diagonal and indirectly glares at the c-pawn on c2. Often the queen comes in handy for a minority attack on the queenside or we use both the a8-h1 diagonal and the b8-h2 diagonal to exert enormous pressure on his castled king. Of course if you've never played against the Taimanov then this is tricky to understand without losing too much time."
11,Nc3,b1c3,r1b1kbnr/ppqp1ppp/2n1p3/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 4 6,Going back in main theory for as far as I know and looking over the d5 square before I get any ideas.

13,a3,a2a3,r1b1kbnr/1pqp1ppp/p1n1p3/8/3NP3/P1N1B3/1PP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"My opponent plays this after a long think. It's not a bad move, but it doesn't help all that much either. Granted after the main line Qd2 there are some theoretical lines with Bb4, but if you know the theory by head then you realise that White can come out fine. That being said Bb4 which I was planning in the near future isn't an option anymore."
14,b5,b7b5,r1b1kbnr/2qp1ppp/p1n1p3/1p6/3NP3/P1N1B3/1PP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,"One of the main ideas behind the Taimanov, more or less killing a lot of his options for his knights and his bishop."
15,Be2,f1e2,r1b1kbnr/2qp1ppp/p1n1p3/1p6/3NP3/P1N1B3/1PP1BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 8,"Bd3 is far too passive and it can't go anywhere but e2. It can get new life in the middlegame, but for now doesn't really do much for him aside from enabling him to castle."
16,Bb7,c8b7,r3kbnr/1bqp1ppp/p1n1p3/1p6/3NP3/P1N1B3/1PP1BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 9,"A mistake in my opinion. The forcing sequence isn't that difficult to spot, but there's quite a bit to calculate. Black can win a pawn with 9. Nxb4 10. axb4 Qxc3+ which is fairly obvious and there's little that White can do about it. That being said it isn't as simple as it appears since after 9. Nxb4 White has the fascinating response of Nxb5! doing the exact same thing. It took me a long time to calculate whether or not Nxb5 works, but found that after 9. b4 Nxb4 10. Nxb5 axb5 11. Nxb5 you have the cheeky Nxc2+. Taking it with the queen means that 12. Qxc2 Qxc2 follows with a very easy game for Black. Therefore the only option for White is to move the king. If 12. Kf1 then you meet that with 12. Nxe3+ 13. fxe3 and without the dark squares bishop you can play Qb6, escaping the Nb5 threat. If the king goes to d2 then you have 12. Qa5+. 13. Kxc2 Rc2+ and with the pawn on e4 also falling in the future with Bxe4 it seems grim. Checkmate seems inevitable. It seems rather easy when you have an analysis board next to you, but calculating everything OTB was surprisingly difficult. After running everything through my head a few more times I decided to go on with my plan, although I felt like something wasn't entirely right."

White's plan for here is rather obvious, and I start to think on ways to counter it. White would like to play Rfd1 and target my d7-pawn. Sadly that's not possible yet as I have 2 defenders on it ( queen and king ). That being said, White has definite ideas of Nxb5 after Rfd1, winning him back the pawn at the very least and even cramping my position."

White wants to get his rook on the open-file and move his knight away. He moves to f3 with the idea of maybe pushing e5 in in the future or occupying this square with his knight."
24,Ne7,c6e7,r3kb1r/1bqpnppp/p3pn2/1p6/4P3/P1N1BN2/2PQBPPP/R4RK1 w kq - 6 13,"I wanted to win the e-pawn and quickly secure my win. You can draw an endgame with 1 pawn down, but with 2? The plan is easy. Play Nxe4, win the pawn, trade all my pieces off and go into an easy endgame. I'm not too scared of e5 either since I can always just play Nfd5 getting a really strong knight in the center."
25,Bf4,e3f4,r3kb1r/1bqpnppp/p3pn2/1p6/4PB2/P1N2N2/2PQBPPP/R4RK1 b kq - 7 13,"Perfectly timed. Black wants to consolidate the position so White needs to find a way to not only move Black's queen, but also in such a way that it doesn't defend d7 anymore if possible."
26,Qa5,c7a5,r3kb1r/1b1pnppp/p3pn2/qp6/4PB2/P1N2N2/2PQBPPP/R4RK1 w kq - 8 14,"I decide to go to a5 rather then for example c6 ( which didn't feel that well ) or c8 where my rook won't be able to reach d7 anymore. I opt for a5 as I start growing suspicious of a future Nxb5  which feels rather strong. Nxb5 axb5 Bxb5 and Black's position can't possibly get more cramped. Qa5 stops Nxb5 ideas because of axb5, and now both queens are looking directly at each other and it's in Black's best interest to remove White's queen as it's a powerful attacker in this position. All that being said, I can't help but feel like this is a mistake, but find it hard to suggest an alternative."
