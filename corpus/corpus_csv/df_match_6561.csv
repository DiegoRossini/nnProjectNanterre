1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,A game that shows (again!) the importance of never giving up!
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,King's Gambit. This has a reputation for leading to bloody combat.

11,Nxg4,e5g4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1p1p/5n2/8/4PpNP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"Instead 6. d4 d6 7. Nd3 is the main line. That said, I can see why White prefers to take the pawn. Black's pawn structure is fractured, and the f4 pawn seems doomed. (Though in this game... but let's not get ahead of ourselves.)"

Perhaps the moral to be drawn is, before choosing a move, press the ""flip"" button on the analysis board at least once. No way I'd have missed it if I'd done that."

It seems I may still have a chance of pulling off a swindle if I can develop rapidly. First, this move threatens 12... Bxh4+ 13. Ke2 (neither Rxh4 nor g3 helps much) Bg4+ winning the queen."

It gets the bishop into play and creates the possibility of the strong move Bg4; losing the pawn doesn't really matter, and my bishop will be pinned if I take it."

Re1 Bh4 19. Re3 Bf2 and the rook has no squares. What's to be done? 16. Rg1 doesn't work: 16... Bg4! and the g2 pawn is still pinned and Black is now threatening a lethal discovered check.
