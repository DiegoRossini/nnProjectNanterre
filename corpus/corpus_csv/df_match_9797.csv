1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I don't normally play 1.e4, and doing so was one of the most interesting experiences of this French mini-tournament. This game is imperfect like so many of mine, but it was a good slugfest. Analysing it was interesting and I was surprised at the depth of some of the variations."
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I experimented with this and the advance variation. I think 3.e5 is too primitive. With the Tarrasch, white aims for positional pressure. Whilst it will never refute the French, it causes headaches for French players as if Black isn't careful he will find himself in a joyless position."

7,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2pP4/3P4/8/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,4.Ngf3 is the other main move.
8,exd5,e6d5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/8/2pp4/3P4/8/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"!? Nowadays 4...Qxd5 is the main line with Watson analysing this in some depth in Play the French. The move played accepts an isolated pawn in return for free and easy development. Uhlman won some terrific games with this line, but I think with best play, Black has a lifeless and dull position."

15,dxc5,d4c5,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2n2n2/1BPp4/8/5N2/PPPN1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,"White exploits the tempo to develop his knight. We now have a standard French defence isolated queen pawn position (IQP) position. White has more space, but black is sound and has harmonious piece development and often targets the white king whereas white plays to create a second weakness on the king-side. The person who understands the nuances of IQP positions will fare best.

However I think the open e-file (rather than white having a pawn at e3 or e2 in Queens Gambit positions with IQPs which black can target)  means that if white can securely blockade the d-pawn he should be better. Korchnoi and Uhlmann are experts on the black side, Karpov on the white."
