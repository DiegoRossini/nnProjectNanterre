1,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone, here is a game between me and my buddy dmaestro.  It starts out with a Bird's Opening 1.f4 and transposes into a King's Gambit.  This has not been my most successful opening, particularly with this opponent, but, somehow I find the best opening moves and gradually get through the middle game without too many probs and end up in a drawish endgame.  I steel myself to play out the 50 move rule, but, jury, just look at my opponent's stats and see how many games he has drawn.  Nevertheless it looks to be heading that way this time, but at the end there was a twist to the tale in my favour!"
