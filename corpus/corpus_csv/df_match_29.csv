The only thing I didn't comment: Here, black seems to own the white squares, and he does... but while my N is in d2, I have nothing to fear: a black N in e4 doesn't bother me too much, I can go on attacking.

At least, I made it for a tempo, now... if I retire my B, I'll lose h4, and if I let it there, I'll lose a pawn in g5...
