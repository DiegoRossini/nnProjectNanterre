1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Currently I'm waivering towards a preferance for d4 as a first move, which seems to inject an element of dynamism into the center. Anyway here I play e4 aiming for probably the Ruy (a line I am beginning not to like)."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Double Kings pawn
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Petrovs defense. A line I'm not particularly familiar playing but havent experienced much difficulty combatting in my past games. Without knowledge of the variations, I'd assess that this line is fairly easy for white to maintain the first move advantage well into the middlegame."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"Petrovs defense.

5,Nxe5,f3e5,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"next few moves are standard. To provide a brief explanation, white first move advantage denies black from an immediate recapture owing to the threat of Qe2. Once black recaptures the pawn via his knight, white stakes a claim for the center. And black does likewise. From here its a race to castle, with white aiming to pressurise blacks advanced knight whilst simultaneously developing pieces into active positions. Black is likewise aiming to develop and castle as quickly as possible."
6,d6,d7d6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Some play Qe7 here, although I've never come across Qe7 from a stronger opponent - possibly oweing to obstruction of the kings bishops development. d6 is a fine move here in any case"

I was hoping black overlooked the exchange Bxf3, Bxd8, Bxd1, Rxd1, f6. Which leaves black with a much better game oweing to whites poorly placed bishop"
