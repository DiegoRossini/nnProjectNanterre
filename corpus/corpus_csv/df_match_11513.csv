2,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I was sincerely surprised. Pirc-Ufimtsev Defense is not a usual one for Topalov, and this opening is hardly worth using in the tournaments of the highest category. White has too many opportunities for anybody's liking: one can lead an acute or a positional game, one can vary different ways of developing the initiative. Nevertheless, Topalov obviously counted on surprise, as he thought that I would play worse in a situation I was not ready for, and besides, he hoped to avoid my opening preparation, which he had faced before."

I was actually engrossed in thoughts on the third move, I had often played 3.f3 threatening with King's Indian Defense. However, this opening couldn't scare Topalov off as he was used to it, moreover, that was what he reckoned on. That is why I decided to play at sight. I went for a position I had a definite idea about but never met in practice and, frankly speaking, had never seriously analyzed."

Alternative variation: [If White wanted to play] 7. Bh6 [he could do it at once, leaving the e2-square free for the other Knight and providing an opportunity to develop the other Bishop on d3. Theoretically this Knight could move to h3 one day.]
Generally speaking, the move 7.Nge2 has no sense, its reason is purely psychological. I remembered that before the game, when we discussed the strategy with [GM] Yury Dokhoian [RUS], he said suddenly looking through Topalov's games: ""You know, Garry, he does not like when the opponent makes the moves he can not predict. This affects him strangely."" That is why I played 7.Nge2 and surprised Topalov. This move does not contain any threats but continues the development. However, it seemed to me that he did not like the character of the fight, as it did not correspond the ideas he had before the game."

However, Black has to show some enterprise, as he is under some pressure. If White develops with g3, Bh3, and Rhe1, then it won't be easy for Black. Black's King is slightly weakened and, of course, he should have considered playing c6-c5, but then White would have a choice: close the position by playing d5, or even to exchange.      It is probably more promising to close the center. White's space advantage lets him push for an attack. Then I hoped to make use of Black's weaknesses on the Queen-side. It was possible to move the Queen from h6 to b6 or to a7. This was an absurd thought: it flashed across my mind and immediately disappeared, but subconsciously I formed the idea that the Queen on b6 together with the Knight on a5 could make a lot of trouble, especially if the white Bishop appears on h3.
