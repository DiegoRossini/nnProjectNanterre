2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,A good enough return. I'm never confident to try something different like c5 because I am never too sure how to take it through.

5,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,Threatening the pawn on f7 by later moving my knight to g5.

7,d3,d2d3,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2B1P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,To protect my knight if i was to move my knight to g5.
