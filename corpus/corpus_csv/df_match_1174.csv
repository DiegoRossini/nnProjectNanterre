1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"In this game, after a level opening, I drop a pawn to a pretty combination. I fight on and manage to reach a level ending. I reach a position where they is just one move to draw. Unfortunately I don't find it, and I lose!"
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"So this was playing in round 6 of the 4NCL (National Chess League), Division 3, North."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,and it start conventionally enough.
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Likely to lead to the Queen's Indian Defence after Nf3 or the Nimzo Indian after Nc3.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,I opt for a Nimzo.
6,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"Which he plays, although he could have transposed into a Queen's Gambit with d5 or a Benoni with c5."
7,e3,e2e3,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,I play the main line.
8,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQ - 1 5,As does he.
9,Bd3,f1d3,rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2NBP3/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQ - 2 5,So I develop.
10,d5,d7d5,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/1bPP4/2NBP3/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQ - 0 6,"I'm very happy after this move, as now, if ever he doubles my c pawns with Bxc3, I can always undouble them."
11,Nf3,g1f3,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/1bPP4/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 1 6,So I develop.
12,c5,c7c5,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/1bPP4/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 7,He continues.
13,a3,a2a3,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/1bPP4/P1NBPN2/1P3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 7,"I now think 0-0 is more accurate, and will play 0-0 if I have this position again."
14,Bxc3+,b4c3,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/2PP4/P1bBPN2/1P3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 8,So he takes.
15,bxc3,b2c3,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/2PP4/P1PBPN2/5PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 8,I take back.
16,Qc7,d8c7,rnb2rk1/ppq2ppp/4pn2/2pp4/2PP4/P1PBPN2/5PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 1 9,With a threat of taking on d4 and then on c4 and I can't recapture with the bishop.
17,cxd5,c4d5,rnb2rk1/ppq2ppp/4pn2/2pP4/3P4/P1PBPN2/5PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 9,To meet that threat I make an exchange which I don't really want to make. I found out later that Qc2 is the usual move in this position.
18,exd5,e6d5,rnb2rk1/ppq2ppp/5n2/2pp4/3P4/P1PBPN2/5PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 10,He takes back.
19,O-O,e1g1,rnb2rk1/ppq2ppp/5n2/2pp4/3P4/P1PBPN2/5PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 10,I finally castle.
20,c4,c5c4,rnb2rk1/ppq2ppp/5n2/3p4/2pP4/P1PBPN2/5PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 11,And he closes down the position for his two knights. In doing so he takes us out of the Gameknot opening databases (not that we were using them at the time of course!
