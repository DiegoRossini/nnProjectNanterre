20,Re8,f8e8,r1bqr1k1/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/4p1N1/8/B1PP4/P3BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 3 11,"This move was going to happen eventually anyway, as I needed some more protection for that e pawn."
21,Bh5,e2h5,r1bqr1k1/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/4p1NB/8/B1PP4/P4PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 4 11,"This is a decent move for White.  Instincts are good on bringing pieces into the fray this aggressively.  White is threatening Bxf7+.  If Nxh5, then Qxh5 spells trouble as I can't protect both h7 and f7 at the same time.  As a result, I only have one option.  

Another play for White to consider is Bf3, as it threatens my queenside and I don't have a lot of good options to protect it quickly."
22,Be6,c8e6,r2qr1k1/ppp2ppp/2n1bn2/4p1NB/8/B1PP4/P4PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 5 12,"I didn't expect this move and am not certain what White is hoping to accomplish.  I would have traded knight for bishop with Nxe6 instead.  However, now that White is allowing me to get rid of one of his two power pieces on my half of the board, I must partake.  If you allow an opponent to have power pieces on your side of the board for a while, they become liabilities quickly.  Don't let them get established and drive them away or trade if it's not disadvantageous."

32,Rd8,a8d8,3r2k1/ppp2pp1/2n1rq1p/4p2Q/8/2PP4/PB3PPP/3RR1K1 w - - 4 17,"Rooks love open and half-open files.  When in doubt, place them there.  I also have the added benefit of being protected by my knight."
33,Re3,e1e3,3r2k1/ppp2pp1/2n1rq1p/4p2Q/8/2PPR3/PB3PPP/3R2K1 b - - 5 17,Offering a queen trade.  If not I have a good diagonal on the d3 pawn and some potential for penetration to White's back rank.

35,Qf3,h5f3,3r2k1/ppp2pp1/2n1r1qp/4p3/8/2PPRQ2/PB3PPP/3R2K1 b - - 7 18,"White declines the trade.  I would have considered moving to h3 instead to keep the potential for using my rooks to harass the Black queen, but keeping a protective line on the rook at d1 is a good idea too.  A key facet of higher level play is to try and have your pieces work in harmony together.  Let them mutually support and defend each other so that you don't leave pieces exposed to themselves and vulnerable to pins/attacks."
36,e4,e5e4,3r2k1/ppp2pp1/2n1r1qp/8/4p3/2PPRQ2/PB3PPP/3R2K1 w - - 0 19,This play has some attacking potential and a chance to create openings for counterplay.  Notice that there are several disastrous ways that Black can respond here.  A lot of chess is about giving your opponent a chance to shoot themselves in the foot and create openings to exploit.  Let's see how Black responds.
