The idea is that the wannabies (like myself) issue a challenge to one of the masters. After ""talking the talk"" it is then time to walk the walk. The Wannabe is to annotate the game on completion. I'm going to annotate this game along the way, to ensure a I represent my thoughts correctly, rather than with a retrospective eye."
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Caro-Kann. This is what was expected as I suggested to Shamash that I was going to turn his Caro-Khan into a Caro-Can't. Seems a little bit like threatening to stab a T-rex with a plastic fork.
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"The advance variation. I have almost no experience with the Caro-Kann, and the small amount of study I was able to put in before the game suggested that this variation doesn't require as much theory to back it up as 3.Nc3 I wouldn't play the exchange variation (3.exd5) as it seems to give black a much easier game. I also noted that Shamash (who is yet to be beaten on this site) has drawn more games of this flavour than the rest."

6,c5,c6c5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2ppP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"I'm not familiar enough with the theory really, but to my untrained eye I would suggest that the idea behind this move is Black offering a pawn in order to draw White into an overextended position. My crash course in Caro-Kann informs me that this defence leads toward long games where it can all come down to the integrity of pawn structures."
7,dxc5,d4c5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2PpP3/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,White now must try to defend his advanced pawns. A big drawback to White's pawns is that there are squares in the centre that they can no longer exert control over.

9,Be3,c1e3,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2PpP3/8/4B3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 5,Looking to place the bishop at d4.
10,Nh6,g8h6,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4p2n/2PpP3/8/4B3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 2 6,Developing. Perhaps looking for Nf5 challenging the bishop when it gets to d4.
11,Bd4,e3d4,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4p2n/2PpP3/3B4/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 3 6,At this point the game looks to be fairly even. White may even retain an edge? What I notice about this position is that White seems to have more options for quickly developing pieces.

14,Bd7,c8d7,rn1qkb1r/pp1b1ppp/4p3/2PpPn2/3B4/2P5/PP3PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 1 8,I continue to develop.
15,Nf3,g1f3,rn1qkb1r/pp1b1ppp/4p3/2PpPn2/3B4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 2 8,I continue to develop.
16,Nc6,b8c6,r2qkb1r/pp1b1ppp/2n1p3/2PpPn2/3B4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 3 9,"Trying to exert more influence on the kingside squares. Black is unlikely to exchange his knight for a ""bad"" bishop and allow White to take away the pawn weakness. At this point I am thinking about b4, trying to gain more space and to put the squeeze on black."

It is currently locked into a relatively useless diagonal. Secondly (and perhaps more importantly), this move is a bid to regain the pawn that was given up and to agressively place his dark square bishop by 10...fxe5 11.Nxe5 Nxe5 12.Bxe5 Bxc5. The resulting position is probably ok for White, but doesn't fit in with the strategy I am trying to implement - basically to make it difficult for black to develop his pieces onto good squares, and to cramp his position."
19,b4,b2b4,r2qkb1r/pp1b2pp/2n1pp2/2PpPn2/1P1B4/2P2N2/P2Q1PPP/RN2KB1R b KQkq - 0 10,"I played this move to avoid the previously mentioned line, and to keep the material advantage for a little longer. Ideas for white may be to follow up with a4, gaining more space and making any Queenside action for black more difficult. An opprtunity may even present itself to exchange with blacks b pawn to create a passed d pawn. A bit of a pipe-dream perhaps! I am expecting Black to respond something like 10...fxe5 11.Nxe5 Nxe5 12.Bxe5 - at least that is what I might consider as black - exchanging pieces to free up a cramped position."
20,a5,a7a5,r2qkb1r/1p1b2pp/2n1pp2/p1PpPn2/1P1B4/2P2N2/P2Q1PPP/RN2KB1R w KQkq - 0 11,"I think Black is looking to exchange at b4, in order to take away a defender of d4. 11.a3 doesn't prevent anything (PxP, PxP, RxR), and 11.bxa5 looks like positional suicide, bringing the black rook into the game and creating isolated, doubled pawns. 11.b5 seems a good way to proceed, forcing Black to either retreat the knight or exchange with White's ""bad"" bishop."

Black must either recapture with gxf, or try to mix it up with something like: 11...axb4, but after 12.fxg7 Nxg7 13.Bxg7 Bxg7 14.Be2 black looks quite scattered. Otherwise 11...Ncxd4 12.cxd4 gxf6 13.b5"

I seem to be more or less keeping up with development, and seem to have a space advantage. The material advantage is an illusion though. I can't see how white can defend d4 after 14...e5"

Exchanges on d4 seem to favour White - Black would have a difficult task on his hands trying to defend all of those isolated pawns. There would be a passed pawn of course, but I don't think that is enough for Black. However, If white doesn't exchange on e5 then Black can play 14...e4 gaining space and forcing the White knight to retreat back to g1. I cannot immediately see any reason why not to take on e5, but I'm sure Shamash wouldn't give me an extra pawn for nothing..."

The obvious responses for Black are 14...fxe5, which seems very bland, and doesn't achieve anything, or maybe 14...Bxc5 which could bring about some complexities, including a bishop sacrifice on f2. I don't think the sac is sound (at least for now). after something like: 14...Bxc5 15.Qxd5 Bxf2+ 16.Kxf2 Qb6+ 17.Ke1, it looks fine, but definitely worth keeping in mind."
28,Bxc5,f8c5,r2qk2r/1p1b3p/5p2/pPbpPn2/8/5N2/P2Q1PPP/RN2KB1R w KQkq - 0 15,I now think that it is a bad idea to take the pawn at d5. after 15.Qxd5 Qb6 the f6 pawn will fall and the White king will be exposed (the White Queen can't come back to d1 because of Bb4). It seems that 15.Nc3 or 15.Bd3 are safer. After 15.Nc3 Qb6 16.Nd1 Bxb5 17.Bxb5 Qxb5 Black has regained the material and has a very aggressive position. After 15.Bd3 Qb6 White can castle into safety.
