1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone, this Rapidplay which took place on 17 September 1996 was the Bury St Edmund's Jamboree where each participant played 3 games of 25 minutes per side.  It was a traditional opener to the Bury League, where various teams in Cambridgeshire and Suffolk would play one another.  There would then be four against four in the Bury League but that is another story.  I won one out of my 3 games and this is the one that I won."
