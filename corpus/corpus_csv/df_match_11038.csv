10,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppp1p/2n2np1/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 3 6,"!?  Alright, now we have to take a look at what's going on here.  If black had played d6 by now, white could play f3, setting up the yugoslav variation of the sicilian, which has very interesting chances for both sides.  I *like* the yugoslav as white, but black hasn't played d6 yet.  The pawn serves an additional purpose by being on f2; more on this in the note to move 12.

My analysis tells me that if black and I both castle (him short, myself long), and he plays d5, the game will continue roughly as a standard yugoslav with 9. 0-0-0 instead of 9. Bc4 (and without f3).  I do note, however, that I could have played Bc4 here, instead of Qd2, preventing black from playing d5 directly."

""Kiss her, miss her, love her... that girl is poi-i-son""  

That pawn on a2 looked poisonous to me that I didn't really consider black would take it.  On the other hand, with so few pieces left on the board, can it really be bad to take a pawn?  I had expected Ra-c8, and that was part of the reason I played Rd2 on my last.  But now I had to think.  My game note to myself was ""does 16. b3 trap the bishop?""  I spent a couple of days thinking about it, and then played..."
31,f4,f2f4,r4rk1/pp3p1p/6p1/4b3/5P2/4B3/bPPR2PP/2K2B1R b - - 0 16,"!?  I like this move as an in-between move.  It drives the black bishop back to either f6, g7, or h8, as any other move simply allows white to play 17. b3, 18. Kb2 and the bishop falls without a fight.  Also, it allows the Be3 to move freely without having to worry about the rook getting pinned to the king."
32,Bg7,e5g7,r4rk1/pp3pbp/6p1/8/5P2/4B3/bPPR2PP/2K2B1R w - - 1 17,"Hard to argue with that choice, as it preserves the possibility of a pin on the Rd2 if white blunders."
