1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"Hi everyone!

Pawns are the soul of chess!  They are certainly not to be taken lightly.  They are potential queens.  If you are able to keep a one pawn advantage all the way through it can therefore be decisive.  It certainly was in this game!  For the want of three rating points I would have clocked up only my third near-Expert Victory.  All the same, it was a big win because William absolutely Blitzed me (pun intended!) in my first game as white against him.  In the second, I got away with a Houdini-Style draw.  In this game, however, the position looked even until I somehow managed to win a pawn in the middlegame.  God only knows how I managed to hold on to this precious one point advantage but I did.  Pieces were exchanged and I ended up in a Q & P ending with an outside passer.  Even in such an advantageous position, Glenda just could not stop defending, right to the end.  However, she was nursing my a pawn through to becoming Glenda2.  William could not stop this promotion and resigned on the grounds of Ruinous Loss of Material.  So, how did this all happen?  Well, let us start with the Reti Opening, which is 1. Nf3."
