1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Queen pawn. Landon & I both tend to use this opening as White. I favor it due to the open position it can allow on the queen side for white.
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I normally respond with d5. e6 seemed like a good idea at the time, it really did! 
I have never used it since."
3,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"c4 is more common, but who am I to gripe?"
4,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,A look at the gameknot database indicates I was doing all I could to give the advantage to white. The pawn is protected by the bishop and makes a play for the center. With no other pawn support. Genius!
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,Solidifying his grip on the center. His teacher would be proud!
6,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,My teacher just ripped a handful of hair out. WTF? That space is protected by not one but TWO white pieces. I wonder how I expected to hold it?
7,Qxd4,d1d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/8/3QP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"I guess I didn't. This is beautiful, isn't it? But I'm sure I have a plan, right?"
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/8/3QP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 1 5,Heck yeah! Go after that nasty early developed Queen and get a piece in play (on move FOUR.. more genius!)  I have dieselengine right where I want him now.
9,Qc4,d4c4,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/8/2Q1P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 2 5,Had to move the Queen. This must have seemed like a good spot for her. Queen pawn could attack supported by the e pawn and queen. But maybe a little extra help would be better.
10,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/8/2Q1P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 3 6,So I develop the other knight. This is looking good now! His Queen is out and I can harass her while I develop. Perfect. I have him!
11,e5,e4e5,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/4P3/2Q5/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"Nuts! have to move a piece twice in the opening. I'm supposed to be chasing HIS Queen.

[In hindsight (thanks to ethansiegel for the analysis) 6.......D5 would have been better. 
Attacking his queen and ignoring the attack on the Knight  might have given me the tempo
I needed to make him pay for the early queen advancement.
As the game was played though, I focused on the immediate attack on my Knight and ignored 
my real objective, chasing his Queen. Ahhh, hindsight!]"
12,Nd5,f6d5,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/3nP3/2Q5/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 1 7,"Some attack?! Nearly forced, and for me, truly forced. I'd rather have a prostate exam than move a piece back to it's home square after I _just_ brought it out. Maybe the prostate exam would have been better.
[Or moving my pawn to D6... But, the die is cast!]"
13,Bd3,f1d3,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/3nP3/2Q5/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 2 7,"OK, now I'm not liking this, more White pieces on the prowl. And pointing at the side I intend on castling on."
14,d6,d7d6,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2npp3/3nP3/2Q5/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 8,That is brilliant!  Seal off my blacksquare bishop and give him something to attack. My genius astounds me at times.
15,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2npp3/3nP3/2Q5/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 1 8,"He didn't take the bait, and castled like a good boy as soon as he was able. This would normally be when I would begin a withering attack with my bishops and knights on his kingside. Too bad they are all hemmed in and on the wrong side of the board. Plus, I sure would like to castle."
16,dxe5,d6e5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1p3/3np3/2Q5/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNB2RK1 w kq - 0 9,I'll show HIM! I'm a pawn up now and feeling mighty smart.
17,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1p3/3np1B1/2Q5/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RN3RK1 b kq - 1 9,And then THIS. An open diagonal to my queen and yet another white piece is developed..... At my expense.
18,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2n1p3/3np1B1/2Q5/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RN3RK1 w kq - 2 10,Now I'm cooking! I may get to castle yet!
19,Nbd2,b1d2,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2n1p3/3np1B1/2Q5/3B1N2/PPPN1PPP/R4RK1 b kq - 3 10,All the white minor pieces have been developed. He could push his Queen's Rook off the board. He won't need it.
20,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2n1p3/3np1B1/2Q5/3B1N2/PPPN1PPP/R4RK1 w - - 4 11,Wheeeee! I'm safe now. Now I can get the rest of my pieces out and make him pay for that early Queen development!  He messed with the wrong cat. I'm a pawn up and victory is certain. Way to go General Custer!
