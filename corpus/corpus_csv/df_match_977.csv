1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This technically should be ""Blitz Series 5"" of my usual set of games involving my blitz games, but frankly, I felt the overall chess concepts explored in this match were much better suited for a general annotation. That said, keep in mind that both players have a 5:00 clock, where 15 seconds are added for each move."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Anyway, we begin with the Sicilian. I might play 1 ...e5 when I've decided shenanigans from classical King's Pawn games don't bother me anymore. That probably won't be for years, frankly."
3,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,"This variation of the Sicilian is considered inferior to most lines, most popular being the Open variation (2. Nf3) or the Closed (2. Nc3). The idea is, Black wants to plan a strong d5 push, and without a pawn on c4 for White, that bishop will go under fire the moment he plays this, and White will lose tempo in preparing against it. White still has ample opportunity, but not as much as other lines in my opinion."
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 3,"Like I said, Black's idea is wanting a strong grip on a d5 pawn push. Also, the DSB is ready to protect the pawn on c5. This is the main line."
5,d3,d2d3,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/2B1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 3,"Rather passive for White. Protecting e4, but Black isn't gearing to seize that square yet. Meanwhile, the LSB is blocked out from the rest of the board entirely. Maybe planning to play Bg5 one day without needing to worry about the center, but this move gives Black a lot of breathing space."
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/2B1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 4,"Gripping the d4-e5 squares before White can get there. If White wants to push further ahead down the board, he will have to start reacting to my development now."
7,c3,c2c3,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/2B1P3/2PP4/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 4,This keeps the knight out of the 4th rank. Perhaps White doesn't like getting harassed by minor pieces so early on in the game.
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/2p5/2B1P3/2PP4/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 5,Putting more support on d5 while preparing for Bg5 from White.
9,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/2p5/2B1P3/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 5,"But instead, White enables castling and continues trying to build his defenses."
10,d5,d7d5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2pp4/2B1P3/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,So I begin the first attack.
11,exd5,e4d5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2pP4/2B5/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,White has little reason to decline the exchange. Black has little reason to play Knight takes.
12,exd5,e6d5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/2pp4/2B5/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,White has little reason to decline the exchange. Black has little reason to play Knight takes.
13,Bb5,c4b5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/1Bpp4/8/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,"White did have a few other options here, however. Qe2+ probably would be a bad idea as Be7 would just accelerate Black's castling. Then Bb3 was there, which could have been a good alternative in order to bring the bishop to c2, pairing the bishops as you would in the Ruy Lopez. But frankly, White's LSB is rather cramped by the d3 pawn, and isn't very good in this game than if it could retreat to e2. Is it worth it for White to consider preserving his bishop here?"
14,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2n2n2/1Bpp4/8/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 8,"I'm not worried if White captures, and if he doesn't, the knight will free itself very soon."
15,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2n2n2/1Bpp4/8/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 3 8,"Instead, he moves to hide the kings."
16,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2n2n2/1Bpp4/8/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 4 9,"I oblige. Again, I don't care enough about the knight to play ...Bd7, undermining the d5 pawn once the Queen no longer protects it."
17,Bxc6,b5c6,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2B2n2/2pp4/8/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 0 9,"Instead, I'm happier to give d5 an extra defender, and putting Bb7 on the cards."
18,bxc6,b7c6,r1bq1rk1/p3bppp/2p2n2/2pp4/8/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 0 10,"Instead, I'm happier to give d5 an extra defender, and putting Bb7 on the cards."
19,Nbd2,b1d2,r1bq1rk1/p3bppp/2p2n2/2pp4/8/2PP1N2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 10,"White continues to develop, clearly behind Black's part."
20,d4,d5d4,r1bq1rk1/p3bppp/2p2n2/2p5/3p4/2PP1N2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 11,"I thought Black might be overreaching a little with this move, but on the other hand, I believed White gets hurt with the pawn stuck on d3. It blocks the White Queen from the center, and should White exchange pawns, then my pawns no longer double and d3 is forever stranded."
21,Qa4,d1a4,r1bq1rk1/p3bppp/2p2n2/2p5/Q2p4/2PP1N2/PP1N1PPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 1 11,"The Queen couldn't attack d4 from d1 very effectively, but I neglected this fork. With c6 left hanging and d4 attacked a third time, I needed to figure out how to cut my losses."
22,Bb7,c8b7,r2q1rk1/pb2bppp/2p2n2/2p5/Q2p4/2PP1N2/PP1N1PPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 2 12,"I decide to defend the weakest pawn. I'm not as sure anymore what would have happened if I went with ...dxc3, but I guess I wanted to leave White's d pawn stranded without having to worry about White's Queen being relatively safe in the Black camp. It doesn't look like White has any winning moves down that way, but why get so nervous with a Queen being so close in the first place?"
