2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The ""quiet""way... a line I played so much..."

4,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3pPb2/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"The white's lsb has d7 (very passive), d6 (played in the game, looking for the exchange, or Bb4+, the well-known attack. It should be played after black goes c5, however, or it will be answered with c6, with tempo."
5,d4,d2d4,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3pPb2/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"The white's lsb has d7 (very passive), d6 (played in the game, looking for the exchange, or Bb4+, the well-known attack. It should be played after black goes c5, however, or it will be answered with c6, with tempo."

7,Nf3,g1f3,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3pPb2/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"This is ""my"" move. I simply don't like b5 - Bb4+. It is playable, for sure, but it gives initiative to white."
8,a6,a7a6,rn1qkbnr/1pp2ppp/p3p3/3pPb2/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"This is ""my"" move. I simply don't like b5 - Bb4+. It is playable, for sure, but it gives initiative to white."
9,Bd3,f1d3,rn1qkbnr/1pp2ppp/p3p3/3pPb2/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,White felt like this. My answer is already prepared.
10,Bg6,f5g6,rn1qkbnr/1pp2ppp/p3p1b1/3pP3/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 6,"Another ""loss of tempo"". But black wants to keep the pawn chain solid, and the centre closed... until he breaks in with c5."
11,O-O,e1g1,rn1qkbnr/1pp2ppp/p3p1b1/3pP3/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 3 6,"If white does this, it means he doesn't want to start the bishop's exchange."
12,c5,c7c5,rn1qkbnr/1p3ppp/p3p1b1/2ppP3/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,"My turn to become active. Look at the board: black seems to be playing foolishly, wasting tempo with pawn moves, while his pieces are still undevelopen."
13,c3,c2c3,rn1qkbnr/1p3ppp/p3p1b1/2ppP3/3P4/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,White doesn't seize the initiative. This move makes it difficult to me to develop my dsb.
14,Nc6,b8c6,r2qkbnr/1p3ppp/p1n1p1b1/2ppP3/3P4/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 8,Finally.
15,b3,b2b3,r2qkbnr/1p3ppp/p1n1p1b1/2ppP3/3P4/1PPB1N2/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,"Interesting, and still not attacking. In chess, when you ""just wait"", normally, the opponent will ""do something""."
16,Qa5,d8a5,r3kbnr/1p3ppp/p1n1p1b1/q1ppP3/3P4/1PPB1N2/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 9,"Like this. Suddenly, developement is almost equal. White has to play carefully the developement of his queenside."
17,Bxg6,d3g6,r3kbnr/1p3ppp/p1n1p1B1/q1ppP3/3P4/1PP2N2/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 9,"This was played to avoid my bishop to take his after a piece goes to d7, but it has a ""little"" downside..."
18,hxg6,h7g6,r3kbnr/1p3pp1/p1n1p1p1/q1ppP3/3P4/1PP2N2/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 10,I open the column.
19,a4,a2a4,r3kbnr/1p3pp1/p1n1p1p1/q1ppP3/P2P4/1PP2N2/5PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 10,"This is the developement way black choose... over Bd7, and this gives me an idea."
20,b5,b7b5,r3kbnr/5pp1/p1n1p1p1/qpppP3/P2P4/1PP2N2/5PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 11,Being axb4 impossible due to QxR.
21,Ba3,c1a3,r3kbnr/5pp1/p1n1p1p1/qpppP3/P2P4/BPP2N2/5PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 1 11,Interesting.
22,b4,b5b4,r3kbnr/5pp1/p1n1p1p1/q1ppP3/Pp1P4/BPP2N2/5PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 0 12,"I take advantage of the fact that white can't play c4, closing the game, because of the bishop. Black created problems in white's developement..."
23,cxb4,c3b4,r3kbnr/5pp1/p1n1p1p1/q1ppP3/PP1P4/BP3N2/5PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 0 12,"Nxb5 is the good move. But I was thinking: ""how to exploit h2"", so I thought about Qc7 and some Nxd5 sac (if NxN, Qxh2#). But it's a long road to there."
24,cxb4,c5b4,r3kbnr/5pp1/p1n1p1p1/q2pP3/Pp1P4/BP3N2/5PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 0 13,Bb2 will be a waste of a bishop. But I don't have developed my kingside... we have both of us a complete wing undeveloped... as far as move 13!
25,Bc1,a3c1,r3kbnr/5pp1/p1n1p1p1/q2pP3/Pp1P4/1P3N2/5PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 13,Bb2 will be a waste of a bishop. But I don't have developed my kingside... we have both of us a complete wing undeveloped... as far as move 13!
26,Qb6,a5b6,r3kbnr/5pp1/pqn1p1p1/3pP3/Pp1P4/1P3N2/5PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 14,Still preventing a white piece to go to e7 (Nxd5).
