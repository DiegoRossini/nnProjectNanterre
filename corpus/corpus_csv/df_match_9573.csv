1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,Chess literature has cases when a player has moved the wrong rook to an open file. cases where players have moved the wrong knight are less common. I invite you to play through this game and stop after White's 17th move and work out which knight you would use to recapture on d5 and why. Then play on and see if you are right!
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,"1. Nf3 constitutes the Reti opening, named after Richard Reti 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_R%C3%A9ti
The Reti usually transposes into a reversed defence to a Queen Pawn opening, for instance, 2. c4 d5 leads to a reversed Benoni which is good for White. A Reversed King's Indian is also quite a common set-up. Probably the best way for Black to equalise is to just copy White's moves."
