1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Just to let you know that I met my usual fate against Freddy, you can now guess what that is!  Anyhow, it was not before he found himself in Old Matey's shadow so it was a case of us being at each other's throats but he got in first!  We pick up the action on move 6 when after responding to the main line 5. ....... Ke7 he plays Bb3."
