1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,From when I started to play 1.d4 openings my ELO rating went up with 150 points about. I think 1.d4 brings to White a very solid position with very good attacking chances. Now my favourites are Colle system and Torre attack. I'm not good in QGambit but play it often. I want to learn more about it and about Catalan opening
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,I hoped for 2...e6 then 3.Bg5

In fact the white pole bishop is blocked on d3 but how see later it'll be useful for defending the queenside. Pawns on kingside are ready to attack.
