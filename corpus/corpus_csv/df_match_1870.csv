8,d6,d7d6,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Another early Bg5 (cf my recent game against Oliver Cairns).  I spent some time working out how best to deal with this, as it's a bit of a nuisance, pinning my N against my Q if the e-pawn makes its normal advance.  In the past I've moved the Q to e8 to avoid the pin but in this game I decided that the N wanted to use e8.  For a while I got a rather cramped looking position but it proved a solid launch pad for a strong counter-attack."
