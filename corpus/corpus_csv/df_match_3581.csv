1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Here is another game in GM Cyrano's MT where I have been playing against the big boys, this time a Master with a rating close to IM level.  I end up in a position where I have a rook against 2 pieces.  Boy those two pieces proved to be much more lethal than a rook.  In fact, all black's remaining pieces swarmed around Henry who, sadly, got stung and suffered an anaphylactic shock.  So how did this happen.  Well before I start, here is the gameknot analysis: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17836549&rnd=0.9027691620956812"
