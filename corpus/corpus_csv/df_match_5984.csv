Black breaks the pin  on the h4-d8 diagonal and forms a pin of his own on the c3 knight (exploiting the absence of the queen's bishop from the queen side). If Black later plays dxc4, there may be threats against the g5 bishop. The first recorded instance of this opening was played by Emanuel Lasker in 1892. The name derives from a 1904 tournament in Cambridge Springs, Pennsylvania in which the defense was used several times. Practitioners of the opening have included Efim Bogoljubov, Vasily Smyslov, and Garry Kasparov.

The line remains popular among amateurs because there are several traps White must avoid."
