Computer says taking the bishop was better."

Computer says he should have moved the bishop to e7."

Computer says Nxd2 was better."

This was a mistake according to stockfish."
15,Bxc4,f1c4,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/4N3/2BP4/4P3/PP1Q1PPP/RN2K2R b KQkq - 0 8,Here I moved my bishop to a centre-controlling square but as it was unprotected here and the pawn was not a threat I could have taken with the knight instead (computer recommends) which would have led to tripled up pawns.
16,Nxe5,c6e5,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/4n3/2BP4/4P3/PP1Q1PPP/RN2K2R w KQkq - 0 9,"Now we have a fairly simple game to play. Pieces are equal and bishops are both light-squared. 

Computer gives me +0.19 advantage which is probably due to advanced pawn and one move advantage."

Computer says b6 was better, preparing for the bishop on b7 and recommends I move to Kf2 rather than castling... interesting."

Stockfish sees this as a mistake, it removed my advantage bringing the game back to zero. In hindsight I can see that black now has free run at putting my pieces on the defense."

Computer sees this as a mistake."
