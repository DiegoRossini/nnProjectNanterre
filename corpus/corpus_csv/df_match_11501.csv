1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I chose to annotate this game because i played better in it, in terms of sacrifices and maintaining my agressive stance than in any other game i've played... Although i'll admit i made some mistakes as well .... I'm playing black 
Big thanks to my opponent lethalia for the fun game"
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"not a very agressive second move, i think this negates most of his advantage as white.... a recurrant theme for white in the beginning of this game seems to be defensive moves"

11,Bh2,f4h2,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2nbpn2/3p4/3P4/P3P2P/1PP2PPB/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 2 6,offer declined.... but in such a way as to prevent a break in his pawn structure
12,Ne4,f6e4,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2nbp3/3p4/3Pn3/P3P2P/1PP2PPB/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 3 7,"what was i thinking here? if he plays f3, i have to retreat, but the knight on his kingside will only be able to go to e2, perhaps i should have made a more agressive decision"
13,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2nbp3/3p4/3Pn3/P3PN1P/1PP2PPB/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 4 7,i should have traded bishops before making that last move in order to prevent him from castling and to cause him to waste a move getting his rook back to his back rank.... hindsight is 20 20
