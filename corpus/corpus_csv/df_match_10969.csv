1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Very solid and very popular. In the opening few moves, aim to establish a strong presence in the center of the board. Think of d4, d5, e4, and e5 as a big hill in the middle of a battlefield. Any general will tell you that it is imperative to control the ""high ground""."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Scandanavian Defense. Black intends to rip open the center immediately and claim it for himself.
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"?! Not neccessarily a bad move, just a little passive. White generally has a better game if he plays 2. exd or 2. e5. The risk of this knight move is that black can claim more space and attack the white Nc3 if he plays 2...d4."
4,dxe4,d5e4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/4p3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Black opts to remove the pawn presence in the middle of the board, with hopes of getting both of his knights and both bishops developed quickly and exerting influence over those now vacated squares."
5,Nxe4,c3e4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/4N3/8/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"White maintains material equality, however this knight is now on an awkward square and can be attacked."
6,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/5b2/4N3/8/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"Black safely develops a piece with ""tempo"". I won't go into a lengthy discussion on ""tempo"". If you don't understand that concept just message me."
7,Bd3,f1d3,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/5b2/4N3/3B4/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 2 4,"? Very suspect move. That is an awful square for white's light squared bishop, as it restricts the development of the other bishop AND blocks the d2 pawn from advancing."
8,e6,e7e6,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/5b2/4N3/3B4/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,Black now has safe squares for all of his pieces to develop to.
9,Nf3,g1f3,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/5b2/4N3/3B1N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,"Not bad.....white can now castle. But think about this........Look at the board. White has 3 pieces developed, black has only 1. White should win the race to get pieces developed, right? Not neccessarily, as black can safely get his pieces out in numerous, immediate ways. White must waste ""time"" (another concept to learn) to deal with the problems caused by 4. Bd3."
10,Ne7,g8e7,rn1qkb1r/ppp1nppp/4p3/5b2/4N3/3B1N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 6,"Obviously not where this knight will reside for any length of time. Black probably intends to move it again on the next move, as it will get another gun into the fight for the center."
11,O-O,e1g1,rn1qkb1r/ppp1nppp/4p3/5b2/4N3/3B1N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 3 6,"Logical. Since the king is now safely tucked away, white MUST get developed on the queenside."
12,Nd5,e7d5,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4p3/3n1b2/4N3/3B1N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 4 7,"Black stays true to form, and will strictly develop over the next few moves."
13,Qe2,d1e2,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4p3/3n1b2/4N3/3B1N2/PPPPQPPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 5 7,"?! Again - not bad, just passive. White MUST address the problems of the d pawn and the the dark squared bishop."
14,Nd7,b8d7,r2qkb1r/pppn1ppp/4p3/3n1b2/4N3/3B1N2/PPPPQPPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 6 8,Black accelerates development knowing he can catch up rapidly and be the instigator of the the first attacking sequence of the game.
15,Bc4,d3c4,r2qkb1r/pppn1ppp/4p3/3n1b2/2B1N3/5N2/PPPPQPPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 7 8,! Nice. White finally realizes his weakness and deals with it in a strong manner.
16,Be7,f8e7,r2qk2r/pppnbppp/4p3/3n1b2/2B1N3/5N2/PPPPQPPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 8 9,Preparing 0-0.
17,d4,d2d4,r2qk2r/pppnbppp/4p3/3n1b2/2BPN3/5N2/PPP1QPPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 0 9,"This move is a coin flip with 9. d3.  As played, white claims space in center - but the d pawn must be protected. 9.d3 is more conservative, as the dark squared bishop still gets out but the d pawn is already protected by the c pawn."
18,O-O,e8g8,r2q1rk1/pppnbppp/4p3/3n1b2/2BPN3/5N2/PPP1QPPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 1 10,As planned.
19,Bd2,c1d2,r2q1rk1/pppnbppp/4p3/3n1b2/2BPN3/5N2/PPPBQPPP/R4RK1 b - - 2 10,Safe and solid development. Check out the possibility of 10.Bg5 if you are the attacking style of player.
20,a6,a7a6,r2q1rk1/1ppnbppp/p3p3/3n1b2/2BPN3/5N2/PPPBQPPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 11,"?! Somewhat limited options exist for piece placement, so black shores up his queenside defense."
