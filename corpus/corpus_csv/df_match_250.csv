1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was a very painful loss. I've played this young man a few times before, but this was the first time for over a year. A couple of my previous games with him I have annotated, http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/revenge?gm=56196

2,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,This was the first surprise. In previous games he had defended with the King's Indian Defence.
3,g3,g2g3,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/3P4/6P1/PPP1PP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"The usual reply to the Dutch Defence.

4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/ppppp2p/6p1/5p2/3P4/6P1/PPP1PP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Look a bit like he wants to head into a King's Indian formation where f7-f5 has already be played.
5,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppppp2p/6p1/5p2/2PP4/6P1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"This is also a common move for white at some stage, against the Dutch Defence."
6,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk1nr/ppppp1bp/6p1/5p2/2PP4/6P1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,Black completes his fianchetto.
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk1nr/ppppp1bp/6p1/5p2/2PP4/2N3P1/PP2PP1P/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 4,I want to play e2-e4.
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqk2r/ppppp1bp/5np1/5p2/2PP4/2N3P1/PP2PP1P/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 3 5,he stops it - at least for now.
9,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqk2r/ppppp1bp/5np1/5p2/2PP4/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 4 5,I threaten e2-e4 again.
10,d6,d7d6,rnbqk2r/ppp1p1bp/3p1np1/5p2/2PP4/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,Another common move for black in this variation.
11,e4,e2e4,rnbqk2r/ppp1p1bp/3p1np1/5p2/2PPP3/2N3P1/PP3PBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 6,So I play it.
12,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1p1bp/3p1np1/5p2/2PPP3/2N3P1/PP3PBP/R1BQK1NR w KQ - 1 7,He castles.
13,Nge2,g1e2,rnbq1rk1/ppp1p1bp/3p1np1/5p2/2PPP3/2N3P1/PP2NPBP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 2 7,"Not Nf6?? of course, breaking the protection of the pawn on e4 with my bishop. Now my plan is to play 0-0 and e4-e5, if he lets me."
14,c6,c7c6,rnbq1rk1/pp2p1bp/2pp1np1/5p2/2PPP3/2N3P1/PP2NPBP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 8,"Another reasonable move, blunting my Bg2 a little, so instance if I take on f5 he can take back with his Bc8 which he couldn't before."
15,O-O,e1g1,rnbq1rk1/pp2p1bp/2pp1np1/5p2/2PPP3/2N3P1/PP2NPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 8,So I continue with my plan.
16,Qe8,d8e8,rnb1qrk1/pp2p1bp/2pp1np1/5p2/2PPP3/2N3P1/PP2NPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 2 9,"I can't see this move in my databases, and I think it is a mistake to allow e4-e5, although in my databases I have come across two games where black allows e4-e5. The Gameknot game frodan (1760) vs. peacemaker (1704) continued with 8....Bc8-d7 and white continued with 9. f4 and then black played fxe4. This game ended in a draw. Trindade Rui Jorge Rodrigues (2063) vs. Costa Joao Guerra (2082) continued with 8....Na6 and once again white didn't advance and black eventually won."
