12,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,Soon to come is Qf3.  I've got several choices here including the strange looking Qc7.  However I choose to remain solid and play Be7 also good is Nd7.

18,Nbd7,b8d7,r1b1k2r/1pqnbppp/p2ppn2/6B1/3NPP2/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/2KR1B1R w kq - 5 10,Gaining more control over e5 and this knight is very well placed for blacks defense.

21,Bxf6,g5f6,r1b1k2r/2qnbppp/p2ppB2/1p6/3NPPP1/2N2Q2/PPP4P/2KR1B1R b kq - 0 11,I have many options here.  I'm not sure that my move was that great...  Nxf6 Bxf6 and gxf6 all work.  I'm under the opinion that Nxf6 is best here.
22,gxf6,g7f6,r1b1k2r/2qnbp1p/p2ppp2/1p6/3NPPP1/2N2Q2/PPP4P/2KR1B1R w kq - 0 12,opening the g-file for my rook.  However now my king is trapped in the center and white is going to be pushing pawns against me soon.
23,f5,f4f5,r1b1k2r/2qnbp1p/p2ppp2/1p3P2/3NP1P1/2N2Q2/PPP4P/2KR1B1R b kq - 0 12,?! e5 was better making the center static and easier to play against.  However I couldn't help but play this move because of the space left behind.
24,Ne5,d7e5,r1b1k2r/2q1bp1p/p2ppp2/1p2nP2/3NP1P1/2N2Q2/PPP4P/2KR1B1R w kq - 1 13,?! e5 was better making the center static and easier to play against.  However I couldn't help but play this move because of the space left behind.

I felt in game that white should win the race but my queen is hard to deal with on this square so white eliminates the threat.  This is still a very good move because white is up a pawn and my king is very open.
38,Qxb3,a4b3,2r4r/1b2bk1p/p2p1p2/4nN2/1p2P1P1/1q6/PPP1N1BP/2KR3R w - - 0 20,"I had other plays here but I felt this to be the best continuation.  I'd rather be aggressive than passive, but this does allow white to enter my position."
