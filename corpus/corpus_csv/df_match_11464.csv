6,Nxd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3n4/3P4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"A little unorthadox, I think, but by no means bad."

9,e4,e2e4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/6p1/3n4/3PP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,A nice central pawn structure.

12,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/2P5/P4PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 7,"At this point, the beginnings of an idea to attack what I assume will be black's castled position arise."
13,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/2PB4/P4PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 2 7,"At this point, the beginnings of an idea to attack what I assume will be black's castled position arise."
14,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/2PB4/P4PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQ - 3 8,To restrict black's light squared bishop (which at this stage I'm a little scared of as it is still very strong.
15,h3,h2h3,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/2PB3P/P4PP1/R1BQK1NR b KQ - 0 8,To restrict black's light squared bishop (which at this stage I'm a little scared of as it is still very strong.
16,Bd7,c8d7,rn1q1rk1/pppbppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/2PB3P/P4PP1/R1BQK1NR w KQ - 1 9,"? This move just ""feels"" wrong. I would have expected b6 or Nc6 at this point."
17,e5,e4e5,rn1q1rk1/pppbppbp/6p1/4P3/3P4/2PB3P/P4PP1/R1BQK1NR b KQ - 0 9,"Opening the way for white's light squared bishop, and further restricting black's dark squared one."
18,c6,c7c6,rn1q1rk1/pp1bppbp/2p3p1/4P3/3P4/2PB3P/P4PP1/R1BQK1NR w KQ - 0 10,Another questionable move. Black has just effectively retarded his Nb8.
19,Nf3,g1f3,rn1q1rk1/pp1bppbp/2p3p1/4P3/3P4/2PB1N1P/P4PP1/R1BQK2R b KQ - 1 10,I'm guessing my opponent started feeling the walls closing in on his position and wanted to open things up. This pawn move just weakened the squares around his king even further.
20,f6,f7f6,rn1q1rk1/pp1bp1bp/2p2pp1/4P3/3P4/2PB1N1P/P4PP1/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 11,I'm guessing my opponent started feeling the walls closing in on his position and wanted to open things up. This pawn move just weakened the squares around his king even further.
21,O-O,e1g1,rn1q1rk1/pp1bp1bp/2p2pp1/4P3/3P4/2PB1N1P/P4PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 11,And now the race is on. Can black get his pieces over to defend in time?
22,fxe5,f6e5,rn1q1rk1/pp1bp1bp/2p3p1/4p3/3P4/2PB1N1P/P4PP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 12,And now the race is on. Can black get his pieces over to defend in time?
23,Nxe5,f3e5,rn1q1rk1/pp1bp1bp/2p3p1/4N3/3P4/2PB3P/P4PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 12,And now the race is on. Can black get his pieces over to defend in time?

25,dxe5,d4e5,rn1q1rk1/pp1bp2p/2p3p1/4P3/8/2PB3P/P4PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 13,And now the race is on. Can black get his pieces over to defend in time?
26,Qc7,d8c7,rn3rk1/ppqbp2p/2p3p1/4P3/8/2PB3P/P4PP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 14,"With the idea of a pawn grab, but notice that black has a knight with only one available square to move to (which is weak at best) and a rook that couldn't move even if it were on fire."
27,f4,f2f4,rn3rk1/ppqbp2p/2p3p1/4P3/5P2/2PB3P/P5P1/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 14,Activating the strength of white's Rf1 and preparing for a pawn storm.
28,c5,c6c5,rn3rk1/ppqbp2p/6p1/2p1P3/5P2/2PB3P/P5P1/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 15,Black finally opens up a space for his knight.
29,Bb2,c1b2,rn3rk1/ppqbp2p/6p1/2p1P3/5P2/2PB3P/PB4P1/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 15,"Delivering a check by Bc4 or Qb3 would simply be a waste of time here. With Bb2, white now threatens to OWN the dark squares around black's king."
30,Rd8,f8d8,rn1r2k1/ppqbp2p/6p1/2p1P3/5P2/2PB3P/PB4P1/R2Q1RK1 w - - 2 16,Possibly thinking of a discovered attack on white's queen. The problem is.......
31,Qc2,d1c2,rn1r2k1/ppqbp2p/6p1/2p1P3/5P2/2PB3P/PBQ3P1/R4RK1 b - - 3 16,"......by thinking that ""forcing"" her to move, the resulting square of destination for white's queen actually bolsters white's attack further."
32,Kg7,g8g7,rn1r4/ppqbp1kp/6p1/2p1P3/5P2/2PB3P/PBQ3P1/R4RK1 w - - 4 17,? I have no idea what that was about.  Black's king has better be wearing Kevlar.
33,c4,c3c4,rn1r4/ppqbp1kp/6p1/2p1P3/2P2P2/3B3P/PBQ3P1/R4RK1 b - - 0 17,Seeking to win a bishop while delivering a check by playing e6.
34,Be6,d7e6,rn1r4/ppq1p1kp/4b1p1/2p1P3/2P2P2/3B3P/PBQ3P1/R4RK1 w - - 1 18,And the fireworks begin. White is now preparing to throw everything including the kitchen sink towards black's king.
35,f5,f4f5,rn1r4/ppq1p1kp/4b1p1/2p1PP2/2P5/3B3P/PBQ3P1/R4RK1 b - - 0 18,And the fireworks begin. White is now preparing to throw everything including the kitchen sink towards black's king.
