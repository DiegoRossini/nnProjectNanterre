1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game features an interesting positional battle in the modern French Classical.  I'm not an e4 player and I haven't played 1...e6 since discovering the Sicilian, however, I can't resist playing in a French tournament.  The positions are always interesting, with plenty of play for both sides.  As usual, I won't annotate the basic opening moves, which should be common knowledge."
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"This seems like a good place to start the annotation.  Instead of 5. f4 leading to the Steinitz, this move betokens the modern treatment of the Classical.  The idea is for White to create a ""super-center"" with c3, f4, and Nf3.  In these positions, the standard break at ...f6 is not so good as it leaves Black with a terminally weakened pawn structure.  This is a fact which determines this game, even though we leave book very early.  Anand has played this several times with great effect.  For some truly amazing games, check out Anand-Shirov, 2000 and Anand-Morozevich, 2000."

By exchanging the knight from c4, I keep the position simple and advantageous for the White pieces.  Black gets the d5-square for his pieces, but I get the e4-square for my knight after I castle, as a bishop capture on c3 would only strengthen my center and then Nd2-e4 would come anyway.  Black also has an isolated pawn on e6, which will be a problem later.  This capture seems like a good example of choosing to use superior technique over complications."
