1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"My current favourite as white, a flexible move that allows me to reach many of my favourite openings whilst avioding those I'm not so keen on. For example i can still reach the sicilian if Black plays 1...c5 and i avoid the possibility of the symetrical kings pawn openings."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 2,A common and flexible responce. From here the game usually transposes to one of many Queens pawn openings.
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,"White is first to commit in the centre, and this does infer a slight disadvantage as black can aim for the Grunfeld where white has already committed his Kings Knight to f3 where it is susceptible to a nasty pin by Blacks White Squared Bishop."
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,Black appears to be aiming for a Modern Benoni type position.
5,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,Black appears to be aiming for a Modern Benoni type position.
6,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,Black appears to be aiming for a Modern Benoni type position.
7,d5,d4d5,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2pP4/2P5/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"?! an unusual move so early on in this set up, Black does usually try to expand on the queenside but not at such an early stage!"
8,a6,a7a6,rnbqkb1r/1p1p1ppp/p3pn2/2pP4/2P5/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"?! an unusual move so early on in this set up, Black does usually try to expand on the queenside but not at such an early stage!"
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/1p1p1ppp/p3pn2/2pP4/2P5/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"Simply developing, this also meets the threat of ...b5 although I'm not sure how strong that move would be it's always frustrating when your opponent stops you from achieving your aims."
10,Qa5,d8a5,rnb1kb1r/1p1p1ppp/p3pn2/q1pP4/2P5/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,"!? Black is quite obsessed with forcing the ...b5 advance but it cannot be achieved, at least not by this move."
11,Bd2,c1d2,rnb1kb1r/1p1p1ppp/p3pn2/q1pP4/2P5/2N2N2/PP1BPPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 3 6,Preventing the advance with a threat on the Black Queen.
12,Qc7,a5c7,rnb1kb1r/1pqp1ppp/p3pn2/2pP4/2P5/2N2N2/PP1BPPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 4 7,"!? Preventing the Dark Squared Bishop taking up its natural post on f4, but at the cost of allowing white to play e4 before black has exchanged on d5, although after the earlier Queen detour Black must allow the e4 advance anyway."
13,e4,e2e4,rnb1kb1r/1pqp1ppp/p3pn2/2pP4/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP1B1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"?! Black chooses to block the centre up entirely, however his Queen in now somewhat misplaced as Black obviously intends to play ...d6."
14,e5,e6e5,rnb1kb1r/1pqp1ppp/p4n2/2pPp3/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP1B1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,"?! Black chooses to block the centre up entirely, however his Queen in now somewhat misplaced as Black obviously intends to play ...d6."
15,Bd3,f1d3,rnb1kb1r/1pqp1ppp/p4n2/2pPp3/2P1P3/2NB1N2/PP1B1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 8,?! I think the Bishop is better placed on e2 but i played it here as i had some vague ideas about forcing the centre open when the bishop would sit nicely on the b1-h7 diagonal.
16,d6,d7d6,rnb1kb1r/1pq2ppp/p2p1n2/2pPp3/2P1P3/2NB1N2/PP1B1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 9,The pin may look annoying but the bishop only provides tempi for a kingside pawn storm...
17,O-O,e1g1,rnb1kb1r/1pq2ppp/p2p1n2/2pPp3/2P1P3/2NB1N2/PP1B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 1 9,The pin may look annoying but the bishop only provides tempi for a kingside pawn storm...

20,Bh5,g4h5,rn2kb1r/1pq2ppp/p2p1n2/2pPp2b/2P1P3/2NB1N1P/PP1B1PP1/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 1 11,obviously with the desire to maintain the apparently awkward pin but with such a closed centre and Black low level of development white can afford to push on kingside inspite of his king being there

22,Bg6,h5g6,rn2kb1r/1pq2ppp/p2p1nb1/2pPp3/2P1P1P1/2NB1N1P/PP1B1P2/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 1 12,getting out of the f pawns way
23,Nh4,f3h4,rn2kb1r/1pq2ppp/p2p1nb1/2pPp3/2P1P1PN/2NB3P/PP1B1P2/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 2 12,getting out of the f pawns way
24,Be7,f8e7,rn2k2r/1pq1bppp/p2p1nb1/2pPp3/2P1P1PN/2NB3P/PP1B1P2/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 3 13,Exposing the white king but as Capablanca said a weakness is only weak if it can be attacked. The central pawns cover the diagonals nicely and stop the Black forces from crossing to the kingside quickly.
25,f4,f2f4,rn2k2r/1pq1bppp/p2p1nb1/2pPp3/2P1PPPN/2NB3P/PP1B4/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 13,Exposing the white king but as Capablanca said a weakness is only weak if it can be attacked. The central pawns cover the diagonals nicely and stop the Black forces from crossing to the kingside quickly.

27,Bxf4,d2f4,rn2k2r/1pq1bppp/p2p1nb1/2pP4/2P1PBPN/2NB3P/PP6/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 14,aiming at e5.
