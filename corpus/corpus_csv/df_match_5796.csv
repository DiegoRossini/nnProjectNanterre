1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"In this game my many early mistakes were overcome, while my opponent's late mistake proved fatal.  My opening was actually very well put together."
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,at this point im thinking about getting one of those center pawns to the 5th rank
3,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,at this point im thinking about getting one of those center pawns to the 5th rank
4,Bb4+,f8b4,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/1b1PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,check
5,c3,c2c3,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/1b1PP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,back the truck up buddy
6,Ba5,b4a5,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/4p3/b7/3PP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,5th rank and the great wall is complete
7,e5,e4e5,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/4p3/b3P3/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,5th rank and the great wall is complete
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n1p3/b3P3/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,right about here I started thinking about possibilities on that wide open kingside...
9,Qg4,d1g4,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n1p3/b3P3/3P2Q1/2P5/PP3PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 2 5,thought #1 trap that rook in the corner
10,Kf8,e8f8,r1bq1knr/pppp1ppp/2n1p3/b3P3/3P2Q1/2P5/PP3PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQ - 3 6,Kf8 ends that thought... but opens up fork possibilities and a lot of them.  pretty far off though.  Right here i think black should have played g6.
11,Nf3,g1f3,r1bq1knr/pppp1ppp/2n1p3/b3P3/3P2Q1/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQ - 4 6,thought #2: get that knight to f7
12,d5,d7d5,r1bq1knr/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/b2pP3/3P2Q1/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQ d6 0 7,"not worried about that move, but it frees black queen a bit"
13,Qf4,g4f4,r1bq1knr/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/b2pP3/3P1Q2/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQ - 1 7,pressure on f7

15,Ng5,f3g5,r1bq1knr/ppp2ppp/1bn1p3/3pP1N1/3P1Q2/2P5/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQ - 3 8,meanwhile im setting up this fork and its going swell...
16,h6,h7h6,r1bq1knr/ppp2pp1/1bn1p2p/3pP1N1/3P1Q2/2P5/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQ - 0 9,black threatens the knight i want to move anyways...  unfortunately im about to get greedy and make my first mistake...  let me just admire my handywork setting this up before i move to 9.
17,Nxe6+,g5e6,r1bq1knr/ppp2pp1/1bn1N2p/3pP3/3P1Q2/2P5/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQ - 0 9,"so with two forking possibilities i got greedy and went for the queen, and didnt see the bishop.  should have went Nxf7"
18,Bxe6,c8e6,r2q1knr/ppp2pp1/1bn1b2p/3pP3/3P1Q2/2P5/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQ - 0 10,with that idea over i need to develop some pieces
19,Bd3,f1d3,r2q1knr/ppp2pp1/1bn1b2p/3pP3/3P1Q2/2PB4/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 1 10,with that idea over i need to develop some pieces
