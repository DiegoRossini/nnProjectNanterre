1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Alright,I decided to play d4. I used to play d4 all the time before but now i prefer e4. after you play d4 so many times you get tired of it and e4 has so many different variations that you wanna try. I tried switching to english,looking up some satisfactionary main lines but I judged that they are to similar to d4 openings and I usually run out of ideas in english."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"Normal move. I have met c5 (old benoni) d5 (Queens gambit after 2.c4) and e6 (usually transposes into Nimzo-indian) and one time i played against g6. I had the advantage but i made a misstake move,i went for a combination and over-looked a move which completely won. It was a real game and my opponent had 2036 in rating."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Normal move. You can also play 2. Bg5,that's the ''Trompovsky attack'' however i have studdied in trompovsky and figured out that black gets a better game if he knows his stuff in that opening i mean i play as black 1.d4 Nf6 2.Bg5 Ne4 with unclear positions even tho i think black gets the advantage. 2.e3 and 2.c3 is a bit passive since c4 grips the d5 square. 2.c3 also prevents that knight from developing to c3. I think you can also play 2.Nf3 with the idea of delaying c4 a move just to confuse your enemy a little bit. It worked well against me."
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"black can play c5 (modern benoni) or g6 (grunfeld/KID) as well. This looks Nimzo-indian like. But it doesnt have to be a Nimzo-indian even tho it looks to me the most popular setup in this position. It can become a Queens-indian and even a Modern Benoni again after 3. ... c5. So yeah,again this is book so far."
5,g3,g2g3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/6P1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"I enjoyed playing the Catalan (3. g3) before,despite that i usually played wrong moves in the opening ^^. White can also play Nc3 and Nf3 in this position. both are different main lines."
6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/6P1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Black plays normal here. he can also play c5,that's also a variation."
7,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 4,"inviting black to take the c-pawn. The advantage is that i get a big diagonal for my bishop,pressuring that b7 square."
8,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 5,"Black chose not to take the pawn. If he takes it is a Catalan Open. If he doesn't it's called Catalan Closed. but he can take that pawn later,transposing it into a catalan open."
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 5,It is neccessary to develop that knight. It looks like it is blocking the g2 bishop but the knight can go to e5 in some occasions.
10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 4 6,"Alright Both of us castles. So far it's book. Look at this position. I enjoy this position as white. the way white's king is so well protected by three pieces and 4 pawns, and has two center pawns dealing with the center."
11,O-O,e1g1,rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 5 6,"Alright Both of us castles. So far it's book. Look at this position. I enjoy this position as white. the way white's king is so well protected by three pieces and 4 pawns, and has two center pawns dealing with the center."
12,c5,c7c5,rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/4pn2/2pp4/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 0 7,i think c5 is a main line move. Black can also play the more normal 6. ... dxc4 7. Qc2 a6 8.Qxc4 b5 9.Qc2 Bb7. I think this is a main line move too. It was a while i played against it.
13,Nc3,b1c3,rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/4pn2/2pp4/2PP4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 7,Simpel development.
14,cxd4,c5d4,rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/4pn2/3p4/2Pp4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 8,And black decided to clarify the situation. i think Nc6 is also a move.
15,Nxd4,f3d4,rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/4pn2/3p4/2PN4/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 8,If white takes with the queen black wins tempo with Nc6. Now we can also see that white frees the g2 bishop.
16,Nc6,b8c6,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/3p4/2PN4/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 9,Okay. I haven't read any main line that goes like this. From here i tried to play as good as i can.
17,cxd5,c4d5,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/3P4/3N4/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 9,Boy i dont know. i think leaving that c-pawn there might have been better. The point of this move is to give black the isolated queens pawn.
18,exd5,e6d5,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2n2n2/3p4/3N4/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 10,I have actually played this position against black before. But i tried 10. b3 Bc5 11.Nxc6 bxc6 12.Na4 Bd6 13. Bb2 Be6 14. Rc1 and we see how well i cover the black squares and stop that passed-backwards-c-pawn. the game went on 14. ... Rc8 15.Nc5 Qe7 16. Qd4 with a small advantage to white (i went on to win that game). I decided that i wanted to try something else in this position and e4 looks fine to me.
19,e4,e2e4,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2n2n2/3p4/3NP3/2N3P1/PP3PBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 10,I have actually played this position against black before. But i tried 10. b3 Bc5 11.Nxc6 bxc6 12.Na4 Bd6 13. Bb2 Be6 14.

20,Bc5,e7c5,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2n2n2/2bp4/3NP3/2N3P1/PP3PBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 11,"Bc5. Uh,i think it's an okay move,it's diffcult to judge for me but after..."
21,Nb3,d4b3,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2n2n2/2bp4/4P3/1NN3P1/PP3PBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 2 11,Nb3 it's getting difficult for black. I am attacking his bishop and questioning his bishop pair.
22,d4,d5d4,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2n2n2/2b5/3pP3/1NN3P1/PP3PBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 12,He tried d4. it was perhaps the best move.
