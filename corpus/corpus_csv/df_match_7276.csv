1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I'm white in this game. 
I often play e4 because you can transpose it afterwards to lots and lots of systems of pawns and pieces (i.e. Scotch opening, Centre game, Kings Indian Attack, and so on.) and also because it can be very sharp"
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,The Sicilian Defence. A very good and common response for black against e4 but it can be risky too if black's not accustomed to it.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"The Chekhover variation (B53) from the Sicilian
I like this move a lot, it's opening good lines for white and weakning the queenside of the black player

EDIT : It isn't the Chekhover variation, it's the main line (thanks to fatcat)"

6,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Qxd4 is also playable but, in the first moves, a Knight in the centre is a better advantage than a queen in the centre, in my opinion"

8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"The two white knights are now very powerful. The two white bishops are controlling full lines and are free of movement.
A good position for white, much more developed than black are (black bishop totally blocked, unable to castle) and with very space"

10,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 3 6,"Quite an agressive move. An exchange, maybe?"

12,e5,e7e5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2np1n2/4p1B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,?! The first idea is to gain space but it's pining his Queen and complicating the game very early with various possible exchange variants.
13,Bxf6,g5f6,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2np1B2/4p3/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,7... gxf6 was strangely better

This move places the Knight in centre, the best position for him."
