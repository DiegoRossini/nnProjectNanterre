1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,So the game started with e4.
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"d5 for the Scandinavian Defence. I know it's a defence that comes after: Sicilian, e5, Frence, Caro Cann and g6 but it has become useful for me and a defence i can rely on."
3,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"He took the pawn, the only logical move."
4,Qxd5,d8d5,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,I play the Lasker variation and i am not used to Nf6 positions. I know the early outcoming of the Queen may cause some problems but still it's a respected reply.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,Logical developing a piece.
6,Qa5,d5a5,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/q7/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"And now Qa5 is the variation i am playing. Others are Qd8, Qd6 (a modern one) and Qe5+. My opinion here is that Qa5 is the best."
7,d3,d2d3,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/q7/8/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,d3!? Awkard move blocking the LS Bishop and also did not challenge the e5 and c5 squares. Best here is d4.
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/q7/8/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,A logical move for black developing a piece and challenge the e4 square.
9,Be2,f1e2,rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/q7/8/2NP4/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 2 5,Be2 is a passive move for white. I see no reason to play that. Maybe Bf4 is better or Nf3.
10,c6,c7c6,rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/q7/8/2NP4/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,This is an important move for that defence opening space for to Queen too.
11,Nf3,g1f3,rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/q7/8/2NP1N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,Nf3 is ok. I think white has to decide which way he's gonna castle: 0-0 or 0-0-0. Going for 0-0-0 helps white better and causes more serious problems to black. From my experience from Gameknot and from blitz games 0-0 is better for black.
12,Bf5,c8f5,rn2kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/q4b2/8/2NP1N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 7,"Another main-line move for black. Here always  comes the question Bf5 or Bg4. I have used both in past but i slightly prefer Bf5, at least in a non blitz game."
13,O-O,e1g1,rn2kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/q4b2/8/2NP1N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 3 7,Logical move as 0-0-0 has to move his bishop and Queen.
14,e6,e7e6,rn2kb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/q4b2/8/2NP1N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,"e6 is an important and main-line move too, protecting the bishop and the 'dangerous' d5 square."
15,Bd2,c1d2,rn2kb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/q4b2/8/2NP1N2/PPPBBPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 1 8,White can always play that move as the Queen has to be retreated. Other option is Bf5.
16,Qc7,a5c7,rn2kb1r/ppq2ppp/2p1pn2/5b2/8/2NP1N2/PPPBBPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 2 9,So the Queen is moved to a safe place.
17,Bg5,d2g5,rn2kb1r/ppq2ppp/2p1pn2/5bB1/8/2NP1N2/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 3 9,"Now this losses a tempo. White plays the same piece two times in row. Re1 would be better. The 'problem' for white is his LS Bishop as he's blocking the Queen's view. On the other hand this is a main set up for black with e6, c6, Bf5 and Qc7."
18,Nbd7,b8d7,r3kb1r/ppqn1ppp/2p1pn2/5bB1/8/2NP1N2/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 4 10,Protecting the knight on f6 and open the line for a possible 0-0-0.
19,d4,d3d4,r3kb1r/ppqn1ppp/2p1pn2/5bB1/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 10,d4 a good move. White should have played it at once and not d3 and then d4.
20,h6,h7h6,r3kb1r/ppqn1pp1/2p1pn1p/5bB1/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 11,I was between opening my DS Bishop and h3. I played h3 to unpin the knight on f6.
