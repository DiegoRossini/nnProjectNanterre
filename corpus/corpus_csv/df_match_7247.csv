14,Kd7,e8d7,rn1q1b1r/pp1kpBpp/8/2p3N1/4pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 1 8,"Here, in my opinion, the best move for black is 8. ... Ke8, which I played. However, there is the possibility that white tries to draw the game by 3-repetition rule. Anyway, I always try this move and will see what white does. If it doesn't go for 9. Bf7+, then black can be an attacker; otherwise the next best move could be 10. ... Kc6. In that case, white will take the position of attacker and black should defend for a while."

18,e5,e7e5,rn1qkb1r/pp4pp/8/2p1p1N1/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 0 10,"Since my king is not in c6, this move cannot be as risky as Dana Mackenzie explained in Chess Lecture. So white cannot go for 10. Nf7 as black king is attacking the f7 square."
19,Nxe4,g5e4,rn1qkb1r/pp4pp/8/2p1p3/4NPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 0 10,"Kind of expected as e4 pawn was unprotected; and if white didn't play that, probably black would go for 10. ... e5xf4 and then white needed to move his knight anyway."
20,Qh4+,d8h4,rn2kb1r/pp4pp/8/2p1p3/4NPBq/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 1 11,"The black queen was released and activated. So from now on, as you will see, the white's job is so hard!!! Because the other bishop of white is still inactive, while the black queen is active."
21,Nf2,e4f2,rn2kb1r/pp4pp/8/2p1p3/5PBq/8/PPPP1NPP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 2 11,"Best move for white, as the knight is covering the king and also protecting the bishop at the same time."

26,h5,h7h5,rn2k2r/pp4p1/3b4/2p4p/5pBq/2N5/PPPP1NPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 0 14,Attacking the bishop to engaged white and force him to defend. This will prevent him from developing his pieces well.

29,Bf5,h3f5,rn2k2r/pp6/3b4/2p2Bpp/5p1q/2N5/PPPP1NPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 1 15,White bishop escaped from being trapped.
30,Be5,d6e5,rn2k2r/pp6/8/2p1bBpp/5p1q/2N5/PPPP1NPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 2 16,Don't really remember why I did this move!! Maybe to prevent of being checked by white's rook so saving time.
31,Re1,f1e1,rn2k2r/pp6/8/2p1bBpp/5p1q/2N5/PPPP1NPP/R1B1R1K1 b - - 3 16,Protecting the bishop as my attack's plan was based on its later protection for queen.

34,Kd8,e8d8,r2k3r/pp1n4/8/1Np1bBpp/5p1q/8/PPPP1NPP/R1B1R1K1 w - - 6 18,"By considering the above theory, even though the bishop was protecting c7 and d6 squares, I decided to move my king from fork and check situation by white's knight."
