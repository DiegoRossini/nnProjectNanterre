An aspect of my game I've been missing is generating threats with moves and the abuse of outposts and watching higher players play and comment their games makes you learn a thing or two. 

So todays game will demonstrate the use of an Outpost that generates checkmate threats and what happens when that threat is overlooked."

Also why I like annotating here on gameknot, I rarely see nimsovich opening annotations by black. I have a few in my repertoire of annotations now but all with different lines. Thus why I like this opening."

White doesn't allow for my favorite Gambit here and I prefer the scandanavian defense with d5."
4,d5,d7d5,r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Very rare that in multiple days time control I get an exchange on d5.

6,Bf5,c8f5,r2qkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3pPb2/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,Natural opening moves done here. White tends to take different routes at this point. They can develop their other knight play either bishops or sometimes their c pawn tend to be the 4 pieces that will move.

9,Bd3,f1d3,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/3pPb2/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,My opponent goes bd3 here and in the past when facing this I would always exchange lsb's here and let their queen come out.
10,Bg6,f5g6,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n1p1b1/3pP3/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 6,This I stole from my recent internet viewings. I quite like letting white do the exchange and not letting his queen out. And if he wants to open my h file all the better. Nimso games where I get a queen side castle tend to go well for me.
11,c3,c2c3,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n1p1b1/3pP3/3P4/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,And with c3 and his queen not out I can strike at the middle right away. Usually f6 would have to come at a safer time if lsb's were off the board and whites queen had roaming ability.

13,Bxg6+,d3g6,r2qkbnr/ppp3pp/2n1ppB1/3pP3/3P4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,And so white gives the open file but I guess h3 is to hinder rook exit somewhat. Although what I like about the opening of the h file is not to take the rook out necessarily but the threats this open file can give if white castles king side.
14,hxg6,h7g6,r2qkbnr/ppp3p1/2n1ppp1/3pP3/3P4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,And so white gives the open file but I guess h3 is to hinder rook exit somewhat.

17,Bf4,c1f4,r2qkb1r/ppp1n1p1/2n1ppp1/3pP3/3P1B2/2P2N1P/PP3PP1/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 2 9,Discomfort the dsb and gain space for Knight also this was to invite dxf6 to undouble my pawns. But white doesn't want a nice Outpost for his Knight on d5.

23,Rg1,h1g1,r2qkb1r/ppp3p1/2n1pp2/3pP1p1/3P3n/2P2N1P/PP2QPPB/RN2K1R1 b Qkq - 5 12,But when he replied this I judged that letting him exchange wouldn't be good anymore and since he doesn't seem to want to exchange on f6 I don't mind tempting him with letting him open the file
24,Nxf3+,h4f3,r2qkb1r/ppp3p1/2n1pp2/3pP1p1/3P4/2P2n1P/PP2QPPB/RN2K1R1 w Qkq - 0 13,He didn't accept my generous double pawn offer :)
