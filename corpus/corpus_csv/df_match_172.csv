11,Ne2,c3e2,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/1B6/3pP3/8/PPPPNPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"I like the more aggressive e5 here, offering knight exchange."

13,f3,f2f3,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/1B6/3pn3/5P2/PPPPN1PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,"Better to castle or perhaps d3, though castle and getting the king to safety is the better play."
14,Nd6,e4d6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/3n4/1B6/3p4/5P2/PPPPN1PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 8,I also considered Nc5.
15,Bd3,b5d3,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/3n4/8/3p4/3B1P2/PPPPN1PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 8,"I also thought White could have played Nxd4, but some prefer bishops to knights."

Also, this move basically encourages trading a bishop for something else with a pawn push, making it a negative play."
18,c4,c5c4,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/3n4/8/2pp4/2PB1P2/PP1PN1PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 10,Natural follow up
19,Bc2,d3c2,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/3n4/8/2pp4/2P2P2/PPBPN1PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 10,"The best play was Bb1, this move is now going to trade a piece for a pawn."
20,d3,d4d3,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/3n4/8/2p5/2Pp1P2/PPBPN1PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 11,"I like that he took right away, getting the pin over with."

22,cxd3,c4d3,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/3n4/8/8/2Pp1P2/PP1PN1PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 12,I think Nf4 would be more natural here.

25,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk2r/pp1pbppp/3n4/8/3N4/2Pp1P2/PP1P2PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 3 13,Perhaps White is looking to acquire the pawn on d3?  A better play would be to get the DSB in action by moving the b pawn.  Once you castle your development isn't complete until you connect your rooks.

Also, there is an open vertical to the king and if I can pincer that knight by eventually moving my queen to b6, there could be some options for a nice attack."
29,Qe3,e1e3,r1bq1rk1/pp1p1ppp/3n1b2/8/3N4/2PpQP2/PP1P2PP/R1B2RK1 b - - 7 15,Apparently going after the pawn at d3.  A lot of moves just to get rid of a pawn that isn't going anywhere...  Better to connect the rooks first.
30,Nc4,d6c4,r1bq1rk1/pp1p1ppp/5b2/8/2nN4/2PpQP2/PP1P2PP/R1B2RK1 w - - 8 16,"If White is going to focus on the pawn, I might as well get to reposition my pieces for free in the process..."
