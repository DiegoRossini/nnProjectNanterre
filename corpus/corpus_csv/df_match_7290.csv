6,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pPb2/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"Black develops his QB outside the pawn wall, establishing an annoying attack on c2."
7,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pPb2/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 4,Kotronias's preferred choice.  I've seen Short get good results with 4. Nf3 and indeed Board 5 ended peacefully with this variation.
8,e6,e7e6,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3pPb2/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"White immediately harasses the annoying Bishop, having secured e4 against a counter-attack on h1."
9,g4,g2g4,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3pPb2/3P2P1/2N5/PPP2P1P/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"White immediately harasses the annoying Bishop, having secured e4 against a counter-attack on h1."
10,Bg6,f5g6,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p1b1/3pP3/3P2P1/2N5/PPP2P1P/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,This N is heading for g3 in accordance with what I remember of Kotronias's recipe.  It temporarily blocks in White's KB but that prelate has nowhere useful to go yet anyway.
11,Nge2,g1e2,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p1b1/3pP3/3P2P1/2N5/PPP1NP1P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 6,This N is heading for g3 in accordance with what I remember of Kotronias's recipe.  It temporarily blocks in White's KB but that prelate has nowhere useful to go yet anyway.
12,Bb4,f8b4,rn1qk1nr/pp3ppp/2p1p1b1/3pP3/1b1P2P1/2N5/PPP1NP1P/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 3 7,"Black pins White's N, allowing the QB to dream of landing on e4 again."
13,Ng3,e2g3,rn1qk1nr/pp3ppp/2p1p1b1/3pP3/1b1P2P1/2N3N1/PPP2P1P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 4 7,So I abandon my general rule of thumb in this opening of making alternate moves with pieces and pawns by immediately moving my KN a second time to cover e4.
14,Nd7,b8d7,r2qk1nr/pp1n1ppp/2p1p1b1/3pP3/1b1P2P1/2N3N1/PPP2P1P/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 5 8,"Black continues to develop solidly, putting pressure on White's pawn centre.  I was expecting ...c5 soon."
15,h4,h2h4,r2qk1nr/pp1n1ppp/2p1p1b1/3pP3/1b1P2PP/2N3N1/PPP2P2/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,"Now White sends another footsoldier after the annoying bishop, heedless of the holes he's creating in his kingside."
16,f6,f7f6,r2qk1nr/pp1n2pp/2p1ppb1/3pP3/1b1P2PP/2N3N1/PPP2P2/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 9,"?! Normal is 8...h6, allowing the B to stay on the b1-h7 diagonal.  This move had the advantage of making me think and continued Black's attack on e5 but it didn't really work for Black."
17,f4,f2f4,r2qk1nr/pp1n2pp/2p1ppb1/3pP3/1b1P1PPP/2N3N1/PPP5/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 9,"Torn between 9. h5 and this, I eventually decided to defend the e-pawn, hoping also for a possible fork on e6 - rather too hopeful, really.  An immediate 9. h5 would have had the advantage of forcing the B back immediately.  Delaying it gives Black time to play ...h6 if he wants.  I normally play f4 at some stage soon in this opening anyway, so I wasn't too concerned about clearing my second rank of kingside pawns.  White hopes to pressurise Black into trouble with the pawn storm, though, with sound defence, it isn't that frightening really."
18,fxe5,f6e5,r2qk1nr/pp1n2pp/2p1p1b1/3pp3/1b1P1PPP/2N3N1/PPP5/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 10,Preferable to dxe5 because that would release Black's d-pawn for a devastating central attack as I often suffer in the French Winawer.  Now who is going to be able to exploit the open f-file first?
19,fxe5,f4e5,r2qk1nr/pp1n2pp/2p1p1b1/3pP3/1b1P2PP/2N3N1/PPP5/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 10,Preferable to dxe5 because that would release Black's d-pawn for a devastating central attack as I often suffer in the French Winawer.  Now who is going to be able to exploit the open f-file first?
20,Bxc3+,b4c3,r2qk1nr/pp1n2pp/2p1p1b1/3pP3/3P2PP/2b3N1/PPP5/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 11,"Black creates a pawn weakness on White's queenside, so now castling either side looks unattractive.  Black, however, can castle safely on the queenside."
21,bxc3,b2c3,r2qk1nr/pp1n2pp/2p1p1b1/3pP3/3P2PP/2P3N1/P1P5/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 11,I normally play this B to e3 to discourage ...c5 but in this position preparing a discovered attack on Black's Q seems preferable.
22,Qa5,d8a5,r3k1nr/pp1n2pp/2p1p1b1/q2pP3/3P2PP/2P3N1/P1P5/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 12,I normally play this B to e3 to discourage ...c5 but in this position preparing a discovered attack on Black's Q seems preferable.

25,h5,h4h5,2kr2nr/pp1n2pp/2p1p1b1/q2pP2P/3P2P1/2P3N1/P1PB4/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 13,"Finally White gets his planned pawn push in, forcing the B off his diagonal."

27,Bh3,f1h3,2kr2nr/pp1n1bpp/2p1p3/q2pP2P/3P2P1/2P3NB/P1PB4/R2QK2R b KQ - 2 14,?!  I was aggressively looking to advance the g-pawn again and attack Black's weak pawn on e6 but I think a central posting on d3 might have been better.

But Black's Q is far from the action now and White's advanced pawns are hemming Black's minor pieces in.  My immediate plan was to attack Black's B on f7 with as much heavy artillery as I could muster.

I like this move because it prepares trebling on the f-file while also defending c3, allowing the QB to move, and also potentially allowing the rook to swing across the queenside to double on the b-file, attacking Black's castled position.  One move I also wanted to play at some stage soon was Bg5.  I can do this now that the R defends c3 and g3; otherwise Black's Q would wreak havoc olong my third rank."
