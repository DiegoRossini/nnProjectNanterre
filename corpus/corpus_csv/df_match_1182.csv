3,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/6B1/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 2 2,Expecting h4 but with this move he appears to be protecting his pawn structure and developing at the same time

5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/6B1/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,Book move
6,h6,h7h6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1pp1/4pn1p/6B1/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,After his last move I was expecting d5 or Nc6
7,Bf4,g5f4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1pp1/4pn1p/8/3P1B2/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"Book says take the knight, I retreated"
8,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1pp1/4pn1p/2p5/3P1B2/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"His first attack, trying to get some control on the centre"
9,c3,c2c3,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1pp1/4pn1p/2p5/3P1B2/2P2N2/PP2PPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,I felt like I had a solid pawn structure in the centre with some good defense
10,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1pp1/2n1pn1p/2p5/3P1B2/2P2N2/PP2PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,I felt like I had a solid pawn structure in the centre with some good defense

13,Bd3,f1d3,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1pp1/2n1p2p/2p4n/3P1B2/2PBPN2/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 2 7,"Played a developing move instead and this was against the principle of never trade bishop for knight early in the game, now could be forced with Nxf4 to defend

This was my weakest move so far and should of played Be5 or Bg3 because I retain the centre pawn and structure that way"
14,cxd4,c5d4,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1pp1/2n1p2p/7n/3p1B2/2PBPN2/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"Feeling attacked now and need to defend
King safety was considered here but chose to use the c-pawn to keep another pawn in the centre and protected by knight on f3"
15,cxd4,c3d4,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1pp1/2n1p2p/7n/3P1B2/3BPN2/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 0 8,"I considered Nxd4 here, would have attacked the knight on h5 gaining a tempo"

17,exf4,e3f4,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1pp1/2n1p2p/8/3P1P2/3B1N2/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 0 9,Pieces in the centre although both pawns unguarded and need king safety
18,Qb6,d8b6,r1b1kb1r/pp1p1pp1/1qn1p2p/8/3P1P2/3B1N2/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 1 10,"dynamic_dv attacks both the b2 and d4 pawns, punishment for unprotected pieces"
19,Qd2,d1d2,r1b1kb1r/pp1p1pp1/1qn1p2p/8/3P1P2/3B1N2/PP1Q1PPP/RN2K2R b KQkq - 2 10,"Clearly I am trying to defend the b2 pawn, however I have hung the d4 pawn with 10...Nxd4 11. Nxd4 Qxd4 and now down a central pawn

Better options were Nc3 to continue development, or castling for king safety and activating the rook"
20,Nxd4,c6d4,r1b1kb1r/pp1p1pp1/1q2p2p/8/3n1P2/3B1N2/PP1Q1PPP/RN2K2R w KQkq - 0 11,At this point feeling pressured although game is fairly even still
21,Nxd4,f3d4,r1b1kb1r/pp1p1pp1/1q2p2p/8/3N1P2/3B4/PP1Q1PPP/RN2K2R b KQkq - 0 11,At this point feeling pressured although game is fairly even still

25,Ne2,c3e2,r1b1kb1r/1p1p1pp1/p3p2p/8/3q1P2/3B4/PP1QNPPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 1 13,"Tried the attack the Queen, better options could have been castling or activating the a1 rook, there was an empty c-file or more support for the d-file"
26,Qb4,d4b4,r1b1kb1r/1p1p1pp1/p3p2p/8/1q3P2/3B4/PP1QNPPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 2 14,"Now I see my error, he forces a Queen trade which will force me to take with my King and take away my castling ability #blunder?

Just as I was about to trade I saw the Nc3 which was definitely a better option, although getting no chance to attack at all"
27,Nc3,e2c3,r1b1kb1r/1p1p1pp1/p3p2p/8/1q3P2/2NB4/PP1Q1PPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 3 14,A moment to breathe..
