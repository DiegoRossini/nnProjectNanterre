1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Standard opening.
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,French defense
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Nf3. Not the most common move, but still pretty good. More usual would be d4."
4,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"c5. A push for space, as in the Sicilian Defense. The c5 pawn lets the Q come to b6, and the N can slot in behind the pawn at c6."
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"d4. This move is ultimately going to get the Q out early, or move the N twice, but is a good push for space."
6,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"cxd4 - after a recapture, Black can develop while attacking."
7,Nxd4,f3d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,Nxd5 - moving the N twice.
8,Bc5,f8c5,rnbqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2b5/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"Bc5 - Attacking the N, and developing the B."
9,Nf3,d4f3,rnbqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2b5/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,Nf3 - third N move. May have been better to play something like Nc3 instead.
10,Qb6,d8b6,rnb1k1nr/pp1p1ppp/1q2p3/2b5/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 3 6,"Qb6 - attacking f2, and, if the B on c1 is moved, b2. Aggressive."
11,Qd2,d1d2,rnb1k1nr/pp1p1ppp/1q2p3/2b5/4P3/5N2/PPPQ1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 4 6,"Qd2. This blocks in the B, but defends the pawn."
12,Nf6,g8f6,rnb1k2r/pp1p1ppp/1q2pn2/2b5/4P3/5N2/PPPQ1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 5 7,"Nf6. Develop again, and attack again."
13,Bd3,f1d3,rnb1k2r/pp1p1ppp/1q2pn2/2b5/4P3/3B1N2/PPPQ1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 6 7,"Bd3, developing and defending."
