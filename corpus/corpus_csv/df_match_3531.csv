1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"He opens with the standard e4, the most noble of openings!"
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I prefer the Caro-Kann to the sicilian or the standard e5 reply. It usually yields a better pawn structure in the end game as well as solid play on the queen side.
3,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"I usually see d4 or a Knight move so this was a bit surprising to me, though i'm sure it is a very normal move."
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,so i'm just going to carry on with the Kann.
5,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pP3/5P2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,all standard so far.
6,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pPb2/5P2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,develops the bishop. Standard Caro-Kann.
7,Nf3,g1f3,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pPb2/5P2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,Probably a wasteful move but it keeps the g5 square out of the Knights hands and gives my bishop a place to go in case of h4. I'm not big on bishop for knight trades and i wanted a solid pawn structure.
8,h6,h7h6,rn1qkbnr/pp2ppp1/2p4p/3pPb2/5P2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,Probably a wasteful move but it keeps the g5 square out of the Knights hands and gives my bishop a place to go in case of h4. I'm not big on bishop for knight trades and i wanted a solid pawn structure.
9,d4,d2d4,rn1qkbnr/pp2ppp1/2p4p/3pPb2/3P1P2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,adds more infrastructure to his e5 pawn.
10,e6,e7e6,rn1qkbnr/pp3pp1/2p1p2p/3pPb2/3P1P2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,Freeing up the dark squared bishop. Pretty standard caro-kann position.
11,Bd3,f1d3,rn1qkbnr/pp3pp1/2p1p2p/3pPb2/3P1P2/3B1N2/PPP3PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"So i'm trading my bad bishop for his good bishop, i can't really see it being a bad thing, even if my bishop was outside the pawns."
12,Bxd3,f5d3,rn1qkbnr/pp3pp1/2p1p2p/3pP3/3P1P2/3b1N2/PPP3PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"So i'm trading my bad bishop for his good bishop, i can't really see it being a bad thing, even if my bishop was outside the pawns."
13,Qxd3,d1d3,rn1qkbnr/pp3pp1/2p1p2p/3pP3/3P1P2/3Q1N2/PPP3PP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 7,attacking the closed center from the wing and giving the c6 spot back to my knight.
14,c5,c6c5,rn1qkbnr/pp3pp1/4p2p/2ppP3/3P1P2/3Q1N2/PPP3PP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 8,attacking the closed center from the wing and giving the c6 spot back to my knight.
15,c3,c2c3,rn1qkbnr/pp3pp1/4p2p/2ppP3/3P1P2/2PQ1N2/PP4PP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 8,further defending his center pawns.
16,Nc6,b8c6,r2qkbnr/pp3pp1/2n1p2p/2ppP3/3P1P2/2PQ1N2/PP4PP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 1 9,adds pressure to the d4 orchid and develops. So far there really hasn't been any exciting play but it is still the opening.
17,O-O,e1g1,r2qkbnr/pp3pp1/2n1p2p/2ppP3/3P1P2/2PQ1N2/PP4PP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 2 9,"tucking the king safely into the corner. White has a pretty fortified center and a safe king. Often times when play the Caro-Kann my king side stays undeveloped for a little while which probably isn't a good thing. However, i often have play on the queen side and when that opens up i am able to develop more."
18,Rc8,a8c8,2rqkbnr/pp3pp1/2n1p2p/2ppP3/3P1P2/2PQ1N2/PP4PP/RNB2RK1 w k - 3 10,Preparing to open the c file for my Rook.
19,f5,f4f5,2rqkbnr/pp3pp1/2n1p2p/2ppPP2/3P4/2PQ1N2/PP4PP/RNB2RK1 b k - 0 10,This was a pretty solid move. He is looking to open up the center with my king still right in the thick of it.
20,cxd4,c5d4,2rqkbnr/pp3pp1/2n1p2p/3pPP2/3p4/2PQ1N2/PP4PP/RNB2RK1 w k - 0 11,But i'm going to carry on with my own plans of trying to control the c file.
21,Nxd4,f3d4,2rqkbnr/pp3pp1/2n1p2p/3pPP2/3N4/2PQ4/PP4PP/RNB2RK1 b k - 0 11,"With the advance of his f pawn, this capture now leaves the pawn at the e5 orchid unguarded."
22,Nxe5,c6e5,2rqkbnr/pp3pp1/4p2p/3pnP2/3N4/2PQ4/PP4PP/RNB2RK1 w k - 0 12,"So i snatch it, putting pressure on his lady."
23,Qb5+,d3b5,2rqkbnr/pp3pp1/4p2p/1Q1pnP2/3N4/2P5/PP4PP/RNB2RK1 b k - 1 12,"I'm wondering if Nc6 would of been better. My king side is still undeveloped and that pawn is looking to break open the center, so my thought process was that a queen trade would really slow the game down and give me a little more freedom to develop."
24,Qd7,d8d7,2r1kbnr/pp1q1pp1/4p2p/1Q1pnP2/3N4/2P5/PP4PP/RNB2RK1 w k - 2 13,"I'm wondering if Nc6 would of been better. My king side is still undeveloped and that pawn is looking to break open the center, so my thought process was that a queen trade would really slow the game down and give me a little more freedom to develop."
