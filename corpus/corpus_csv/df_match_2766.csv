1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"Hi everyone!

I see you all enjoyed my game against Expert X in which Henry got entombed on the kingside.  That is really something!  I'd much rather not be on the receiving end of such a mating attack but it was certainly fascinating and awesome to watch.  Anyhow, I do get a huge slice of consolation for my loss - another Expert Draw, courtesy of Operation Joblock.  Dave, my opponent is a very strong player and his rating was only 25 points shy of Masterdom when we agreed that draw, so I was really, really chuffed to keep him out!  So how did this happen?  Well, let's start with Dave's first move - 1. Nf3 - the Reti Opening, named after a GM called Richard Reti who just lurved sticking his knight on that square.  This opening can transpose into a myriad of queen pawn openings, or the English Opening."

At least with the g7 pawn already moved, white would be hard pushed to find a smothered mate here!"

However, there is the possibility of regaining my pawn by taking off his e4 pawn with my knight, discovering an attack on e5.  So, after 12. Nxe5, Nxe4 13. Nxe4, Bxe5, material is even.  However, I notice that the pawn is hanging so I decided to open up the h8-e5 line for Fou Lenoir.  I think my knight would be well placed on d6, hitting out at e4 and c4.
