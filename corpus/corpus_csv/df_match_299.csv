Yes. BUT: can I bring into the attack other pieces, quickly, after the sac? I couldn't see it, so, for once, I didn't go for the more aggressive option. Was I right?"

It pins the e pawn. f7 is pinned, too. The threat is Bxe7, QxB, QxN. What do you say? Was it sound? // If Ng4 now, he just plays h6. Nxf7, RxN leaves the R pinned, true, but I can't get it fast enough, and black can always play d5. So no good sacs, as far as I can see."

No matter my Q is where it is, as far as black is unable to get more firepower on c4... and he can't. Now I'm on to play d5, and b2 (that gets weak in return, but this is the cost of my c4 move) is defended."
