1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This, the penultimate game in my Latvian Gambit series, is defined by an early misstep by White, resulting in the loss of his early aggressive potential and a much more positional game than is typical of this opening, as Black seeks to slowly compound his spatial and material advantages, finally reaching an instructive endgame with approximate material equality, but wherein Black enjoys far more activity and a minor piece over White's pawns. Enjoy!"
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"?! The key move of the controversial Latvian Gambit. Very rarely seen at high levels, Black gives up a pawn (and usually much more) for a lead in space and development."

37,Nf4,d5f4,2kr3r/ppp2q2/2n1b1p1/8/3n1NP1/3P3P/PPPQ1PB1/2K1R2R b - - 4 19,"?! This move looks a little strange to me; White seems to be trying to mobilize on the flank but the center is wide open and largely controlled by Black. The text certainly sets up a number of potential combinations after 19...Bxa2 (which is practically forced at this point), but I don't see a line that goes particularly badly for Black, especially with the threat of ...Nb3+ hanging in the air. At the time, I had expected 19.c4, but White presumably doesn't want to make his d-pawn a target."

41,Re4,e1e4,2kr3r/p1p2q2/2p3p1/8/3nRNP1/3P3P/bPPQ1P2/2K4R b - - 1 21,"!? White desperately wants to remove the Black Knight from d4 so he can play b2-b3, but he cannot kick it with the c-pawn. The text trades off the Black Bishop for the White Knight and pins one Rook to the other, which is a hit to White's mobility--a critical commodity, especially if he is ever to convert his pawn advantage."
