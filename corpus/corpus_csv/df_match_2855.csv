1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I've started to prefer this move over d4 since its tactical and often more fun than the slower moving d4.  However d4 is very solid and I would say lately it even challenges this move for being the best by test.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Classical response.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,I find this move a less appealing than Nc6 because it inhibits the development of the dsb.
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,I find this move a less appealing than Nc6 because it inhibits the development of the dsb.
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,Attacking the center and honestly I'm out of my opening book here :) but its fun to experiment.
6,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/3PP1b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,Threatening to break open my king side with exd4.
7,Bc4,f1c4,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/2BPP1b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 4,Indirectly protecting the d4 pawn and threating Bxf7+.
8,Nf6,g8f6,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/2BPP1b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 3 5,Defends my threat and threatens e4 as well as breaking open my king side again since Qxf3 no longer threatens mate.  I make a the decision here that having my kingside broken up isn't really an issue since having the half open g-file should make up for the doubled pawns.  Therefore I simple defend my e4 pawn.
9,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/2BPP1b1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 4 5,I think this is a structurally dubious since I think it would be wiser for black to leave his castling options open on the queen side as my attack is going to be coming king side.  Also his pieces and structure dictate his play is on the king side as well.  Think Nc6 would have been much better.
10,c6,c7c6,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2pp1n2/4p3/2BPP1b1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,I think this is a structurally dubious since I think it would be wiser for black to leave his castling options open on the queen side as my attack is going to be coming king side.  Also his pieces and structure dictate his play is on the king side as well.  Think Nc6 would have been much better.
11,Bg5,c1g5,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2pp1n2/4p1B1/2BPP1b1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 6,Developing my last minor piece this also makes d5 or exd5 have more option for white.  I think d5 dxe5 dxc4 Qxd8+ Kxd8 exf6 is rather interesting.
12,Be7,f8e7,rn1qk2r/pp2bppp/2pp1n2/4p1B1/2BPP1b1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 7,With this move its time to release the tension on d4 since it comes with a surprising complication.
13,dxe5,d4e5,rn1qk2r/pp2bppp/2pp1n2/4P1B1/2B1P1b1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 7,Best move here is the in-between move Bxf3.  Qxf3 dxe5 Rd1 Qc2 where white has a small edge.
14,dxe5,d6e5,rn1qk2r/pp2bppp/2p2n2/4p1B1/2B1P1b1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 8,? loses two pawns to a very complex line.
15,Qxd8+,d1d8,rn1Qk2r/pp2bppp/2p2n2/4p1B1/2B1P1b1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 0 8,Move one.
16,Bxd8,e7d8,rn1bk2r/pp3ppp/2p2n2/4p1B1/2B1P1b1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 9,Kxd8? Nxe5 beside black keep the ability to castle at least for now anyway.
17,Bxf7+,c4f7,rn1bk2r/pp3Bpp/2p2n2/4p1B1/4P1b1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 0 9,!
18,Kxf7,e8f7,rn1b3r/pp3kpp/2p2n2/4p1B1/4P1b1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 10,Most likely best Nxe5 is next anyway.
19,Nxe5+,f3e5,rn1b3r/pp3kpp/2p2n2/4N1B1/4P1b1/2N5/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQ - 0 10,Best move because it centralizes the king for the endgame.
20,Ke6,f7e6,rn1b3r/pp4pp/2p1kn2/4N1B1/4P1b1/2N5/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 1 11,Best move because it centralizes the king for the endgame.
21,Bxf6,g5f6,rn1b3r/pp4pp/2p1kB2/4N3/4P1b1/2N5/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQ - 0 11,Only way to keep the advantage.
22,Bxf6,d8f6,rn5r/pp4pp/2p1kb2/4N3/4P1b1/2N5/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 12,Bh5 Bxd8.
23,Nxg4,e5g4,rn5r/pp4pp/2p1kb2/8/4P1N1/2N5/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQ - 0 12,Doubles pawns and the only way to keep in the game.
24,Bxc3+,f6c3,rn5r/pp4pp/2p1k3/8/4P1N1/2b5/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 13,Doubles pawns and the only way to keep in the game.
