15,O-O,e1g1,rn1qkb1r/1p3ppp/p2pbn2/4p3/4P3/1NN5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 3 8,I hadn't expected this to come quite so soon but I suppose with most of whites army already developed it makes sense to strike.

Maybe this wasn't the correct response however the idea seemed appealing the point was to allow lines where black can check the on b6 without having to worry about white playing a knight to a4 and of course the other main idea is to win a pawn in some lines by b4 followed by Nxd4
19,fxe5,f4e5,rn1qk2r/4bppp/p2pbn2/1p2P3/4P3/1NN5/PPP1B1PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 10,I thought about throwing an I between move here by checking the black king
20,dxe5,d6e5,rn1qk2r/4bppp/p3bn2/1p2p3/4P3/1NN5/PPP1B1PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 11,However I changed my mind figuring that a queen exchange was probably in blacks favor however since b5 had been in order to allow for the queen check I probably should have gone with it.

Instead something like the simple ...Rc8 and black is doing well however I decide to mix things up

The sacrifice is bad enough as it is however even if I do want to sac a piece it should have been the knight that I sacrificed, not the bishop. However the main idea behind the sacrifice was to leave white in a position where it is very difficult to develop and coordinate the pieces, I thought by having my knight on g4 white would have a difficult time however I guess I just got lazy and didn't put enough thought into it. Because white has a reasonably easy game after this."

Had I foreseen that I think I would have instead saced the knight or not sacrificed at all
