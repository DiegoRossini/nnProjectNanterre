1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

I have taken a trip down memory lane again, this time I have gone back to my very first game I played on gameknot.  This game ended happily for me.  My opponent played the Alekhine's Defense.  Nf6 in response to my 1. e4.  When I joined Gameknot it was to keep my hand in while easing my way back onto the OTB tournament circuit so I played the game as much as possible like an OTB one - no database and no analyse the board - instinct only."

However spirited Black's subsuquent counterattack, you were never in very serious danger from it, given sufficient alertness. All the same, 26.Ne5! called for fine judgement and accurate play. You were always in a position if necessary to bale out with g3 or h3, but your hold on the initiative meant you never were called upon to do so (how early did you spot that knight manoeuvre to e3: when you played it to e5? If so: not bad, especially as not only did it stop Black's mating threat cold, meant that in trying to avoid an exchange of rooks, lost one for nothing to stop -slow down- your own king hunt. I also liked the choice of 4 checkmates in the final position..."
