2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"Black keeps his options open, probably looking for d4 which transposes into a Queen's Indian."
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 2,"But I prefer to stay within the English lines, doubling my attack on the d5 square."

6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2P5/2N2N2/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,"The natural defence of the e5 Pawn, developing a piece.  This takes us into the Four Knights Variation of the English."

Bxf6 would've allowed Black's Queen to come out and play, which I wasn't ready for yet, so instead I decided to disrupt the Black King-Side Pawn formation by drawing out his Pawns in chase of my Bishop.  This was a tactic that paid off later in the game, allowing me to squeeze an advantage out of the game."

Instead, I think Black should've considered d6, opening up the light-side Bishop and protecting the weak c7 Pawn."

But during my match with easy19 he had suggested I should always look at how a position can be achieved, then reverse the move order and see if anything jogs loose.  I decided I preferred the look of h4, but in hindsight think that perhaps I took the lesson too literally and should've stuck to my gut instinct of O-O-O."
