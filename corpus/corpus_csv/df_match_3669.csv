1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"So here is my second Annotation. I was taught by myself therefore I do not know the chess language and the openings people use, but I'm sure I have a fair Idea of what I'm doing.

I am very lucky to not have lost this game, as you will find out in the latter half on this annotated game.

But onwards to the game at hand. White starts with the kings pawn opening very standard opening play by most players, although I do believe when you start to play the 1700s+ d4 is commonly used along with c4, Nc3, Nf3 etc. 

I am not a fan of the e4 opening and not sure why I've played this, it's the first time I have ever played e4 in any of my chess games on Gameknot. I must have not been paying attention."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I don't like playing off the lines and never like to play the Sicilian as I do not know it, I have never studied it due to the fact I don't play e4."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Saying as I don't have much of an idea of how to play against the Sicilian I just play a safe move of Nc6 and try and keep things steady as possible and not make any mistakes. As I recall the Sicilian doesn't have many gambits if any at all so I can cope well enough.
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,From this move onwards Nc3 there is no main line
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,From this move onwards Nc3 there is no main line
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,Nc6
7,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/1Bp5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 4,"Here I am not sure whether it was the best move, I felt I wanted to develop my Bishop instead of playing d3, of course if my opponent decides to play a6 then I am forced to trade off as Ba4 will lose my bishop for 2 pawns."
8,Bd7,c8d7,r2qkbnr/pp1bpppp/2np4/1Bp5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 4 5,"Bd7, which I believe was so my opponent wouldn't have doubled pawns on the c file, which in most cases isn't bad to have. I would have forced the Bishop/Knight trade-off as I like have doubled pawns on the c or f files."
9,O-O,e1g1,r2qkbnr/pp1bpppp/2np4/1Bp5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 5 5,"0-0 let's get the king safe first and foremost, never wait to castle king unless you have a very good attack going."
10,Nf6,g8f6,r2qkb1r/pp1bpppp/2np1n2/1Bp5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 6 6,Nf6
11,d3,d2d3,r2qkb1r/pp1bpppp/2np1n2/1Bp5/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 6,d3 was used to develop my Bishop and protect e4 from attacks further down the line.
12,g6,g7g6,r2qkb1r/pp1bpp1p/2np1np1/1Bp5/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,"g6, something about this move seems too passive I would have played e5 possibly but that just seems to be the English opening as black, everyone has different ways to play and maybe e5 would of blocked in the bishop. So playing g6 was to release his f7 Bishop."
13,Bxc6,b5c6,r2qkb1r/pp1bpp1p/2Bp1np1/2p5/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,"Sooner or later it was going to happen Bxc6, I never really strategize throughout this match, this is probably mainly the reason I only got a draw. I tend to try and win the end-games rather than the middle game."
14,Bxc6,d7c6,r2qkb1r/pp2pp1p/2bp1np1/2p5/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,Bxc6
15,b3,b2b3,r2qkb1r/pp2pp1p/2bp1np1/2p5/4P3/1PNP1N2/P1P2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,"What a pointless move on my part, the Bc1 already has the ability to be developed playing Bb2 does nothing but weaken my Nc3 because Bg7 by black already covers the pin on Nf6 and castling the move after effectively ruins the point of Bb2."
16,Bg7,f8g7,r2qk2r/pp2ppbp/2bp1np1/2p5/4P3/1PNP1N2/P1P2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 1 9,Bg7 as expected
17,Bb2,c1b2,r2qk2r/pp2ppbp/2bp1np1/2p5/4P3/1PNP1N2/PBP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 2 9,Bb2

Black has two options here play dxe5 or Bxf3 but doing so would result in the loss of b7 for double pawns on e5. Then again white could move his knight if he wanted to go defensive."
20,dxe5,d6e5,r2q1rk1/pp2ppbp/2b2np1/2p1p3/8/1PNP1N2/PBP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 11,dxe5 didn't expect anything else.
