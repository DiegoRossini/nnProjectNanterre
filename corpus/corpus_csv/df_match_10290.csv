1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is the game that earned me the dubious distinction/accusation of being a ""Romantic"" player.  Now that I look back on it, although it was wide-open, it was still fairly sound throughout.  This is simply an example of the advantage of playing white.  If you want to attack, you can.  I started with the most popular opening, e4."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,The beginning of the Sicilian.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,This is a quick attacking setup that allows for early bishop pressure on the queen's pawn.
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"By advancing the queen's pawn, this opens the possibility for an early check."
5,Bb5+,f1b5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 3,Which I decide to make.
6,Bd7,c8d7,rn1qkbnr/pp1bpppp/3p4/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 4,It's either this or Nd7.
7,Bxd7+,b5d7,rn1qkbnr/pp1Bpppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,I force the issue rather than playing Nc3 or Na3.
8,Qxd7,d8d7,rn2kbnr/pp1qpppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"Nxd7 restricts the queen; Qxd7 allows more freedom but also places the queen in front of the king.  With the white bishop gone, this isn't as dangerous as it could be."
9,O-O,e1g1,rn2kbnr/pp1qpppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 5,"White and black are under-developed, but there are interesting opportunities for attack.  The king is still vulnerable, and the b7 pawn is potentially weak."
10,Nf6,g8f6,rn2kb1r/pp1qpppp/3p1n2/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 6,Black wants to castle quickly.
11,e5,e4e5,rn2kb1r/pp1qpppp/3p1n2/2p1P3/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 6,"But with the knight at f3 and no other support, the early e-attack is available.  You don't see this often, but it caused all sorts of chaos."
12,dxe5,d6e5,rn2kb1r/pp1qpppp/5n2/2p1p3/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,"The pawn capture is fairly safe, but, in this scenario, it allows white to put immediate pressure on the queen.  Moving the knight might have been better."
13,Nxe5,f3e5,rn2kb1r/pp1qpppp/5n2/2p1N3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,"White is quite under-developed, but causing all amounts of grief for black."
14,Qc7,d7c7,rn2kb1r/ppq1pppp/5n2/2p1N3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 8,"The only problem with this is that the queen is, at least on the short-term, being marginalized."
15,Re1,f1e1,rn2kb1r/ppq1pppp/5n2/2p1N3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq - 2 8,Why move?  Bolster the knight and see how black responds.
16,e6,e7e6,rn2kb1r/ppq2ppp/4pn2/2p1N3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq - 0 9,Nc6 might have been better
17,c4,c2c4,rn2kb1r/ppq2ppp/4pn2/2p1N3/2P5/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq - 0 9,Opening up the possibility for a queen check and beginning to establish center control.
18,Bd6,f8d6,rn2k2r/ppq2ppp/3bpn2/2p1N3/2P5/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq - 1 10,This is smart.  Creates a strong queen-bishop line while simultaneously developing the board and attacking the pesky knight.
19,Qa4+,d1a4,rn2k2r/ppq2ppp/3bpn2/2p1N3/Q1P5/8/PP1P1PPP/RNB1R1K1 b kq - 2 10,"Hello!  I think she forgot about this possibility.  If you have a chance to halt the castle, it can often cause great pain for the opponent."
20,Nbd7,b8d7,r3k2r/ppqn1ppp/3bpn2/2p1N3/Q1P5/8/PP1P1PPP/RNB1R1K1 w kq - 3 11,"All of black's mid-level pieces are out and the king can castle in either direction, if need be.  But, the attack is not necessarily over."
