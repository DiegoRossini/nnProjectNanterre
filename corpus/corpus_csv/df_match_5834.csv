1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

This is a game to illustrate that Knights on the Rim can be dim!  Adam, a former Expert, could not resist a little bit of pawn grabbing, a sin I have sometimes been guilty of when I have done this against, Freddy the Master Mater and paid with my king!  Adam was a little more fortunate, his knight ended up getting coralled on the rim.  Adam had a potentially decisive kingside pawn majority.  I was taking no chances and so Henry did a royal progress up the chessboard and forced Adam to exchange pawns.  Adam was then left with a side pawn which Fou Lenoir captured and the game ended as a draw with neither players having sufficient material.  Computer Analysis for this game has been done so you can pick up my game in my past games profile and follow the game that way.  Black responds 1..... e6 to my e4 and so this becomes the French Defense."
