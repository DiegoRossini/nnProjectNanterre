8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 5,"with black blocking the queens cover of g5, i jump in with the knight on g5, i choose this as it is clear black is looking to castle king side"
9,Ng5,f3g5,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p1N1/2B1P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 5,"with black blocking the queens cover of g5, i jump in with the knight on g5, i choose this as it is clear black is looking to castle king side"
10,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p1N1/2B1P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 3 6,and theres the castle
11,d3,d2d3,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p1N1/2B1P3/2PP4/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQ - 0 6,"i would have preferred d4, but with the early movement of the knight to g5 i like strength to hold the d4 square. So, d3 is strengthening the lead pawn at e5 and also opening the bishop to protect my knight at g5"
12,d6,d7d6,r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/2b1p1N1/2B1P3/2PP4/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 0 7,black wants to launch a king side attack
13,h3,h2h3,r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/2b1p1N1/2B1P3/2PP3P/PP3PP1/RNBQK2R b KQ - 0 7,"one of the drawbacks to the d3 pawn move was it locked out my white bishop, i make h3 here to prevent my queen from being pestered which would result in my pawn structure reducing mobility."
14,a6,a7a6,r1bq1rk1/1pp2ppp/p1np1n2/2b1p1N1/2B1P3/2PP3P/PP3PP1/RNBQK2R w KQ - 0 8,"black is some what locked down  here, making the move a6 then looking to go for b5 lacks any immediate threat... this was a turning point in the game, black should have played h8 kicking my knight on g5"
15,O-O,e1g1,r1bq1rk1/1pp2ppp/p1np1n2/2b1p1N1/2B1P3/2PP3P/PP3PP1/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 1 8,"mentioning that black was locked down, white here too doesn't have any decisive moves so seemed like a great time to complete development and castle kingside"
16,Bd7,c8d7,r2q1rk1/1ppb1ppp/p1np1n2/2b1p1N1/2B1P3/2PP3P/PP3PP1/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 2 9,"i dont quite know what blacks plan is here, perhaps to sacrifice the bishop on a4 setting up a fork of the queen and white bishop... again this would have been a good point to kick my g5 knight."
17,Nd2,b1d2,r2q1rk1/1ppb1ppp/p1np1n2/2b1p1N1/2B1P3/2PP3P/PP1N1PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 3 9,"i don't see any holes to aim for quite yet, I just want to get some more peices over king side to be ready to capitalize when I see something"
18,b5,b7b5,r2q1rk1/2pb1ppp/p1np1n2/1pb1p1N1/2B1P3/2PP3P/PP1N1PP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 10,i guess black was trying to open up the a file for his rook here or perhaps undermine my strong white bishop with a follow up move of Be6 which could also open the f file for blacks rook
19,Bd5,c4d5,r2q1rk1/2pb1ppp/p1np1n2/1pbBp1N1/4P3/2PP3P/PP1N1PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 10,"here i see that blacks failure to kick my g5 knight could cause black problems now, instead of moving my bishop back to b3 i move up to d5 offering a trade for the black knight on f6 which would cause issues for black after Qh5. I think black wasted a couple of moves back with the a and b pawns and the Bd7 move. This has left his development a bit cluttered and allowed for my d5 bishop and g5 knight to build up some early pressure on black's kingside"
20,b4,b5b4,r2q1rk1/2pb1ppp/p1np1n2/2bBp1N1/1p2P3/2PP3P/PP1N1PP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 11,"this was another wasted move, the attack does not develop any major threats and does not reduces blacks building kingside pressure"
21,Nc4,d2c4,r2q1rk1/2pb1ppp/p1np1n2/2bBp1N1/1pN1P3/2PP3P/PP3PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 11,"the hole left by the questionable b4 pawn advance provides my knight with a good post at c4. I am now looking to move my queen out to the open king side, i dont know exactly what the knight on c4 can to to help me know but blacks lack of meaningful attack means i can use it for my offense"
22,bxc3,b4c3,r2q1rk1/2pb1ppp/p1np1n2/2bBp1N1/2N1P3/2pP3P/PP3PP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 12,"again, no major threat"
23,bxc3,b2c3,r2q1rk1/2pb1ppp/p1np1n2/2bBp1N1/2N1P3/2PP3P/P4PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 12,"I want to remove the defender at f6 to allow my queen to attack the h7 pawn, the attack is beginning to take shape now"
24,Rb8,a8b8,1r1q1rk1/2pb1ppp/p1np1n2/2bBp1N1/2N1P3/2PP3P/P4PP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 13,"I want to remove the defender at f6 to allow my queen to attack the h7 pawn, the attack is beginning to take shape now"

27,cxd4,c3d4,1r1q1rk1/2pb1ppp/p1np1n2/2bB2N1/2NPP3/7P/P4PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 14,i am happy to weaken my queen side in exchange for more room to attack on blacks the center and king side with my more developed peices
28,Bxd4,c5d4,1r1q1rk1/2pb1ppp/p1np1n2/3B2N1/2NbP3/7P/P4PP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 15,"now i finally see blacks attack,  he has my h1 rook here... i could make it an exchange by moving my c1 bishop.... but my kingside attack will be more potent, so I decide to allow black to have his way with my queenside while I finalize kingside attack"
29,Bxc6,d5c6,1r1q1rk1/2pb1ppp/p1Bp1n2/6N1/2NbP3/7P/P4PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 15,i want to weaken the e5 square so i can kick the f6 knight of defense
