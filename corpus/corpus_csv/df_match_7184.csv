The center has been ripped open early, and we have a sharp, open, tarrasch french battle on our hands.  Castling is clearly the best move.  The e-file is wide open and black has to move his queen in order to castle queenside.  WHite's king is now safe, and the f-rook is waiting to jump on the open e-file and attack the king!"

Not wasting any time in retreat, white simply snaps the piece off and continues the attack on blacks' king."
16,Bxc6,d7c6,r2qkbnr/1p3ppp/p1b5/2pp4/3P4/5N2/PPPN1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 9,The attack begins on the open king file...

The knight rushes into e5, the ultimate attack position available...supported on an open file in the center by a rook and pawn this early in the game is a powerful opening advantage.  The knight and rook are in their perfect attack positions, soon the white queen will go to e2 and join the attack formation.  It will then be ready to strike and black has got to organize his pieces for defense immediately."

Insanely, black wastes a precious defensive tempo by opening up the position even further!  It seems risky at the very least.  I would have played 10.Nf6 and then 11. 0-0 imediately get the king out of harm's way."
21,Nb3,d2b3,r2qk1nr/1p2bppp/p1b5/3pN3/3p4/1N6/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq - 1 11,"!
Two pieces are activated in one move!
The Knight develops himself, gets ready to jump on the d4 pawn and join the attack, also this allows the dark bishop to join the attack!"

The queen's knight joins his brother in the central attack!  The White knights are absolutely dominating the center of battle at this point!  They swell with power in the center supported by the queen and rook!  An awesome sight to see such an attacking position this early in the game! (move 12)"

I don't see anything better, black's king is under assault, and his only defense is to sacrifice his court and lose a slow, but hopeless defense.  Instead the king goes down fighting with his court!"
