I haven't played enough d4 games to know how to react :P"
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Queen's gambit (just looked up the name...haha)
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Queen's gambit (just looked up the name...haha)
4,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p1b2/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,Focused on developing...not really sure what the standard moves are. I'm too lazy to read books and stuff.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p1b2/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 3,Developing and threatening d5
6,e6,e7e6,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p1b2/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Developing and backup to d5
7,Nf3,g1f3,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p1b2/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,Clop clop!
8,h6,h7h6,rn1qkbnr/ppp2pp1/4p2p/3p1b2/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,Not sure why I did this. Perhaps to prevent Bg5 or Ng5
9,Bf4,c1f4,rn1qkbnr/ppp2pp1/4p2p/3p1b2/2PP1B2/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,Developing bishop and placing it in a powerful position
10,Bd6,f8d6,rn1qk1nr/ppp2pp1/3bp2p/3p1b2/2PP1B2/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,Maybe Bb4 would've been a better move here (any insights?).
11,e3,e2e3,rn1qk1nr/ppp2pp1/3bp2p/3p1b2/2PP1B2/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,White's development is much further than black's. You would think I would focus on getting the knights out and finishing up my development ... but...
12,Bxf4,d6f4,rn1qk1nr/ppp2pp1/4p2p/3p1b2/2PP1b2/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,Pikachu knows best...I don't really like so many white control on e5. And this doubles pawn on f-file for white.
13,exf4,e3f4,rn1qk1nr/ppp2pp1/4p2p/3p1b2/2PP1P2/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,Getting material back

I should've probably focused on developing knights at this point"

19,Nh4,f3h4,rn2k2r/pp3pp1/2pqpn1p/3p1b2/2PP1P1N/2N5/PP2BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 5 10,Attacking the LSB
