1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi to all. First, I say ""My English is very poor"". Sorry if I committed mistakes in the annotation of the game. This is my first annotated game, a very dynamical play in a very sharp variation of the Two Knights defense. I used the StockFish for the postmortem analysis, but I tried to gives  my own calculations in the game and, if I or my opponent did't see a critical variation, estimates with the chess engine."

8,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p1N1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 6 5,"Two Knights defense, Traxler variation. I played, few years ago, this maneuver. Actually, I am playing the Fritz variation ( 4... d5 5 exd5 Nd4) without bad results. With the 4 ... d5 variation too is possible 5 ... Na5 (normal variation, I think) and 5 ... b5.

 Now, white has three principal moves: 5 Bxf7+ (In my juice, the strongest move) 5 d4 and the move of the game, fork queen and rook."

13,Ke3,f2e3,r1bqk2r/pppp1Npp/2n5/4p3/2B1n3/4K3/PPPP2PP/RNBQ3R b kq - 1 7,It's too risky!! May be 7 Kg1 was sure and black had to move the queen (Qe7... if 7 Kg1 Qf6 8 Qf3 and black (minimum)  wasted a tempo)

I was calculated  about if 8 Nxh8 Qf2+ 9 Kxe4 d5+! 10 Kd3 Bf5+(StockFish gives me a better mate, but i did't see 10... dxc4+ 11 Kxc4 Qd4 and Qb4#) 11 Kc3 Qd4+ 12 Kb3 Qxc4+  13 Qa3 Qb4#, a funny king hunting .

White had Rh4 (I analyzed the postmortem with StockFish and white keep advantage in material). I don't see Rh4 in the game, only analyzes 11 Be2 and I was planned castle in the position. The variation in my mind was 11 Be2 0-0 (the knight is pinned) 12 Kg2 Rxf7 and white's king isn't in a sure place.

The variation gives for SF is 11 Rh4 e4+ 12 Kg2 0-0 13 Bb3 Rxf7  (0.73 for white). The attack vanishes on the lines of the engine!!!"
