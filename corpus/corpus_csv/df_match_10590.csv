5,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,"....but white's attack on f7 can be troublesome, and in this game I decided to cut it out."

15,exd5,e4d5,r1bqk1nr/p4ppp/2p1p3/2bP4/2B5/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,I was not particularly worried by the exchange of light square bishops. In many variations of the Open Sicilian white lives to regret the light square weaknesses.
