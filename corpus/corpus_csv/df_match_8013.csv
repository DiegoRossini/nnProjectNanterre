4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,This seems to be blacks best counter to the Grand Prix according to the db... though the next move seems to favor white.
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/4PP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"Largely ignored because of the pawn sacrifice but, perfectly sound."
6,dxe4,d5e4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2p5/4pP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"White's other option Ne5 doesn't attack anything, so this move is slightly more preferred."
7,Ng5,f3g5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2p3N1/4pP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"White's other option Ne5 doesn't attack anything, so this move is slightly more preferred."
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2p3N1/4pP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,Defensive black tries to hold onto his advantage.
9,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2p3N1/2B1pP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 5,This move puts pressure on f7.
10,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2p3N1/2B1pPb1/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 6,"Bg4?! I believe now after playing this line over the course of the annotation project and this game, that black's 5th move should actually be e6 because the queen sacrifice seems devastating."
11,Qxg4,d1g4,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2p3N1/2B1pPQ1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 6,This move is key for white so the game can be balanced.

14,Kd7,e8d7,rn1q1b1r/pp1kpBpp/8/2p3N1/4pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 1 8,Gets the second piece for the queen.

17,Bxg4,e6g4,rn1q1b1r/ppk1p1pp/8/2p3N1/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 0 9,Qe8 the best option Black has a possible Kc6 or Kb6 but since black is going to move there in the next move might as well do this first.
18,Qe8,d8e8,rn2qb1r/ppk1p1pp/8/2p3N1/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 1 10,Qe8 the best option Black has a possible Kc6 or Kb6 but since black is going to move there in the next move might as well do this first.
19,Ne6+,g5e6,rn2qb1r/ppk1p1pp/4N3/2p5/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 2 10,Kb6 not necessarily the best move preferred by Freddy but Chessmaster actually plays Kc6 here.
20,Kb6,c7b6,rn2qb1r/pp2p1pp/1k2N3/2p5/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 3 11,Kb6 not necessarily the best move preferred by Freddy but Chessmaster actually plays Kc6 here.

22,cxb4,c5b4,rn2qb1r/pp2p1pp/1k2N3/8/1p2pPB1/8/P1PP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 0 12,Accepting the sacrifice.

24,h5,h7h5,rn2qb1r/pp2p1p1/1k2N3/7p/1p2pPB1/3P4/P1P3PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 0 13,h5?! because of Qg6.  My plan was to play Rh6 and exchange Rook for knight.

27,Be3+,c1e3,rn3b1r/pp2pqp1/1k2N3/5B1p/1p2pP2/3PB3/P1P3PP/RN2K2R b KQ - 3 14,Rh6?? this loses a queen.  b3 is more than likely the only move.
28,Ka5,b6a5,rn3b1r/pp2pqp1/4N3/k4B1p/1p2pP2/3PB3/P1P3PP/RN2K2R w KQ - 4 15,Rh6?? this loses a queen.  b3 is more than likely the only move.
