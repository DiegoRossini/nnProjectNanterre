11,d4,d2d4,r2qkbnr/1p1bpppp/p2p4/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 6,Deciding to develop the DSB on the g7 diagonal is a very good idea here because it is extremely difficult for white to shut it in. I am planning to setup a hedgehog formation which I love to play as black.

17,Be3,c1e3,r2qk1nr/1p1bppbp/p2p2p1/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 3 9,"When white plays Be3 in the Sicilian he almost always wants to play Qd2. Especially if black has played the Fianchetto. The reason for this is that later on white can setup all kinds of tactics on f6 and h6 with the support of the king pawns. But here this maybe a tad too early because this blocks the escape route of the DSB.  Allowing black to play his next move.

This a typical mistake, white ignores the attack on one piece only to put two in danger. It is kinda like a rescue mission gone bad. Where the rescuer ends up needing rescue too.

White should have accepted his losses and enter damage control. Instead he, goes all kamikaze on me. He attacks a point(...f6) that is well in black's control. No hope at all!
