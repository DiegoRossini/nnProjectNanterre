1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Fischer once said of 1. e4 ""Best by test."""
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,The Sicilian defense is one of the most popular choices for black.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,The open Sicilian (the closed would be 2. Nc3) is the most challenging continuation.
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,The hyper-accelerated dragon.  In the accelerated dragon black plays 2. ...Nc6.
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,The principled continuation.
6,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Black will try and control the dark squares along the h8-a1 diagonal, especially d4 and e5."
7,Nxd4,f3d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,Developing towrds the center and with an eye on d4 and e5.
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,Developing towrds the center and with an eye on d4 and e5.
9,c4,c2c4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/8/2PNP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"Establishing the so-called Maroczy Bind.  Black often wants to play d7-d5 in the dragon lines, and the move 5. c4 is intended to discourage that possibility once and for all.  This used to be all the rage against the accelerated dragon, but theory maintains that black is OK."
10,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppp1p/2n2np1/8/2PNP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,Black wishes to complete his kingside development prior to issuing any challenges to white's position.  Black will seek counterplay along the dark squares and on the queenside.
11,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppp1p/2n2np1/8/2PNP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 6,"Defending the e-pawn, while continuing to develop."
12,d6,d7d6,r1bqkb1r/pp2pp1p/2np1np1/8/2PNP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"With d5 out of the picture for the foreseeable picture, black opens the c8-h3 diagonal and prevents e4-e5."
13,Be2,f1e2,r1bqkb1r/pp2pp1p/2np1np1/8/2PNP3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,"It is often difficult to activate this bishop.  Notice that while the e and c-pawns have a cramping effect on black's position, they also limit the e2 bishop's mobility."
14,Nxd4,c6d4,r1bqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p1np1/8/2PnP3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"This capture trades one knight, which has moved twice, for one that has also moved twice.  In terms of the element of time, the trade would be neutral, except that it also brings the queen to a square that will come under attack.  The queen will be forced to move again, costing white a tempo."
15,Qxd4,d1d4,r1bqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p1np1/8/2PQP3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 0 8,Restoring material equality.
16,Bg7,f8g7,r1bqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PQP3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 1 9,The dragon bishop takes up its usual perch.
17,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/6B1/2PQP3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 2 9,One of several plausible continuations.  White develops the bishop first and then plays the queen behind it on either d2 or e3.
18,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/6B1/2PQP3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R3K2R w KQ - 3 10,Completing black's kingside development.  Black is now looking for queenside counterplay.
19,Qd2,d4d2,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/6B1/2P1P3/2N5/PP1QBPPP/R3K2R b KQ - 4 10,A typical queen and bishop battery along the c1-h6 diagonal.  A typical way of attacking the fianchetto is to try and exchange bishops leaving the (in this case) dark squares weak.
20,Be6,c8e6,r2q1rk1/pp2ppbp/3pbnp1/6B1/2P1P3/2N5/PP1QBPPP/R3K2R w KQ - 5 11,White wants to tie white down to the defense of the c-pawn.
21,Rc1,a1c1,r2q1rk1/pp2ppbp/3pbnp1/6B1/2P1P3/2N5/PP1QBPPP/2R1K2R b K - 6 11,"A normal move.  White removes the rook from the long square diagonal and positions it on the c-file, where it can help defend the c-pawn, and where it will be come active, if the c-file is ever opened.  Typically, white's other rook goes to d1."
