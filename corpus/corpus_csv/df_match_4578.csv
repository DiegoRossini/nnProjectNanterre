1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The game was quite an interesting positional struggle. with an odd sort of prison occuring around my king. My opponent for this game is meant to be a very expierenced dangerous player however he does have a tendancy to play slightly to fast and is notourios for making these horrific blunders, one such won me this game however there was some intersting play before that."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The symmetrical english, I have played this a couple of times now from blacks perspective and am starting to really enjoy it. During this game black (myself) played something of a very hypermodern style by allowing my opponent to overextend and then take advantage of the weaknesses later."
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,Normally I would just play Bg7 however this time I played this instead.
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/2p5/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Normally I would just play Bg7 however this time I played this instead.

6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/2p5/2P5/2N3P1/PP1PPP1P/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,Normally I would just play Bg7 however this time I played this instead.
7,Bg2,f1g2,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/2p5/2P5/2N3P1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 2 4,preparing the thematic d pawn push. Here I decided on a whim to try something a little different from the norm.
8,Bg7,f8g7,r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/2p5/2P5/2N3P1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 3 5,preparing the thematic d pawn push. Here I decided on a whim to try something a little different from the norm.

10,Ne5,c6e5,r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/6p1/2p1n3/2P5/2N1P1P1/PP1P1PBP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 1 6,!? This came from some of my limited expierence from playing white in the english system. I often found a few times that by waiting too long for the d pawn push I began having problems when black took advantage of the hole created on d3. This move although it violates the principle that one should avoid moving a piece more than once in the opening does force whites hand. I think the loss of tempi is justified as it forces white to play in a way he is unfammilier with.
11,d3,d2d3,r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/6p1/2p1n3/2P5/2NPP1P1/PP3PBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 6,Practically forced.
12,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/pp1pppbp/5np1/2p1n3/2P5/2NPP1P1/PP3PBP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 1 7,"?! very agressive. I suspect my oponent is underestimating me in this game. I'm young and my only expierence playing this opponent tendid to be when I was still very new to chess. Now I'm starting to develop something of an appreciation for positonal play so although far from being good I'm slowly learning how to take advantage of some weaker moves my opponents occasionally play. As white I think I would be considering instead moves like Ne2, Nf3, or maybe even b3. This move however is not that bad when it comes down to it."
13,f4,f2f4,r1bqk2r/pp1pppbp/5np1/2p1n3/2P2P2/2NPP1P1/PP4BP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 7,"?! very agressive. I suspect my oponent is underestimating me in this game.

14,Nc6,e5c6,r1bqk2r/pp1pppbp/2n2np1/2p5/2P2P2/2NPP1P1/PP4BP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 1 8,The only other square being g4 and I didn't like the idea of playing my knights over to the king side. black needs to remain flexible in this position.
15,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqk2r/pp1pppbp/2n2np1/2p5/2P2P2/2NPPNP1/PP4BP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 8,"I decided to play a restrained sort of game, once again as well this comes from expierence playing the english, I often had troubles when my opponents opposed my King side fianchettoe as well as that I noticed that black doesn't do too badly in some of the games I have seen in the symmetrical english."
16,b6,b7b6,r1bqk2r/p2pppbp/1pn2np1/2p5/2P2P2/2NPPNP1/PP4BP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,"I decided to play a restrained sort of game, once again as well this comes from expierence playing the english, I often had troubles when my opponents opposed my King side fianchettoe as well as that I noticed that black doesn't do too badly in some of the games I have seen in the symmetrical english."
17,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk2r/p2pppbp/1pn2np1/2p5/2P2P2/2NPPNP1/PP4BP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 9,I think it's usually best to complete a fianchetto as soon as possible when you start one.
18,Bb7,c8b7,r2qk2r/pb1pppbp/1pn2np1/2p5/2P2P2/2NPPNP1/PP4BP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 10,I think it's usually best to complete a fianchetto as soon as possible when you start one.
19,Nh4,f3h4,r2qk2r/pb1pppbp/1pn2np1/2p5/2P2P1N/2NPP1P1/PP4BP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 3 10,"The only reason white would play this move is he intends to play the f pawn foward. It's not a plan I would have chosen as white but I supose everyone has there own styles, besides it's consistent with whites play so far, what with the f pawn thrust before. Other moves that may have been sensible were e4 since the d pawn cant make its advance and must become backward then perhaps the e pawn will be the one to make its way foward. b3 planning to use the LSB on the a1-h8 diagonal and Re1 both seem to be potential ideas"
20,Rb8,a8b8,1r1qk2r/pb1pppbp/1pn2np1/2p5/2P2P1N/2NPP1P1/PP4BP/R1BQ1RK1 w k - 4 11,"?! intended to give support to my b7 bishop and allow my knight to move should it be worthwhile, probably this was a waste of time. Had I given some thought to the reason behind my opponents previous move I may have have made the more logical move e6 which prevents any advance my my opponents f pawn as well as preparing a potential d pawn thrust. It would also make my opponents previous move look silly."
21,f5,f4f5,1r1qk2r/pb1pppbp/1pn2np1/2p2P2/2P4N/2NPP1P1/PP4BP/R1BQ1RK1 b k - 0 11,well with Nh4 not much else would make any sense.
22,Ne5,c6e5,1r1qk2r/pb1pppbp/1p3np1/2p1nP2/2P4N/2NPP1P1/PP4BP/R1BQ1RK1 w k - 1 12,Hoping to get rid of whites LSB. Perhaps 0-0 or e6 should have been played instead.
23,e4,e3e4,1r1qk2r/pb1pppbp/1p3np1/2p1nP2/2P1P2N/2NP2P1/PP4BP/R1BQ1RK1 b k - 0 12,"This was probably going to occur at some stage anyway, however now boths sides plans are becoming slightly more clear. Black intends to make use of the a1-h8 diagonal and maybe plant knights on d4 and e5 via d6-Nd7-Nde5 and the knight curently on e5 will go back to c6 to aim for d4. white it seems plans to press blacks position and see if he can drum up some form of attack. White should be able to make good use of the nice diagonal c1-h6 and maybe even look to trade DSB."
24,O-O,e8g8,1r1q1rk1/pb1pppbp/1p3np1/2p1nP2/2P1P2N/2NP2P1/PP4BP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 13,This or else d6. possibly even Nc6. I think the move I made was correct.
25,Bf4,c1f4,1r1q1rk1/pb1pppbp/1p3np1/2p1nP2/2P1PB1N/2NP2P1/PP4BP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 2 13,Since I cant move the knight this seems alright. If I was to play d6 then Bxe5!? would be worth looking at for white the point being that Bxe5 dxe5 seems to be bad for black.
26,Nh5,f6h5,1r1q1rk1/pb1pppbp/1p4p1/2p1nP1n/2P1PB1N/2NP2P1/PP4BP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 3 14,So I made this move almost instantly. White cant trade the bishop for the knight. I never considered trying to get a knight to e3. What does the reader think? would Ng4 (either knihgt) have been worth looking into?
27,Be3,f4e3,1r1q1rk1/pb1pppbp/1p4p1/2p1nP1n/2P1P2N/2NPB1P1/PP4BP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 4 14,playing to plant a knight on d4.
