White should play 9 f4! Here, with the following ideas in mind.  First, if Black plays 9…Nxc4? white answers by 10 e4! attacking that knight and building up a huge center. That gives white a big advantage and a big initiative. Black should on the other hand play  9…Ng6! 10 Bxf6! Qxf6 11 g3!  

And now, if Black wants to stay out of trouble, he should send his knight on g6 on maneuvers with 11…Nf8! Intending Nd7 to c5.
