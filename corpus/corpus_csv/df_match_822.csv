1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I begin with my usual King's Pawn Opening.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Developing and threatening black's e-pawn.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Developing and threatening black's e-pawn.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,Defending the e-pawn. Now I must decide whether to play Bc4 or Bb5.
5,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,I stick with what I know and play the Ruy Lopez. I only experiment with openings in unrated games or against a computer.
6,a6,a7a6,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,Kicking the bishop.
7,Bxc6,b5c6,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1B5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,"I choose to exchange. I know that Ba4 is preferred, but I play better when the board is less cluttered (the position is simplified somewhat)."
8,bxc6,b7c6,r1bqkbnr/2pp1ppp/p1p5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"This is a bit of an inaccuracy, because it only creates an open file for the rook, which won't be used until later on, while dxc6 opens up a file for the queen and a long diagonal for the LSB."
9,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkbnr/2pp1ppp/p1p5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 5,"I castle, bringing my king into a safe position."
10,Bd6,f8d6,r1bqk1nr/2pp1ppp/p1pb4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 6,"This defends the e-pawn, but prevents the move of the d-pawn, postponing the effective development of the LSB (the a-pawn and the c6-pawn are preventing Bb7 from being an effective development)."
11,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqk1nr/2pp1ppp/p1pb4/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 3 6,I continue development.
12,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/2pp1ppp/p1pb1n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 4 7,He develops and gets ready to castle.
13,d4,d2d4,r1bqk2r/2pp1ppp/p1pb1n2/4p3/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,I open up the position.

15,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqk2r/2pp1ppp/p1pb1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,Black castles.
16,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/2pp1ppp/p1pb1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 9,Black castles.
17,Nf3,d4f3,r1bq1rk1/2pp1ppp/p1pb1n2/8/4P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 2 9,"I bring my knight back, to threaten a fork with e5."
18,Bb7,c8b7,r2q1rk1/1bpp1ppp/p1pb1n2/8/4P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 3 10,?? This allows me to win a piece with the fork.
19,e5,e4e5,r2q1rk1/1bpp1ppp/p1pb1n2/4P3/8/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 10,"Black chooses to lose his knight. Moving his bishop was a good choice, because it allows the d-pawn to move."
20,Be7,d6e7,r2q1rk1/1bppbppp/p1p2n2/4P3/8/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 11,"Black chooses to lose his knight. Moving his bishop was a good choice, because it allows the d-pawn to move."

23,Bf4,c1f4,r2q1rk1/1bpp1ppp/p1p2b2/8/5B2/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 12,"I have plans to attack sooner or later, but first, I complete minor piece development."
24,h6,h7h6,r2q1rk1/1bpp1pp1/p1p2b1p/8/5B2/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 13,I'm not too sure what this was meant to accomplish.
