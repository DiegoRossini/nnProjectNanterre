Nf3 is fairly common here, and the Danish Gambit (3. c3) is also playable, as is 3. Bc4. At this point, it's premature to assume white is sending his lady out to avenge pawns.

It's not too early to assume anything, because I wrote this note long after the game was over. But...correct me if I'm wrong this so called Nf3, Bc4, c3 ""danish gambit"" none of those moves will recover that  lost  pawn, right? Now that he's come this far he gotta bring the queen out here, so far as I can see."

Actually, she did. She's quite safe here. This opening by white is known as the Paulsen Attack (although I'm not quite sure what Paulsen would be attacking from here). While it doesn't seem to exemplify white's best options in the opening, it's far from a foregone conclusion.

It IS a foregone conclusion that patzers shouldn't pull their queens out early. Look on and you will see what  Paulson is attacking/what I am attacking. If this guy was a chessmaster, than maybe he could pull his queen out early, but he ain't one, and he can't. I am trying to help people here.

White obviously wanted to attack the pawn at g7, a target typical of the Paulsen variation, though for obvious reasons the attack is usually carried out from g3.
