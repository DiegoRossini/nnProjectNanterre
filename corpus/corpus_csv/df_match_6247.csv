1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"hello everyone, and today I will annotate a french  exchange between 2 C-B level players on GK."
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"the french defence. In this opening, black will usually have strong central point on d5 that can last very long, but he will usually have trouble activating his light squared bishop. However, the exchange variation gives a symmetrical and very drawish position."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,THIS IS white's most common 2nd move choice.
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"the exchange variation. This is a great choice if one wishes to get a draw. White is rated lower than his opponent, so this is a perfectly reasonable choice."
5,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3P4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"the exchange variation. This is a great choice if one wishes to get a draw. White is rated lower than his opponent, so this is a perfectly reasonable choice."
6,exd5,e6d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Okay, but the best line by the book is 4.Nf3 Bg4!  5.Qe2ch! Qe7  6.Be3! when a draw is the most common result. I have played a this line in a short game which followed 6...Qb4ch?!  7.Nc3 Qxb2?? 8.Bc1ch 1-0  
U14 tournament, Me vs. D class player 2007. This is the most common beginner's trap in the exchange, and although I played this a long time ago, I remember this because it was so short and simple."

8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 5,"this is just like a rubenstein exchange variation in the caro-kann, except black's e pawn is gone in exchange for a c pawn."
9,c3,c2c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/2PB4/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,"this is just like a rubenstein exchange variation in the caro-kann, except black's e pawn is gone in exchange for a c pawn."

11,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/3b1n2/3p2B1/3P4/2PB4/PP3PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 2 6,"This is move has a purpose, denying black use of the g4 square for his bishop, which he may try and play:
Bg4-h5-g6, exchanging white's good bishop."
12,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/3b1n2/3p2B1/3P4/2PB4/PP3PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQ - 3 7,"This is move has a purpose, denying black use of the g4 square for his bishop, which he may try and play:

14,Re8+,f8e8,rnbqr1k1/ppp2ppp/3b1n2/3p2B1/3P4/2PB3P/PP3PP1/RN1QK1NR w KQ - 1 8,"Black, who is ahead in development, may try c5 at some point before playing Nc6, trying to break down the opponent's pawn structure. However, this is just an idea to be implemented later maybe."
15,Ne2,g1e2,rnbqr1k1/ppp2ppp/3b1n2/3p2B1/3P4/2PB3P/PP2NPP1/RN1QK2R b KQ - 2 8,"I don't like this because it impedes the black development. Black may have had a setup Be6, Nd7,Rc8,c5, but I don't see what c6 really does, as it denies the black knight  a good square, and the d pawn can be well protected"
16,c6,c7c6,rnbqr1k1/pp3ppp/2pb1n2/3p2B1/3P4/2PB3P/PP2NPP1/RN1QK2R w KQ - 0 9,"I don't like this because it impedes the black development.
