1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This game is a training match against a teammate.  Welcome any and all comments.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Petrov defense, one of my favorite lines."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Petrov defense, one of my favorite lines."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"Petrov defense, one of my favorite lines."
5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,"Good opening position for White... a lot of attack power, clearing way for a castle, and the potential for a lot of pressure on Black without good counterplay."
6,Nxe4,f6e4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B1n3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,"Another option (and more common) is Nc6, but in training matches I like to get aggressive early to test people's mettle."
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B1n3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"Personally I like Nxe5 or Qe2 more, but this line is playable.  Another good option is castling."
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1n3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,Developing the second knight and offering some defense for e5
9,d3,d2d3,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1n3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,Not the top response.  I strongly prefer 5. Nxe4 d5 6. Bxd5 Qxd5 7. Nc3.  Another option worth considering is 5. Bxf7+ Kxf7 6. Nxe4 d5 7. Neg5+
10,Nf6,e4f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B5/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 6,I also considered Nxc3
11,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p1B1/2B5/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 2 6,"Another strong consideration should have been 0-0, allowing the rook to get into the game."
12,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/2n2n2/4p1B1/2B5/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 3 7,Preparing for the castle.
13,Qe2,d1e2,r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/2n2n2/4p1B1/2B5/2NP1N2/PPP1QPPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 4 7,"Unless White is considering 0-0-0, I would go ahead and castle 0-0 and then think about attacking."
14,d6,d7d6,r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/2np1n2/4p1B1/2B5/2NP1N2/PPP1QPPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 8,Defending e5 and opening a path for the LSB.
15,h3,h2h3,r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/2np1n2/4p1B1/2B5/2NP1N1P/PPP1QPP1/R3K2R b KQkq - 0 8,0-0 is a better play
16,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/ppp1bppp/2np1n2/4p1B1/2B5/2NP1N1P/PPP1QPP1/R3K2R w KQ - 1 9,"And now White's development is complete.  Although down a pawn, still in fairly good position overall."
17,O-O,e1g1,r1bq1rk1/ppp1bppp/2np1n2/4p1B1/2B5/2NP1N1P/PPP1QPP1/R4RK1 b - - 2 9,"And now White's development is complete.  Although down a pawn, still in fairly good position overall."
18,Be6,c8e6,r2q1rk1/ppp1bppp/2npbn2/4p1B1/2B5/2NP1N1P/PPP1QPP1/R4RK1 w - - 3 10,"Completing the development of Black.  A common perception is that doubling pawns is bad.  However, doubled pawns in the center with supporting side pawns can provide some attack options and opening a file for a rook is never a bad thing, IF White takes."
19,Bxe6,c4e6,r2q1rk1/ppp1bppp/2npBn2/4p1B1/8/2NP1N1P/PPP1QPP1/R4RK1 b - - 0 10,"And he takes.  I'm not immediately opposed to this play, but White should also consider b3 or b5, if just to prevent me from getting an open file for my rooks to getting greater reach."
20,fxe6,f7e6,r2q1rk1/ppp1b1pp/2nppn2/4p1B1/8/2NP1N1P/PPP1QPP1/R4RK1 w - - 0 11,"Order of capture is important.  If Black had taken Ne4 first, Black gains a piece."
21,Ne4,c3e4,r2q1rk1/ppp1b1pp/2nppn2/4p1B1/4N3/3P1N1P/PPP1QPP1/R4RK1 b - - 1 11,"Order of capture is important.  If Black had taken Ne4 first, Black gains a piece."
22,Nxe4,f6e4,r2q1rk1/ppp1b1pp/2npp3/4p1B1/4n3/3P1N1P/PPP1QPP1/R4RK1 w - - 0 12,"Order of capture is important.  If Black had taken Ne4 first, Black gains a piece."
23,Bxe7,g5e7,r2q1rk1/ppp1B1pp/2npp3/4p3/4n3/3P1N1P/PPP1QPP1/R4RK1 b - - 0 12,"Order of capture is important.  If Black had taken Ne4 first, Black gains a piece."
24,Qxe7,d8e7,r4rk1/ppp1q1pp/2npp3/4p3/4n3/3P1N1P/PPP1QPP1/R4RK1 w - - 0 13,"An unfortunate side effect for White is that my rooks are now connected and I get a free positional development for my queen.  It's not a big advantage, but little advantages add up over time."
25,Qxe4,e2e4,r4rk1/ppp1q1pp/2npp3/4p3/4Q3/3P1N1P/PPP2PP1/R4RK1 b - - 0 13,"In general I like taking with the queen more than the d pawn, to get a more centralized location from which to assault the board and keep some attack options on the e5 pawn.  However, I can harass White and gain some tempo by moving my rook, all because White let me get a half-open file on turn 10.  Because of the free tempo move I probably would have taken dxe4."
26,Rf4,f8f4,r5k1/ppp1q1pp/2npp3/4p3/4Qr2/3P1N1P/PPP2PP1/R4RK1 w - - 1 14,Allowing me to move White's queen and also giving tempo to connect my rooks in a battery on the half-open f-file.
