8,a6,a7a6,rnbqkbnr/1p2pppp/p2p4/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Personally, this would be a situation I'd avoid if playing Black. White now has a developed knight pairing, whilst Black has gained....really...nothing. There is no great check on White's intended development or claims for the centre, nor has Black really staked any crucial outposts on the flank. Honestly, for a mid-ranker or below, I believe the main lines of the Sicilian, once White plays Nf3, begin the death toll for Black if he sticks to book. Instead, at 3.d4, I think Black is better with the 3....Nf6 movement."

I asked Joe if he would learn anything from the crushing endgame, he said no and justly resigns. So much for bad and good bishops, btw, White's dcb hasn't moved a bit whilst Black's was a constant pain in its side. I would say, when reading any middle game text that begins harping on about bishops, to rip that chapter out. That note was included as I noticed Joe talking about this concept in my other annotation. Even Euwe mentions a bad bishop need not necessarily be bad and a good bishop necessarily good so why the hell bother labelling either bishop as such? 

Anyway, the game was over and the war was won, solid play, knowledge of a familiar opening and a particular player's style was used to swiftly engineer a decisive victory. And, of course, the old fallacy of bringing the Q out too early again led to yet another budding chess player's downfall! :D I look forward to the rematch! :)
