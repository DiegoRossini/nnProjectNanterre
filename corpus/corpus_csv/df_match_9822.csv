The Black h pawn is a potential target, but even more important is the a1-h8 diagonal, particularly g7.  White's queen plays an important defensive role on the hot diagonal by covering b2, c3 and d4, and if she can arrive at g7 with check the Black h pawn will be lost unless Black can interpose his queen.  This limits the Black queen's mobility  On the queenside there is nothing but open space around the Black king, and if White can force a pawn to a5 then b6 will become dangerously weak.  Black could prevent this with 32 ... b4, which may have been a better option than the move played.   Or he could force a draw with 32 ... Qh1   33 Kb2 Qxh2 34 Qxe6 Qxg3 35 Qxf5 Qg7 , but he seems to have overestimated the strength of the passed  e pawn."
