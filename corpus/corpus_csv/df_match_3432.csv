1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I decided to annotate this game which results in an aesthetically pleasing bind from white and an illustrative endgame.

The plan is solid, but considered slightly passive as White gets to carry on with his development. The typical position arises after 4.d4 exd4 5.Nxd4 Bd7."

7,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/1B2p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,White enjoys the space advantage and easy piece development where Black's position is sound and without weakness. Typical followup includes 5.Nc3 or 5.O-O.

11,Bxc6,b5c6,r2qkbnr/pppb1ppp/2Bp4/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"The decision was made to take the knight with the bishop. The plan is to push c4 to attain a Bind position - white will blockade the center to reinforce the space advantage to pressure black. Normally, one does not trade bishops for knights, however:
1) In a cramped position, Black's knight may have more potential than a bishop.
2) A longterm weakness is induced in Black's structure with the resulting pawn island.
3) White's light-squared bishop will be ""bad"" in White's resulting pawn formation."
12,bxc6,b7c6,r2qkbnr/p1pb1ppp/2pp4/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,The Bind is set. Black can attempt to immediately break it with pushing d5 (resulting in a dull game where white retains a pawn advantage for the endgame). c5 to push the knight is ineffective due to Nc2 where white still retains excellent piece activity (or later Nf5 to trade off).
