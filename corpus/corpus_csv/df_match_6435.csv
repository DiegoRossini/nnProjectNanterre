1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is a common, powerful move. This gives space to move and controls the center squares."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"This starts off the Sicilian Defense. The goal of this opening is to not expose the king and go for a center-pawn trade for a side-pawn after white plays d4. The main square of this opening is d5, because if black takes control of d5, white will not be able to do anything else without regaining that square."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"This move further controls the center, and threatens d4 for the center advantage."
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,This move gives the bishop room to move. This also is a common start move for the Dragon Variation.
5,Bb5+,f1b5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 3,"This is the Moscow Variation. The goal here is to trade off my white bishop for a tempo in castling. In variations such as the Yugoslav, the white bishop does not do much. The black light-squared bishop can cause problems as well. I play this opening because there is not much theory to memorize."
6,Bd7,c8d7,rn1qkbnr/pp1bpppp/3p4/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 4,This move is used to block the check.
7,Bxd7+,b5d7,rn1qkbnr/pp1Bpppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,This is how the main line goes.
8,Qxd7,d8d7,rn2kbnr/pp1qpppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,Nxd7 was also an option.
9,O-O,e1g1,rn2kbnr/pp1qpppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 5,I am getting ready for d4 by getting the rook ready to defend e4.
10,e5,e7e5,rn2kbnr/pp1q1ppp/3p4/2p1p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 6,This move stops my plan to play d4.
11,Nc3,b1c3,rn2kbnr/pp1q1ppp/3p4/2p1p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 6,"Now that he played that, d5 seems weaker than it was before."
12,Ne7,g8e7,rn2kb1r/pp1qnppp/3p4/2p1p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 7,This move protects d5. Remember how you read that d5 was a key square in the Sicilian?
13,d3,d2d3,rn2kb1r/pp1qnppp/3p4/2p1p3/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,I plan to gain some space and let my last bishop control some more squares.
14,Nec6,e7c6,rn2kb1r/pp1q1ppp/2np4/2p1p3/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 1 8,This was likely to go into d4 if I go to d5.
15,Re1,f1e1,rn2kb1r/pp1q1ppp/2np4/2p1p3/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq - 2 8,"I do not know why I played this. I wanted to play Nd5. If Nd4, I play c3 and then d4 later."
16,Be7,f8e7,rn2k2r/pp1qbppp/2np4/2p1p3/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w kq - 3 9,This was likely to develop and castle.
17,Nd5,c3d5,rn2k2r/pp1qbppp/2np4/2pNp3/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq - 4 9,"Now I play that to get the outpost... I forgot this opening was meant to control d5, not occupy it."
18,Nb4,c6b4,rn2k2r/pp1qbppp/3p4/2pNp3/1n2P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w kq - 5 10,This was to trade knights due to my superior outpost.
19,Nxb4,d5b4,rn2k2r/pp1qbppp/3p4/2p1p3/1N2P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq - 0 10,"I trade, so that he gets doubled b-pawns."
20,cxb4,c5b4,rn2k2r/pp1qbppp/3p4/4p3/1p2P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w kq - 0 11,Recaptures...
