2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,The King's Gambit! One of my favorite openings on both sides of the board. It's very rare to see a dull game in this opening.

5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,All very by-the-book. I should mention that I played several games against this opponent; this was one of the later ones and the opening was played quite rapidly as we'd already played it out a couple of times at this point.

11,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk1nr/pppp1pb1/7p/6p1/2BPPp2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"The first game we played, White played 7.Bxf7+?! in this position. I ended up with a crushing lead, and I think this time he was feeling somewhat too cautious. More common are 7.h4, 7.g3, or simply 7.O-O."

On the one hand, it invites Black to bottle up his forces with 9...c6, making development slightly more difficult. On the other hand, it doesn't accomplish a whole lot, and Black's QN frequently ends up aiding on the kingside via d7 anyway, so this check may not accomplish much of anything."
