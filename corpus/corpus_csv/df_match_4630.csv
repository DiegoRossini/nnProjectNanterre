1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I have been asked to annotate this game
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The centre counter defence, a respected, if slightly unambitious defence."
3,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,White takes.
4,Qxd5,d8d5,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Black takes back
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,White hits the queen.
6,Qe5+,d5e5,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/4q3/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"Black throws in a check. I remember reading an article in the magazine ""Chess"" promoting this move, although post-match computer (hereafter referred to as ""computer"") gives it as an error. The downside is that White can continue with Be2 and Nf3 hitting the queen again. The article suggested continuing 4. Be2 c6 5. Nf3 Qc7 and justified this on the grounds that c6 and Qc7 is often playing in this opening anyway. I am not convinced!"
7,Qe2,d1e2,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/4q3/8/2N5/PPPPQPPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 3 4,White doesn't go in for the lines mentioned above. I think white should
8,Qxe2+,e5e2,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/8/2N5/PPPPqPPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 0 5,So black takes
9,Ngxe2,g1e2,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/8/2N5/PPPPNPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 5,white takes back
10,Bf5,c8f5,rn2kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/5b2/8/2N5/PPPPNPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 1 6,Black hits c2
11,d3,d2d3,rn2kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/5b2/8/2NP4/PPP1NPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"White defends. Computer gives Nd4 as better, but I don't agree!"
12,Nc6,b8c6,r3kbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/5b2/8/2NP4/PPP1NPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 1 7,Black develops
13,Bf4,c1f4,r3kbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/5b2/5B2/2NP4/PPP1NPPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 2 7,white hits c7

15,Ng3,e2g3,r3kbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/4pb2/5B2/2NP2N1/PPP2PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 1 8,White counter attacks. I wonder if black considered Bxd3 here? It seems to win a pawn. Computer prefers Be6.
16,g6,g7g6,r3kbnr/ppp2p1p/2n3p1/4pb2/5B2/2NP2N1/PPP2PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 9,But black plays this

20,Nd4,c6d4,r3k1nr/ppp2p1p/6p1/4pb2/1b1n4/2NP2N1/PPPB1PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 4 11,"Computer prefers Be6, but I like this move, attacking c2 and protecting Bf5"
