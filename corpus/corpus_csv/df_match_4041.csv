1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I am usually at a loss when trying to create a pawn storm.  Should it be a single mayhem-maker, or a time-consuming swarm?  This time, a swarm seemed to work.  I was proud to play this deeply into a territorial battle, against a much higher-rated opponent here. I play white, and comments most welcome!"

As I said, I get the idea of a pawn storm, I just don't know how to make one work in a time-efficient way.  However, I felt that there was some time to spare here--I felt that my kingside defences were relatively resilient, and took the time to complete a full-on pawn storm."

This move blocks his finacetto bishop, although I suppose  12...e5 can be met by  13. d5 and the result is the same.
