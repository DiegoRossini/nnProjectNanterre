Better is  2 .. d5 or 2 ... Nf6 which would of been a standard response to 2. c4"

5,Nf3,g1f3,rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/2PP3q/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 3,Developing while making black waste another turn by moving his Queen again.
6,Qe4,h4e4,rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/2PPq3/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 3 4,I did this to stop Bb4 but I should of just kept developing with 4 Nc3

8,Nf6,g8f6,rnb1kb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PPq3/P4N2/1P2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,Another free move to get my Knight out since he will have to move his Queen rather then bring out more of his pieces.
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1kb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PPq3/P1N2N2/1P2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,Another free move to get my Knight out since he will have to move his Queen rather then bring out more of his pieces.

13,Nxe4,c3e4,rnb1kb1r/pppp1ppp/4p3/5q2/2PPN3/P3PN2/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,This is the 5th time he has had to move his Queen in the opening. It is ideal to move a piece just once during your development.
14,Qxe4,f5e4,rnb1kb1r/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/2PPq3/P3PN2/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,This is the 5th time he has had to move his Queen in the opening. It is ideal to move a piece just once during your development.

17,O-O,e1g1,rnb1kb1r/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/2PP2q1/P2BPN2/1P3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 3 9,0-0 is a solid move but interesting would of been 9. h3 if 9... Qxg2? 10 Rh2! and black would lose his queen.
18,Nc6,b8c6,r1b1kb1r/pppp1ppp/2n1p3/8/2PP2q1/P2BPN2/1P3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 4 10,Better is 9 ... Be7.   9 ... Nc6 followed by 10 d5 making his knight go to the edge of the board or cramping his position making him lose more time in getting his pieces active. I ended up missing the d5 move in the game though.
19,h3,h2h3,r1b1kb1r/pppp1ppp/2n1p3/8/2PP2q1/P2BPN1P/1P3PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 10,I did this because I didn't like his queen staring down at my king but this move just wasted my time.

23,e4,e3e4,r1b1kb1r/pppp2pp/2n1p3/5p1q/1PPPP3/P2B1N1P/5PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 12,My response to f5 since he is starting to weaken his king side I wish to open it up as much as I can to put pressure on it.

32,b6,b7b6,r1b2rk1/p1ppR1pp/1p6/nP3p1q/2PP4/P2B1N1P/5PP1/R1BQ2K1 w - - 0 17,I did this because I would rather his Knight be placed on the b7 square then his bishop. But due to 17... a6 I believe 17 Bf4 would of been slightly better.

35,Qc2,d1c2,r1b2rk1/pnppR1pp/1p6/1P3p1q/2PP4/P2B1N1P/2QB1PP1/R5K1 b - - 3 18,I did this to line up my queen and bishop on the b1 h7 diagonal  but 18 Qe2 would of been more of a threat.

Note that with 20 Bxf4 if black does 20... Rxf4 following will be 21 Re8+ Rf8 22. Bxh7 Qxh7 23. Qxh7+ Kxh7 24 Rxf8"
