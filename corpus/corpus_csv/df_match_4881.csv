3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,White goes probably for the open sicilian.
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"Nothing wrong, but I expected d4. @slywing the realms of the sicilian defense are huge, and Bc4 is a extreemely common move in many open and closed sicilians. the move e6, in many cases, can be broken down by some pawn thrusts, or with a piece sac. Also, e6 restricts piece mobility, with the light bishop. If white wants to , he can go into a open siclian, and the d6 pawn will be left weak and unable to advance in many cases."

6,h6,h7h6,rnbqkbnr/pp2ppp1/3p3p/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,"It would be wrong to label this move as just 'bad', but I would never play it because it just wastes time.@slywing but this is not nearly enough to lose a game, even at the grandmasters level. White could probably get a edge in a masters game. I would like to see some of the strongest players on this site get a real advantage from this small move agianst good play. It is not too critical."
7,h3,h2h3,rnbqkbnr/pp2ppp1/3p3p/2p5/2B1P3/5N1P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,Black develops a piece. The position is about =. White looks better.
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2ppp1/3p1n1p/2p5/2B1P3/5N1P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 5,Black develops a piece. The position is about =. White looks better.
9,d3,d2d3,rnbqkb1r/pp2ppp1/3p1n1p/2p5/2B1P3/3P1N1P/PPP2PP1/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"Supporting the pawn. White's other option was Nc3, where the move d4 could be played quickly. Would anyone consider advancing or sacrificing the pawn with a move like 0-0?@slywing yes, I would probably choose Nc3 personally, and head for an open position. The knight is probably going there anyways if d4 is played. However, if white intended a closed game, which I would prefer not to go to, then d3 is fine. The knight ma head to d2 anytime, or c3."
10,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pp2ppp1/2np1n1p/2p5/2B1P3/3P1N1P/PPP2PP1/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 6,"This square is not optimal for the bishop. The bishop neither looks good nor has an active role at this square. White was probably unsure about where to put the bishop. If he wanted to, he could have pllayed Nc3, and waited for 'signs' of where to put the bishop."
11,Bd2,c1d2,r1bqkb1r/pp2ppp1/2np1n1p/2p5/2B1P3/3P1N1P/PPPB1PP1/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 2 6,"This square is not optimal for the bishop. The bishop neither looks good nor has an active role at this square.

However, here it is not as good as if the white dark square bishop were fianchettoed. Now the d5 square is a target, and black has no outposts or weak squares to target himself."
13,a3,a2a3,r1bqkb1r/pp3pp1/2np1n1p/2p1p3/2B1P3/P2P1N1P/1PPB1PP1/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 0 7,"Nc3 was better. My strong point in chess are tactics and attack strategy, but closed positions and manuevering give me headaches. this move a3 might have been intended to play b4, getting a little open play and potentially activating the rook. a simple a5 would stop it. All together, b4 idea is not very hopeful."
14,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/pp2bpp1/2np1n1p/2p1p3/2B1P3/P2P1N1P/1PPB1PP1/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 1 8,"The first real mistake of the game. Black was doing fine up til now. This is the kind of move to play in general when the position is open, you have a majority of your forces at the kingside, and they are all at their optimal positions. Preferably, the opponent has very few pieces for defense. It can rarely even be played to just gain an initiative. In those positions, this move often gains a decisive ad, even when no tactical finishes are found, these moves force a win. Instead, in closed positions, with no force to back up the sacrifice, and no way to take the initiative, this is the kind of move weak players make, in attempt to 'open the king'. What they are doing is really 'losing a piece'. As the game continues, white's advantage gets bigger. Black probably could have just castled and had a good game. Be6 is even considerable. Anything but this."
