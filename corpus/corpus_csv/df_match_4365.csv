1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This is my first annotation. I chose this game because I was losing at some point but I didn't give up and in the end I managed to make my opponent resign. Victory is sweeter when you work hard for it and the opponent has a higher rating :)

9,Ne5,f3e5,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/4N3/2pP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,White should have played 5. a4 first (the Alapin Variation) in order to prevent me from defending the c4 pawn with b5.
