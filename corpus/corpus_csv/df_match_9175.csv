A privilege to play against sycilmathai once again."

I immediately started thinking about uniting my queen and LSB on the a2-g8 diagonal.  (10....dxc would give me a dynamite LSB with 11. Bxc4, and 12. Qb3 would allow this pair to go marauding.)

The backward e pawn will invite my sacrifice offer three moves later."

I remember that at this point sycilmathai wrote ""You're messing up my plan!""  The plan in question must have involved opening up the center for his LSB (perhaps exchanging both pawns under threat) and revealing an attack on my d pawn.  But here I was able to take initiative."

Was taking better?  Many scenarios exist, but one is 12...Qxe6 13.cxd5 Nxd5 14. Bc4 Na5  15. Bxd5 Bxd5 16. Qxd5 Qxd5 17. Nxd5 leaving white up only the one pawn with position roughly equal."

Perhaps Nxd5 was better here, or even g6?  I considered g6 a possibility, and thought of offering a second sacrifice:  15. Bxf5 gxf5 16. Qxf5, getting two pawns for the bishop, exposing the king, and protecting the passer, but the position gets a little over-extended for white."

Ng5 Qc6 offers a countering mate-threat, and I have not found a continuous forced mate from here, but white should be able to play the position to further advantage."

In the end it looks like 9....d5 was a losing proposition.  Thanks for the game!"
