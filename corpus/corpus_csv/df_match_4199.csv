1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game was a nice theoretical struggle, on a common top level (Anand, Kramnik, Shirov,...) opening variation, were white sacrifices the a pawn to grab the initiative, and exert a smashing center domain... I disliked the follow up after the already played 21.dxe7 that just loses a great passed pawn, and went to play a novelty with the idea of infiltrating black's 7th rank and pressure for the promotion of that same pawn... it payed off and black blundered a rook for a pawn as he missed the easy combination that grants a promotion with check..."
