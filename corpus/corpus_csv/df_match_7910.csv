1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

After my 8 rating point loss against John it is nice to get back to winning ways.  I note from Ion's comments about the point distribution between white or black in this mini-tournament.   In my case make that 10 points out of 13 games.  You Steve (untateve) pointed out that the black player often loses his queen.  Well in my case I deliberately walked Glenda into a pin against Henry.  You may think I am off my trolley, indeed I have had a few moments of madness such as taking the black side of a Latvian or a Fried Liver Attack against Coach Ion or the Fried Fox Pork Chop Opening against the Master Mater and paying the ultimate price, but to deliberately walk Glenda into a Royal Pin?  That must take the biscuit!  You will, however, see a method in the madness.  We pick up the action on move 11."
