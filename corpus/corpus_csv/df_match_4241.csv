17,Kf1,e1f1,r2qkb1r/pbp2ppp/1p3n2/3Pp3/8/1QNnP1P1/PP1PNPBP/R1B2K1R b kq - 4 9,This is where the complications will begin. I expected Nc5 however blacks move is interesting.
18,e4,e5e4,r2qkb1r/pbp2ppp/1p3n2/3P4/4p3/1QNnP1P1/PP1PNPBP/R1B2K1R w kq - 0 10,!? Black plays e4 protecting the knight however there are some complications: Nxe4 (Nxe5? Qxd3 is what my friend played to start with however I let him take it back) Nxe4 Bxe4 Nc5 Qc2 Bxe4 (Or Qxe4) and black is better due to a safer king however he is a pawn down but I beleive he has compensation. White's weak king and light squares as well as some troublesome development of the DSB. So maybe rather than Bxe4 white Plays Qxe3 Nf6 with pressure on the d-pawn. White can play e4 or Nc3 but not Nf4 due to g5 and kicking the Knight and dropping the d-pawn. This is probably better for white (I like Nc3) because he has two pawns for his bad king however he needs to exchange pieces and get to an endgame to make advantage of this.
