I probably should have played Be6, but decided on d6 to prevent e5 and free my white bishop.  Jeremy Silman says that e5 is a mistake for white and that an early d6 is a sign that black doesn't know the opening (which I've already stated).  :)"

White's kingside knight didn't emerge till move 28 and the rook never stirred.  Either Nf3 or f4 would have challenged my center knight and given white much better chances."
