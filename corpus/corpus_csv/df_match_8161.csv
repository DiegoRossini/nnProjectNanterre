1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Here is an interesting miniature I played on the ICC.  Time control G-5.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,My standard response to the queen pawn openings.  I have played the Nimzo-Bogo systems for the past 5 years and find they are very solid and can provide interesting kingside attacking chances.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Heading straight for the main lines, many players who want to avoid theory will try the Tromp, the Torre, the London, or even 2. Nc3 aiming for a Veresov or a gambit with 3. e4!?."
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Implementing the light-squared strategy in the center and preparing to develop the bishop to b4.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"Supporting the e4-push which forces black to respond in the center immediately with, ...d5, ...c5, or my favorite..."
6,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,Bb4.  Heading straight for the Nimzo-Indian where black counts on his pieces to control the center and also on rapid development.
7,Qc2,d1c2,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PPQ1PPPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 3 4,The classical variation of the Nimzo.  There are nine different strategies that white can adopt against the Nimzo and my opponent chooses the most popular.
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n1pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PPQ1PPPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 4 5,It's no secret that my pet line against the classical is a little known variation known as the Zurich.  Rapid development coupled with an immediate threat to the d-pawn which white has temporarily abandoned.
9,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n1pn2/8/1bPP4/2N2N2/PPQ1PPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 5 5,Probably the most sound reply.  White keeps up his development and keeps the c1-h6 diagonal for his dark-squared bishop.
10,d6,d7d6,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2nppn2/8/1bPP4/2N2N2/PPQ1PPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 0 6,With this move it's clear that black wants to swap the dark-squared bishop for the knight and try to arrange an ...e5 break to free the other bishop and gain some space in the center.
11,a3,a2a3,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2nppn2/8/1bPP4/P1N2N2/1PQ1PPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 6,Immediately forcing the swap.
12,Bxc3+,b4c3,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2nppn2/8/2PP4/P1b2N2/1PQ1PPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"Avoiding any pawn weaknesses, but temporarily leaving e4 in black's control."
13,Qxc3,c2c3,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2nppn2/8/2PP4/P1Q2N2/1P2PPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"Avoiding any pawn weaknesses, but temporarily leaving e4 in black's control."
14,a5,a7a5,r1bqk2r/1pp2ppp/2nppn2/p7/2PP4/P1Q2N2/1P2PPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 0 8,This is the move I forgot when I played this line agains GM Varushan Akobian in a Seattle Simul.  In that game I played the immediate ...Ne4 and ...f5 and Var eventually took over the center and won around move 42.
15,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqk2r/1pp2ppp/2nppn2/p5B1/2PP4/P1Q2N2/1P2PPPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 1 8,A solid an aggressive continuation.  I decide to hit the bishop.
16,h6,h7h6,r1bqk2r/1pp2pp1/2nppn1p/p5B1/2PP4/P1Q2N2/1P2PPPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 9,Not quite the best move as this helps black develop and brings the queen into position to assist in an ...e5 break.
17,Bxf6,g5f6,r1bqk2r/1pp2pp1/2nppB1p/p7/2PP4/P1Q2N2/1P2PPPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 9,Not quite the best move as this helps black develop and brings the queen into position to assist in an ...e5 break.
18,Qxf6,d8f6,r1b1k2r/1pp2pp1/2nppq1p/p7/2PP4/P1Q2N2/1P2PPPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 10,"This is also a bit odd as e3 is the theoretical recommendation, bringing the other bishop into play and preparing to castle."
19,Rc1,a1c1,r1b1k2r/1pp2pp1/2nppq1p/p7/2PP4/P1Q2N2/1P2PPPP/2R1KB1R b Kkq - 1 10,"This is also a bit odd as e3 is the theoretical recommendation, bringing the other bishop into play and preparing to castle."
20,Bd7,c8d7,r3k2r/1ppb1pp1/2nppq1p/p7/2PP4/P1Q2N2/1P2PPPP/2R1KB1R w Kkq - 2 11,Simple development.  0-0 is also fine.
21,e3,e2e3,r3k2r/1ppb1pp1/2nppq1p/p7/2PP4/P1Q1PN2/1P3PPP/2R1KB1R b Kkq - 0 11,Keeping control of the d4-square.  11. e4 would allow black easy equality after 11...e5; 12. d5 Nd4.
22,O-O,e8g8,r4rk1/1ppb1pp1/2nppq1p/p7/2PP4/P1Q1PN2/1P3PPP/2R1KB1R w K - 1 12,Castling before the central break ...e5.
23,Bd3,f1d3,r4rk1/1ppb1pp1/2nppq1p/p7/2PP4/P1QBPN2/1P3PPP/2R1K2R b K - 2 12,"Be2 is better as there really isnt a target on the kingside after ...h6.  White will also many times play e4 to stop ...f5, when the bishop on d3 is poor."
