I play Ng3 which not only gets it pinned but also blocks my f pawn. I'm satisfied that at least it's a developing move and that I can remove the pin later.  We'll see how things work out..."

Both my knights would love to move forward (Ne5 and Nc5), except my d pawn can't defend both of them adequately.  I guess I should have played b4 last turn instead."
