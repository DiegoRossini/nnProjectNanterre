4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"This the Classic variation, other possibilities are c6: the Slav, dxc4: accepted Queen's Gambit, Nc6: Tsjigorin, c5: Austrian defence and the ambitious e5, Albin's Counter Gambit."

If white is so stupid to think he wins the pawn on d5, he's wrely mistaking! Because after 5. cxd5 exd5 6. Nxd5? Nxd5! 7. Bxd8 Bb4  white has lost a minor piece."

18,Bb7,c8b7,r2q1rk1/pbpnbpp1/1p2pn1p/3p4/2PP3B/2NBPN2/PPQ2PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 2 10,"This is a typical bad move. What's the point of a move like h3? g4 is impossible, because I can win a pawn with taking c4."
