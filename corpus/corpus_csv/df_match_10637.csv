1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Here is a team game I just completed, and it was one of the hardest fought games I've had in a while. It was a very positional type game, and with the white pieces I establish what I considered to be a very favorable position with two handsomely posted pieces. While the board was somewhat locked down, I felt that I had a nice space advantage and the more active pieces. The main problem was that I just couldn't seem to break through. My opponent, who was apparently playing off of his heels heading into and during the middlegame, fights back very admirably and has me on the very unexpected defensive. He ends up pushing a pawn down my throat that forces me to lose my last piece defending against his promotion. The real beauty of the position is that while I am down a piece, that piece is a bishop, and as you know lone bishops can be dodged by a crafty king. My king runs an end sweep around his remaining pawns, and ends up trapping the enemy king! This really is a pretty nifty draw - I hope you enjoy:)"
