1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

So, I see you enjoyed that game where I gave my Class C opponent a hard time with a central pawn push.  In this game (which began with a Queen Pawn Opening) against a Class A 1800+ opponent, it was one passer on one side and two connected pawns on the other in a rook and pawn ending.  Although the connected pawns were on the kingside, they were not passed.  However, my decoy pawn enticed the rooks to be swapped off and my kingside pawn majority proved decisive.  Glenda's arrival heralded victory for Yours Truly.  Gameknot Analysis is provided here: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=16196577&rnd=0.8325142630569565"
