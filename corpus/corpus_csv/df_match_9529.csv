1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This was a standard game between two low-ranked players. I annotated this game simply to try and improve my own skills and understanding of the game. I opened with e4 - the only move I've had much experience with.
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Black plays the Caro-Kann defence.
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,The Goldman variation of the Caro-Kann plays d5 instead. I can't find this variation in the GameKnot database.
4,b5,b7b5,rnbqkbnr/p2ppppp/2p5/1p6/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,The Goldman variation of the Caro-Kann plays d5 instead. I can't find this variation in the GameKnot database.
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/p2ppppp/2p5/1p6/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"Again, a less-than-common move, with a strong structure on white squares but very weak on black squares, a blocked white bishop and with no pieces developed."
6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/p2p1ppp/2p1p3/1p6/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Again, a less-than-common move, with a strong structure on white squares but very weak on black squares, a blocked white bishop and with no pieces developed."
7,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/p2p1ppp/2p1p3/1p6/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,I tried to push paws forward to stop black gaining too much pawn strength.
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/p2p1ppp/2p1pn2/1p6/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"A strange move for the knight, with no support and no visible motive. Black is falling further and further behind on development."
9,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqkb1r/p2p1ppp/2p1pn2/1p6/3PP3/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 5,"A strange move for the knight, with no support and no visible motive. Black is falling further and further behind on development."
10,Ng4,f6g4,rnbqkb1r/p2p1ppp/2p1p3/1p6/3PP1n1/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 3 6,"A strange move for the knight, with no support and no visible motive. Black is falling further and further behind on development."
11,Bf4,c1f4,rnbqkb1r/p2p1ppp/2p1p3/1p6/3PPBn1/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 4 6,"With hindsight, Bg5 might have also been good. Black would have three options: move the queen, play f6 in contrast to his previous pawn moves, or play Be7, the best option. Instead, I played the less-confrontational Bf4."
12,Qf6,d8f6,rnb1kb1r/p2p1ppp/2p1pq2/1p6/3PPBn1/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 5 7,This move served two purposes for me: I was able to defend the bishop and move the knight away from black's oppressive pawns.
13,Ne2,c3e2,rnb1kb1r/p2p1ppp/2p1pq2/1p6/3PPBn1/3B1N2/PPP1NPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 6 7,This move served two purposes for me: I was able to defend the bishop and move the knight away from black's oppressive pawns.
14,Bb4+,f8b4,rnb1k2r/p2p1ppp/2p1pq2/1p6/1b1PPBn1/3B1N2/PPP1NPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 7 8,A waste of a move on black's part.
15,Bd2,f4d2,rnb1k2r/p2p1ppp/2p1pq2/1p6/1b1PP1n1/3B1N2/PPPBNPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 8 8,"c3 is also viable, with a view to pushing forward on the queen-side."
16,Bd6,b4d6,rnb1k2r/p2p1ppp/2pbpq2/1p6/3PP1n1/3B1N2/PPPBNPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 9 9,Pushes forward and forks the black queen and bishop.

19,dxe5,d4e5,rnb1k2r/p2p1ppp/2p1pq2/1p2P3/6n1/3B1N2/PPPBNPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 10,Pushes forward to try and break black's pawn structure and free the queen for action.

23,cxb5,c4b5,r1b1k2r/p2pqppp/n1p1p3/1P2P3/6n1/3B1N2/PP1BNPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 12,In keeping with the idea behind playing c4. The next few moves require little comment.
