1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,c4 is an alternative taking play into a Gurgenidze Accelerated Dragon after g6. Nc3 is fine though expecting a Classical Sicilian

10,g6,g7g6,r1bqkbnr/pp2pp1p/2np2p1/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,This is quite an odd move order for the dragon but I couldn't find a punishment of any kind
11,Be3,c1e3,r1bqkbnr/pp2pp1p/2np2p1/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,Bb3 isn't necessary due to the early d6. We are now in a normal dragon as opposed to an accelerated

15,f3,f2f3,r1bqk2r/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/2BNP3/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 8,Bb3 isn't necessary due to the early d6. We are now in a normal dragon as opposed to an accelerated
16,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/2BNP3/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R w KQ - 1 9,"This is more precise than the usual Bb3. It looks odd to retreat the bishop but the knight doesn't belong on a5 so it will likely transpose to a more mainstream dragon line after Bd7, Rc8 and Nc4."
17,Qd2,d1d2,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/2BNP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3K2R b KQ - 2 9,"This is more precise than the usual Bb3. It looks odd to retreat the bishop but the knight doesn't belong on a5 so it will likely transpose to a more mainstream dragon line after Bd7, Rc8 and Nc4."

20,Nc6,a5c6,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPPQB1PP/R3K2R w KQ - 5 11,A surprising move and not one I particularly rate. The bishop itself may not have gained anything by going to e2 but at least the a1 rook can swing into the attack faster if necessary afetr 0-0-0 so I don't see how Black has gained anything.
21,O-O-O,e1c1,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPPQB1PP/2KR3R b - - 6 11,A surprising move and not one I particularly rate. The bishop itself may not have gained anything by going to e2 but at least the a1 rook can swing into the attack faster if necessary after 0-0-0 so I don't see how Black has gained anything.
22,Qa5,d8a5,r1b2rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/q7/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPPQB1PP/2KR3R w - - 7 12,This doesn't seem consistent. The only meaningful idea behind Nc6 I thought was to play into a 0-0-0 rather than a Bc4 dragon with d5 where the loss of tempo may be made slightly relevant by the fact that I'm in an opening less consistent with my repertoire.
23,Nb3,d4b3,r1b2rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/q7/4P3/1NN1BP2/PPPQB1PP/2KR3R b - - 8 12,The last two moves have resulted in a transposition to mainline Qa5 dragon with an extra tempo spent on Be2. Now after the main move h5 then g4 will come with more force now thanks to the bishop on e2 and the rook on d1 getting to g1 quickly
24,Qc7,a5c7,r1b2rk1/ppq1ppbp/2np1np1/8/4P3/1NN1BP2/PPPQB1PP/2KR3R w - - 9 13,The last two moves have resulted in a transposition to mainline Qa5 dragon with an extra tempo spent on Be2.

27,g4,g2g4,r1b2rk1/ppq1ppbp/2np2p1/7n/4P1PP/1NN1BP2/PPPQB3/2KR3R b - - 0 14,"This move is another strange one to look at. It has a few interesting lines though. The main sequence I looked at was f4, Bxc3, bxc3 (Qxc3, Nxe2, Rxe2, Bxg4) Nxe2, Qxe2, where white does have the doubled pawn weakness but this wont be significant because of the dark square weaknesses in Black's kingside and fact that White's queenside is much more developed."
