1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,My typical response to e4 players. My coach tell me it most popular as well. My goal is to gain advantage over the d4 square with the sacrifice of white aggressive development. Also I don't tend to like to play copycat game (1. e4 e5 ...) but rather pick my own style of play.

3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,This is new for me. I not see players play this against me before either online or on the chess board. I see if sequence 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 to play. So this make me think a bit.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,This is new for me. I not see players play this against me before either online or on the chess board. I see if sequence 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 to play. So this make me think a bit.

6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,"In the end I choose develop other knight I anticipate the e5 response for white forcing another knight move, but nothing really expose. As I say before this play is new for me."
7,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/1Bp5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 5 4,Not what I expect but it works as well I think.
8,e5,e7e5,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/1Bp1p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,Since white choose not to go for e5 I choose to. I predict the next response and set conditionals: 5. Bxc6 dxc6 6. Nxe5 Nxe4 7. Nxe4 Qd4 8. d3 Qxe5 to simplify the position a bit.
9,Bxc6,b5c6,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2B2n2/2p1p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,The queen take control of center position but Black have double pawn but with bishop off board for white it make it difficult to take advantage. Plus the pawn to claim d4 and d5 and queen control e5 so center is good right now. Did I bring queen out to fast?

17,f4,f2f4,r1b1kb1r/pp3ppp/2p5/2p1q3/4NP2/3P4/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 9,With only knight in center White must use tempo and superior pawn structure to regain position in center.

Many piece lay not develop for Black and the retreat to start square put pressure on Black to develop and get tempo lost back. f5 is option for Black but I choose not to open position around king yet. This allow white to take f5 and limit bishop involvement.
22,Qd8,d5d8,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2p5/2p5/2P1NP2/3P4/PP2Q1PP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 1 12,At castle point. White play very well to get space in center develop remain piece and soon can connect rook.

It turn out it really is a good move. I only see the weak 2 rank due to the queen come out. I not see how bad my kingside become.

It will be end soon. I should play Rf7 last move instead and Bd7 to get rook help to protect weak kingside. But I decide to follow my plan instead.
