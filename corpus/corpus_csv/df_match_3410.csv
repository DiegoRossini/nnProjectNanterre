1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Ardin kindly put this game into the It Can Be Done thread many moons ago.  Although this isn't an Expert draw, it is a Near-Expert Draw and there is a 500 point rating differential between the two sides.  It looked as though Ardin's opponent was gonna cop Old Matey.  In fact the black king was in Old Matey's shadow, but a stunning sacrifice of the black queen ensured that Ardin delivered the wrong kind of mate.  So how did this happen?  Well, here is the Gameknot Analysis version: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=13171068&rnd=0.9733391231055444"
