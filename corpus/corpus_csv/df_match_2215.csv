Now the black rook is tied to a6, else the white pawn will advance, whilst the white rook can make tempo moves back down the a-file, as required. White's plan is as follows: 
1. Bring his king over towards the pawn. The black king will have to stand in opposition, to prevent the white king reaching b5 and forcing the advance of the pawn.
2. Once the kings stand in opposition, a waiting move by the white rook will force the black king to give way; either it allows its opposite number into b5, or into the kingside (two weaknesses!}."

By a curious coincidence, just as this book was being written, German endgame expert Dr Karsten Muller devoted one of his Chess Cafe endgame columns to an examination of this very move, prompted by  analysis supplied by a German amateur, Erich Korber. The full analysis is too extensive to reproduce here, and can be found in Muller's column anyway, but the conclusion is that White still wins. The main line of the analysis immediately exploits Black's failure to play 56 ...h5, as follows: 57. h5 Ke6 (or 57. ...g5 58. f4 gxf4+ 59. Kxf4 and White's king invades the kingside, rather as in the final phase of the game continuation) 58. hxg6 fxg6 and White will now be able to create another passed pawn, this time on the  king side. 
Just as in the game, Black will not be able to hold both fronts: 59. f4 h5 60. Kd4 Kd6 61. Ra3! and White wins in similar fashion to the game: his king will either penetrate on the queenside and support the apawn, or will attack the kingside pawns, supported at the crucial moment by a switch of his rook.
