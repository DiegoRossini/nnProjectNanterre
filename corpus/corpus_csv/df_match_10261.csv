1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I chose the quieter Queen pawn opening to steer the game into quieter lines. In so doing I am trading quick attacking chances for long term gains. Queen pawn games develop quietly and are more positional by nature. Thus, you will not see quick opening mates very often."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,The kings indian is a very flexible openning system. GMs often use it to steer way from varations that they do not wish to play.

7,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 4,"fianchettoing this bishop is not my style. I prefer to develop it to Nc3 or c4. I am  a very positional player, I naturally play moves that optimize the potential of my pieces."
8,d5,d7d5,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3p4/2PP4/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,In the style of Petrosain I opt to release the tension in the centre immedaitely.

10,Nxd5,f6d5,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/6p1/3n4/3P4/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,I decide to play queitly and opted out of e4 because my centre would be hard to defend. Nc3 is also playable.

14,c5,c7c5,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/2pn4/3P4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 8,An ambitous move that strikes immedaitely at white's centre. This move is in the spirit of the Neo-grunfeld defence.
15,Nxd5,c3d5,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/2pN4/3P4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 8,This removes black's advanced knight.
16,Qxd5,d8d5,rnb2rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/2pq4/3P4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 9,Black has a slight edge in the centre.
17,O-O,e1g1,rnb2rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/2pq4/3P4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 9,Black has a slight edge in the centre.
18,cxd4,c5d4,rnb2rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/3q4/3p4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 10,This is a very imposing pawn.
19,Be3,c1e3,rnb2rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/3q4/3p4/4BNP1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 10,Aiming to get rid of the pawn.
20,Qh5,d5h5,rnb2rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/7q/3p4/4BNP1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 2 11,This is a bit odd. The queen does not exert much influence from here. Besides black gives back the pawn for nothing in return.
21,Nxd4,f3d4,rnb2rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/7q/3N4/4B1P1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 11,regaining the pawn with a temperary plus in position.
22,e5,e7e5,rnb2rk1/pp3pbp/6p1/4p2q/3N4/4B1P1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 12,Ok I will move!
23,Nb5,d4b5,rnb2rk1/pp3pbp/6p1/1N2p2q/8/4B1P1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 12,This forces black a bit.
24,Nc6,b8c6,r1b2rk1/pp3pbp/2n3p1/1N2p2q/8/4B1P1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 2 13,getting rid of my nice fianchetto bishop was not an easy decision but I have seen that this isolates C pawn(which black will have to contently defend) and makes advancing my queen pawns easier in the endgame. This move may have suprised Mercutio abit.
25,Bxc6,g2c6,r1b2rk1/pp3pbp/2B3p1/1N2p2q/8/4B1P1/PP2PP1P/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 13,getting rid of my nice fianchetto bishop was not an easy decision but I have seen that this isolates C pawn(which black will have to contently defend) and makes advancing my queen pawns easier in the endgame. This move may have suprised Mercutio abit.
26,bxc6,b7c6,r1b2rk1/p4pbp/2p3p1/1N2p2q/8/4B1P1/PP2PP1P/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 14,We are now entering the second phase of my overall game plan. Which is to create a pawn majority on the queen-side. I do this at the expense of creating a permanate weakness on the light squares.
27,Nxa7,b5a7,r1b2rk1/N4pbp/2p3p1/4p2q/8/4B1P1/PP2PP1P/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 14,going up a pawn and decimating blacks queen-side.
28,Ba6,c8a6,r4rk1/N4pbp/b1p3p1/4p2q/8/4B1P1/PP2PP1P/R2Q1RK1 w - - 1 15,Attacking whites weak e2 pawn
29,Re1,f1e1,r4rk1/N4pbp/b1p3p1/4p2q/8/4B1P1/PP2PP1P/R2QR1K1 b - - 2 15,defends against the e2 threat. White can also try Qc2
