7,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3P4/3P4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,My young opponent opts for the Exchange Variation.
8,Nxd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/6p1/3n4/3P4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,Now White has an imposing looking centre
9,e4,e2e4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/6p1/3n4/3PP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,Now White has an imposing looking centre
10,Nxc3,d5c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/6p1/8/3PP3/2n5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"The exchange of knights strengthens the white centre still further. Black generally attacks White's centre with ...c5 and ...Bg7, often followed by moves such as ...Qa5, ...cxd4, ...Bg4, and ...Nc6. White often uses his big centre to launch an attack against Black's king."
11,bxc3,b2c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/6p1/8/3PP3/2P5/P4PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,"The exchange of knights strengthens the white centre still further. Black generally attacks White's centre with ...c5 and ...Bg7, often followed by moves such as ...Qa5, ...cxd4, ...Bg4, and ...Nc6. White often uses his big centre to launch an attack against Black's king."
12,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/2P5/P4PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 7,"Reuben Fine in ""The ideas behind the chess openings"" 1943 thought that black had to play an immediate 6.....c7-c5 as otherwise white can play 7. Ba3. However it was later pointed out that black can play Nd7 to prepare c7-c5, if necessary sacrificing a pawn, and so black need not fear 7. Ba3, so I prefer to to play Bg7 and 0-0 first and avoid variations where white may throw in Bb5+ - not that black need fear this move either, but I haven't learned about it!"
13,Be3,c1e3,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/2P1B3/P4PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 2 7,"White can develop his pieces in a number of ways in the Exchange Variation. For decades, theory held that the correct method of development was with Bc4 and Ne2, often followed by 0-0 and f4–f5, playing for a central breakthrough or kingside attack. It was generally thought that an early Nf3 was weak in the Exchange Variation because it allowed Black too much pressure on the centre with ...Bg4. In the late 1970s, however, Karpov, Kasparov and others found different methods to play the Exchange Variation with White, often involving an early Rb1 to remove the rook from the sensitive a1–h8 diagonal, as well as attempting to hinder the development of Black's queenside. Another, relatively recently developed system involves quickly playing Be3, Qd2, and Rc1 or Rd1 to fortify White's centre, remove White's rook from the diagonal, and possibly enable an early d5 push by White. Playing 7. Be3 keeps white's options open."
14,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/2P1B3/P4PPP/R2QKBNR w KQ - 3 8,According to plan.
15,Nf3,g1f3,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/2P1BN2/P4PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 4 8,Ruling out the old main line of Bc4 and Ne2.
16,c5,c7c5,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/2p5/3PP3/2P1BN2/P4PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 9,So I do the thematic push.
17,Rc1,a1c1,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/2p5/3PP3/2P1BN2/P4PPP/2RQKB1R b K - 1 9,"Moving his rook off the a1-h8 diagonal, I was rather afraid of him playing d4-d5 followed by c3-c4 at some stage, which is why I did the following exchange."
18,cxd4,c5d4,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/8/3pP3/2P1BN2/P4PPP/2RQKB1R w K - 0 10,Now taking with knight or bishop leaves his pawn on c3 very weak - it is isolated and exposed to attack along the diagonal and the file.
19,cxd4,c3d4,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/4BN2/P4PPP/2RQKB1R b K - 0 10,So this recapture is virtually forced.
20,Bg4,c8g4,rn1q1rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/8/3PP1b1/4BN2/P4PPP/2RQKB1R w K - 1 11,"Indirectly attacking d4. If I were to take on f3 now, if he took back with the queen I could take on d4."
21,Be2,f1e2,rn1q1rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/8/3PP1b1/4BN2/P3BPPP/2RQK2R b K - 2 11,"So he prevents that. Now I decided that I had better check on a5 now, otherwise he will castle and then it is not check."
22,Qa5+,d8a5,rn3rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/q7/3PP1b1/4BN2/P3BPPP/2RQK2R w K - 3 12,So I threw in the check.
23,Qd2,d1d2,rn3rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/q7/3PP1b1/4BN2/P2QBPPP/2R1K2R b K - 4 12,Otherwise he loses the a2 pawn.
24,Qxd2+,a5d2,rn3rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/8/3PP1b1/4BN2/P2qBPPP/2R1K2R w K - 0 13,So I take.
25,Kxd2,e1d2,rn3rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/8/3PP1b1/4BN2/P2KBPPP/2R4R b - - 0 13,"He takes back. Because of his better development and strong centre white has an edge in this position, but I correctly guessed that my young opponent had yet to master the grand-master skills of grinding out a win in endings like this!"
26,Nc6,b8c6,r4rk1/pp2ppbp/2n3p1/8/3PP1b1/4BN2/P2KBPPP/2R4R w - - 1 14,So I develop.
27,d5,d4d5,r4rk1/pp2ppbp/2n3p1/3P4/4P1b1/4BN2/P2KBPPP/2R4R b - - 0 14,He attacks my knight.
