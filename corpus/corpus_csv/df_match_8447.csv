6,Bb4+,f8b4,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/1bPP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,"I don't know what this is technically classified as, but I would call it a sort of Bogo-Indian.  Black attempts to misplace my pieces with this check.  I can either play Nc3 and transpose to the Nimzo-Indian, or play Bd2, when the normal move is Be7."

16,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/8/2NP4/3BPN2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 1 9,"? A weak move which simply creates dark square weaknesses.  I assume that Black was scared of my d3 bishop, but that is no way to approach chess.  Prophylaxis is good, but this way too much.  I always strive to play active moves and reach for the initiative rather than react to my opponents moves."

Normally in these positions, White must use the ""minority attack"" a4,b4-b5, to attack the c6 pawn and make a weakness.  Black just saved me several tempi and accomplished my goal for me!"

In Nimzowitsch's My System, he claims that whoever can control the 7th rank should always win.  (Yea, yea, there is more to it than that, but that is MY simple analysis of it)."
