1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Sicilian Defense.  I chose this opening because a quick review of Maglicianer's games showed she tended to lose more often with this.

3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,I chose Nf6 because every move made by white except NC3 favors black in the database.

9,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,Naturally white plays NC3.  Pelikan variation.
10,e5,e7e5,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"This was an early morning blunder.  For some reason I thought I could answer 7 NxNe4 with Qa5+, and then QxNb5--completely overlooking the fact Nb5 was defended by Bf1.  I even programmed it."
11,Ndb5,d4b5,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/1N2p3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"This was an early morning blunder.  For some reason I thought I could answer 7 NxNe4 with Qa5+, and then QxNb5--completely overlooking the fact Nb5 was defended by Bf1.  I even programmed it."

13,Nxe4,c3e4,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n5/1N2p3/4N3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,Now I notice Bf1.  (At least I didn't program THAT!)

The black queen is all that is protecting against the infamous Nc7+ rook fork.  Black could respond with Qb6, but white would answer with Be3, forcing the black queen back to Qd8."
