1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"A remarkable high-draw game where, with an exchange down, white manages to almost win the game."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,"No one would recommend this move at this point. b4 IS in fact an important square you have to care of, eventually, but not in this early stage of the game, and not before black goes e6."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,"No one would recommend this move at this point. b4 IS in fact an important square you have to care of, eventually, but not in this early stage of the game, and not before black goes e6."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 3,"No one would recommend this move at this point. b4 IS in fact an important square you have to care of, eventually, but not in this early stage of the game, and not before black goes e6."
5,a3,a2a3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/P4N2/1PP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"No one would recommend this move at this point. b4 IS in fact an important square you have to care of, eventually, but not in this early stage of the game, and not before black goes e6."
6,c6,c7c6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/3P4/P4N2/1PP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Now, white has to take care of Qb6, threatening b2. I normally play c3 (would c4 be preferable?), but if c3 now, a3 becomes useless."
7,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/3P4/P3PN2/1PP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"Self-bloking the dsb, but normal, since Bc1 is dued to guard b2."
8,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p1b2/3P4/P3PN2/1PP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"That's better than c3. a3 has a purpose, even if black is using his developement tempoes without challenging b4, making a3 a waste of time. It is a very delicate equilibrium in openings like this... and very fascinating."
9,c4,c2c4,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p1b2/2PP4/P3PN2/1P3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"That's better than c3. a3 has a purpose, even if black is using his developement tempoes without challenging b4, making a3 a waste of time. It is a very delicate equilibrium in openings like this... and very fascinating."
10,e6,e7e6,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p1b2/2PP4/P3PN2/1P3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Ok, now a3 has a purpose (to prevent the dsb's developement with pin), and the white position resembles a little more one of a ""normal"" game. Nevertheless, it seems that black is a little more armonious and coordinated."
11,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p1b2/2PP4/P1N1PN2/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"Ok, now a3 has a purpose (to prevent the dsb's developement with pin), and the white position resembles a little more one of a ""normal"" game.

12,Bd6,f8d6,rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/2pbpn2/3p1b2/2PP4/P1N1PN2/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 7,"I would have played Ne5, but this is only my style. This move seems a little passive, though."
13,Be2,f1e2,rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/2pbpn2/3p1b2/2PP4/P1N1PN2/1P2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 7,"I would have played Ne5, but this is only my style. This move seems a little passive, though."
14,Nbd7,b8d7,r2qk2r/pp1n1ppp/2pbpn2/3p1b2/2PP4/P1N1PN2/1P2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 4 8,"A normal developement plan, but without any attack in it."
15,O-O,e1g1,r2qk2r/pp1n1ppp/2pbpn2/3p1b2/2PP4/P1N1PN2/1P2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 5 8,"A normal developement plan, but without any attack in it."
16,O-O,e8g8,r2q1rk1/pp1n1ppp/2pbpn2/3p1b2/2PP4/P1N1PN2/1P2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 6 9,"I try to castle queenside, as white, to launch a kingside pawn storm. Black helps by putting his king just on the side white can attack best."
17,b4,b2b4,r2q1rk1/pp1n1ppp/2pbpn2/3p1b2/1PPP4/P1N1PN2/4BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 9,"...but white has other plans - normal, having castled kingside."
18,a5,a7a5,r2q1rk1/1p1n1ppp/2pbpn2/p2p1b2/1PPP4/P1N1PN2/4BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 10,"A strategic battle for b4 and b5. It is very interesting. Of course white can try c5, but it leads to a lot of tactic lines (axb4, cxB, bxN...). Otherwise, if black retires the bishop, b5 favours white."
19,b5,b4b5,r2q1rk1/1p1n1ppp/2pbpn2/pP1p1b2/2PP4/P1N1PN2/4BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 10,I like this move. b5 is better for white than b4.
20,dxc4,d5c4,r2q1rk1/1p1n1ppp/2pbpn2/pP3b2/2pP4/P1N1PN2/4BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 11,I would thank black for this.
21,Bxc4,e2c4,r2q1rk1/1p1n1ppp/2pbpn2/pP3b2/2BP4/P1N1PN2/5PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 11,"!? Correct: white tries to open the white diagonal. But what would she do after e5 by black, followed by e4?"
22,c5,c6c5,r2q1rk1/1p1n1ppp/3bpn2/pPp2b2/2BP4/P1N1PN2/5PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 12,"!? Correct: white tries to open the white diagonal. But what would she do after e5 by black, followed by e4?"

25,Nxd5,c3d5,r2q1rk1/1p1n1ppp/3b1n2/pPpN1b2/2B5/P3PN2/5PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 13,"White's game is coming to life, even if the dsb is still on it starting square."
26,Ne5,d7e5,r2q1rk1/1p3ppp/3b1n2/pPpNnb2/2B5/P3PN2/5PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 14,"Black fights back for dark diagonals control. White can't develop his dsb in b2 because of NxB, so probably you can try Qe2, accepting to lose the bishop's pair, but somewhat catch up in developement."
27,Nxe5,f3e5,r2q1rk1/1p3ppp/3b1n2/pPpNNb2/2B5/P3P3/5PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 14,"This alternative saves the bishop's pair, but at the moment, black's are much more dangeroud than white's."
28,Bxe5,d6e5,r2q1rk1/1p3ppp/5n2/pPpNbb2/2B5/P3P3/5PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 15,"The plan was Rd2 from the start of the NxN sequence. It looks promising. White's bishop blocks black's c pawn, and white keeps some perspective of attack with Qb3, b6, Nc7..."
29,Ra2,a1a2,r2q1rk1/1p3ppp/5n2/pPpNbb2/2B5/P3P3/R4PPP/2BQ1RK1 b - - 1 15,"The plan was Rd2 from the start of the NxN sequence. It looks promising. White's bishop blocks black's c pawn, and white keeps some perspective of attack with Qb3, b6, Nc7..."
30,Bb1,f5b1,r2q1rk1/1p3ppp/5n2/pPpNb3/2B5/P3P3/R4PPP/1bBQ1RK1 w - - 2 16,"Dramatic. It seemed that black oversighted Rd2, but in fact this was exactly what he wanted."
