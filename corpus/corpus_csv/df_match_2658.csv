But here is white first mistake, there is no need to castle this early.
In fact it is too soon, because it gives black a target to play against.
The king should have kept his options open a little longer."

Unfortunately is runs into a counter attack: 19...,bxc6; 20.bxa5, Bxa5; 21.Rab1,Bb6; 22.a5;

So I had a seconde look at Qxc6 and realised the position is strategically won.
White has horrible weaknesses on e4 and c4."
