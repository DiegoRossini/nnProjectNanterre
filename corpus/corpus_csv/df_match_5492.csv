Qc1 - I certainly do feel that there is gonna be a major piece stouche on the a and b columns so Glenda moves to c1 to protect the b2 pawn (hence her sobriquet Glenda The Defender!) and to ensure that black will not be able to take control of either the open a and b columns when the a and b pawns are traded off.

Black tries to contest the b column by moving the Wicked Witch of the West onto that file.  But never fear, my stalwart defender, Glenda has this all sussed and covered.  Her better half, Henry edges towards the centre.  I intend a move such as g3 and moving Henry to g2.  This solidifies my position making it very hard to break down.  From a seemingly open position, that Joblock strikes again!  On moving Henry to f1 I decided to offer a draw here.  Gameknot Analysis showed the position to be slightly in favour of black so it was a good draw offer, netting me a handy 6 rating points, keeping my rating in the high 1700s.
