12,c6,c7c6,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2pp1np1/8/2PPPP2/2N1B3/PP4PP/R2QKBNR w KQ - 0 7,(?) ... and a very insipid response.  Black just wasn't attending.
13,Bd3,f1d3,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2pp1np1/8/2PPPP2/2NBB3/PP4PP/R2QK1NR b KQ - 1 7,(?) Another weird move that lands White in a bit of hot water...

I really did think the lines opened up would be of more use to Black than to White, but that belief was to prove unfounded.  But all this was in fact a change of mind.  I spent a deal of time looking at the possibility of giving up my passed d-pawn for the change of breaking through in the centre: 19...d3!? 20.Bxd3!? cxb4 21.axb4 a5 22.b5 Nd4 with maybe a bit of a bind on the position.  E.g. 23.Na4 Nb3  24.Qf2 Nc5  25.Nxc5 dxc5; or, possibly less OK for Black: 20.Nxd3 cxb4  21.axb4  Be6  22.Bb3 Nd4  23.Ba2 Bxc4  24.Bxc4 Qxc4  25.e5 (...dxe5; fxe5).  On the whole Black seemed to get nothing tangible for the pawn sacrificed."
