9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,when black plays an early ...Nf6 I try to aim for the Keres attack with f3 and g4.
10,a6,a7a6,rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,following my plan to play g4 so black should be active in order to avoid g4.

15,Nb3,d4b3,r1b1kb1r/1p2pppp/pqnp1n2/8/4P1P1/1NN2P2/PPP4P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 8,This is more flexible than 9. Be2 because the queen can float over to g2 to support g4-g5. It also threatens Be3 gaining tempo against the black queen.

So I have the better of it for sure. However, like all great defenders Drzemik does not panic but calmly thinks it through."

So here is what I have learned from Alekine and Karpov. 1) bind/limit- force your opponent into a never ending cramped position. Forcing your opponent to make further weaknesses to create room to move. 2) Bind some more- use your superior piece position to force your opponent to sacrifice material in order stay alive 3) open lines to the kings with pawn breaks.
