1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Black plays the opening poorly and it is clear that white has an advantage. eventually white wins a pawn but black gets an open g file toward the white king which ultimately proves decisive when white continues his attack with a natural but very weak move. i hope you enjoy.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"i don't usually play the sicilian, but i fancied something different. my usual against e4 is Alekhines defence"
3,c3,c2c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"the c3 sicilian, i really have no idea how to play against this."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,now the position is looking quite Alekhines defence like but with the black c pawn on c5
5,e5,e4e5,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p1P3/8/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,now the position is looking quite Alekhines defence like but with the black c pawn on c5
6,Nd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/8/2pnP3/8/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,now the position is looking quite Alekhines defence like but with the black c pawn on c5
7,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/8/2pnP3/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,now the position is looking quite Alekhines defence like but with the black c pawn on c5
8,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/8/3nP3/3p4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"apparently Nf3 is more accurate here as the d pawn is pinned to the knight on d5, but i think it would just transpose to the game next move anyway"
9,cxd4,c3d4,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/8/3nP3/3P4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"apparently Nf3 is more accurate here as the d pawn is pinned to the knight on d5, but i think it would just transpose to the game next move anyway"
10,d6,d7d6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p4/3nP3/3P4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,i've let white build a centre so now i've got to attack it before his pieces can orginise themselves to defend it
11,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p4/3nP3/3P4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,i didn't like the look of 7...e6 as it give white alot of ways to hurt my pawn structure which i'd have to keep an eye on
12,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np4/3nP3/3P4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 7,i didn't like the look of 7...e6 as it give white alot of ways to hurt my pawn structure which i'd have to keep an eye on
13,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np4/3nP3/2BP4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 7,i didn't like the look of 7...e6 as it give white alot of ways to hurt my pawn structure which i'd have to keep an eye on
14,Nb6,d5b6,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/1nnp4/4P3/2BP4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 8,i didn't like the look of 7...e6 as it give white alot of ways to hurt my pawn structure which i'd have to keep an eye on
15,Bb5,c4b5,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/1nnp4/1B2P3/3P4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 5 8,i think the exchange on c6 improves my pawn structure here.
16,a6,a7a6,r1bqkb1r/1p2pppp/pnnp4/1B2P3/3P4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,i think the exchange on c6 improves my pawn structure here.
17,Bxc6+,b5c6,r1bqkb1r/1p2pppp/pnBp4/4P3/3P4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 9,"i think whites position is better here, he has a space advantage and a slight lead in development, but black has a definate target to aim at - the white centre"
18,bxc6,b7c6,r1bqkb1r/4pppp/pnpp4/4P3/3P4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 10,"i think whites position is better here, he has a space advantage and a slight lead in development, but black has a definate target to aim at - the white centre"
19,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkb1r/4pppp/pnpp4/4P3/3P4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 10,"i think whites position is better here, he has a space advantage and a slight lead in development, but black has a definate target to aim at - the white centre"
20,Bf5,c8f5,r2qkb1r/4pppp/pnpp4/4Pb2/3P4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 11,this is a strong diagonal for the bishop as it controls some good squares deep in enemy territory and white has no light square bishop to oppose it.
21,Nh4,f3h4,r2qkb1r/4pppp/pnpp4/4Pb2/3P3N/8/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 3 11,so he forces it to move
22,Bd7,f5d7,r2qkb1r/3bpppp/pnpp4/4P3/3P3N/8/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 4 12,although the bishop is now not as active the white knight is off side on h4
23,Nc3,b1c3,r2qkb1r/3bpppp/pnpp4/4P3/3P3N/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 5 12,maybe trying to activate the dark square bishop via g7 would be a better plan
24,Nd5,b6d5,r2qkb1r/3bpppp/p1pp4/3nP3/3P3N/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 6 13,maybe trying to activate the dark square bishop via g7 would be a better plan
25,exd6,e5d6,r2qkb1r/3bpppp/p1pP4/3n4/3P3N/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 13,if 13.Nxd5 cxd5 14.exd6 e6! and blacks pawn structure is very nice and the d6 pawn will be won soon
26,Nxc3,d5c3,r2qkb1r/3bpppp/p1pP4/8/3P3N/2n5/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 14,13...e6 is an interesting alternative but it looks like it is met well with 14.Qg4
27,bxc3,b2c3,r2qkb1r/3bpppp/p1pP4/8/3P3N/2P5/P4PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 14,the natural 15...Be7? loses to 16.Bg5! Be6 (16...f3? 17.Qh5 ) 17.Bxe7 Kxe7(17...Qxe7? 18.Nf5 Qf8 19.Qa4! Kd7 20.d5! is a massacre) 18.d5 cxd5 19.Qxd5 looks very good for white
28,exd6,e7d6,r2qkb1r/3b1ppp/p1pp4/8/3P3N/2P5/P4PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 15,the natural 15...Be7? loses to 16.Bg5! Be6 (16...f3? 17.Qh5 ) 17.Bxe7 Kxe7(17...Qxe7? 18.Nf5 Qf8 19.Qa4! Kd7 20.d5! is a massacre) 18.d5 cxd5 19.Qxd5 looks very good for white
29,Re1+,f1e1,r2qkb1r/3b1ppp/p1pp4/8/3P3N/2P5/P4PPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq - 1 15,the natural 15...Be7? loses to 16.Bg5! Be6 (16...f3? 17.Qh5 ) 17.Bxe7 Kxe7(17...Qxe7? 18.Nf5 Qf8 19.Qa4! Kd7 20.d5! is a massacre) 18.d5 cxd5 19.Qxd5 looks very good for white
30,Be6,d7e6,r2qkb1r/5ppp/p1ppb3/8/3P3N/2P5/P4PPP/R1BQR1K1 w kq - 2 16,the natural 15...Be7? loses to 16.Bg5! Be6 (16...f3? 17.Qh5 ) 17.Bxe7 Kxe7(17...Qxe7? 18.Nf5 Qf8 19.Qa4! Kd7 20.d5! is a massacre) 18.d5 cxd5 19.Qxd5 looks very good for white
31,Nf5,h4f5,r2qkb1r/5ppp/p1ppb3/5N2/3P4/2P5/P4PPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq - 3 16,this is a rather annoying move that seems to tie down the black army.
32,Kd7,e8d7,r2q1b1r/3k1ppp/p1ppb3/5N2/3P4/2P5/P4PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 4 17,"this seemed the best way to side step the threats, 16...g6 17.Nh6 is strong, keeping the black king in the centre"
33,Ne3,f5e3,r2q1b1r/3k1ppp/p1ppb3/8/3P4/2P1N3/P4PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - - 5 17,here i completely missed the point and ended up paying for it.
34,Be7,f8e7,r2q3r/3kbppp/p1ppb3/8/3P4/2P1N3/P4PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 6 18,"? not a good move, ...d5 was required here preventing d5 from white"
