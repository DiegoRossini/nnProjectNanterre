1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

My opponent asked me for a rated challenge.  I did oblige because I have been in a whirlwind of rated games, although I will still play most non-MT games unrated.  Thankfully I won this game but it was very slow and hard process, even when I was a pawn up in a K & P ending I found it hard to find the right winning plan.  Thankfully I did.  You can all follow this game by clicking on the Gameknot Analysis link here: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17177151&fb=1&rnd=0.6438160757498827.  I feel that this game would be a very useful endgame study even if I did have to work hard for this victory."
