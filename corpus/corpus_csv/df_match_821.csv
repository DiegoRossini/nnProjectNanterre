The Rook sac is now the bloody end to this bold but futile attempt to recover Black's losses. At this point Black admits they had a few when moving 12...Qd7?? Well...at least they were enjoying themselves! :)

But it really doesn't matter due to that mate in 2 still in play. After 22...Nxc4+, 23. Kd3 Nxe3?? 24. gxh8+!! So the fork continues the trend of Black's attacks lacking teeth."

Remember all the way back at 16 when I said Black should have withdrawn, that the game was lost but at least they could make a last stand? That's really what Black should have done."

Looking at this game we see Black's true ability lies perhaps somewhere closer to the 1300s as they are making a complete mess of this match. Black is finally getting taught a good chess lesson! Cheap rating points for the Tipsy! :)
