1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"On the game title question - I'm not sure!   I think this is the first time I've won with it; I've lost a few times.   It follows a big number of games, and yet I find the ideas aren't all that clear for black in particular.   So wouldn't mind sharing this game and getting ideas from other players."

I'm hoping for a little clarification here!   Black could just castle here instead and hope to weather the inevitable Bd3 and h4-h5-h6 attack, and if he survives, freeze the c3 pawn (with a c4 push) and target it."

We're still following 400+ GK games.   White's kingside pawn majority is a lasting advantage.   White has an extra pawn and an open b-file to attack black's king, which is invariably going to castle long.   Black has better development and is aiming to keep white's king in the centre.   I'm not entirely sure of the necessity of Nf5 at this stage though, even though it's by a distance the most-played move here.   Is it just a case that there's no rush castling, so you may as well bring the knight more into things?   Is it that there is a rush to halt the kingside pawns as soon as possible, so the knight heads towards them?"
