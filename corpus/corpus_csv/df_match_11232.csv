1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hello guys and girls, this is my first notation. 

Well, a classic move by white."
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I have a different opening compared to the chess engines, soon you will see what I mean. Even though, my first move is alike."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Not what I expected, but it doesn't blows me off. Sending it unprotected?"
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/4p1p1/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"I won't go and try to attack it. Stick to the opening, plus he can easilly protect it."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/4p1p1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,Having the knight at c3 is a great move since you have two pawns at line four.Plus nothing is attacking the pawns
6,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk1nr/pppp1pbp/4p1p1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"Having the bishop there is a good play, since, it can attack what is attacking it and no knight is able to attact it due to the pawns around it."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk1nr/pppp1pbp/4p1p1/8/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 4,"Adding defence to the piece in the lead, helps you have control of your territory."
8,Ne7,g8e7,rnbqk2r/ppppnpbp/4p1p1/8/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 4 5,"Moving the knight away for castling is a great way to let them know your king is not easy to capture. Moving it at f6 is a bad ideal, because it blocks the bisops attack. At h6 is also good, but I don't like to extend my territory attacks."
9,e4,e2e4,rnbqk2r/ppppnpbp/4p1p1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"White is building a wall, which helps him control more of his territory. He now protected his c4 too."
10,b6,b7b6,rnbqk2r/p1ppnpbp/1p2p1p1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Aha you thought I was going to castle, but the king is not close to  danger or under attact, so there is no need to castle so soon."
11,Be2,f1e2,rnbqk2r/p1ppnpbp/1p2p1p1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,He is getting ready to castle so it won't get in the way later.
12,Bb7,c8b7,rn1qk2r/pbppnpbp/1p2p1p1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 7,"I have to have my second tower, but the real castles has four but when your facing one wall you see two towers."
13,e5,e4e5,rn1qk2r/pbppnpbp/1p2p1p1/4P3/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,He is trying to block my bishop's attack.

16,dxe5,d6e5,rn1qk2r/pbp1npbp/1p2p1p1/4p3/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 9,MY TERRITORY!   >:O
