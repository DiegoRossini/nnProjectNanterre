1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"Hi everyone!

I thought that was the end of the annotating on the above theme, but no, I remember another one, against a buddy of mine (a carpenter) who left gameknot a year ago and has still not returned to the board.  Brace yourself, this game is quite a marathon, it lasted 73 moves all in all and although it looked a comprehensive victory from me at the end, boy did the game not seasaw!  White starts off with the Reti Opening, 1. Nf3."
