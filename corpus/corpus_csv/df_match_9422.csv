It was after this game that Glenda went into her shell and from this day onwards she was either exchanged off early or if on the board, seen defending things.  Hence she is known to me as Glenda The Defender.  However, write here off at your peril my friends as every once in a while she can become Glenda The Offender!  Thankfully this was to be my only defeat in the tournament."
