Rf8+ Rxf8 Qxf8+ Kc7 Qf4+ forking his king and bishop, I then somehow assumed that he could do one of these three things. One: Kd8 where I could play Qf8+ and keep repeating it until he changed his move. Two: Kb6 I was then hoping that I could somehow get perpetual check or something, I didn't really analyze it. Or three, I though he could play Ne5, but for some reason I didn't notice Be5."
