1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"1.e4, one of the most popular openings."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"1...c5. The Sicilian. I am not secure in the Sicilian, but I decided to play along with what I knew and throw some curves."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"2...d6. Standard book, I believe. Is this a Closed Sicilian?"
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"2...d6. Standard book, I believe. Is this a Closed Sicilian?"
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"I try to open. This is actually a gambit, as you will soon see. I will sacrifice this pawn for a development and doubled d-pawns."
6,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,Protecting and developing.
7,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,Protecting and developing.
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/8/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,Protecting and developing.
9,c3,c2c3,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/8/2BpP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,Attacking. Building pressure.
10,e5,e7e5,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2np4/4p3/2BpP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"Now Black has three pawns and a minor in the center versus my one pawn and two minors. Black is cramped and underdeveloped. White can castle and continue developing. Perhaps get the Dark Squared Bishop to a3, where it can peek into Black's base."
11,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2np4/4p3/2BpP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 6,"Attacking the vulnerable e4 pawn. Nbd2 solves this problem, and develops. It can be argued that it would be a bad move, since it blocks in the Dark Bishop, and that may very well be why I played Ng5, but if White wants to put the Bishop on a3, then Nbd2 is best."
12,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2np1n2/4p3/2BpP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 7,"Attacking the vulnerable e4 pawn. Nbd2 solves this problem, and develops. It can be argued that it would be a bad move, since it blocks in the Dark Bishop, and that may very well be why I played Ng5, but if White wants to put the Bishop on a3, then Nbd2 is best."
13,Ng5,f3g5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2np1n2/4p1N1/2BpP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 3 7,"7.Ng5. Defends the e4-pawn, and puts more pressure on the f7 pawn, getting ready to fork on f7."
14,d5,d6d5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/3pp1N1/2BpP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,"7....d5! This move undoubles Black's pawns, opens the center, attacks the Bishop and the e4-pawn, and opens the a3-f8 diagonal for Black's Dark Bishop."
15,exd5,e4d5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/3Pp1N1/2Bp4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,"9.Bxd5!?. I think that here, the continuation 9.Qf3 f6 10.Qxd5 Qxd5 11.Bxd5 fxg5 12.Bxc6+ bxc6 13.cxd4 exd4 14.Re1+ Be7 15. Bxg5 leaves White ahead, even though material is even."
16,Nxd5,f6d5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n5/3np1N1/2Bp4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 9,"9.Bxd5!?. I think that here, the continuation 9.Qf3 f6 10.Qxd5 Qxd5 11.Bxd5 fxg5 12.Bxc6+ bxc6 13.cxd4 exd4 14.Re1+ Be7 15. Bxg5 leaves White ahead, even though material is even."

18,Qxd5,d8d5,r1b1kb1r/pp3ppp/2n5/3qp1N1/3p4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 10,"When the dust settles, White is down by one, and Black dominates the center. White's only pro in this situation is that he is castled."
19,Re1,f1e1,r1b1kb1r/pp3ppp/2n5/3qp1N1/3p4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq - 1 10,Hitting/pinning the e5-pawn and putting indirect pressure on the King.

23,Nbd2,b1d2,r3kb1r/pp3pp1/2n4p/3qp3/3p2b1/2P2N2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq - 3 12,"12.Nbd3? This should have been done five moves ago. This move is too passive. Even h3 is more useful, stopping Black from castling."
24,Be7,f8e7,r3k2r/pp2bpp1/2n4p/3qp3/3p2b1/2P2N2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQR1K1 w kq - 4 13,"Black is fully developed, almost, and White still has a minor and his Queen on the back rank."
25,h3,h2h3,r3k2r/pp2bpp1/2n4p/3qp3/3p2b1/2P2N1P/PP1N1PP1/R1BQR1K1 b kq - 0 13,13....Bh5. Better than the other options.

28,Qd7,d5d7,r3k2r/pp1qbpp1/2n4p/4p2b/3p4/1QP2N1P/PP1N1PP1/R1B1R1K1 w kq - 3 15,And the final needed defender is removed. e5 will fall.
