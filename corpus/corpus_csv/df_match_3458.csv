1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The Smith-Morra. One of several playable openings against the Sicilian. Though, from experience, I can tell you that it is probably not the best option. The main line leaves white a pawn down for rapid development and center control, which can effectively take down weaker players and players that do not often play the Smith-Morra. Fortunately, I have played several games with this opening; both using it and against it, so I have a knowledge of how to catch up to the opponent before he or she launches a powerful attack."
