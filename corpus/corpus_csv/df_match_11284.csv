1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I'm a king's pawn kind of guy.  It's what I do.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,So is Dave.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,I chose the king's knight this time to pressure e5.  I thought I was conceding d5.  I thought I knew Dave.
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,I don't.
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,The smarter move here would have probably been Nc3.  I usually don't make the smarter move.
6,exd4,e5d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,and Dave gains the advantage.
7,Qxd4,d1d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/3QP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"I tried something different here.  I usually don't overuse my queen, especially so early in the game.  I'm still learning from every game I play though, so I thought this gave me a chance to do a little something different.

....there also may be a few curse words after this.  Nothing major.  Just forewarning you."
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/8/3QP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 1 5,Naturally dave would respond while developing at the same time.
9,Qd5,d4d5,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/3Q4/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 2 5,"I'm just pushin wood around.  I know I'm not in a good spot and this is costing me development of my own pieces, but I'm playing a superior opponent so I have to do things to take him out of his game."
10,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/3Q4/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 3 6,The logical next step for Dave.  He's gaining a real advantage on me at this point.
11,Qb3,d5b3,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/8/4P3/1Q3N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 4 6,I retreat.  It was fun while it lasted.
12,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/2np1n2/8/4P3/1Q3N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 5 7,Dave developing and preparing to castle.
13,Bf4,c1f4,r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/2np1n2/8/4PB2/1Q3N2/PPP2PPP/RN2KB1R b KQkq - 6 7,I start developing some of my own here.
14,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/ppp1bppp/2np1n2/8/4PB2/1Q3N2/PPP2PPP/RN2KB1R w KQ - 7 8,Dave gets castled.  He's out in front.
15,g3,g2g3,r1bq1rk1/ppp1bppp/2np1n2/8/4PB2/1Q3NP1/PPP2P1P/RN2KB1R b KQ - 0 8,Preparing to castle.
16,Nxe4,f6e4,r1bq1rk1/ppp1bppp/2np4/8/4nB2/1Q3NP1/PPP2P1P/RN2KB1R w KQ - 0 9,Dave gets pushy.  He can spot by now that I'm thinking a kingside castle and he's gonna try to muff that up.  He's a hater that way.
17,Bc4,f1c4,r1bq1rk1/ppp1bppp/2np4/8/2B1nB2/1Q3NP1/PPP2P1P/RN2K2R b KQ - 1 9,I go on about my business.  I can't afford to lose anymore ground.
18,Bg4,c8g4,r2q1rk1/ppp1bppp/2np4/8/2B1nBb1/1Q3NP1/PPP2P1P/RN2K2R w KQ - 2 10,"Dave gets even MORE pushy.  Being that I'm still in the learning stages of the game, I can't use knights really well.  My knight is guarded, so this doesn't really scare me."
19,Na3,b1a3,r2q1rk1/ppp1bppp/2np4/8/2B1nBb1/NQ3NP1/PPP2P1P/R3K2R b KQ - 3 10,"Dave is my friend.  He really let me have it for this move.  I don't know that I've ever seen an initial knight move to the a or h file that was annotated as smart.  My thoughts were of planning an attack up the a side at some point, plus guarding my bishop with something other than my queen.  Not wise to guard more 2 pieces with one I'm told."
20,Bxf3,g4f3,r2q1rk1/ppp1bppp/2np4/8/2B1nB2/NQ3bP1/PPP2P1P/R3K2R w KQ - 0 11,"Dave takes the knight.  I'm not sure if he meant to concede the bishop or if my queen had slipped his mind.  We chat while playing, and he questioned why I'd just give up a knight and allow him to pressure my rook.  He does this to play mind games sometimes, so I just played dumb (it wasn't hard to do) and said oops.  So he took my knight.  I considered it a victory to get one of his bishops off the board."
