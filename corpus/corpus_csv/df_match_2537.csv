1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This was a blitz game I played quite recently in which I employed my new opening of choice: the Sicilian Najdorf. I took too much time on the first 15-20 moves so I ran into time pressure pretty early but I managed to secure an advantage and win the game.

12,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,This was an irregular move as f4 followed up by Qf3 is the main line.

14,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/1p2bppp/p2ppn2/6B1/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 8,I can't say I like this move as it is moving the bishop twice but since the bishop would have to move after b5 it is not bad. I prefer Re1.

25,Qf4,e5f4,rn1q1rk1/1b2bppp/p3p3/1p4B1/3N1Qn1/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - - 2 13,"Here I wanted to play f5 and then try to play e5. However, there were two major flaws to my plan. A) after 14....f5 15.Qg3 e5 Nd6 wins the g5 bishop. B) f5 hangs after e5. Although it is relatively early in the game, I was already in time pressure and failed to take into account the latter of these problems. I played Re8 in anticipation of the first issue."

29,Rad1,a1d1,rn1qr1k1/1b3ppp/p3p3/1p4b1/3N2Q1/2NB4/PPP2PPP/3R1RK1 b - - 2 15,I was worried about a discovered attack on my queen and made my first major mistake in the game. I also thought that my bishop on b7 gave me some attacking chances so moving the queen to the kingside seemed logical. White's best move is Ne4 giving me  several problems.

38,Be7,g5e7,r3r1k1/4bppp/p1n1p3/1p6/4N3/3B1P2/PPP2P1P/3R1RK1 w - - 3 20,Making Nf6+ impossible and leaving the possibility of bringing the Bf8 to defend open.
