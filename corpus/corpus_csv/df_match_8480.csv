1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I am endeavoring to improve in chess and therefore, I have decided to annotate some of my losses.  I have been trying to focus more on tactics in my limited study time and avoided studying openings.  I have good self-esteem--feel free to point out my multitude of errors."
2,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I'm going with the Pirc defense.  It seemed simple enough but I'm slowly learning that it is a defense that is somewhat more complicated.
