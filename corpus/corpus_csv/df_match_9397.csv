7,Nc3,b1c3,r2qkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3p4/2PP2b1/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 4 4,"hoping to play 5..Bb4 pinning the white knight and allowing black to take on d5 with his queen if white ever exchanges on d5. However, white may be better if he takes on d5 immediately since after 5. pxp pxp the black knight seems a little awkward on c6. Instead of 4..e6 black should play 4...pxp 5. e3 (protecting the d pawn)  5...e6 6. Bxc4 Bb4 with play similar to the game.  Blacks plan would be to exhange on c3, get the kings knight on d5 and if white exchanges on d5 to recapture witth the queen putting pressure on the pinned knight on f3. The main difference between this line and the actual game is that here whites dark square bishop would probably go on b2 hoping the a1 h8 diagonal will open up."

23,Bxc7,f4c7,r4rk1/ppB2ppp/2n1p3/3q4/3P2b1/2P1PN2/P4PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 12,Black is down a pawn. But is his position really all that bad? Already he has good pressure along the h5 d8 diagonal. After he plays Rc8 he puts pressure on the backward c pawn. Next the c6 knight will get to c4 via a5. All this amounts to clear compensation.
