1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,the Petrov defense is a favorite of several grandmasters and I myself have used it on several occassions. I do not recommend this defense to players because it loses alot of flexibility in favor of a very commital sort of pawn structure and piece development.

5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 3,"This is the classical way of handling the Petrov, I prefer this over playing d4 only because I like to prepare first."
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 4,This is fast approaching a more apprpriate Italian Game position. I don't mind the change.

9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2pp1/3p1n1p/4p3/2B1P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,"this move is in preparation for Be3 (preparing d4 as in my previous note). However, it is a weakness that Black can target, I should have erred on the side of caution."
