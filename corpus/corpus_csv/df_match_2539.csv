4,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Uh,oh I've never seen this before, hope I don't blunder the game too quickly."
5,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/2PP4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,I I felt like capturing his pawn fell too easily into his plans.
6,exd4,e5d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/2Pp4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"So far, nothing special and I don't think there's advantage to either side."

11,Qc2,d1c2,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/1bPP4/2N5/PPQ2PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 4 6,"?! I think this might have been a bit of a mistake, I do this a lot in the queen's gambit because I like to move my rook underneath my queen and also this prevents doubled pawns if he captures my knight. But on the other hand, it is too early for the queen."

13,Bg5,c1g5,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p2B1/1bPP4/2N5/PPQ2PPP/R3KBNR b KQ - 6 7,"! This is a good move as it wins a pawn, at first I thought it was bad as it trades a center pawn for a side pawn that allows my to develop my LSB with the recapture."
