1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

After suffering Henry being buried alive, after a dogged rear-guard draw against Dynamic Dave, I think it is time for you to see Yours Truly go on the attack for a change.  This is my most recent game and it ended with my opponent's king getting trapped in the centre and then subsequently copping Old Matey.  So how did this happen?  Well, after my standard 1. e4, JJ plays a favourite defense of the Master Mater.  He really does lurve playing 1. ..... Nf6 in response to e4.  It is a very good defense, even though black's knight does get chased about a bit - don't knock it!"
