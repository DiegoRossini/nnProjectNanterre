Black has many options to win, and I examined two of them: 17...Bd6 and 17...Nd5. (I also looked at 17...Qd5 until realzing White's queen guards that square--so I guess in that case, taking my time did work out!) I rejected Bd6 due to 18.Qxg6 and did not play Nd5 because of 18.Bf4.

Let's take on 17...Nd5 first because it's easier to explain. I had been well aware of the f-file pin well before this move, but for some reason I completely overlooked it in the 17...Nd5 variation. It's just fine for Black to play 18...Nxf4 19.Qxf4 Rhf8. (The choice between Rdf8 and Rhf8 in these variations is a whole other question, beyond the scope of this annotation.) Instead, I thought that by attacking my queen, White would have left me with no time to enact the pin I was looking for. 

After 17...Bd6, meanwhile, 18.Qxg6 is indeed White's best response by guarding the knight on g3. However, White's king is still stalemated, so there's no time to get out of the discovered check after Rhf8 except giving up a piece by 19.Nf5 Ne4 20.Qg4 Rxf5+. (19...Ne4 threatens 20...Rxf5+ 21.Qxf5+ Qxf5+ 22.Ke3 Bc5# and if 20.Kg4 to break the pin there is a mate in 2.)

Now, it looks silly to claim I might have thought too much when those decisions are made on just a one-ply response. However, what I mean is, if I had only looked for 30 minutes, I would certainly have played 17...Bd6 or maybe 17...Nd5. Instead, I thought to the point where I found ""refutations"" to those moves that actually failed. Perhaps I needed to think about how I could reply to those ""refutations,"" and that's where extra thought should have come in. But spending hours seems like enough time. I suppose it's as important *what* you're looking at as how long you look."

The point of 17...Nxh5 was to simultaneously threaten g3, increase control over f4, and immediately prepare for the f-file pin. (I'm just now realizing the pin isn't that important anyway. If the queen flees to b3, Black must still have a withering attack on the White king, right?) Anyway, White's 20th move suddenly became painfully obvious."

The plan to get there was somewhat convoluted: 21. Kf2 Qc5+ 22. Kf3 g5 23. hxg5 Qxg5. It doesn't work due to 22. Be3  Rxf4+ 23. Bf3, breaking the pin and thus enabling the latent bishop fork. No matter what I did now, in fact, I would end up in a queen-for-two-rooks situation with best play from White. Stockfish actually likes Black in the conditions of this ending, though. I assume it's do to the queen's ability to pick off a couple pawns before White's uncoordinated rooks, still on their initial squares, could get their act together."
