1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi all; just going to do a quick runthrough of this game. As it is the mirror game to 'Activity vs. Aggression' from the same tournament, I'll focus on the same themes, as they apply to a very different game. The basics: Activity is the ability to which a player can move and threaten different squares. Aggression is the actual production of threats which the opponent must answer. Generally speaking, the player with more activity gets to make the threats."

The thought is to eventually bring the Knight back to c7 where it's not in the way as much as it could be on d7, or possibly advance to b4--a maneuver not usually possible in this opening because of the pawn on c6. Standard play is 3...Bf5, and honestly the biggest appeal of this move is probably that it gets off-book quickly."

7,Bxa6,f1a6,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/B1p5/3pP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 4,"?! This Bishop is normally quite strong in this opening, so exchanging it for a marginalized Knight right away is suspect. This is an immediate example of the game title: White trades his potential midgame activity (from the Bishop) for simple aggression. He perhaps feels that Black's broken queenside will make up for the loss of his Bishop-pair, but Black doesn't actually have to retake with the pawn..."

White has a slight edge in development, though he lacks his good Bishop and I'm not sure if e3 is the best place for the Queen's Bishop, but White presumably wants to leave d2 open for the Queen herself. Black retains his good Bishop, but it has few prospects as its natural spot on d6 is unavailable. Black's kingside looks difficult to develop in any case, and his Queen is somewhat trapped on the queenside all alone--not in any particular danger, but Black must beware of any nets being woven around her. With his development and space advantages, as well as the initiative, I'd give White a very slight edge here."

Black prepares the same maneuver again, with a twist--rather than play ...f6 and open the center with his King still vulnerable, he holds g4 against the WQ (after Ng3 Bg5), and also threatens to play ...Ng4 and ...h5 with a decent attack against the White King (especially after ...O-O-O).

I don't think this is the best choice. e3 wasn't a great square for the Bishop, the worst Black does after ...Ng4 is force White to relocate the Bishop to a better spot. I think 9.Ng3 Bg6 10.Bg5 was better, as the text gives up--once more--a decent White piece for a passive Black one, for the sake of playing for aggression rather than activity. It is worth noting, however, that White has the Knights against Black's Bishops in a solidly-closed center, so White should still have an advantage there unless Black can open the position."

Consider the position as a whole: Black has the bishop-pair and an extra pawn, but the position is closed and the BQ is stuck on the queenside. Clearly queenside aggression will be difficult to manage in this situation, with only Knights to work with, and those on the kingside--so work with what's already looking strong. White has a good Rook on f1, which will be lifted by force to an extremely strong outpost on f5 after (say) 16.f5! exf5 17.a3 Be7 18.Nxf5 Bxf5 19.Rxf5. This sets White up to double on the half-open f-file in front of an isolated Black pawn--a good recipe for success. It also brings the action to the kingside, where all the White pieces already are, and gives the Ne2 a place to go (namely f4 or g3)."

It's also worth noting that White can essentially force Black to give up his bishop-pair, which is certainly a tempting proposition if the center ever opens up (and it will somewhat after f4-f5)."

I just went over the reasons why a direct queenside attack is not going to work: namely that Black has pieces stuck over there, and White has pieces that can't get there. White should be maximizing the advantages he has, not trying to find some where there aren't any! On the other hand, Black has been playing consistently with a clear goal--he will push f7-f6 and release himself from his cramped position."
