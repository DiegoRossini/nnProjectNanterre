While White does not play entirely accurately in the opening, he makes no important mistakes and gradually transforms his natural positional advantage into a deadly passed pawn to score the full point. Black, meanwhile, makes no obvious mistakes in surrendering the full point! White's play lends a powerful impression."

Before moving on, I should note that even the non-Taimanov ""Modern Main Line"" (White's second-best shot against the Benoni) is extremely formidable.

7,d5,d4d5,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2pP4/2P5/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"Here is a basic Modern Benoni formation. Black will develop his ""bad"" bishop onto g7, where is exerts tremendous pressure on White's queenside. Then, Black often continues with queenside expansion via ..a6 and ..b5, with tactical play along the dark squares. Sometimes Black offers the pawn sacrifice ..b5 to open queenside lines (specifically pressuring b2) and sometimes divert the Nc3 from defense of e4 (allowing ..Nxe4). Black's main problem is space - White has most of it! The cramped nature of Black's position makes it somewhat difficult for him to develop his queenside minor pieces, especially the c8 ""problem"" bishop (d7 is best reserved for a knight, and b7 often interferes with a rook on b8). For this reason, Black often hopes for an early ..Bg4, pinning the Nf3 to the queen (and preventing the powerful White maneuver Nf3-d2-c4, a key theme as a knight on c4 places tremendous pressure on Black's d6 pawn. Indeed, so powerful is this plan that White plays an early h3 in many lines just to stop it!). White's plan is simple - use his massive space advantage to place his pieces on ""ideal"" squares and enforce the advance e4-e5, which often initiates kingside attacking possibilities. Black invariably meets this threat with tactics (really the only reason the Benoni is still playable), which make for a very exciting and double-edged game. A quick aside: a move deserving attention is 6..a6!?, which prevents White's 8th move and thereby dodges the Flick-Knife attack. In light of White's healthy plus in the Flick-Knife, this quirky move is probably worth further investigation. It would be an easy choice if not for White's speedy plan of 7.f4 g6? 8.e5! and White is crashing through.

The idea behind ..c3 was to attack with the doomed pawn and extract further benefits (e.g. ripping open the b or c file and activating the g7 bishop). It transpires that Black's compensation for this tempo is not complete if White continues accurately. Black is better off playing with pieces via ..Ne3 (gaining the dark-squared bishop) or the tricky ..Nde5, forcing White to expend time to pick up the c4 pawn (and thereby place a piece on an undesirable square). The issue of how to return ""dead"" material (e.g. something you cannot hold forever) is highly complex and situation-oriented. [If interested in this subject, I recommend studying the Benko gambit, which arises from a Benoni structure where White has 3 playable alternatives - 1) accept the gambit, 2) ignore the gambit, and 3) expend an extra tempo sacrificing the doomed pawn, hoping to push White's pieces offside.]
