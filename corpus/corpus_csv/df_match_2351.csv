6,c5,c6c5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2ppP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,I found this idea in the DB and it seems to be a funny line to follow.
7,dxc5,d4c5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2PpP3/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"Now, black is one pawn late."
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/2PpP3/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,The other option for white is 5. Bb5
9,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/2PpP3/8/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,The other option for white is 5. Bb5
10,Bg4,c8g4,r2qkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/2PpP3/6b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 3 6,"5. ... Qa5+ was also playable but white can play 6.Nc3 which gives the knight a good place and doesn't lose a tempo. Then, the black queen can easily be fired by 6. b4. 5. ... e6 is playable as well but I thought that my LSB would be blocked and I didn't like this idea."

Since white will probably castle short, the e pawn will be hard to defend, except by playing f4, which will weaken the white queen."

If we trade black's 2 bishops against white's 2 knights, which I cannot prevent, black's counterattacking possibiities will be considerably weakened but white will find it difficult to attack my fiancheto without DSB, so that I might obtain a draw even considering white's pawn advance."

White is ahead in material (one pawn), both Kings are safe, there is no immediate threat and no open line. Black's pawn structure is better. White can improve his but he will have to weaken his king. White has still the initiative. With this pawn disposition, a bishop is better than a knight. The situation seems equilibrated."

Anyway, black cannot prevent f6. Now I see 2 possible plans for black : whether defend on the left wing (playing Rfb8 or a6), or attack on the center, attacking the e pawn by f6 or with a previous Qc7. I hesitate a bit. Anyway, this game is already a good point for me, because it's the first time that I can envisage an attacking strategy with black, against a master, with a reasonable chance of success."
