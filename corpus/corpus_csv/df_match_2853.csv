Up to this point everyone had played 4.f4 which is fine for Black.  See for example:  http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/the-philidor-getting-my-feet-wet-internet?gm=45300

The two most popular plans for Black are: (1)  aiming for Queenside expansion by means of ...b5, or (2) securing c5 for his knight.
