1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is another practice game, in which I play the dubious Latvian Gambit and take some risks to open up an attack against a disorganized White position. The theme of this game is piece coordination and planning--Black has a very clear plan throughout the game, whereas White does not, and the differences in the solidity of their resulting midgame positions are substantial as a result. Enjoy!"
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"?! The Latvian. As soon as Black makes this move, he knows his general game plan: (A) break up the White center, then (B) create activity in the center and on the kingside. This move in particular also shows that Black is willing to sacrifice material for that activity."

5,d3,d2d3,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"For all the reasons I don't think White should decline the Gambit in such a passive way like this, see my Latvian Gambit series. 3.Nxe5, 3.Bc4, 3.exf5 or 3.d4 are all stronger for White, but this move crops up quite often, especially if White doesn't know the opening well. The problem is that it is simply too passive, and lets Black get virtually everything he wants--space and time. We know Black's game plan--what is White's? This move suggests he wants to play a more positional game, keeping some tension in the center rather than tearing into a kingside attack."
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/2n5/4pp2/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,"This is essentially a waiting move, with the benefit of holding onto e5 without blocking in the DSB by playing ...d6. If possible, Black wants to play d7-d5 at once, in keeping with his plan to create space and play energetically in the center."
7,c3,c2c3,r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/2n5/4pp2/4P3/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"This move seems to prepare White to play d3-d4, but why? 3.d4 was absolutely playable (last turn), and this move denies White the natural spot for his Queen's Knight, after already committing to the d2-d3 move. Already White's moves feel like they lack cohesion."
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp2pp/2n2n2/4pp2/4P3/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"I don't like this move very much--Black can easily play 5...h6, and either drive the Bishop back to e3 with a gain of tempo, exchange White's good Bishop for a Knight, or win a piece for two pawns if 6.Bh4? White's e4 pawn was threatened, but a better way to deal with it would have been 5.exf5."

Nxd5 10.Nxe5 and allows White to improve his LSB's outlook by enabling d3-d4 soon, but Black needs to get his own LSB into play, and remember, he is willing to sacrifice material for activity.

White's pieces, on the other hand, have little in common except that they seem awfully cramped, and don't threaten much of anything. In other words, Black's pieces are coordinated and active, while White's are disorderly and passive. Black's midgame plans are clear--what are White's goals?"
