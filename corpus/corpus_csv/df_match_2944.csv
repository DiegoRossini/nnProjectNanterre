4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3P1B2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Traps his own bishop. Not necesarily bad, but it does allow me to manouver on the kingside. In my scheme, I already know that 85% of the games will be under the flag ""white attacks the kingside"". This move kind of favour me. I can tell these things so early in the game by experience - hundreds of games. Normally, it is too soon to make these assumptions."
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3P1B2/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"Now, this is the move that disrupts my plans. Normally, people plays it later, ""once the N is in f6 (the fisrt key) and my pawn is on d3 (second key)"". So I can go Ne5, and it cannot be kicked by f6 very quickly. And Nh5 cannot be played because the Q is aiming at it. But now, I know that after Ne5, f6, then I cannot go Qh5 (because I didn't play d3 yet), so I must retire in d3, and after BxB, NxB, my knight is displaced, and black will have an edge. By experience. So I decided to try something more."
6,Bd6,f8d6,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3bp3/3p4/3P1B2/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,"Now, this is the move that disrupts my plans.

7,Qc1,d1c1,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3bp3/3p4/3P1B2/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNQ1KB1R b KQkq - 3 4,Ugly. But it's a blitz. Let's see what happens.
8,Bxf4,d6f4,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3P1b2/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNQ1KB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Ok, now the story is different. I have a queen and a knight on the kingside. I have to prove that these two pieces are deadly, to force black to find a better move than BxB (probably a better move)."
9,Qxf4,c1f4,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3P1Q2/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN2KB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"Ok, now the story is different. I have a queen and a knight on the kingside. I have to prove that these two pieces are deadly, to force black to find a better move than BxB (probably a better move)."
10,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3P1Q2/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN2KB1R w KQkq - 1 6,"I expected g5, kicking the queen, but black is too wise and he knows that it will be difficult for him to castle queenside, so he has to guard his kinside castling."
11,Qg5,f4g5,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p2Q1/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN2KB1R b KQkq - 2 6,"So let's threat it. This is a kind of ""unnatural"" move (the natural one would have been a developement move, like d3, or Nd2/Nc3). So before you try it in an actual game, think more than twice."
12,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p2Q1/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN2KB1R w KQ - 3 7,"Black castles just in front of my queen. But my pieces are still undeveloped, and my knight in e5 does nothing for the attack. I better spend my move wisely."
13,Nbd2,b1d2,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p2Q1/3P4/5N2/PPPNPPPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 4 7,"Better than d3 because I don't want to allow black to threat a Queen's trap. If you are experienced, you will already have smelled the danger of having the queen out of squares. But it was too late."
14,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bq1rk1/pppn1ppp/4pn2/3p2Q1/3P4/5N2/PPPNPPPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 5 8,"Better than Nc6, normally, because now black can go c5 - always the move he has to  go after, in this opening - but now black could have gone for the queen trap and play Nc6 threatening something starting with h6 and ending with e5, with the white bishop threatening the white queen once retired on a white square."
15,e3,e2e3,r1bq1rk1/pppn1ppp/4pn2/3p2Q1/3P4/4PN2/PPPN1PPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 0 8,"Well, since black doesn't seem to play for it, let's use the tempo for my very necessary developement. Note tha, in doing that, I am closing another possible square for my qeen: I am basically trapping it myself. Be aware..."
16,c5,c7c5,r1bq1rk1/pp1n1ppp/4pn2/2pp2Q1/3P4/4PN2/PPPN1PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 0 9,Black doesn't seek my queen. Good.
17,c3,c2c3,r1bq1rk1/pp1n1ppp/4pn2/2pp2Q1/3P4/2P1PN2/PP1N1PPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 0 9,"Let's pretend my queen isn't trapped, and go on for a while. But this was a mistake. I won't take the pawn because after the N retakes, is in a very good position. Then black will be able to play c4, preventing the bishop on f1 from the diagonal aiming at the black king. So, I SHOULD have moved Bd3, even if black would have gone cxd4. (So what? I would have retaken with d3xd4, and my queen would have been almost free, so...) But if the bishop is in d3, after c4 it goes to c2, and from there he aims at the enemy's king, helping the queen to attack. So why to waste time with this useless c3?"
18,c4,c5c4,r1bq1rk1/pp1n1ppp/4pn2/3p2Q1/2pP4/2P1PN2/PP1N1PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 0 10,"Deserved. Now my lsb cannot enter into the fry. It must go to e2, doing nothing, and from there wait for the knight to jump to act as g4 and h5's guardian - nothing more."
19,h4,h2h4,r1bq1rk1/pp1n1ppp/4pn2/3p2Q1/2pP3P/2P1PN2/PP1N1PP1/R3KB1R b KQ - 0 10,"So I, desperately, tried another way to attack: by force. Wiht the help of my h1 rook (h3-g3). Rude and inelegant, and probably my queen will be trapped in the process, but I have nothing funnier to to. Qg3 - Qd6 could have been an escape for my queen, exchanging it... but is this ""fun""? :-)"
20,Ne4,f6e4,r1bq1rk1/pp1n1ppp/4p3/3p2Q1/2pPn2P/2P1PN2/PP1N1PP1/R3KB1R w KQ - 1 11,"I can exchange the knigt, here, after which a lot of exchanged can be possible, and, again... it is not fun!"
21,Qg4,g5g4,r1bq1rk1/pp1n1ppp/4p3/3p4/2pPn1QP/2P1PN2/PP1N1PP1/R3KB1R b KQ - 2 11,"Let's see what's happens. White takes advange of the blocked black's lsb to find a place. It is very bad, since after Nd7-f6,u Q must move again and black has plenty of pieces around his king."
22,Nxd2,e4d2,r1bq1rk1/pp1n1ppp/4p3/3p4/2pP2QP/2P1PN2/PP1n1PP1/R3KB1R w KQ - 0 12,But black helps me a little.
23,Kxd2,e1d2,r1bq1rk1/pp1n1ppp/4p3/3p4/2pP2QP/2P1PN2/PP1K1PP1/R4B1R b - - 0 12,"...not with the knight, because I want to keep the pieces as active as possible. No problem for my king to stay in the middle of the board. Black can attack with Qb6, and I wil defend with Kc3. Not unbareable, but more dangerous if you think about black playing e5, and then opening the way to his lsb to occupy f5."
24,f5,f7f5,r1bq1rk1/pp1n2pp/4p3/3p1p2/2pP2QP/2P1PN2/PP1K1PP1/R4B1R w - - 0 13,"Trap the queen's mission starts, at last. I think in the wrong way, let's see."
