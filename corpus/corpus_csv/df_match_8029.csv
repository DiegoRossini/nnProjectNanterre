2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,The response is D5 pawn I love when opponents play the pawn right back. This move will result in an action packed game.(offensive)

6,Nd7,b8d7,r1bqkbnr/pp1npppp/2p5/3p4/3P1B2/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,Playing the knight in the backfield results in more of a defensive game. Trying to close gaps through-out the game

9,e4,e2e4,r1bqkbnr/pp1nppp1/2p4p/3p4/3PPB2/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,The big pawn push I wanted to open the game and this is what I do. Hopefully she takes and I can plant my knight right in the middle of the board. Just remember the pawn on D5 is attacked and if she doesn't protect it I can capture it for free.
