1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I adore Alekhine's defense - this may be because it is an opening one is told repeatedly not to play, and its naysayers have a ver serious point. Unlike others of my pet openings (specifically Reti and the Dutch) - which are unpopular but still played at the grandmaster level - this one is specifically considered sub-standard, and many theoretical articles on the subject will say that Nf6 is not a serious reply to 1.e4. 

Nonetheless, I have found that it is, in fact, quite playable *if* you play it often and prepare well. The biggest problem with Alekhine's, in my opinion, is not the tempo loss from 2.e5 Nd5 but the sheer instability of the structure. Simply stated, you have to memorize variations - a lot of variations - because so many moves are playable for white and several of them lead to fundamentally different structures with a TON of tactical traps that either player can fall in to. The plus side to this memorization chore is that Alekhine is rare at all levels of play, and if you prepare, you will reach very sharp, very tactical positions which you know and your opponent does not - the result is that your opponent is busy calculating while you're still playing on book. 

This particular game is one I played against someone who usually plays more precisely than I do on the whole - he is consistently 100+ points higher rated, and a dedicated e4 player. The first time I used Alekhine's defense against him, he played 2.d3 and went on to win after squeezing out a middle game advantage (and I played a howling blunder at the end...oops). After that loss, I developed a refined system for 2.d3, and this game is, I think, a beautiful example of that preparation coming to fruition."

This variation is much better for black, I think - d3 cuts off the light square bishop whose job it is to hold up the squares weakened in the initial pawn advance. Nc3 is OK if you want to avoid some of the theory (though, on gameknot, the 'main line' of Alekhine - e4 Nf3, e5 Nd5, c5 Nb6, d4 d6, Nf3 Nc6 - is hardly ever played, so I have lines memorized for d3, f3, and Nc3 that I actually know *better* than what grandmasters consider the main line). In general, I think this move is typically played out of confusion - the opponent wants an e4 e5 position, so (s)he wastes a tempo pushing a pawn in order to encourage me to play e5 and transpose......however, I will never oblige - this is Sparta!!!"

My pawns will be doubled - this is true (and *never* resolved in this game), but one of the concessions made in the 2. d3 variation is that black will usually be able to get her hands on the d4 square and use it to stage an attack. If you're keeping score, the pawns have advanced (leaving weak squares behind them), the f1 bishop is controlling a pitiful ONE square, and the c1 bishop has been traded for a knight whose main job is to play decoy dummy. Once the dark square bishop is removed, I have two pieces pointing at that lovely d4 square - no pawns can protect it, and Nf3 is the only move that even pretends to keep it under control.

This is going to be a difficult game for white...."

This attack serves no purpose as the tempo gain of forcing me to move the queen is totally offset by her ability to exploit the dark squares - she's only too happy to move deeper in to white's territory! The e4 square is great for knight if you can keep it there, but I also have an unused f pawn itching to jab from f5.
