1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"White plays the Reti Opening, which is not an opening I usually see."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,"I respond with d5. My usual response to most opening moves back at that time was e5, but with the knight positioned where it is, that would of lost me a pawn, so d5 was my preferred alternative. This as well continued the Reti Opening."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,The Reti continues.
4,dxc4,d5c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2p5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"This is called the Reti Accepted. Generally if I see an opportunity gain a free pawn, I take it."
5,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2p5/4PN2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"Obviously white likes the Reti, as he continues with the Reti Accepted."
6,b5,b7b5,rnbqkbnr/p1p1pppp/8/1p6/2p5/4PN2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"I knew hardly anything about other opening moves, so I end the Reti with b5. This is viewed by the computer analysis as an inaccuracy. True, for if white plays a4 the next move, black can defend but white gains a slight advantage."
7,b3,b2b3,rnbqkbnr/p1p1pppp/8/1p6/2p5/1P2PN2/P2P1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"White does not play a4, which of course is an inaccuracy by the computer analysis."
8,cxb3,c4b3,rnbqkbnr/p1p1pppp/8/1p6/8/1p2PN2/P2P1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,I figure it is best to take.
9,Bxb5+,f1b5,rnbqkbnr/p1p1pppp/8/1B6/8/1p2PN2/P2P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"Well I did not see that coming, but this is easy to counter."
10,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/p3pppp/2p5/1B6/8/1p2PN2/P2P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"This is a good move, for now white must save their bishop instead of attack the b3 pawn, so black can still have a small material advantage."
11,Bc4,b5c4,rnbqkbnr/p3pppp/2p5/8/2B5/1p2PN2/P2P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"I take as I hoped, but of course that pawn is lost."
12,bxa2,b3a2,rnbqkbnr/p3pppp/2p5/8/2B5/4PN2/p2P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"I take as I hoped, but of course that pawn is lost."
13,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/p3pppp/2p5/8/2B5/2N1PN2/p2P1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,"? I was a bit puzzled by this move. White could of easily played Bxa2 or Rxa2, but instead chose to save their knight. True the pawn is still lost and although the computer analysis says nothing about this, in my view, they might as well got it over with now."
14,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/p4ppp/2p1p3/8/2B5/2N1PN2/p2P1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,Now white plays Rxa2. It's pretty obvious that white will castle king-side.
15,Rxa2,a1a2,rnbqkbnr/p4ppp/2p1p3/8/2B5/2N1PN2/R2P1PPP/2BQK2R b Kkq - 0 8,Now white plays Rxa2. It's pretty obvious that white will castle king-side.
16,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/p4ppp/2p1pn2/8/2B5/2N1PN2/R2P1PPP/2BQK2R w Kkq - 1 9,"Yep, I was correct, a king-side castle."
17,O-O,e1g1,rnbqkb1r/p4ppp/2p1pn2/8/2B5/2N1PN2/R2P1PPP/2BQ1RK1 b kq - 2 9,"Yep, I was correct, a king-side castle."
18,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk2r/p4ppp/2p1pn2/8/1bB5/2N1PN2/R2P1PPP/2BQ1RK1 w kq - 3 10,I hope to trade the knight and bishop.
19,Qb3,d1b3,rnbqk2r/p4ppp/2p1pn2/8/1bB5/1QN1PN2/R2P1PPP/2B2RK1 b kq - 4 10,"I take the knight as I planned, and of course white will take the bishop, but the computer analysis views this as a inaccuracy. I can not really see the reason why, but since it's only an inaccuracy, it would not give black a bad disadvantage. The best move was a5. True, for then both the pawn and the bishop would of protected each other, and white would not attack with one of their powerful pieces."
20,Bxc3,b4c3,rnbqk2r/p4ppp/2p1pn2/8/2B5/1Qb1PN2/R2P1PPP/2B2RK1 w kq - 0 11,"I take the knight as I planned, and of course white will take the bishop, but the computer analysis views this as a inaccuracy. I can not really see the reason why, but since it's only an inaccuracy, it would not give black a bad disadvantage. The best move was a5. True, for then both the pawn and the bishop would of protected each other, and white would not attack with one of their powerful pieces."
21,Qxc3,b3c3,rnbqk2r/p4ppp/2p1pn2/8/2B5/2Q1PN2/R2P1PPP/2B2RK1 b kq - 0 11,That was the expected move.
22,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/p4ppp/2p1pn2/8/2B5/2Q1PN2/R2P1PPP/2B2RK1 w - - 1 12,"I now castle. Get ready though, this game is about to become blunderful!"
23,Ng5,f3g5,rnbq1rk1/p4ppp/2p1pn2/6N1/2B5/2Q1P3/R2P1PPP/2B2RK1 b - - 2 12,"This would be the first of many mistakes and blunders. Ng5 was viewed as a mistake by the computer analysis. This is so because if this sequence followed: 12. ... Nd5 13. Bxd5 cxd5 14. Nf3 ... Black would gain a advantage ever so slightly, not in material, but in position, but not much. The best move for white here was Qa5, an attack on black's queen that likely would of ended up being a queens exchange."
24,h6,h7h6,rnbq1rk1/p4pp1/2p1pn1p/6N1/2B5/2Q1P3/R2P1PPP/2B2RK1 w - - 0 13,"Black would not play Nd5 but instead h6 to drive away the knight. This is viewed by the computer analysis as an inaccuracy. Although as stated earlier, Nd5 was the best move, this move doesn't really give black a disadvantage, but it doesn't give black an advantage either, for white will of course protect their knight."
