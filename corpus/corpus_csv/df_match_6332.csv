1,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

About a month ago, antagonistknight and I played this unrated game.  He started off with 1. f4 which was The Bird's Opening and I got the mischevious idea about me playing the black side of another of Freddy's Annotation's Project.  I lost this game but maybe some lessons can be learned from this and hopefully it will be a worthy contribution to the Project.  We will therefore pick up the action on Move 9.  Before I start this, here is the gameknot analysis version of the game which will help you follow the game up to move 9.  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=14011633&fb=1&rnd=0.054344796625981295"
