1,d3,d2d3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/3P4/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"So, my opponent opens with d3."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/3P4/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"My response is e5, which I often use. !Very! often :D"
3,Na3,b1a3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/N2P4/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"Bareq plays Na3, which seemed me a bit strange, because if I had taken his knight with my bishop, he would have doubled pawns on the edge of the board."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/8/N2P4/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,"But I didn't take it, I played Nf6 instead. I chose this option because I don't like closed games, so bishops can be useful later."
5,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/8/N2PP3/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,e3 followed. It didn't seem that my opponent wanted to use his bishops.
6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3pp3/8/N2PP3/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"But I wanted, so I opened the way of my LSB, and also set a pawn into the centre."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3pp3/8/N2PPN2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"Bareq plays Nf3, atacking my e5 pawn."
8,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3pp3/6b1/N2PPN2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,"I didn't allow to capture it, I pinned it to his  queen."
9,h3,h2h3,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3pp3/6b1/N2PPN1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"But now if I don't want to lose a pawn, I have to take his knight."
10,Bxf3,g4f3,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3pp3/8/N2PPb1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Ok, done."

12,c6,c7c6,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p2n2/3pp3/8/N2PPQ1P/PPP2PP1/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"Then I played c6, and my future plant was to bring my knight from b8 to d7. And look at the white piece on a3. It cannot go to the centre. I think my opponent's next move was to move it closer to the center, so"
13,c3,c2c3,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p2n2/3pp3/8/N1PPPQ1P/PP3PP1/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"he played c3 attacking d4, and also freeing some place for his knight (the c2 square) to go, and later to approach the centre."
14,Bd6,f8d6,rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/2pb1n2/3pp3/8/N1PPPQ1P/PP3PP1/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 1 8,A simple developing move defending my e5 pawn and preparing a short castling.

16,O-O,e8g8,rn1q1rk1/pp3ppp/2pb1n2/3pp3/8/2PPPQ1P/PPN2PP1/R1B1KB1R w KQ - 3 9,"My king is on a safe square, and I think I am OK with developing."
