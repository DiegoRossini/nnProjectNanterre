I note Black's dcb is currently tipsy (I term the ""bad"" bishop as tipsy and the ""good"" bishop as sober to avoid the prejudicial terms bad and good), nor do I wish to park my dcb on the eventual g3 square. I have possible plans for kingside development, particularly should I decide to castle long. Therefore I avoid the R-Llike (but on the kingside) 8. Bh4 g5 9.Bg3."

16,Ne7,g8e7,r2qkb1r/pppbn1pp/3p1p2/3Pp3/4P3/4BN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 2 9,"Not quite sure where Black is going with that, they appear to be cramping their own position. Perhaps setting up for Ng6, White could really put dampeners on that plan with 9h4. I did say I was contemplating kingside development and could get off to a flyer with the double pawn movement. Still, sometimes a poor move by an opponent can draw out a poor move on one's own behalf. Looking at this board, with all that Qside space, c4 and the beginnings of a Qside roll seems a much better double pawn movement than h4. Indeed, if coupled with h3, suddenly Black's sober bishop finds it has no place to go."

Besides, Black may miss 11...f4 and elect to exchange pawns. If not, then it will simply be a case of who uses their pawn chains to greater effect, and ol Tips is not shy of a tactical pawn-off! :)"

29,Qg4,f3g4,r2qkb1r/ppp3pp/3p4/3Pp3/2P1PpQn/1PN5/P2B1PPP/R4RK1 b kq - 2 15,"That, to me, looks like a bonafide mistake leading to loss of knight. By blocking off the escape square, as soon as a pawn is posted on g3, that Black knight has nowhere to go. All that remains is to evaluate whether 16. g3 or 16. Qe6+ followed, eventually, by g3, is the better move."

Qe6+??? was TERRIBLE! 16.Qe6+?? Be7 17.g3??	Nf3+! and White has gone from ahead to firmly behind! With that issue resolved, White posts its pawn on g3 and seals the knight's fate. Black will gain compensation in terms of 1 pawn and White's fortress being opened up. But the positional gain would have to be +2 for Black to break even and I don't rate it as that. Indeed the opening of the kingside will probably actually favour White in the end, with perhaps that f rook set to become devastating, perhaps even doubling up on the f file, whilst White's pawn chain prevents Black from any counterplay on the qside. Overall, it continues to amaze me how asking questions of an opponent, and increasing the pressure, can have such pronounced consequences in correspondence chess! When you've 7 days/move, surely all pressure is an illusion, all questions asked can be answered competently? Yet time and time again, after solid development, as soon as I build a little threat or two, an opponent buckles. I think I need more games against higher opponents."

From a +2 situation, Black has gone to at least a full officer down in material, if I reply with the straightforward 18.Qxh4. That is my minimum gain. Now all that remains is rudimentary tactical analysis to see if the maxima and minima are the same, or if there isn't an even better line for White. 18.
