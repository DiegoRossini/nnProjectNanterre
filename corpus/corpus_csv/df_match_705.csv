11,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"He plays the Richterâ€“Rauzer Attack, probably the strongest continuation, and at the moment the most popular."

18,Rc8,a8c8,2rqkb1r/1p1b1ppp/p1nppn2/6B1/3NP3/2N2P2/PPPQ2PP/2KR1B1R w k - 1 10,I continue with my queen-side operations.

Presumably the idea is throwing the queen over to the king-side to support a pawn advance there. I don't think it turns out particularly well for white."

He can't take back with the rook, so he has to take with the pawn and then my weakness on d6 is shielded by his pawn on d5. They is also the chance of an attack on a2. I'm quite happy with this position for black."
