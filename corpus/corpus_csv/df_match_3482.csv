1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,The title of this annotation is because this is probably one of my best displays of technique where from a position that doesn't appear to be more than slightly better for white gradually almost imperceptibly turns decisive. Of course this is largely due to taking advantage of blacks mistakes but never the less I made no major error in converting the point.

White chooses to develop the knight here as opposed to its 'classical' square so that d4 can be thoroughly reinforced by c3 and potentially Ndf3 and Nge2, and of course if black plays ...c5 immediately then the idea is to straddle black with an isolated queens pawn then play against that"

6,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2pp4/3PP3/8/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,This is adopted so that black is not left with an isolated d pawn which gives white a clear target and plan. Of course this move has the disadvantages that white will gain a bit of time attacking the black queen and the black pawn on e6 will mean that black will have to develop the LSB via ...b6 and Ba6/b7

9,Ngf3,g1f3,rnb1kbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2pq4/3P4/5N2/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"!? A relatively new move that appeared not all that long ago in New in chess with some analysis. The point is that this allows for the DSB to develop freely and neither the black knight or the black LSB will need to make use of d7 so the queen is not blocking anything from this square. Though if I were in blacks position I think I would prefer to place the queen back on her home square since it seems, to me at least that the dark squares will be of more consequence"

Black starts creeping his king closer to the centre of the board however the queens are still on the board and as such this is not yet an endgame. This could lose a pawn to 23.Bxf6 followed by Bxh7 however I decide to go down a different path. But then it is hard to suggest an alternative plan for black, clearly black should try to exchange one of whites bishops, but there are no obvious ways to do that further more blacks minor pieces can't seem to find any useful roles since the f3 pawn both blunts blacks bishop and takes away squares from the knight"
