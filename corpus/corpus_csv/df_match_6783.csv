1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Common opening
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I often follow that same opening also
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,he moves his knight...
4,b6,b7b6,rnbqkbnr/p1pp1ppp/1p6/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,and I follow with a stupid (soon to be proven) move
5,Nxe5,f3e5,rnbqkbnr/p1pp1ppp/1p6/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,what I expected...
6,f6,f7f6,rnbqkbnr/p1pp2pp/1p3p2/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"just about the only good thing that the pawns can be used for, except for resurrecting captured pieces"
7,Nf3,e5f3,rnbqkbnr/p1pp2pp/1p3p2/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,he moves back...
8,Nh6,g8h6,rnbqkb1r/p1pp2pp/1p3p1n/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,"also move my knight... could have chosen better moves, but felt the need to get the knight out of hiding"
9,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkb1r/p1pp2pp/1p3p1n/8/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 5,no idea why he moved his bishop there...
10,c6,c7c6,rnbqkb1r/p2p2pp/1pp2p1n/8/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,another hopeless move by me
11,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/p2p2pp/1pp2p1n/8/2BPP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"this move exposed my knight, though the g7 pawn is defending it"
12,Ba6,c8a6,rn1qkb1r/p2p2pp/bpp2p1n/8/2BPP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 7,I insist on swapping bishops... a little fight that in the end I win... you'll see
13,Bxa6,c4a6,rn1qkb1r/p2p2pp/Bpp2p1n/8/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,"the predicted move, and......"
14,Nxa6,b8a6,r2qkb1r/p2p2pp/npp2p1n/8/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"I win the 'quarrel...'. I often think whether or not I should get myself into that 'argument,' as bishops are worth more than knights, but how else do I get one of his good pieces near the beginning of the game?"
15,Nc3,b1c3,r2qkb1r/p2p2pp/npp2p1n/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 8,a response with a knight...
16,f5,f6f5,r2qkb1r/p2p2pp/npp4n/5p2/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,"completely hopeless, superfluous move... of course, made by me..."
17,e5,e4e5,r2qkb1r/p2p2pp/npp4n/4Pp2/3P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 9,an excellent responding move...
18,Bb4,f8b4,r2qk2r/p2p2pp/npp4n/4Pp2/1b1P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 10,a good move I finally saw I could do...
19,Bg5,c1g5,r2qk2r/p2p2pp/npp4n/4PpB1/1b1P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 2 10,a response full of intimidation... I would take the life of his bishop if his f3 knight wasn't in the way...
20,Qc7,d8c7,r3k2r/p1qp2pp/npp4n/4PpB1/1b1P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 3 11,"the only reasonable move to do, really..."
