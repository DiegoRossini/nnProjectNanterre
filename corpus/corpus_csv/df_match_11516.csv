I get that 10 ... axb5, 11 Nxb5 puts the knights strongly into play and makes c7 a hot spot, but I don't think the position is worth the material sacrifice, especially considering the firestorm that's about to land on the other side of the board."

Castling did remove the only protection for my bishop, but I'll worry about that later.  For now it's safe behind my knight."

Ne5 succeed at both.  It puts the knight into position to join the assult, and it makes the d4 pawn poison.  Rxd6 is met by Nc4, forcing white to choose between losing the rook and checkmate."

This move does four things, and it does them very well.  First, it pins the white queen to the c3-d4 diagonal.  If she ever leaves, the next move is checkmate.  Second, it defends the d pawn from the white rook.  Third, and perhaps most importantly, it pins the white f pawn to the white knight.  Otherwise, f6 could be a dangerous move.  Lastly, it prevents Kd2, keeping the king under pressure while I rally the troops.
My goal here is to get my bishop out of the way and play Rf-c8, Nxa3, Nc4, Ra1  ."

White's best hope is to break through my king-side pawns, because the battle for the white king is out of reach of the rest of white's pieces.  h4 is a solid move because it releases the pin on the white f pawn.  The combination I have to watch here is fxe6, Nxe6, Qg7  ."

The real point of this move, though, is to incite Nxe6, ending the threat against my king, and making my remaining knight even more important.  Basic rule of equal trades: no trade is equal.  Someone always loses some positional advantage."
