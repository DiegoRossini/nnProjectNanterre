Except he doesn't much love playing it against me anymore, after I began playing the Krejcik against him. He's tried several systems against it, and still hasn't found a sure antidote. There's something about the Krejcik ... it handles more soundly, more playably, following 1. c4 than it does following 1. d4. I dunno. I just know that springing it after 1. c4 f5 I've gotten excellent results against pretty much everyone."
