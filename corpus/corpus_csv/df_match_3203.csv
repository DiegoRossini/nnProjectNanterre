1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The Petroff, a line I play myself. This was remarkably the second time I encountered it in one week, the game I played the day before (also for the external league but for another team) also started off with the Petroff, I was White in that game as well."

5,Nxe5,f3e5,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,This is the variation I find the hardest to meet as Black. It's solid but White can also get a quick attack going if Black isn't careful.
6,d6,d7d6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,This is the variation I find the hardest to meet as Black. It's solid but White can also get a quick attack going if Black isn't careful.

10,d5,d6d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/4n3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"?! Apparently my opponent didn't know this variation. He thought for 2,5 minutes and came up with this dubious move. I guess he overlooked my next move..."
11,Qe2,d1e2,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/4n3/2N2N2/PPPPQPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"! A slightly counter-intuitive move as it temporarily blocks in the bishop, but White wins a pawn."
12,Be6,c8e6,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4b3/3p4/4n3/2N2N2/PPPPQPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 2 7,"?! This is another inaccuracy from my opponent. After 6...Be7 Black can at least castle after the exchanges on e4 and will then start to think of getting some real compensation for his pawn deficit. 6...f5?? is far worse due to 7.d3 winning a whole knight, and 6...Qe7?? is even worse than that because 7.Nxd5 not only wins a pawn, but also the knight on e4 as Black has to move his queen and can't defend the knight anymore (7..Qe6?? 8.Nxc7+ wins the queen)."
13,Nxe4,c3e4,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4b3/3p4/4N3/5N2/PPPPQPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 7,8...Qd5 was preferable. Now Black also gets an isolated pawn on an open file.

17,Bc4,f1c4,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1b3/8/2B1Q3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 1 9,"I thought during the game that 9.Nd4 would accomplish the same thing (an isolated e-pawn for Black), and it but now that I think of it 9...Qd5 seems to be a good counter. The reason why I chose this move during the game was because the knight on f3 was already developed and I wanted to develop another piece."
