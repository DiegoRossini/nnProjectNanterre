1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was a return game, I had played against the same opponent with Black and drew in a complicated Najdorf. So I was determined to win this one, especially since I had White."

The alternative is playing 9...Nc6, but that leads to a difficult middlegame for Black.

The move itself has some points, it prevents d5 and prepares to develop the Nb8 to c6 but it has bigger things going against it. On one hand, it's slow, another pawn move when I am fully mobilized and Black still has pieces on the back rank and on the other hand, should I play d5, a passed pawn will appear on the board much faster than before."
29,Qd3,d1d3,rn3rk1/pp3pb1/4p1pp/8/3PP1b1/3QBN2/q3BPPP/1R3RK1 b - - 1 15,"A very flexible move, connecting the Rooks and preparing d5. The immediate caputre 15. Rxb7 doesn't lead to anything but equality after 15...Nc6 16. h3 Bxf3 17. Bxf3 Rfd8 18. d5 Ne5 19. Qe2 Qxe2 20. Bxe2 exd5 21. exd5 Rxd5 22. Rxa7 Rax7 23.

32,Nc6,b8c6,r4rk1/pR3pb1/2n1p1pp/8/q2PP1b1/3QBN2/4BPPP/5RK1 w - - 1 17,Developing the last minor piece and putting pressure on d4.

35,gxf3,g2f3,r4rk1/pR3pb1/2n1p1pp/3P4/q3P3/3QBP2/4BP1P/5RK1 b - - 0 18,I took with the pawn mainly because I saw that I could double Rooks on the seventh rank and I didn't want to suffer from back rank tactics.

39,exd5,e4d5,r2r2k1/pR3pb1/2n3pp/3P4/q7/3QBP2/4BP1P/2R3K1 b - - 0 20,"The Knight was attacked and it had to go somewhere. Perhaps better was 20...Na5, removing one Rook from the seventh rank, but the Knight might become stuck on the rim and trying to exchange a pair of Rooks after 20...Na5 21. Rb5 Rdc8 22. Rxc8+ Rxc8 23. d6 Nc8 24. Qd5 and f7 and a7 are horribly weak."
