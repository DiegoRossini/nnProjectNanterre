1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This move controls the center and opens up lines for development of the queen and bishop. This move usually leads to sharp open battles, but can also lead to quiet closed positions if White plays something passive like d3 Nd2 transposing into some kind of King's Indian Attack"
2,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"I don't like to play normal openings because White usually has a slight advantage in those openings, and I have to fight for equality as Black. I like this move because White usually plays d4 here, and the passive e6 is safe and solid, and it usually brings White out of his opening repertoire."
3,g3,g2g3,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/6P1/PPPP1P1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"The sharpest moves were d4 and Nf3. This move is somewhat passive to play as White, and can transpose into King's Indian Attack, which is a passive opening and gives Black immediate equality."
4,Ne5,c6e5,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/8/4n3/4P3/6P1/PPPP1P1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"I like to bring my queenside knight to the kingside so I can have an extra defender when I castle, and also have an extra attacker if White castle's kingside. A lot of times when I play this opening, White advances his pawns trying to chase my knight, and a lot of pawn moves create weaknesses."
5,Ne2,g1e2,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/8/4n3/4P3/6P1/PPPPNP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 3,"This is a terrible move, and White should've expanded d4 with tempo, or at least followed up with his plan to fianchetto the bishop. This move blocks the queen's path to the weakness f3, so now f3 is severely weak."
6,Nf3#,e5f3,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/5nP1/PPPPNP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 3 4,"Just one simple mistake like that can lose immediately. Always keep track of your weaknesses and the defenders you have on that weakness, otherwise something like this could happen to you."
