1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Not a defense that I see very often. Black wants to develop the light squared bishop to the long diagonal early.
2,b6,b7b6,rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/1p6/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Not a defense that I see very often. Black wants to develop the light squared bishop to the long diagonal early.
3,Nd2,b1d2,rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/1p6/8/3P4/8/PPPNPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,My idea is to give my king's knight some cover on f3 with a piece. e3 or e4 would have accomplished the same thing. The disadvantage is that my dark square bishop is closed off. I compensated later in the game by putting my queenside pawns on dark squares.
4,Bb7,c8b7,rn1qkbnr/pbpppppp/1p6/8/3P4/8/PPPNPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,I was a little confused by this move. Nf3 would have been better to prevent the e4 push.
5,Ngf3,g1f3,rn1qkbnr/pbpppppp/1p6/8/3P4/5N2/PPPNPPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 3,I was a little confused by this move. Nf3 would have been better to prevent the e4 push.
