I like to do ""surprise"" castling, and I estimated here that black attack power was near to 0, so it was safe for me to play this move. While this is not true, I can also say: why castling? Ok, my plan is to launch a pawn storm on the kingside, so it is not adequate to castle kingside. 
In addition: my position is not bad, but my pieces are not coordinated. My d2 knight hasn't any place to go, and blocks my rook's action... and my queen is in a bad trap, you'll realize it soon."

I had to develop my pieces instead, but note that Bd3 leads to lose it (b5-c4) and Be2 is a dull move, since the bishop is doing nothing there."

Now I'm seriously worried about my queen, and all the ""tempos"" I will spend in saving it, instead than developing and attacking.

If Qa5, Nc6 and Bc8, but my queen can still escape into c5. I can also play c3xb4, but in both cases allowing NxB or worse. Maybe he calculated I could save myself, but with a piece less, even for some pawn. He decided to wait, and this, probably, was his ""big"" strategical mistake."
