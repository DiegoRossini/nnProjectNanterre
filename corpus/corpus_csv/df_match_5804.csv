Bc4, b3, Qd2, Be2

Thinking first bishop then Queen. Rejected, don't have a great spot for Bishop yet. But Qd2 allows for the queen to slide along the 2 rank and o-o-o

Threw out Bc4 because of d5. I need to push e5 when he does d5 and I can't if my bishop is being attacked.

b3 seems like a weakness, but if Bd7 happens I have to consider it more because I need running room for the Knight."

I think I can ignore this move for now and continue with development, king side attack.

Bc4 helps him open up c file, 
h5, 
g5 Knight goes to h5 making attack harder sort of like he is in now, 
Ne2, 
e5 gives him a good hole for his knight, 
d5 gives him open c file then Bishop x Knight destroys my queen side,
