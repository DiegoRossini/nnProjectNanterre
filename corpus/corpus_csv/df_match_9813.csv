1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is the starting position of the Tchigorin Defence. Revived lastly by the top GM Alexander Morozevich. Much less explored than the Slav 2...c6, Queen's Gambit Accepted 2...dxc4 or Orthodox Systems beginning with 2...e6. I very much like the development of the Nc6 here as it is quite justified by the c2-c4 pawn advance wich make possible immediate pressure on Pawn d4. One drawback of this method is the obligatory investment of Black's pair of Bishops to maintain his opening goals, but Knights are pleasant beasts also in combat."
