1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"***ANNOTATION UNFINISHED***
This was a real struggle for me, since I played the opening in a very wishful style, neglecting opening principals, and quickly found myself in a pickle of a situation. I played the game for a draw from early on and a late blunder from my opponent allowed me to seize a win in this one."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"1. e4 e5 - responding in the center, the position well known to everyone."

8,Bb4,c5b4,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/1b1PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"In stead of making a simple trade of pawns on d4, I tried to make some fancy gambit, that clearly was out of place :)"
9,dxe5,d4e5,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4P3/1b2P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"Taking back on e5 would deny me from castling, so I went with this weird gambit. Gambits are usually about giving material in order to gain time or space or lines, but in this case i didn't really gain much of anything, other than a weaker position."

12,Qxd6,d8d6,rnb1k1nr/ppp2pp1/3q3p/8/1b2P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,My Bishop moved 3 times in this opening which is a clear disadvantage. My weak Q-side is now vulnerable to the White Knight on c3

17,Nxd6+,b5d6,r1b1k1nr/ppp2pp1/2nN3p/8/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 9,A simple combination attacks my weak isolated d6 pawn and enables the long castle for White

20,Nf6,g8f6,r1b1k2r/pp3pp1/2np1n1p/8/4PB2/5N2/PPP2PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 2 11,"If Bxd6, Black can capture the pawn on e4, not letting the material deficit to grow."
21,Bd3,f1d3,r1b1k2r/pp3pp1/2np1n1p/8/4PB2/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 3 11,"defends the e4 pawn, but I think Bxd6 was stronger. If White were to keep his Bishop on the a3-f8 diagonal, that would keep the Black King vulnerable in the center. I suppose Black wasn't sure whether to castle long or short and decided to keep his options open by developing the second bishop..."
22,d5,d6d5,r1b1k2r/pp3pp1/2n2n1p/3p4/4PB2/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 12,Weak pawns must be pushed. This evades the attack from the f4 Bishop and offers a comfortable exchange for Black.
23,e5,e4e5,r1b1k2r/pp3pp1/2n2n1p/3pP3/5B2/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 0 12,"White denies the exchange and instead decides to push the Black Knight away. A White pawn can often be very strong on e5 if Black castles short, but I believe this isn't the case. Black's mobility felt more strangled with that pawn on e4. 
12. e5 advances the relocation of the Black Knight on f6, so I'd say While lost some time with this move, though he probably lost it with 11. Bd3. 
Notice also that this pawn now blocks the Bishop's access to the a3-f8 diagonal. If White would attempt to regain access to it with e6, then my d5 pawn would no longer be isolated and Black would gain some needed space in the center.
I think this move more than any other allowed me to think of a realistic draw."
24,Nd7,f6d7,r1b1k2r/pp1n1pp1/2n4p/3pP3/5B2/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 1 13,"The Knight prepares to jump into c5 and hopefully exchange with the Bishop on d3. Keeping bishops of opposite color on the board makes a draw a lot more likely. I've been hoping for a draw ever since I made that weird 4. ... Bb4, so I felt that drawing the game would be a small victory for me."
25,h3,h2h3,r1b1k2r/pp1n1pp1/2n4p/3pP3/5B2/3B1N1P/PPP2PP1/R3K2R b KQkq - 0 13,I imagine White was either worried about the mobility of his f4 Bishop in case Black attacks it with g5 or perhaps to deny the g4 square for my c8 bishop in the future... either way I believe this just gave me time to reorganize and catch up with White's development.
26,Nc5,d7c5,r1b1k2r/pp3pp1/2n4p/2npP3/5B2/3B1N1P/PPP2PP1/R3K2R w KQkq - 1 14,"My Knight completes the relocation to a better square, attacking the Bishop on d3 and eyeing over the e6 square"
27,O-O-O,e1c1,r1b1k2r/pp3pp1/2n4p/2npP3/5B2/3B1N1P/PPP2PP1/2KR3R b kq - 2 14,Another move that I think wasn't too strong - the White King doesn't look right on the Queen-side. The c file is semi-open and Black rooks would eventually feel very comfortable on it. The White King would look a lot safer on the King-side. At least that is my opinion... I don't see what purpose that White King could perform on the Queen-side... a simple Rd1 would have made more sense.
28,Nxd3+,c5d3,r1b1k2r/pp3pp1/2n4p/3pP3/5B2/3n1N1P/PPP2PP1/2KR3R w kq - 0 15,Black achieves the first goal and leaves bishops of opposite color on the board. Next goal is to exchange the knights and to go into the endgame asap.
