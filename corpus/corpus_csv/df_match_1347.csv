11,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqk1nr/p3bppp/2ppp3/8/2B1P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 3 6,6. Bc4 - people think that Bc4 is mainly for beginners and novices - I frequently play it.
12,e5,e6e5,rnbqk1nr/p3bppp/2pp4/4p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 7,My pawn takes a share in the centre.

However, after the recapture, there will be an open b-file for either of us to use, but there is no reason why I cannot place a rook on the b-file first. Also from a book - grab an open file as quickly as you can."

22,Qc7,d8c7,r3k1nr/p1q1bppp/2ppb3/4p3/2P1P3/2N1BN2/P1P1QPPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 3 12,"A passive square for the queen, and to support the c-pawn."
