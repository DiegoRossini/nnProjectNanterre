1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"hey hey lively chess crew! i like posting games with this gambit where there have been new move in it so i can save the lines. ive showed one with classical development. But this one is with a new ""irregular"" move, the game didnt last long but i want to save the early lines as facing rare replies are good to keep note of in my mind. you face those less often and may have less natural memory to them,"
2,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"and so my lovely nimzo! ive grown accustomed to it by now.  against players over 1800 rating it can fall short but its helped me climb from 1300 to the 1500 range with a good win ratio.  im also learning the budapest counter for d4 starters. and might start looking at the sicilian for higher opponents who go e4,"
3,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 2,"my favorite gambit can only be played when white replies with nf3.  alot of whites will reply with d4 here and there are 2 ways to respond either e5 or d5, i personally choose d5 vs d4 reply ive learnt those lines alot more,"
4,f5,f7f5,r1bqkbnr/ppppp1pp/2n5/5p2/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"and the gambit starts here. its called the colorado gambit.  initially played by a  player called Doug Root, i believe  he was able to win many games until grand masters were able to analyse flaws in this start but sub 1800 rating this gambit is extremely fun to play."
5,exf5,e4f5,r1bqkbnr/ppppp1pp/2n5/5P2/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,and so he decides to accept my gambit
6,d5,d7d5,r1bqkbnr/ppp1p1pp/2n5/3p1P2/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,proper reply
7,d3,d2d3,r1bqkbnr/ppp1p1pp/2n5/3p1P2/8/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,this is the first time i face this situation. where a white does not take out his LSB before playing his d pawn. much less i never anticipated him to block his LSB in... hmm uncharted waters. ill develop naturaly for a move or 2 still and see if what develops
8,Bxf5,c8f5,r2qkbnr/ppp1p1pp/2n5/3p1b2/8/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,recapture + development
9,Bf4,c1f4,r2qkbnr/ppp1p1pp/2n5/3p1b2/5B2/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,hmmm not nc3 nor Bg5. this is really unexpected. i have to think to myself. is this opponent familiar with the opening im using or is he also just going with the flow having not faced the colorado gambit before.
10,Bg4,f5g4,r2qkbnr/ppp1p1pp/2n5/3p4/5Bb1/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,usually i wouldve been able to play e5 but since he has double coverage on that square i couldnt play that yet. so i decide to pin his knight to induce a pawn weakness or allow e5 depending on his reply.
11,Be2,f1e2,r2qkbnr/ppp1p1pp/2n5/3p4/5Bb1/3P1N2/PPP1BPPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 3 6,"reinforces the knight. very wise choice or else i couldve played nd4 threatning a double pawn,  here i took a long time to what my reply should be. and playing e5 is no longer viable. i dont want to move any left side or right side pawns to have both castle options open. playing nf6 is developing but doesnt help the situation on e5 and creates alot more tension because he could now play his knight on e5 blocking my pawn, and moving my queen now doesnt seem wise with 3 of his pieces live with blind attacks."
12,d4,d5d4,r2qkbnr/ppp1p1pp/2n5/8/3p1Bb1/3P1N2/PPP1BPPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 7,so im happy i faced an irregular game like this where an opponent didnt develop his d pawn at all and playing d4 is a wise crunch. so i choose to replay this move that was great. i also remembered that trying to fight for the e5 square in that fight wouldve led to my demise. but i can set a trap up with the e5 square.  and it was wiser to castle long during that game. so now i can also move my king side pawns
13,Nbd2,b1d2,r2qkbnr/ppp1p1pp/2n5/8/3p1Bb1/3P1N2/PPPNBPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 7,"the d4 prevents nc3 obviously. he also cant take the pawn with his knight. i can hold back my epawn until i consolidate some material off the board and relieve some tension. so i analysed that the f knight and the DSB are the culprits that have to leave the board,."
14,Nf6,g8f6,r2qkb1r/ppp1p1pp/2n2n2/8/3p1Bb1/3P1N2/PPPNBPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 8,so i decide to help provide cover to the bishop incase he does choose to play ne5 and it further helps develop
15,Nb3,d2b3,r2qkb1r/ppp1p1pp/2n2n2/8/3p1Bb1/1N1P1N2/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 3 8,hmm going after my d4 pawn. i cannot let that happen. time to take attack the culprits i want to take off the board
16,Nh5,f6h5,r2qkb1r/ppp1p1pp/2n5/7n/3p1Bb1/1N1P1N2/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 4 9,if he takes my d4 pawn he loses his bishop. i would hope to induce a pawn reinforcement. or that he would go to d2
17,Be5,f4e5,r2qkb1r/ppp1p1pp/2n5/4B2n/3p2b1/1N1P1N2/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 5 9,hmmm unanticpated reply. and has now triple attack on my d4 pawn. but he placed both the 2 units i wanted off the board within attacks reach
18,Bxf3,g4f3,r2qkb1r/ppp1p1pp/2n5/4B2n/3p4/1N1P1b2/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 10,and so force the bishop retake first and itll be an even trade but i get both the 2 enemies of the e5 square off the board
19,Bxf3,e2f3,r2qkb1r/ppp1p1pp/2n5/4B2n/3p4/1N1P1B2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 10,gulp and gulp
20,Nxe5,c6e5,r2qkb1r/ppp1p1pp/8/4n2n/3p4/1N1P1B2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 11,gulp and gulp
21,Bxh5+,f3h5,r2qkb1r/ppp1p1pp/8/4n2B/3p4/1N1P4/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 11,and since im queen side castling. pinning my knight isnt wise even though i do want the e5 square open.  playing the pawn is safer
