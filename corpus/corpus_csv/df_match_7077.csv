1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Right now, I Jo Stevens, am sitting in Coach Ion's Classroom on a stool near his desk, with my back to the class with the Dunce's Cap on.  The reason for this is because I had to go pawn grabbing again - didn't I?  I really should have learned from this game with Freddy, the Headmaster - OMG, if he sees me in the corner, I had better think of hiding a few regicide manuals under my gym pants and trousers lest I get summoned to his study!, that game is: http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/the-sodium-attack?gm=28475 in which I was punished in full for my ""greed"" although one must note that in both cases I lost or was about to lose a pawn and I thought I would regain the pawn, unfortunately I did but at a price.  One has to say, however, that the motif Ion used was similar but a little different.  Ahh well, here goes.  This is the King's Indian Thematic Tournament organised by fatcat, a member of the Master Mater's Coaching Club.  I will comment again on move 5 because although that is part of the MT setup that f4 move deserves some comment ....."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"5. f4 - this move has advantages and disadvantages.  It's strengths are twofold.  This pawn controls e5 and g5 and is also used to break up a fianchettoed position.  This pawn moves early on in the opening in The Bird's Opening, The Pirc Defense - Austrian Attack, The Robatsch Defense and the Sicilian Dragon/Naijdorf as well as the King's Indian 4 pawn attack.  Ok. White has an impressive pawn centre, but it can be punctured.  The drawback of the f pawn moving, however, is that it opens up the Fool's Mate Diagonal - e1-h4.  Here is how a 1650+ player came a cropper against The Dentist on that diagonal:-  http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/fools-paradise?gm=15408.  That diagonal can be exploited in the opening.  Another diagonal that black can take advantage of is the g1-b8 diagonal after white has castled short by means of his queen or dark squared bishop.  In this case I do castle short and Ion does take advantage of this with his dsb as you will see."

Note I talked about that g1-a7 diagonal earlier on, where black can land an annoying check on a king that has castled on that side.  Here is the check.  Now how do we get out of check.  There are only two options here, block or move Henry.  1. Blocking with Rf2 drops at least the exchange and walks Henry into a pin after the resulting Bxf2+.  Option 2, Kf1 walks Henry straight into a pin on the f column.  Option 3, well, no obvious pin, but look - the knight will be pinned because Old Matey just lurves those back rows and I will certainly cop it if I move my knight after Ion pushes his pawn to g5.  Nh3 will not help as the g2 square is doubly attacked by the dsb and the rook when it lands on f1 to give check, so Rxg1 will be mate, sss-shh-ugar!"
