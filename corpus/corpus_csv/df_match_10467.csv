Black's kingside is severely weakened, and suddenly castling seems a lot less safe. Moves like h4 and g4, seeking to pry open files on the kingside, are suddenly in the offing after White castles queenside."

There, Alburt pointed out that I could have repeatedly gotten an advantage by playing the e5 pawn push because my opponent had allowed it. He said that this move is thematic in this opening and that White should play it. I wasted no time, seeing that Black's knight doesn't really have any good squares."

I didn't want Black moving his knight to f8 to defend the e6 pawn, and to subsequently start pushing his center pawns. No doubt that would have been very weakening, but I don't like being material down, and I was most interested in trying to regain my pawn by aiming my forces at g6. Thus, this pin."
