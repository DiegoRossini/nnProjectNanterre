9,d3,d2d3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/4n3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,5. d3 chases the knight away and opens a diagonal to the queen bishop.
10,Nf6,e4f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/8/8/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,5. Black backs his knight off to f6 and the position looks very symmetrical.  I bring my other knight out next move and this hits at e4 and d5.

20,Bg4,c8g4,rn1q1rk1/pp3ppp/2pb1n2/3p4/3P2b1/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 2 11,"10. To which my opponent responds Bg4 pinning my knight.  I kick it away with  h3 and his bishop moves to h4.  I wondered about the feasibility of breaking the pin with g4 as it does weaken the kingside castling position - I decided to click on the database button just to see if there was a position recorded - luckily there was and the percentage was favourable to white - the next few moves were made in conjunction with the database which ended with the exchange of bishops on d3.  They were all good solid moves, involving harassing the light squared bishop - so much so that in order to avoid a possible pawn bust up on the kingside, or if black is not careful his bishop could be trapped, the bishop exchanges itself and the white queen looks safe on d3 - I did look at the possibility of Ktg5 later on ganging up on the white h pawn but this did not materialise).  I therefore decided to accept the recommendation of the 1900s database."

Rob and I agreed in the chat that I should have exchanged knights here but I go and play c3?? (  whatever more question marks should be added) to back up my d4 pawn.  This takes away the defence of the d3 square allowing his knight to go to d3 and discover an attack on my hanging f3 knight and threatens the rook on e1 - I give up the exchange and play on for just a few more moves but I resigned when I knew that I was going to be at least 3 material points behind with no counterplay) - it is such a shame that the game had to end in this way and I hope I can give Rob a better show later on.
