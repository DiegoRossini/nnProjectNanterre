1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"? An old system, never seen in serious chess, probably played by mistake!"
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"? An old system, never seen in serious chess, probably played by mistake!"
3,dxe5,d4e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/8/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Black assumes the game (I tried to offer draw, but it was too late)."
4,Bc5,f8c5,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1P3/8/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"Black assumes the game (I tried to offer draw, but it was too late)."
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1P3/8/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 3,"? ...but interesting. In fact, I decided I could just ignore it. I want a pawn in h3, so no problem with that pawn."
6,h5,h7h5,rnbqk1nr/pppp1pp1/8/2b1P2p/8/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"? ...but interesting. In fact, I decided I could just ignore it. I want a pawn in h3, so no problem with that pawn."
7,e4,e2e4,rnbqk1nr/pppp1pp1/8/2b1P2p/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"? I understad, black wants to contest the center, but he is neglecting developement. I overlooked that he is opening the way for his Q to b6, TOO..."
8,c6,c7c6,rnbqk1nr/pp1p1pp1/2p5/2b1P2p/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"? I understad, black wants to contest the center, but he is neglecting developement. I overlooked that he is opening the way for his Q to b6, TOO..."
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk1nr/pp1p1pp1/2p5/2b1P2p/4P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"Uh-oh, I'm in trouble! Incredibe! This will be fun. The only reasonable answer is to block with my Q one of my B's path. Too bad!"
10,Qb6,d8b6,rnb1k1nr/pp1p1pp1/1qp5/2b1P2p/4P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,"Uh-oh, I'm in trouble! Incredibe! This will be fun. The only reasonable answer is to block with my Q one of my B's path. Too bad!"
11,Qd2,d1d2,rnb1k1nr/pp1p1pp1/1qp5/2b1P2p/4P3/2N2N2/PPPQ1PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 3 6,"I sensed I better kept an eye on the d column, well aware of the black's attacking potential."
12,Na6,b8a6,r1b1k1nr/pp1p1pp1/nqp5/2b1P2p/4P3/2N2N2/PPPQ1PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 4 7,"? ... unfortunately, this move is not a good way to attack, since it essentially loses a piece. The Q and B battery is uncovered after Na4, and NxB will have neutralized black's power."
13,Na4,c3a4,r1b1k1nr/pp1p1pp1/nqp5/2b1P2p/N3P3/5N2/PPPQ1PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 5 7,"...but now, black has only one move to save the B, that IS en prise. After the Q retreats, BxNa6 will leave black with Bxf2+, KxB, bxBa6, with few compensation. Black had to play Qb4, in order to threat the WN and the Q's exchange at the same time, guaranteeing to maintain the balance."
14,Bb4,c5b4,r1b1k1nr/pp1p1pp1/nqp5/4P2p/Nb2P3/5N2/PPPQ1PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 6 8,"? but this move plainly loses a piece... or not? The whole situation is thematic, and good for beginners to get used to."
15,c3,c2c3,r1b1k1nr/pp1p1pp1/nqp5/4P2p/Nb2P3/2P2N2/PP1Q1PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 8,"Now both pieces, Q and B, are threatened at the same time. It seems not to be any escape for black."
16,Qa5,b6a5,r1b1k1nr/pp1p1pp1/n1p5/q3P2p/Nb2P3/2P2N2/PP1Q1PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 1 9,"... but in fact there is one, and very good, indeed. This way, the BQ escapes and threats the Na4 in return. The balance will be mantained."
17,cxb4,c3b4,r1b1k1nr/pp1p1pp1/n1p5/q3P2p/NP2P3/5N2/PP1Q1PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 9,"...but again, the situation is not so simple. This is a kind of dangerous move (if not a blunder). White (I) should have taken the chance to develop with tempo with BxNa6. This just to make possible o-o, the beginning of the freedom. Now, the N will become a killer monster! Can you see?"
18,Nxb4,a6b4,r1b1k1nr/pp1p1pp1/2p5/q3P2p/Nn2P3/5N2/PP1Q1PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 0 10,"Threatening Nc2+! AND my Na4. Time to behave ""cool blood fashion""."
19,Nc3,a4c3,r1b1k1nr/pp1p1pp1/2p5/q3P2p/1n2P3/2N2N2/PP1Q1PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 1 10,"This simple move counters all of black's threats. Now, a3 will solve all my problems... but the funny thing about this game is that after a black's horrible opening, I am the one struggling for coming out of problems! There is a theory chapter somewhere I didn't read! :-)"

27,Nxd5+,c3d5,r1b3nr/pp2k1p1/5p2/qB1NP2p/1n6/5N2/PP1Q1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 0 14,Black loses here both the N and the Q. You'll see!
