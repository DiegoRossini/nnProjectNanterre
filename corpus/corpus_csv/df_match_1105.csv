1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,White opens with king pawn.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,standard stuff
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,white threatens the black pawn.
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,Lately I have been playing this when I have black.  It is called Petrov's defense. If you take me then I take you.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 3,White says no thanks and develops another horse while protecting the king pawn.  Now its called the Petrov three knights game (C42)
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 4 4,Black does likewise and we have achieved perfect symmetry.  Seems like it should now be called the Petrov 4 knights game but GameKnot database does not make a distinction.
7,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1B2p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 5 4,White threatens to take blacks pawn protector.
8,Nd4,c6d4,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/1B2p3/3nP3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 6 5,Black threatens the white bishop. This really goes against my training. because if white trades horses then the black pawns will be doubled and thus weaker.
9,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/1B2p3/3NP3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"As expected, white trades horses."
10,exd4,e5d4,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/1B6/3pP3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,Black now has a doubled pawn which the experts say is a really bad thing but the white horse is threatened and black has hopes of getting that white king pawn.
11,Ne2,c3e2,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/1B6/3pP3/8/PPPPNPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,The white horse saves himself and that leaves the white pawn in trouble but it also puts the black pawn in trouble.
12,c6,c7c6,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2p2n2/1B6/3pP3/8/PPPPNPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"Rather than taking his point, black decides to play chase the bishop.  This also goes against my grain.  It seems to me that black should do the pawn trade in order to get rid of that hated doubled pawn."
13,Bd3,b5d3,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2p2n2/8/3pP3/3B4/PPPPNPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,Now the white pawn is protected again.  Black has lost his chance to go one point up and the black pawn is still in trouble.
14,d5,d7d5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p2n2/3p4/3pP3/3B4/PPPPNPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"Black pushes the queen pawn.  Now the white pawn has two threats, but the leading black pawn is still in trouble."
15,e5,e4e5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p2n2/3pP3/3p4/3B4/PPPPNPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,White smartly pushes his pawn threatening the black horse.
16,Nd7,f6d7,r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p5/3pP3/3p4/3B4/PPPPNPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 9,Black horse saves himself while threatening the white pawn.  This seems familiar.
17,Nxd4,e2d4,r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p5/3pP3/3N4/3B4/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 9,White takes his booty but allows black to do likewise.
18,Nxe5,d7e5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p5/3pn3/3N4/3B4/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 10,As expected the pawn trade is executed.  So black ultimately gets his wish.  The black doubled pawn is now gone.  We just took the long road to get there. White is mildly threatened with a possible doubled pawn if black takes the white bishop.
19,Qe2,d1e2,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p5/3pn3/3N4/3B4/PPPPQPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 1 10,"White is playing very well. The threat on the white bishop is squelched and at the same time, the black horse is pinned.  Can not move."
20,Bd6,f8d6,r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2pb4/3pn3/3N4/3B4/PPPPQPPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 2 11,Black protects his horse but it looks bad for black if white pushes the f pawn.
