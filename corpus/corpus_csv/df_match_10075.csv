1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"So this game was a mini-tournament created by Pawnbandit.
It was a King's Gambit Accepted."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"In this game, Pawnbandit has agreed to annotate his half of the game and I will annotate my half of the game at pivotal points as play develops. I write comments for the White pieces and Pawnbandit commentates for the Black pieces..I have some comments for black as well. To make this easy I will put Pawnbandits comments in brackets."
3,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,This is where each game in the tournament started. White to move.
4,exf4,e5f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,This is where each game in the tournament started. White to move.
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,Nf3 is line for the 3rd move for white. Takes some squares in the center as well as guarding the h4 square.
6,g5,g7g5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/6p1/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,This seems to be the berlin defense. I'm not positive. It was definitely the favorite for black in this tournament.
7,h4,h2h4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/6p1/4Pp1P/5N2/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,This line follows.
8,g4,g5g4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/8/4PppP/5N2/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,(Bg7 is one of many possibilities here but too passive for my taste. I like to force the issue with g4 and see what develops.)
9,Ne5,f3e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/4N3/4PppP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,This is the best move for white. Anything else is trapped
10,h5,h7h5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p2/8/4N2p/4PppP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,(Nf6 leads to the Kieseritzsky Gambit and can lead to some interesting games. Here I feel like doing something different with a view to consolidating my extended pawn structure on the king side so I play 5..h5)
11,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p2/8/4N2p/2B1PppP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,The crucial square in the kings gambit f7. In this position for the Berlin it's easy to kick out.
12,Nh6,g8h6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1p2/7n/4N2p/2B1PppP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 7,(Developing the knight on the side of the board and defending f7. This looks awkward but is consistent with the king side pawn thrust that follows.)
13,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1p2/7n/4N2p/2BPPppP/8/PPP3P1/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,Castling on the king side would be an obvious mistake now. White's advantage is this game is quick development. This defense slows it down.
14,d6,d7d6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2p2/3p3n/4N2p/2BPPppP/8/PPP3P1/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,(Time to kick away White's centralized knight and open the way for the white squared bishop )
15,Nd3,e5d3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2p2/3p3n/7p/2BPPppP/3N4/PPP3P1/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 8,"I thought here for awhile.
Playing 8.Bxf7   Nxf7
9. Nxf7  Kxf7
10. Bxf4  
then castling king side with a check.
that would have been too aggressive and would have failed just as quickly. It could have been interesting though"
16,f3,f4f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2p2/3p3n/7p/2BPP1pP/3N1p2/PPP3P1/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,(This sort of early kingside thrust is often seen in 19th century games and has lead to quick wins for Black)
17,gxf3,g2f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2p2/3p3n/7p/2BPP1pP/3N1P2/PPP5/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 9,Of course capturing is the best idea here.
18,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/ppp1bp2/3p3n/7p/2BPP1pP/3N1P2/PPP5/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 10,"Instead of taking back, black threatens bxh4 .
Black wins a pawn as well as stopping white from castling.(Attacking the pawn on h4 and threatening a check which would prevent any chance of queenside castling. )
I guess this one is pretty clear."
19,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqk2r/ppp1bp2/3p3n/6Bp/2BPP1pP/3N1P2/PPP5/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 2 10,"White still loses a pawn, but white can now still keeps an ok position."
20,Bxg5,e7g5,rnbqk2r/ppp2p2/3p3n/6bp/2BPP1pP/3N1P2/PPP5/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 11,(The h pawn can't be saved but White's move prevents the check.)
21,hxg5,h4g5,rnbqk2r/ppp2p2/3p3n/6Pp/2BPP1p1/3N1P2/PPP5/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 0 11,(The exchange of bishops ends up winning a pawn)
22,Qxg5,d8g5,rnb1k2r/ppp2p2/3p3n/6qp/2BPP1p1/3N1P2/PPP5/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 12,(The exchange of bishops ends up winning a pawn)
