16,g6,g7g6,rn1qkb1r/4pp1p/3p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQ1KNR w kq - 0 9,critical idea where black wants to develop his DSB bishop on the strong diagonal
17,g3,g2g3,rn1qkb1r/4pp1p/3p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N3P1/PP3P1P/R1BQ1KNR b kq - 0 9,Making room for the white king who for the most part will be safe on g2. Though later on he may have to watch out for tactical threats along the a8-h1 diagonal
18,Bg7,f8g7,rn1qk2r/4ppbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N3P1/PP3P1P/R1BQ1KNR w kq - 1 10,White has essentially castled the old school way.

20,O-O,e8g8,rn1q1rk1/4ppbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N2NP1/PP3P1P/R1BQ1K1R w - - 3 11,White has essentially castled the old school way.
21,Kg2,f1g2,rn1q1rk1/4ppbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N2NP1/PP3PKP/R1BQ3R b - - 4 11,White has essentially castled the old school way.
22,Nbd7,b8d7,r2q1rk1/3nppbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N2NP1/PP3PKP/R1BQ3R w - - 5 12,Develops a piece and prepares to create an outpost on ...c5 later on.
23,a4,a2a4,r2q1rk1/3nppbp/3p1np1/2pP4/P3P3/2N2NP1/1P3PKP/R1BQ3R b - - 0 12,one of white's long term assets is the passed a-pawn. This kicks off some tactics as well as creates an outpost on b5 for the white knight.
24,Ra6,a8a6,3q1rk1/3nppbp/r2p1np1/2pP4/P3P3/2N2NP1/1P3PKP/R1BQ3R w - - 1 13,lifting the rook and preparing for possible operations in the centre by supporting d6. The long term idea is to play ...e6 liquidating white's center pawns and creating possible tactic against white's king along the light squares with the queen on a8. Also with the queen on a8 taking on the white a-pawn is a threat.
25,Qc2,d1c2,3q1rk1/3nppbp/r2p1np1/2pP4/P3P3/2N2NP1/1PQ2PKP/R1B4R b - - 2 13,!? first major deviation from main line theory. The idea is to fight against ...c5-c4 and support a4 and e4. I think it is a pretty useful move. The two more popular moves are Re1 and Qe2. But IMO both are not as useful as Qc2.
26,Qa8,d8a8,q4rk1/3nppbp/r2p1np1/2pP4/P3P3/2N2NP1/1PQ2PKP/R1B4R w - - 3 14,Black continues to put pressure on a4 and build long term tactics on the a8-h1 diagonal.
27,Nb5,c3b5,q4rk1/3nppbp/r2p1np1/1NpP4/P3P3/5NP1/1PQ2PKP/R1B4R b - - 4 14,Not only does this knight look strong here it hits at black critical square of d6. The tactical idea is that it inhibits ...e6
28,Rc8,f8c8,q1r3k1/3nppbp/r2p1np1/1NpP4/P3P3/5NP1/1PQ2PKP/R1B4R w - - 5 15,black is clearly wanting to play ...c5-c4 making room for ...Nc5. Tactically after a future exchange on ...c5 the rook is lifted and has a powerful c-pawn that is well supported by the DSB on g7 and rook on c5.
29,Bd2,c1d2,q1r3k1/3nppbp/r2p1np1/1NpP4/P3P3/5NP1/1PQB1PKP/R6R b - - 6 15,"Of course I have prepared for this tactical idea by black and played Qc2, Nb5 and Bd2 making the journey of the black c-pawn a dangerous one."
30,c4,c5c4,q1r3k1/3nppbp/r2p1np1/1N1P4/P1p1P3/5NP1/1PQB1PKP/R6R w - - 0 16,Only move that gives black a chance in this position. Black can not afford to be timid.
31,Bb4,d2b4,q1r3k1/3nppbp/r2p1np1/1N1P4/PBp1P3/5NP1/1PQ2PKP/R6R b - - 1 16,The idea of Bd2 was in anticipation of ...c4 now ...Nc5 is short lived. This sets up a critical moment for black. As I see it black has two moves
32,Nc5,d7c5,q1r3k1/4ppbp/r2p1np1/1NnP4/PBp1P3/5NP1/1PQ2PKP/R6R w - - 2 17,"!? this is the main move and if black can play it he would dearly love to play it. But can he? You see, the other alternative that I am sure is a novelty is the exchange sacrifice 16. ...Nb6 supporting c4 and adding another attacker onto a4. Which in my mind would force me to play the unwanted 17. a5 Nbxd5!? 18. exd5 Qb7 19. Qa4 Rb8 looks decent for black. But as this game progress you be the judge on whether 16....Nc5 is playable."
33,Bxc5,b4c5,q1r3k1/4ppbp/r2p1np1/1NBP4/P1p1P3/5NP1/1PQ2PKP/R6R b - - 0 17,Lifting the rook and tactically threatening Rha1
34,Rxc5,c8c5,q5k1/4ppbp/r2p1np1/1NrP4/P1p1P3/5NP1/1PQ2PKP/R6R w - - 0 18,Lifting the rook and tactically threatening Rha1
35,Ra3,a1a3,q5k1/4ppbp/r2p1np1/1NrP4/P1p1P3/R4NP1/1PQ2PKP/7R b - - 1 18,Lifting the rook and tactically threatening Rha1
36,e6,e7e6,q5k1/5pbp/r2ppnp1/1NrP4/P1p1P3/R4NP1/1PQ2PKP/7R w - - 0 19,!? a super risky move that really puts black behind the 8-ball. The final game in my database continued with 18...Nfd7 which ended in a draw.
37,dxe6,d5e6,q5k1/5pbp/r2pPnp1/1Nr5/P1p1P3/R4NP1/1PQ2PKP/7R b - - 0 19,defending e4 and threatening e4-e5
38,fxe6,f7e6,q5k1/6bp/r2ppnp1/1Nr5/P1p1P3/R4NP1/1PQ2PKP/7R w - - 0 20,defending e4 and threatening e4-e5
39,Re1,h1e1,q5k1/6bp/r2ppnp1/1Nr5/P1p1P3/R4NP1/1PQ2PKP/4R3 b - - 1 20,defending e4 and threatening e4-e5
40,d5,d6d5,q5k1/6bp/r3pnp1/1Nrp4/P1p1P3/R4NP1/1PQ2PKP/4R3 w - - 0 21,now the critical black c-pawn finds itself under attack. Slow but surely black's pieces get deflected away from a4.
41,exd5,e4d5,q5k1/6bp/r3pnp1/1NrP4/P1p5/R4NP1/1PQ2PKP/4R3 b - - 0 21,now the critical black c-pawn finds itself under attack. Slow but surely black's pieces get deflected away from a4.
42,Nxd5,f6d5,q5k1/6bp/r3p1p1/1Nrn4/P1p5/R4NP1/1PQ2PKP/4R3 w - - 0 22,now the critical black c-pawn finds itself under attack. Slow but surely black's pieces get deflected away from a4.
43,Re4,e1e4,q5k1/6bp/r3p1p1/1Nrn4/P1p1R3/R4NP1/1PQ2PKP/8 b - - 1 22,now the critical black c-pawn finds itself under attack. Slow but surely black's pieces get deflected away from a4.
44,Bf8,g7f8,q4bk1/7p/r3p1p1/1Nrn4/P1p1R3/R4NP1/1PQ2PKP/8 w - - 2 23,because the c-pawn is threatened so is the hanging rook on c5. So black feels obliged to move the bishop off it's strong diagonal and onto a weaker one.
