Don't play this move if you value your rating points (although fortunately for Bob this game was unrated).  Over the next few moves you will see why.  Going through the World DB a suggested alternative for black would have been as follows:- 6....... Nc6 7. cxd5 Na5 8. Qa4+ Bd7 9. Bb5 a6 10. Bxd7+ Nxd7 though I think white still has the edge here.
