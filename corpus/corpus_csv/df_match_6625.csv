9,e3,e2e3,rn1qkb1r/pbppp1pp/1p3n2/5p2/2PP1B2/4PN2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"now that this move doesn't block in the dark-square bishop, this move is perfectly fine"
10,d6,d7d6,rn1qkb1r/pbp1p1pp/1p1p1n2/5p2/2PP1B2/4PN2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Post-mortem, I considered d5... but I should mention, I was treating the opening like a rapid-fire blitz game, and in my head I had already planned these moves. Besides, d5 might not have been the best line of play anyway... what if White plays c5? (I should mention, I find those kind of moves very annoying!)"

I want to play e5, but White has too many defenders on the e5 square. Then I noticed that my f5 pawn was hanging, so I decided that it needed protection. Finally, I considered the possibility of simply blocking the bishop's scope..."
