1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"One of the most uncommon approaches to the opening. Of course, white has the chance to overextend with d5, which offers black a target. But I want to see if the London holds."

3,Bf4,c1f4,rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/1p6/8/3P1B2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"If Nf3 at once, some players play BxN, just to scramble my pawns. I would have an edge, but even so I didn't want to play this line."

11,Bd3,f1d3,rn1qkb1r/pbpp1pp1/1p2pn1p/8/3P1B2/3BPN2/PPPN1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 6,Supporting a future e4.
12,Be7,f8e7,rn1qk2r/pbppbpp1/1p2pn1p/8/3P1B2/3BPN2/PPPN1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 7,"Still passive, so I can..."

15,c3,c2c3,rn1qk2r/pbp1bpp1/1p1ppn1p/8/3PPB2/2PB1N2/PP1N1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 8,"...I just skewered the decision. I'm now planning some attack on the white squares, so I wanted to leave room for my minor pieces, but correct would have been c4, depriving Nf6 from his fly square after e5."
16,O-O,e8g8,rn1q1rk1/pbp1bpp1/1p1ppn1p/8/3PPB2/2PB1N2/PP1N1PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 1 9,"Still passive. Sound, but passive. Black defines white's targets better, while he could have developed instead."

18,c5,c7c5,rn1q1rk1/pb2bpp1/1p1ppn1p/2p5/3PPB2/2PB1N2/PPQN1PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 10,"Finally! Black has his chance and takes it. Now, I tried to force something by winning some tempoes while I leave this pawn to make his feeding race."

21,Nxe5,f3e5,rn1q1rk1/pb2bpp1/1p2pn1p/2p1N3/3P1B2/2PB4/PPQN1PPP/R3K2R b KQ - 0 11,"I didn't care at all Bxg2, Rg1, this only helps me. I don't care to exchange the pawn, since then Qxd4 would harm me a lot. I was looking to Nxf7, but I found no trick or mate... still. My problem is Nf6, shielding h7."
22,cxd4,c5d4,rn1q1rk1/pb2bpp1/1p2pn1p/4N3/3p1B2/2PB4/PPQN1PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 12,"I didn't care at all Bxg2, Rg1, this only helps me.

24,dxc3,d4c3,rn1q1rk1/pb2bpp1/1p2pn1p/4N3/4NB2/2pB4/PPQ2PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 13,"This was the ""munching march"" I was allowing him."

26,Bxf6,e7f6,rn1q1rk1/pb3pp1/1p2pb1p/4N3/5B2/2pB4/PPQ2PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 14,Nxf7 still doesn't work...
