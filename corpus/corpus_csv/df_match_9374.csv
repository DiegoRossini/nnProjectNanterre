16,Bd7,c8d7,r2qkb1r/pp1bnppp/5n2/3Pp3/8/1QN3P1/PP1P1PBP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 1 9,I doubted the pawn capture was in my best interest.  Can it be soundly played?  8...b6 leads to 9.d6 forking rook and knight.
17,Nge2,g1e2,r2qkb1r/pp1bnppp/5n2/3Pp3/8/1QN3P1/PP1PNPBP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 2 9,"I expect 10... exd4 11. Nxd4.  I still need to castle, but he has no viable strategy to keep my king in the center."

20,Bd6,f8d6,r2qk2r/pp1b1ppp/3b1nn1/3Pp3/3P4/1QN3P1/PP2NPBP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 1 11,"He blockades the pawn, a good idea in isolated queen pawn positions, but it will take him a little while to attack the blockaded pawn.  Bd7 still seems like a waste of time.  The more the b7 pawn is offered, the more I feel that he wants the counterplay and time I would have to use repositioning the queen.  I think Qxb7 is perfectly playable, but I know my nature as a chess player.  I could just as easily lose my queen as gain a solid two or three points heading towards a solid endgame."
21,O-O,e1g1,r2qk2r/pp1b1ppp/3b1nn1/3Pp3/3P4/1QN3P1/PP2NPBP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 2 11,"He has again offered the pawn on b7.  In addition, I can capture the pawn on e5.  Perhaps taking the relatively free material (e5) in exchange for a doubled pawn seems like a bargain, but I felt my King's safety as a higher priority."
22,b6,b7b6,r2qk2r/p2b1ppp/1p1b1nn1/3Pp3/3P4/1QN3P1/PP2NPBP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 0 12,"If he was going to play this move, he should never have played Bd7.  Actually he should not have played Bd7 at all.  The f knight is vulnerable.  It needs to reposition before Bg5, but it has no great place to move."
23,Bg5,c1g5,r2qk2r/p2b1ppp/1p1b1nn1/3Pp1B1/3P4/1QN3P1/PP2NPBP/R4RK1 b kq - 1 12,Now this is a common tactical move in Tarrasch style positions.  The pin can be brutal and the pinned must be really careful because the knight (c3 here) can often force a doubled f pawn.  The pin undermines black claims on e4 and strongly discourages the black knight from moving.

The highlights of the position are as follows: The a8 rook will be lost if white gets to play NxN with tempo, black's dark-squared bishop will be lost one way or another, and white seems fine in the resulting play.  14...Bxd6? 15. Nxd6 exposing the black rook to white's LS bishop.  14... Nxe4 15. d6xe7 threatening queen and rook followed by 15... Qwhatever 16. exf8=Q  Q/Rxf8 17. Bxe4.  AND the line that follows:"

Even if I lose the queen, a queen for a bishop and rook is very close to an equal exchange.  I can't say I actually worked it out.  It seemed to promise an interesting game, so I played it!"
