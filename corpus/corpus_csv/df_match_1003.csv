8,Bb4+,f8b4,rn1qk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3pPb2/1bPP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,It seems an useless attack.
9,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3pPb2/1bPP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 5,"More aggressive and forceful was Bd7. White can allow himself to lose his ""bad"" bishop."

White should have gone for Bd2 (defending the R), renewing the threat on the black's dsb. Not doing so costs black the game. You have to recognize a strong attack when it cames, and the best thing is to try to develop, defend and exchange whenever not dangerous."
13,Nge2,g1e2,rn2k1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/q1ppPb2/1bPP4/P1N5/1P2NPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 7,"Not bad, supporting the other N in case of BxN. But it allows..."
