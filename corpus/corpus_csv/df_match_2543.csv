1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"In this exciting encounter, White goes for the 'Full Danish' Gambit - you'll see what 'full' implies - and played throughout as he began, full of fight. Rather unwisely (and unnecessarily), I played an attacking line that was far riskier than I had calculated upon.  Though far behind in material, White's active pieces came within an ace of turning the tables.  Here's the plot."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The Centre Game.  In my view it is really only worth playing this if you are going to play the Scotch Game, or a gambit.  I believe White knew exactly what he wanted to play the moment he saw my first move."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"The Centre Game.  In my view it is really only worth playing this if you are going to play the Scotch Game, or a gambit.  I believe White knew exactly what he wanted to play the moment he saw my first move."
4,exd4,e5d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3pP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Best.  There really is no better move than this capture.
5,c3,c2c3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3pP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"The beginning of a complex of gambit lines that could include the Scotch Gambit, the Goring, and, of course, the Danish in various forms."
6,dxc3,d4c3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4P3/2p5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Black could play safe, here, but I was prepared to live a little dangerously."
7,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1P3/2p5/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 4,"Far out! The real deal, the 'full' Danish!"
8,cxb2,c3b2,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1P3/8/Pp3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,"I recall seeing this for the first time as a schoolboy.  The line seemed so fraught with possibilities, the way those bishops raked down towards Black's undeveloped position.  As it turns out, Black's lack of development leaves him a position flexible in defence."
9,Bxb2,c1b2,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1P3/8/PB3PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,"I recall seeing this for the first time as a schoolboy.

10,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/2B1P3/8/PB3PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 1 6,"!?  It is hard to know what's best here.  This seemed safe enough.  I was within an ace of playing the 'Schlechter Antidote' here, and possibly my opponent was hoping I would try it on.  After 5...d5!?  6.Bxd5 Nf6  7.Bxf7ch! Kxf7  8.Qxd8 ... Has White won Black's Queen?  Not... quite: 8...Bb4ch  9.Qd2 Bxd2  10.Nxd2 c5.  The game becomes a battle between Black's 3-1 majority on the Q-side and White's 4-2 majority on the K-side.  My copy of MCO10 indicates Black would have the better of it, but I'm not so sure."
11,Qf3,d1f3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/2B1P3/5Q2/PB3PPP/RN2K1NR b KQkq - 2 6,Seeking immediate attack in return for the material invested.  Time is of the essence.
12,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/2B1P3/5Q2/PB3PPP/RN2K1NR w KQkq - 3 7,"Blocks this attack.  If now 7.e5, ...Qe7 is a fine response, and 7...Bb4ch has its points as well."
13,Qb3,f3b3,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/2B1P3/1Q6/PB3PPP/RN2K1NR b KQkq - 4 7,Taking up the attack from a fresh angle.  In response to 7.e5 I had prepared this reply: 7...Bb5ch!?  with the idea [A] 8.Nd2 Qe7 or [B] 8.Kf1 d5!  9.exf6 dxc4  10.fxg7 Rg8  11.Nc3 Rxg7.
14,Bb4+,f8b4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/1bB1P3/1Q6/PB3PPP/RN2K1NR w KQkq - 5 8,"A tempo gainer.  After 8.Bc3 Bxc3ch or 8.Kf1 0-0, but instead..."
15,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/1bB1P3/1QN5/PB3PPP/R3K1NR b KQkq - 6 8,Even better than castling.  White's exiguous centre comes under heavy pressure from Black's pieces.
16,Qe7,d8e7,r1b1k2r/ppppqppp/2n2n2/8/1bB1P3/1QN5/PB3PPP/R3K1NR w KQkq - 7 9,Even better than castling.  White's exiguous centre comes under heavy pressure from Black's pieces.
17,Nge2,g1e2,r1b1k2r/ppppqppp/2n2n2/8/1bB1P3/1QN5/PB2NPPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 8 9,"Partly to block the e-file, and partly to protect c3 whist he castled, I expect.  But this turns out to be a serious error, on account of the extra protection now given the Black Bishop on b4.  Better would have been 9.Bd3."
18,Na5,c6a5,r1b1k2r/ppppqppp/5n2/n7/1bB1P3/1QN5/PB2NPPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 9 10,"[!] Black will now win a piece.  Already two pawns down, this further loss is serious for White."
19,Bxf7+,c4f7,r1b1k2r/ppppqBpp/5n2/n7/1b2P3/1QN5/PB2NPPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 0 10,"[!] His best response to contain the damage.  Black's game suffers some disruption.  Though Black has now a winning game, White does his best to make it difficult."
20,Kf8,e8f8,r1b2k1r/ppppqBpp/5n2/n7/1b2P3/1QN5/PB2NPPP/R3K2R w KQ - 1 11,[!] Not 10...Qxf7? 11.Qxb4ch etc.  but now the White Queen can no longer maintain its guard over the bishop.
21,Qc2,b3c2,r1b2k1r/ppppqBpp/5n2/n7/1b2P3/2N5/PBQ1NPPP/R3K2R b KQ - 2 11,Instead 11.Qa4 was worth a look.
22,Kxf7,f8f7,r1b4r/ppppqkpp/5n2/n7/1b2P3/2N5/PBQ1NPPP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 12,Takes with the King the sooner the rook can be hoiked out of the corner - castling 'long hand'.
23,O-O,e1g1,r1b4r/ppppqkpp/5n2/n7/1b2P3/2N5/PBQ1NPPP/R4RK1 b - - 1 12,"After a build-up phase, White's game does look the better developed.  But that +4 edge that Black has is hard to go past."
