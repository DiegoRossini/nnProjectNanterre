1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"An irregular opening played by myself. I usually play 1.e4, to create a game where sacrifices and beutiful combonations are aplenty. When I played 1.d4, I created a slow positional game, which most masters prefer.

I however, wanted to try something new, and played 1.d4."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"A popular reply by black. This offers blacks best chances at a defense to the queen pawn. Other moves, such as 1.. g6 or 1... d5, would allow a positional downside, where white wins on position. Examples are white taking control of the centre, or black lacking mobility."
