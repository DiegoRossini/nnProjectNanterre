1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi all. Here is a game - my first on GameKnot's new Slow Ladder - in which, thanks mainly to some less-than-accurate opening play on the part of my opponent, I launched a successful minor piece attack early in the game. As per the Ladder challenge rules (challenger plays Black, defender plays White) I had the White pieces, and I open with my usual queen pawn."
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"This is a transposing move, often seen played by Black. It is very flexible: after 2.c4, Black can transpose into a Nimzo-Indian with 2...Nf6, a Queen's Gambit Declined with 2...d5, a Benoni with 2...c5, or even a Dutch Defence with 2...f5. The main drawback is that it fails to take a hold of the e4-square, so White is not prevented from placing two pawns in the centre."
3,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Transposing back into a French Defence position. Black's most common move now is to follow up with the key French move 2...d5, striking back at White's centre."
4,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Instead, Black strikes from the wing, assaulting White's d-pawn rather than the e-pawn. This may transpose back into a main line French Defence position though."
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"I am not entirely convinced by Black's opening play. This seems now to have transposed into a sort of Open Sicilian variation - not great for me, as I have no experience with Sicilian lines. However, Black has not yet exchanged pawns on d4. I feel that Black's play is too conservative here."
6,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/3pp3/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"I am not entirely convinced by Black's opening play.

7,dxc5,d4c5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/3pp3/2P5/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"I stop Black from castling with this queen exchange, and take a lead in development. My light-squared bishop is now on a strong square, and cannot be chased away with ...d5 since Black's d-pawn no longer exists!"
8,dxc5,d6c5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"I stop Black from castling with this queen exchange, and take a lead in development. My light-squared bishop is now on a strong square, and cannot be chased away with ...d5 since Black's d-pawn no longer exists!"

12,Nd7,b8d7,r1bk1bnr/pp1n1ppp/4p3/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 2 7,"Developing a knight, but I cannot help but think that it would have been better-placed on c6. On d7. the knight controls less central space, and also blocks Black's light-squared bishop. I couldn't think why Black had not played 6...Nc6."
13,Bf4,c1f4,r1bk1bnr/pp1n1ppp/4p3/2p5/2B1PB2/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R b KQ - 3 7,"I continued with my plan - develop quickly, control powerful diagonals into Black's position (such as this f4-b8 diagonal) and build up a space advantage."
14,a5,a7a5,r1bk1bnr/1p1n1ppp/4p3/p1p5/2B1PB2/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R w KQ - 0 8,"(?) I feel that Black should definitely be developing here; I can see no possible benefits of 7...a5. Perhaps ...a6 followed by ...b5 and a queenside expansion with tempo, but then only when Black is more developed."

18,Ndf6,d7f6,r1bk1bnr/5ppp/1p2pn2/pBp5/4PB2/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 2 10,"...and moves an already developed piece again. Surely 9...Ngf6 would have been much, much better! I think Black needs to develop his understanding of opening principles here."
19,Ne5,f3e5,r1bk1bnr/5ppp/1p2pn2/pBp1N3/4PB2/2N5/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQ - 3 10,"Leaping into the attack. 10...Ke7 is Black's only way of preventing a knight fork on f7, winning the exchange (I had no high hopes of my knight escaping)."

I can feel quite proud of myself for this win...however, I still remind myself that it was more my opponent who lost, than me who won. I would be interested to see viewers' comments!"
