1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

After conceding that Low Draw against Dan in that K & P ending, in my return match against him I find myself in a rook ending a pawn up.  Dan ended up losing a pawn in the middlegame in order to beat off Old Matey who was loitering with intent on his kingside.  I found it really hard to make my advantage work and I had to watch out that Henry did not get stalemated on a8!  So, did I get out of that one?  Well, there is only one way to find out, my friends, READ ON!"
