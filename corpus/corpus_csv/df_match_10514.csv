1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"I like playing Nf3 because it has three important merits which I like:
1- it is flexible ... not committing myself to any pawn structure
2- directly gain two squares in the center d4 and e5
3- allows a faster king-side castling"
2,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 2,I guess my opponent likes flexibility too
3,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,"pushing a pawn to the center, clearing the way for the dark-squared bishop and threatening d5 which if not taken care of, will make the knight make an exhausting journey."
4,e6,e7e6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n1p3/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,defending d5 and clearing the way for the dark-squared bishop
5,e4,e2e4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n1p3/8/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,gaining a two-pawns center ... I think the center will be mine
6,d5,d7d5,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/3p4/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,countering my center superiority
7,e5,e4e5,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/3pP3/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,gaining space
8,g6,g7g6,r1bqkbnr/ppp2p1p/2n1p1p1/3pP3/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"want to fianchetto the dark-bishop. It is not a bad move. But, I don't like it because black needs to remove my two center pawns before he can make use of the long dark diagonal ... which will require time
and also this move weakens the f7 pawn a little"
9,c4,c2c4,r1bqkbnr/ppp2p1p/2n1p1p1/3pP3/2PP4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,attacking a center pawn from side ... this move also allows my queen access to the queen side
