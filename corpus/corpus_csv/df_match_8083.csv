1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Now finally here is Part 4.  I thought that this time I would round it off with a game against two masters just to prove a point that in general 2 pieces are certainly better than a rook.  We see Master Freddy in action again.  In fact, Freddy's opponent is a IM so a tough game in store for Freddy.  After white played 1. e4 Freddy starts off with another fav opening of his with the blacks - the Alekhine's Defense.  This move is Nf6."
