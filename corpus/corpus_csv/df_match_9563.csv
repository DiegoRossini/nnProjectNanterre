1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hello everyone and thank you for giving up a few moments to see this annotated game :) This was a game i played in simultaneous chess against my chess teacher in chess club (i was not playing simultaneoulsly if you are wondering that). In a real game, my teacher would play as white, but he was so confident about winning all the games, he put himself as black in all the games. I wrote down the moves against my teacher, and decided to annotate it here."
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"If you are an intermediate player, you might have noticed that this is the French Defence. This used to be my favorate opening, but i gave up on it recently. while looking at the other games, i noticed that my tutor played different openings against all of us (either it was the Sicilian, Alkaline Defence or the French Defence."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Here i wondered what would be a sensible variation to play. Maybe the Exchange Variation because of his strong rating, but i have not really learnt it."

5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"I decided to play the Winewar Variation (i think i spelt it wrong) because it defends the pawn on e4 effectively, and because it is favoured by GMs."
6,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/1b1PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"This caused me some trouble. i have not seen this before. i knew that my e-pawn was in trouble, and that i risk doubling up my pawns."
7,Nge2,g1e2,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/1b1PP3/2N5/PPP1NPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 4,"probobly not the best move, but i chose it because:

1. it develops the knight.
2. if Bxc3, Nxc3 and my e-pawn is defended.
3. it stops my pawns from doubling up."
8,dxe4,d5e4,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/1b1Pp3/2N5/PPP1NPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"i saw this coming, but it did not bother me too much. my simple plan was to play 5. a3 Ba5 16. b4 Bb6 17. Nxe4."
9,a3,a2a3,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/1b1Pp3/P1N5/1PP1NPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,damn! i did not see that Nf6 could simply be played to defend. it is never good to be a center pawn down against a Grade 189 chess teacher :)
10,Bxc3+,b4c3,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/3Pp3/P1b5/1PP1NPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,damn! i did not see that Nf6 could simply be played to defend. it is never good to be a center pawn down against a Grade 189 chess teacher :)

13,Be3,c1e3,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/8/3Pp3/P1N1B3/1PP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 2 7,can't remember why i played it. I think it was because i did not want white to play Nc6 and put pressure on the pawn. i think i played it so Nc6 won't bother me too much.
