1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"coaching match... a very close match which demonstrates the strength of linked pawns vs loose pawns in an endgame... with each move, i will also post the gamenotes as discussed during the game as an added insight (they will be in these <<>> things), though there are one or two occasions where i made some errors of judgement, and only with the benefit of hindsight was i able to see how silly i sounded, especially when i predict white's collapse!

<<<(Taufiq) My ""normal"" opening.. >>>"
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"not my usual opening, in fact i never play e5. currently i'd most likely play caro-kann (c6), though i often play sicilian (c5) or french (e6) also... but this, i am led to believe, is a better opening for training purposes...

<<<(Tugger) e4 is my usual opening too... normally, i'd reply with c5, as i belive it to be blacks strongest defence, but i will play e5, as i'm told it provides a better chance to learn. i don't know if you've discovered it yet, but the database is an excellent tool for learning openings, take the link under 'resign' and have a look... it can make things awkward though, too, as if your opponent moves off-book quickly, you can find yourself lost in an unfamiliar opening...>>>"
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"<<<(Taufiq) Yes, I've allready looked to the Game DB, and I find it very helpfull !

Now, the attack with my horse forces you to cover your e-pawn.. >>>"
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"<<<(Tugger) Indeed... i'm not comfortable playing Nf6 and attacking your e-pawn too, and a gambit isn't really appropriate! i might look into f5 in the future, i like gambits! they can provide huge development advantages that far outweigh the pawn loss... for now though i'll stick with Nc6...>>>

of course, i meant the gambit wasn't appropriate for black, Nf6 could encourage the gambit (Nxf7) for white, which i play often."
5,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 3,"<<<(Taufiq) ""normal"" protection for my e-pawn.. >>>"
6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 4 4,"four knights...

<<<(Tugger) I believe it is best for black to ensure there is a knight-balance, ie my position would be weaker if you had more knights developed early on... so Nf6 is the natural move... your opening is sound as you are still forcing me to respond, as opposed to me making you play...>>>"
7,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1B2p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 5 4,"<<<(Taufiq) In this case, I would dare to exchange my bishop for your knight, cause it weakens your protection for your King..>>>"
8,Nd4,c6d4,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/1B2p3/3nP3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 6 5,"i'm pretty sure this move is sound. i have abandoned my pawn on e5, but this would be a temporary loss, as 5... Qe7 attacks knight and exerts yet more pressure on the e4 pawn, or i could even reclaim the e4 pawn immediately, since my knight on d4 stops white pinning the knight (and yes, despite white's knight on e5, my knight would be pinned if white's queen safely occupied e2, since the discovered check Nc6  would be devastating). 

<<<(Tugger) Now, although this move loses the protection of my e-pawn, it would most certainly be a temporary loss, i would reclaim the pawn within a couple more moves, while gaining a positional advantage, at least i think... i also attack your bishop and knight, and i have brought my knight into a central position. you can of course take him, but then when i reclaim, your other knight is attacked... while this does not win any material, it hands the initative to me... i can now begin to build up a counter-attackâ€¦>>>"
9,Be2,b5e2,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/3nP3/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 7 5,"<<<(Taufiq) Yes, VERY nice move ! Most people counter 4.Bb5 with 4. ... a6 But as you say, 4. ... Nd4 is most likely a better thing to do.. I'll protect my f-knight again with my bishop..>>>

4... a6 would be a blunder, since the bishop/knight trade would leave black a pawn down and an inferior pawn structure. and white moving his bishop twice in the opening means black has a development advantage."
10,Nxf3+,d4f3,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/2N2n2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"<<<(Tugger) It was too late to play a6, as this is a prevention move... after Bxc6, i have to reclaim with a pawn, messing up my structure... and you would be able to claim my e-pawn for free... a clear advantage to you...

now i have the choice out of bishop and knight... normally, i'd go bishop, but this would simply aid your development after the queen takes... Nxf3  will obviously respond Bxf3... while you may have more pieces developed, i will still be able to hold the initiative with 6. Bb4, which threatens your e-pawn and develops my bishop...>>>"

12,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/2b1p3/4P3/2N2B2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 7,"steal the a7-g1 diagonal before white can develop his bishop.

<<<(Tugger) There was an oversight on my part, though... Bb4 does not threaten your e-pawn, as the bishop now protects it as well as the knight... therefore, instead i shall play Bc5, as this gains the g1-a7 diagonal before you can develop your black bishop...>>>

just one of the many times i'll look a bit silly, but that's what was said, and it aids the insight to the game to see what was discussed at the time."
