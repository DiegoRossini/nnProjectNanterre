1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,And here we go. Pirc Alert!
2,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,And here we go. Pirc Alert!
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,First unusal move by white. Standard would have been Nc3. So my opponent goes into a more defensive style.
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p1n2/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,First unusal move by white. Standard would have been Nc3. So my opponent goes into a more defensive style.
5,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p1n2/8/3PP3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 3,First unusal move by white. Standard would have been Nc3. So my opponent goes into a more defensive style.
6,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 4,? A more or less useless move at this stage. Seems like someone is panicing? Weekens kingsafty.
7,h3,h2h3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/3B3P/PPP2PP1/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 4,? A more or less useless move at this stage. Seems like someone is panicing? Weekens kingsafty.
8,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP3/3B3P/PPP2PP1/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 5,Still no move to prepare e5 (which will follow right away!). Prepares fianchetto for the blacksquared bishop. Perhaps my opponent was planning on Bb2 to build up pressure on the diagonal.
9,b3,b2b3,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP3/1P1B3P/P1P2PP1/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,Still no move to prepare e5 (which will follow right away!). Prepares fianchetto for the blacksquared bishop. Perhaps my opponent was planning on Bb2 to build up pressure on the diagonal.
10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP3/1P1B3P/P1P2PP1/RNBQK1NR w KQ - 1 6,"A not well prepared and early e5. The move that is often kind of a decision in the game...
Leaves the d4 pawn weak (in addition to g2)"
11,e5,e4e5,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/4P3/3P4/1P1B3P/P1P2PP1/RNBQK1NR b KQ - 0 6,"A not well prepared and early e5. The move that is often kind of a decision in the game...

12,Nd5,f6d5,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p2p1/3nP3/3P4/1P1B3P/P1P2PP1/RNBQK1NR w KQ - 1 7,Since I had to go somewhere and due to the lacking Sc3 my knight gets a cosy home at d5. Perhaps xe5 would have been the better decision. Also the Bishop is locking on d4 and a1
13,a4,a2a4,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p2p1/3nP3/P2P4/1P1B3P/2P2PP1/RNBQK1NR b KQ - 0 7,?? what is he planning to do? This gives away a pawn
14,dxe5,d6e5,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/6p1/3np3/P2P4/1P1B3P/2P2PP1/RNBQK1NR w KQ - 0 8,After the exchange I'm a pawn up my Bishop is attacking the rook!
15,dxe5,d4e5,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/6p1/3nP3/P7/1P1B3P/2P2PP1/RNBQK1NR b KQ - 0 8,After the exchange I'm a pawn up my Bishop is attacking the rook!

17,Ra3,a1a3,rnbq1rk1/ppp1pp1p/6p1/3nb3/P7/RP1B3P/2P2PP1/1NBQK1NR b K - 1 9,Only other option is a2 which would provoke Nc3 (which still would have needed to be prepared)
18,Qd6,d8d6,rnb2rk1/ppp1pp1p/3q2p1/3nb3/P7/RP1B3P/2P2PP1/1NBQK1NR w K - 2 10,Letting the Queen join the attack.
19,Bc4,d3c4,rnb2rk1/ppp1pp1p/3q2p1/3nb3/P1B5/RP5P/2P2PP1/1NBQK1NR b K - 3 10,Another move with the bishop... just one white minor piece has moved!  (although the blacksquared bishop shows his influence already:))
20,Qb4+,d6b4,rnb2rk1/ppp1pp1p/6p1/3nb3/PqB5/RP5P/2P2PP1/1NBQK1NR w K - 4 11,Building up preassure. Not sure if it is the best move for black.
21,Bd2,c1d2,rnb2rk1/ppp1pp1p/6p1/3nb3/PqB5/RP5P/2PB1PP1/1N1QK1NR b K - 5 11,Natural.
22,Nc3,d5c3,rnb2rk1/ppp1pp1p/6p1/4b3/PqB5/RPn4P/2PB1PP1/1N1QK1NR w K - 6 12,"Seems natural, but:?? Fritz notes: Qf3! This attacks the knight(!) and strenghens the preassure on F7. And the worst thing about it: Me as Black would have no idea what to do about the knight... 
12 ... Nc6 does not help.. Ne2 would be the next step... So it really starts to get tricky"
23,Bxc3,d2c3,rnb2rk1/ppp1pp1p/6p1/4b3/PqB5/RPB4P/2P2PP1/1N1QK1NR b K - 0 12,Fortunatly for myself white decided on Bxc3
24,Bxc3+,e5c3,rnb2rk1/ppp1pp1p/6p1/8/PqB5/RPb4P/2P2PP1/1N1QK1NR w K - 0 13,"? Sacrificing a whole rook. Nxc3 woud at least try to contain the dammage.
From here on the game was more or less won, but how is it said:
The hardest thing is winning a won game."
