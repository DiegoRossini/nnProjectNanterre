1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I seen that and thought he's probably going to try scholars mate
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I did that just in case he tries D4
3,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,just as expected Bc4to attack the F7 square
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 3,so I brought my knight out so if he tried move Queen to F3 I would go Ne5 to attack both queen and bishop and protect the mating square
5,Qh5,d1h5,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p4Q/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 3 3,but instead moves his Queen to H5 and then try and mate me on the F7 square
6,e6,e7e6,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p4Q/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 0 4,I went to E6 to protect the C5 Pawn but also stop checkmate
7,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p4Q/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 1 4,I then thought whilst his queen is out I would start attacking it
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/2p4Q/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 2 5,I then thought whilst his queen is out I would start attacking it
9,Qf3,h5f3,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/2p5/2B1P3/2N2Q2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 3 5,I attack it with the other Knight
10,Ne5,c6e5,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p1n3/2B1P3/2N2Q2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 4 6,I attack it with the other Knight
11,Qd3,f3d3,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p1n3/2B1P3/2NQ4/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 5 6,I was suprised with this as I thought he would probably move it to E2
12,Nxd3+,e5d3,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/2B1P3/2Nn4/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 0 7,I then took the Queen which then my opponent resigned
