3,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/4P3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Steinitz attack..I play this to gain some space
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/4p1p1/4P3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,g6 with the intention the fianchetto the bishop and attack my advanced pawn
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/4p1p1/4P3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,d4 to protect the pawn after the intended bg7 and further gain space.
6,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk1nr/pppp1pbp/4p1p1/4P3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,bg7 came anyway even though the diagonal is blunted by the pawns and i just developed my knight
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk1nr/pppp1pbp/4p1p1/4P3/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,bg7 came anyway even though the diagonal is blunted by the pawns and i just developed my knight
8,Ne7,g8e7,rnbqk2r/ppppnpbp/4p1p1/4P3/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 3 5,Ed developed his knight as well with thoughts of coming to either d5 or f5 in the future
9,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqk2r/ppppnpbp/4p1p1/4P3/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 4 5,bishop d3 to develop and put a bishop on a good diagonal ....I anticipated kingside castling since his queenside pieces are undeveloped.
10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppppnpbp/4p1p1/4P3/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 5 6,Surely enough he castled kingside.perhaps a move like d6 or nc6 (to potentially castle queenside after getting the light square bishop out somehow )although perhaps a bit slow..
11,Ng5,f3g5,rnbq1rk1/ppppnpbp/4p1p1/4P1N1/3P4/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQ - 6 6,ng5 ...i was already had thoughts about sacking it here...I noticed the king might be vulnerable to attack especially if the H file opens ...I thought it was important to get rid of the h7 pawn
12,f6,f7f6,rnbq1rk1/ppppn1bp/4ppp1/4P1N1/3P4/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 0 7,f6 to try to chase knight away.
13,exf6,e5f6,rnbq1rk1/ppppn1bp/4pPp1/6N1/3P4/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQ - 0 7,After the exchanges I go for it and make my unsound sack with hopes of a bright game.
14,Bxf6,g7f6,rnbq1rk1/ppppn2p/4pbp1/6N1/3P4/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 0 8,After the exchanges I go for it and make my unsound sack with hopes of a bright game.
15,Nxh7,g5h7,rnbq1rk1/ppppn2N/4pbp1/8/3P4/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQ - 0 8,After the exchanges I go for it and make my unsound sack with hopes of a bright game.
16,Kxh7,g8h7,rnbq1r2/ppppn2k/4pbp1/8/3P4/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 0 9,I push h4 immediately to try to open the h file as soon as possible for my rook and possibly form a battery with my queen...the 2 bishops already support my attack so I dont need to move them anywhere
17,h4,h2h4,rnbq1r2/ppppn2k/4pbp1/8/3P3P/3B4/PPP2PP1/RNBQK2R b KQ - 0 9,I push h4 immediately to try to open the h file as soon as possible for my rook and possibly form a battery with my queen...the 2 bishops already support my attack so I dont need to move them anywhere
18,Kg7,h7g7,rnbq1r2/ppppn1k1/4pbp1/8/3P3P/3B4/PPP2PP1/RNBQK2R w KQ - 1 10,Ed moves his king off the file.
19,h5,h4h5,rnbq1r2/ppppn1k1/4pbp1/7P/3P4/3B4/PPP2PP1/RNBQK2R b KQ - 0 10,h5 to open the file up hopefully..
20,Rh8,f8h8,rnbq3r/ppppn1k1/4pbp1/7P/3P4/3B4/PPP2PP1/RNBQK2R w KQ - 1 11,rh8 so I cannot take on g6 as that would loose rook and queen..
21,Qg4,d1g4,rnbq3r/ppppn1k1/4pbp1/7P/3P2Q1/3B4/PPP2PP1/RNB1K2R b KQ - 2 11,Qg4 where i was hoping to put pressure on g6 and also have my queen on the g file where i thought it might be usefull..
22,Qe8,d8e8,rnb1q2r/ppppn1k1/4pbp1/7P/3P2Q1/3B4/PPP2PP1/RNB1K2R w KQ - 3 12,Qe8 to strengthen the g6....
23,Nd2,b1d2,rnb1q2r/ppppn1k1/4pbp1/7P/3P2Q1/3B4/PPPN1PP1/R1B1K2R b KQ - 4 12,After long thinking I knew I needed to bring move pieces to the attack....I already intended to bring the the knight to either e4 or f3 ...it temporary blunts my dark square bishop but if nc3 then d5 and i could no longer maneuver it to a good square quickly.
24,d6,d7d6,rnb1q2r/ppp1n1k1/3ppbp1/7P/3P2Q1/3B4/PPPN1PP1/R1B1K2R w KQ - 0 13,d6 getting ready to push e5 with an attack on my queen...
25,h6+,h5h6,rnb1q2r/ppp1n1k1/3ppbpP/8/3P2Q1/3B4/PPPN1PP1/R1B1K2R b KQ - 0 13,h6+ and i was hoping that the pawn would either turn into a dangerous passed pawn or at least create a pivit square on g7 at some point for my pieces..it also cuts off squares for the king to run to..
26,Rxh6,h8h6,rnb1q3/ppp1n1k1/3ppbpr/8/3P2Q1/3B4/PPPN1PP1/R1B1K2R w KQ - 0 14,ed takes the pawn offering a rook exchange which i decided to take because if say rg1 then rh4 threatning my queen with tempo and also the d4 pawn at least...I had to be fast with my attack
