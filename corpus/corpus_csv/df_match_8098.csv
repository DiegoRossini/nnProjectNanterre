1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Me again!  After obtaining a high draw I end up chalking up a welcome victory against a 1300+ player.  You are wondering what do the two buses have to do with a game of chess.  Answer - everything.  After 6 months of failing to deliver checkmate I end up delivering two within a few days of one another, one on the Dentist which was annotated as ""Learning from the Master Mater"" and now this one!  Usually I end up delivering mate with Glenda or a castle, but this time it is a mere steed!

This is in fact part of Master Freddy's tournament, the Annotation's project and I now have 3 points out of 6 games in it.  Anyhow, on with the game and we pick up the action on move 8."
