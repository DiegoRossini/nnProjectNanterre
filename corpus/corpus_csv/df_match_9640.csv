Odd that I mention the endgame when we've barely left the opening.  I don't think there's any clear demarcation between phases, but as pieces are traded off, threats against the king are reduced and play begins to revolve around pawn promotions instead of direct mates.  In this case, white is out of threats against black and black's king can start eyeing the path to the center of the board."
