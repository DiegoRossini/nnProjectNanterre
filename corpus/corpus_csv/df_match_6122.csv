He is a worse chess player then I am, give him a bit of material advance:D:D I wanted his bishop, because if he doesn't play Nxe5 or Ng5, after 7... a4 8.Bd5 attacking my rook, c6 would have won a bishop."

( I lied, I don't like horses. HAHAHAAA) BUT!!! It was also a mistake!!! After Bishop to g5, I would have been forced to move my Knight on f6 and he could have played Nd5# Or just simply Nd5# I must have told him the truth:D:D:D"
