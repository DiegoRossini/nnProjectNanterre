1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,The English Opening. I wanted to try something different from my usual 1.e4
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"And an unusual reply! This is the Caro-Kann Defense, usual played after 1. e4 but not unknown as a response to the English. Jun Zhao played it twice with Black in the Asia Championship in 2007 and drew both games after 17 and 8 moves!"
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Another unusal choice, taking us away from the English and into the Dutch."

With this in mind I think I would have played 9. ... c5, looking to counter the queen side attack with gaining control of the centre. Black is short of space and sooner rather than later he needs to open the cage door."
