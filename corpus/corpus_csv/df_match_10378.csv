1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is an OTB game I played recently, which I lost in brutal fashion. In the critical position both players actually thought that Black has the advantage! First words of White player after the game were ""I was lost"", and Black just kept saying ""I totally underestimated the attack"". It was pretty funny I guess :) This annotation will show that the position was in fact about even but it was Black who needed to be careful. I am annotating the game partly as a way to fully ""digest"" this loss and hopefully gain some useful learning points for myself, and partly to amuse GK population, especially those that do not play OTB chess (those who do probably have their own horror stories) :) So, lets have fun!"
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"My faithful Sicilian :) ---  I was pretty shocked when I achieved only 2,5 points out of 6 Black Sicilian games played during the summer, with zero (!?) wins in open Sicilian (2 wins against Grand Prix Attack, 1 draw, 3 losses) and was saved from negative overall score with Black only by 2 straight wins in QGD at the end of the second tournament... Maybe I am getting old? Should I start playing something safer, like Caro-Kann? Time will tell probably... :)"

I never played against this move, but the idea is very typical and not hard to spot - attack on h7 after Black castles. If White later plays Be4 (intending to take on d5) it can be interpreted as a waste of time compared to normal Bc4. The main problem with 7.Bd3 is that it does not pressure Black at all at this moment, so it can be safely said that Black already has full equality."

I didn't yet consider 7...Ndb4; 8.Be4, d5; 9. ed6, Bd6 or 7...Bb4; 8.Bd2, Nf4. Both variations give equality, but Black already has that so I felt that there is no need to be aggressive this early."

The reason is that after 8.0-0, Ndb4 White can't play 9.Be4 anymore due to 9...d5. Also it allows White to set up his intended pressure on b1-h7 diagonal."

I wanted to allow White to take on d6 ""with gain of tempi"", which would give him an isolated d pawn. This is pretty typical in this kind of positions, and I like playing against the isolani :) the position is equal in any case, this is just personal preference."
