My belief, rightly or wrongly is that your e4 pawn is more difficult to defend than my e5 pawn. If you look at this position in a simple way the following is true. the weak pawns are c2/c7, f2/f7, e4/e5. Pretty much the same strengths and weaknesses. The real difference is that I can castle long getting my King to safety and developing my Q rook. I can get my other rook to the centre easily enough. You cannot get your K to safety without trapping a rook or compromising your position in some manner. These are probably the reasons why Black doesn't play this sort of stuff at the highest levels."

Your Nh6-g4 manouevre is the only way to get play and you need to get your R out via h6. I thought 9....h6 10.h4 (if 10h3 h4 11.Bh2 Bxf2) Nh6. Forcing h4 means that there is one less pawn defending the B on g3. This doesn't mean much right now but it allows tactics based on a future Bg4 hitting the R on d1 then the N on h6 goes to f5 hitting the B on g3. If the N can take the B on g3 then my pawn structure will be pawns on g2,g3,h4 which means your pawn on e4 is a passed pawn. look at this possible line. 9...h5 10.h4 Nh6 11.a3 Bg4 12.Nge2 e3 13.fxe3 Bxe3  14.Kb1 Nf5 and black has a bit of play.
