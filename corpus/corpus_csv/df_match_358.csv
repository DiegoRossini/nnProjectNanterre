It would have been more wise for black to remove a defender by taking the c1 bishop with either the d3N or the a3B.  Note that Bxe2# continues to be an unqualified blunder, although it is debatable whether Bxe2# would be better or worse then Qxd2, since Black really only manages to trade his queen for a pawn and manages to go down -18 points in material as a consequence.
