1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Queen's Pawn is my favored opening with white
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Heading for an Indian Defense perhaps
3,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Normally I would 2. c4 here for the Queen's Pawn Gambit but I decided to play away from my strength perhaps finding our way into a French
4,Qf6,d8f6,rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/4pq2/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,Out comes the Queen which is generally frowned upon
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/4pq2/8/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 3,Out of anything with which I'm familiar I tried to apply the strategy that my mentor (OldGus here at GameKnot) suggests. Make developing moves that put pieces in good positions
6,d5,d7d5,rnb1kbnr/ppp2ppp/4pq2/3p4/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,Now looking French like
7,Bd3,f1d3,rnb1kbnr/ppp2ppp/4pq2/3p4/3PP3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,I'm thinking about eventuall Bg5 and trapping the queen or forcing a lot of queen defensive moves
8,Ne7,g8e7,rnb1kb1r/ppp1nppp/4pq2/3p4/3PP3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,"My opponent cuts off all retreating squares making my life easier. It did take me some time to figure out 5. Bg5 was no longer the best move. If you see a good move, always look around and try and fine one better."
9,e5,e4e5,rnb1kb1r/ppp1nppp/4pq2/3pP3/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,Trapping the queen
10,Qxf3,f6f3,rnb1kb1r/ppp1nppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/3B1q2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,Making the best of a bad situation
11,Qxf3,d1f3,rnb1kb1r/ppp1nppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/3B1Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 6,Already with eyes towards a king side attack
12,g6,g7g6,rnb1kb1r/ppp1np1p/4p1p1/3pP3/3P4/3B1Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 7,Preparing to fianchetto and castle. The Bishop on g7 looks weak to me because of my strong pawn structure blocking the diagonal
13,Bg5,c1g5,rnb1kb1r/ppp1np1p/4p1p1/3pP1B1/3P4/3B1Q2/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R b KQkq - 1 7,Development and threatening 8. Bxe7 preventing castling
14,Nec6,e7c6,rnb1kb1r/ppp2p1p/2n1p1p1/3pP1B1/3P4/3B1Q2/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R w KQkq - 2 8,A second knight move aiming for Nb4 possibly
15,Bb5,d3b5,rnb1kb1r/ppp2p1p/2n1p1p1/1B1pP1B1/3P4/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R b KQkq - 3 8,Preventing the knight from making headway
16,Bd7,c8d7,rn2kb1r/pppb1p1p/2n1p1p1/1B1pP1B1/3P4/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R w KQkq - 4 9,Relieving the pin
17,Nc3,b1c3,rn2kb1r/pppb1p1p/2n1p1p1/1B1pP1B1/3P4/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 5 9,Just getting my pieces out. I didn't feel an urgency to castle at this point
18,Nb4,c6b4,rn2kb1r/pppb1p1p/4p1p1/1B1pP1B1/1n1P4/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 6 10,Threatening 10. Nxc2 winning the rook with a pin
19,O-O-O,e1c1,rn2kb1r/pppb1p1p/4p1p1/1B1pP1B1/1n1P4/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b kq - 7 10,Preventing the pin. I went long side castle here because my Bishop on g5 prevents my opponent from long side castling and my king side attack is already rolling
20,Bxb5,d7b5,rn2kb1r/ppp2p1p/4p1p1/1b1pP1B1/1n1P4/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/2KR3R w kq - 0 11,Hoping to win a pawn with 11. Nxb5 Nxa2+ but not seeing the continuation I think
