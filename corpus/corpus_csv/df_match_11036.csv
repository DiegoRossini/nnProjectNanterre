6,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1p1p/4pnp1/8/3P4/4BN2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,Black continues the main line of the kings indian planning to bring the bishop to g7 giving the king a large amount of protection when castled.
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1p1p/4pnp1/8/3P4/2N1BN2/PPP1PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"Continues development, again I would play c4, and plan perhaps to set up an assault on the queenside."
8,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/pppp1pbp/4pnp1/8/3P4/2N1BN2/PPP1PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,"A second move for the bishop, against opening principles, although it moves the bishop to a more natural square, and frees whites position."
9,Bg5,e3g5,rnbqk2r/pppp1pbp/4pnp1/6B1/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 3 5,"A second move for the bishop, against opening principles, although it moves the bishop to a more natural square, and frees whites position."
10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pppp1pbp/4pnp1/6B1/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 4 6,"White is now set up to push the e-pawn to get the pawn centre, black could have prevented this with a pre-emptive d5. However one of the tactics of the kings indian defence is to encourage white to over expand, then counter-attack the over stretched pieces. For this reason black castles to safety, and can now think about developing the queenside."
11,e4,e2e4,rnbq1rk1/pppp1pbp/4pnp1/6B1/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 6,Grabs the pawn centre
12,d6,d7d6,rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/3ppnp1/6B1/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 7,"Doesn't assult the centre yet, black decides to bide his time and let white over commit. This move releases the bishop to d7, however I feel b6 to fianchetto the bishop to b7, or c6 to support the d-pawn in an advance to d5, would have been better. Nothing wrong with the played move though."
13,Bd3,f1d3,rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/3ppnp1/6B1/3PP3/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 1 7,"Played to unbreak the pin on the knight. White can either retreat or capture the knight. My instinct would be to retreat, as I value the bishop over the knight, and I see no precise tactic to win material or position by taking the knight. Also I feel black has weakened his king by playing the move, and the pawn structure in front of the black king is already weak from the early fianchetto, white could take advantage of this by keeping the bishop attacking the now weak h-pawn."
14,h6,h7h6,rnbq1rk1/ppp2pb1/3ppnpp/6B1/3PP3/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 8,"Played to unbreak the pin on the knight. White can either retreat or capture the knight.

15,Bxf6,g5f6,rnbq1rk1/ppp2pb1/3ppBpp/8/3PP3/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 8,"But white captures the knight, possibly he considers himself to be more developed than black, so can start thinking of a kingside assault, however losing the black square bishop isn't a good way to start this kind of attack."
16,Bxf6,g7f6,rnbq1rk1/ppp2p2/3ppbpp/8/3PP3/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 9,"Black finally attacks the centre, and releases his white squared bishop, however he has to be careful, as generally the more developed player benefits from open lines."
17,O-O,e1g1,rnbq1rk1/ppp2p2/3ppbpp/8/3PP3/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 9,"Black finally attacks the centre, and releases his white squared bishop, however he has to be careful, as generally the more developed player benefits from open lines."

19,d5,d4d5,rnbq1rk1/ppp2p2/3p1bpp/3Pp3/4P3/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 10,"However he needn't worry as white chooses to close the centre. This choice would be more logical if white had a pawn standing on c4, to protect the d-pawn, however as he doesn't the overextended pawn may become a weakness"
20,Nd7,b8d7,r1bq1rk1/pppn1p2/3p1bpp/3Pp3/4P3/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 1 11,"Black now looks to take advantage of the overstretched white centre, by threatening to move his knight into c5, a strong outpost for the knight, and if not then the knight is well positioned to swing over to the kingside to support an attack or defend."
21,Qd2,d1d2,r1bq1rk1/pppn1p2/3p1bpp/3Pp3/4P3/2NB1N2/PPPQ1PPP/R4RK1 b - - 2 11,Attacks the weak h6 pawn
22,Bg7,f6g7,r1bq1rk1/pppn1pb1/3p2pp/3Pp3/4P3/2NB1N2/PPPQ1PPP/R4RK1 w - - 3 12,"Defends the pawn, this is better than moving the king forward as now the knight has a square to move to on the kingside"
23,g3,g2g3,r1bq1rk1/pppn1pb1/3p2pp/3Pp3/4P3/2NB1NP1/PPPQ1P1P/R4RK1 b - - 0 12,"A surprising move, and one that fundamentally weakens the king, with no apparent advantage to doing so as white cannot put a bishop on g2. It could be to give the knight a square to retreat to if white plays Nh4, however again there is no advantage to playing this."
24,Nf6,d7f6,r1bq1rk1/ppp2pb1/3p1npp/3Pp3/4P3/2NB1NP1/PPPQ1P1P/R4RK1 w - - 1 13,"Black continues to organise his forces, and his position, though initially weaker now looks to be stronger.
1) Whites centre pawns are overextended, and c6 would be problematic
2) The pawn structure in front of both kings is weak, however black is stronger as he has more pieces to defend it and no obvious way in. White however has a major white square weakness, and will need to be careful
3) Whites bishop is blocked in, and has little mobility, blacks c8 bishop looks far more active, and can easily move to attack the white position"
25,h4,h2h4,r1bq1rk1/ppp2pb1/3p1npp/3Pp3/4P2P/2NB1NP1/PPPQ1P2/R4RK1 b - - 0 13,"It now looks like white hopes for a kingside attack, and wants to open blacks kingside with pawn exchanges. This is a big mistake, and will lead to his downfall, black will now use the weak white squares to attack whites king before white gets any chance to lead an attack"
26,Bg4,c8g4,r2q1rk1/ppp2pb1/3p1npp/3Pp3/4P1bP/2NB1NP1/PPPQ1P2/R4RK1 w - - 1 14,"Attacking the undefended knight. Also playable is Bh3, moving in behind the advanced pawns"
