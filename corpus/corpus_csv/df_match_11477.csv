1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Another queen's pawn opening.  These are getting popular.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I like Benoni against queen's pawn for a stronger player.
3,dxc5,d4c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2P5/8/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,White takes the gambit.
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2P5/8/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,I prepare to take the center and threaten the lead white c pawn.
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2P5/8/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"No way to protect the c pawn, so white develops."
6,Bxc5,f8c5,rnbqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2b5/8/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,This move eliminates the c pawn and is the first step towards attacking the f2 square.
7,e4,e2e4,rnbqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2b5/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,Attacking the e pawn and lining up to attack f2.
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2b5/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,Attacking the e pawn and lining up to attack f2.
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2b5/4P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,Defending the e pawn.
10,Ng4,f6g4,rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2b5/4P1n1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 3 6,The only reasonable response to this is Be3 which loses a pawn.
11,Be3,c1e3,rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2b5/4P1n1/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 4 6,"I chose to attack first with the knight instead of the bishop for two reasons.  First, the bishop is easier to rescue when it eventually gets overwhelmed.  Second, with white's dark bishop gone, my dark bishop becomes more valuable."
12,Nxe3,g4e3,rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2b5/4P3/2N1nN2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"I chose to attack first with the knight instead of the bishop for two reasons.  First, the bishop is easier to rescue when it eventually gets overwhelmed.  Second, with white's dark bishop gone, my dark bishop becomes more valuable."
13,fxe3,f2e3,rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2b5/4P3/2N1PN2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"The beauty of this position is that as long as I can maintain it, white can't castle."
14,Bxe3,c5e3,rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/2N1bN2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,"The beauty of this position is that as long as I can maintain it, white can't castle."
15,Qd3,d1d3,rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/2NQbN2/PPP3PP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 1 8,"Attack the bishop, defend the knight."
16,Qb6,d8b6,rnb1k2r/pp1p1ppp/1q2p3/8/4P3/2NQbN2/PPP3PP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 2 9,"Attack the b pawn, defend the bishop.  This also opens up Bf2 , robbing white of the ability to castle."
17,g3,g2g3,rnb1k2r/pp1p1ppp/1q2p3/8/4P3/2NQbNP1/PPP4P/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 9,Preparing the fiachetto the bishop.
18,d6,d7d6,rnb1k2r/pp3ppp/1q1pp3/8/4P3/2NQbNP1/PPP4P/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 10,"At this point, I had a problem.  I had this great queen-bishop combo lined up, but with *nothing* to support it.  I had to break my other bishop free and get my knight into the game.  My goal was to get my bishop on c6 and my knight on d7.  I strongly considered d5 here, taking the material loss to gain position, but I didn't like the freedom it left the white e/d pawn.  d6 does just as much to free my pieces, and doesn't give away material or position."
19,Qb5+,d3b5,rnb1k2r/pp3ppp/1q1pp3/1Q6/4P3/2N1bNP1/PPP4P/R3KB1R b KQkq - 1 10,Clearly an attempt to exchange queens.  Fine by me.
20,Nd7,b8d7,r1b1k2r/pp1n1ppp/1q1pp3/1Q6/4P3/2N1bNP1/PPP4P/R3KB1R w KQkq - 2 11,"My first thought was Bd7, protecting the king and challenging the queen.  The problem is that if white is only looking to exchange queens (which is the only thing that makes sense), then Qxb6 begets axb6, leaving me with doubled pawns on the b rank.
I next considered Qc6, which has the same effect, but leaves me with an intact pawn structure.  The problem with this move, though, is that it leaves my queen-side pawns badly underrepresented, and it doesn't do any actual development.
Finally I came to Nd6, which defends my king and queen but doesn't challenge the white queen.  Now the effect of Qxb6 is Nxb6, leaving me well balanced and better developed.  As an added bonus, if white gets cold feet about the trade, I have the following possibility:
11. ... Bf2 
12. Ke2 Qe3 
13. Kd1 Qe1  
At worst, it gives white something more to worry about."
21,Qxb6,b5b6,r1b1k2r/pp1n1ppp/1Q1pp3/8/4P3/2N1bNP1/PPP4P/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 11,"As expected, white trades queens to try to get my bishop out of his hair."
22,Nxb6,d7b6,r1b1k2r/pp3ppp/1n1pp3/8/4P3/2N1bNP1/PPP4P/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 12,"Because I defended with my knight instead of my light bishop, I can continue to protect my dark bishop and broaden the attack with Nc4.  His only real chance to castle is to also trade bishops with Bb5 ."
23,Rd1,a1d1,r1b1k2r/pp3ppp/1n1pp3/8/4P3/2N1bNP1/PPP4P/3RKB1R b Kkq - 1 12,"White has now forfeited his queen-side castle, which means I only have to hold my bishop to the g1-a7 diagonal."
