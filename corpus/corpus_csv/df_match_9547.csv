1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,My opponent annotates a large number of games and I would be interested to see what he thought of this as I have enjoyed a number of his annotations.
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,The tarrasch. I played this on the grounds it's the variation i least like to play against when I am black in a french. It will never refute the french but it can be very hard to create counterplay against it.
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,The tarrasch. I played this on the grounds it's the variation i least like to play against when I am black in a french. It will never refute the french but it can be very hard to create counterplay against it.
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,The tarrasch. I played this on the grounds it's the variation i least like to play against when I am black in a french. It will never refute the french but it can be very hard to create counterplay against it.
5,Nd2,b1d2,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,The tarrasch. I played this on the grounds it's the variation i least like to play against when I am black in a french. It will never refute the french but it can be very hard to create counterplay against it.
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"The Guimard. It has a dubious reputation and it blocks the ...c5 break, but it can't be bad to simply develop a piece. I tried to keep the position closed as I think Black may find his position a bit ""gummed up"" if he isn't too careful."
7,Ngf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/3p4/3PP3/5N2/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 4,"I am playing for the so-called ""Universal system"": I don't know any theory so I just develop my pieces on natural squares and hope for the best!
 4. c3 e5 5. dxe5 Nxe5 6. Ngf3 Nxf3  7. Nxf3 Nf6 With a slight plus for white according to Fritz, but with the e5 break obtained and even development, it feels pretty level to me. Given that 3...Nc6 presumably aims for a quick ...e6-e5 it feels wrong to let black get it in so quickly."
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/3p4/3PP3/5N2/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 4 5,"This just felt ok: I was completely out of book, and after this game I left wondering if I am better just playing chess than studying theory - I liked my position and I had to play moves based on my assessment of the position, giving me a deeper feel for it cf learned theory."
9,e5,e4e5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/3pP3/3P4/5N2/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"This just felt ok: I was completely out of book, and after this game I left wondering if I am better just playing chess than studying theory - I liked my position and I had to play moves based on my assessment of the position, giving me a deeper feel for it cf learned theory."
10,Nd7,f6d7,r1bqkb1r/pppn1ppp/2n1p3/3pP3/3P4/5N2/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,I am trying to argue that Black has misplaced his knight.
11,Bd3,f1d3,r1bqkb1r/pppn1ppp/2n1p3/3pP3/3P4/3B1N2/PPPN1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 6,I am trying to argue that Black has misplaced his knight.
12,Nb4,c6b4,r1bqkb1r/pppn1ppp/4p3/3pP3/1n1P4/3B1N2/PPPN1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 3 7,"I found out after that this is theory: black gains a tempo for ...c5, but it seems very much like a normal Tarrasch.
6... f6 7. Ng5 Ndxe5 8. dxe5 fxg5 9. Qh5  g6 10. Bxg6  Kd7 11. f4 gxf4 12. Bd3 Nb4 13. Nf3 Nxd3  14. cxd3 Qe8 With equality according to Fritz, but long-term I would prefer white: the f4 pawn looks ropey and Black will have to mess about with his king to get the Bishop out. 15. Qh4 Qg6 16. O-O Qxd3 17. Bxf4 Bc5  18. Kh1 c6 With a slight edge to white, although black will have counter-chances against the white king so it's playable."
13,Be2,d3e2,r1bqkb1r/pppn1ppp/4p3/3pP3/1n1P4/5N2/PPPNBPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 4 7,After this it becomes like a normal tarrasch.

Contrast this with the black position and the hemmed-in light-squared bishop and inative d7 knight: these two pieces don't appear to have any obvious squares to go to.

It's hard to see why on the grounds I think the Bishop belongs on e3, discouraging any ...f6...e5 break by Black by pointing at the queen and overprotecting d4 and by extension the c5 outpost too.

12... Bb4 Prevents the rook going to e1, perhaps making ...f6 easier, but black's king-side looks a bit draughty 13.Qc2 with a plan of playing on the king-side with Nf3-g5 or down the c-file."
25,Bb5,e2b5,r1b1k2r/1p1nbppp/1qn1p3/pB1pP3/P2P4/1N3N2/1P3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 2 13,This opens the e-file for the white rook and allows white to complete development harmoniously. The B can always drop back to d3 if needs must.

However, it's hard to see a constructive plan for black here - he's solid but passive and by extension worse: As Mihai Suba said, chess is a dynamic game and black seems to lack dynamism."
