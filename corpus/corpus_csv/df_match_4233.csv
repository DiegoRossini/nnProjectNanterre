1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I am annotating this game for the benefit of my team, the Burninators, and especially for my teammate, esegromal."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"In the Sicilian defense, per Kasparov, one of the biggest challenges for white is to deal with the two center pawns for black.  White's challenge is to neutralize those pawns and black's challenge is to not trade them away cheaply."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Fairly standard progression so far.  Nothing out of the ordinary.

9,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,"This move has good instinct, in that it is designed to stake a claim to the center and force me to move my knight.  Any piece that has reach into your side of the board should be viewed with extreme caution.  If you allow pieces to stick around, they can have long-term consequences to your game play."
10,e5,e7e5,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"This move has good instinct, in that it is designed to stake a claim to the center and force me to move my knight.

12,d5,d7d5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/1N1pp3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"A wrong move here can spell some problems for my side if I'm not careful.  If I choose not to take the d5 pawn, then he can advance the pawn one space and force me to move my knight around while staking a strong claim to the center.  However, I have three options at this point.  I can take with the knight, take with the pawn, or move my bishop to g5 to pin his knight against his queen, allowing me to move my knight to the d5 square (provided he doesn't pin my own knight with a reciprocal Bb4).  To avoid all of those pin issue, I prefer to take with the e pawn."
13,exd5,e4d5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/1N1Pp3/8/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"If black had decided to immediately retake with his f6 knight instead, I would have won a knight in the process.  This is an interesting response and I think is worthy of discussion.  As this now stand black has three attackers and I have 2 defenders.  I could potentially move my bishop to c4 to protect, but I see problems down that road.  With proper analysis though, black is potentially in trouble if I give a little nudge."
14,Nb4,c6b4,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/5n2/1N1Pp3/1n6/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,"If black had decided to immediately retake with his f6 knight instead, I would have won a knight in the process.

15,a3,a2a3,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/5n2/1N1Pp3/1n6/P1N5/1PP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,"Now black has some poor options, and ultimately he moves the b knight to retake the d pawn.  If black had instead decided to move to a6 I would have gotten a decent amount of advantage in development and could have added more pressure to his exposed king, BUT it would have been better than this move, which I will categorize as a mistake."
16,Nbxd5,b4d5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/5n2/1N1np3/8/P1N5/1PP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 9,"if instead Na6...
9.	Qe2	Bd6 (to allow castle)
10.	Nxd6+	Qxd6 (to set up pressure and force an eventual queen trade)
11.	f4	Nd7 (bringing pressure and forcing a knight move to prevent a pawn fork)
12.	fxe5	Qxe5
13.	Bf4	Qxe2+
14.	Bxe2	O-O
15.	Bxa6	bxa6
16.	O-O

And now black is only down a pawn, but I would have three connected, passed pawns down the center of the board."
17,Nxd5,c3d5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/5n2/1N1Np3/8/P7/1PP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 9,"Black appears to have an advantage here and can regain his knight, however, my b5 knight has a nasty surprise waiting."
18,Nxd5,f6d5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/8/1N1np3/8/P7/1PP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 10,I believe that this move is not necessarily one that you would naturally see.  Taking with a queen and leaving it hanging begs it to be taken.

20,Qxd5,d8d5,r1b1kb1r/pp3ppp/8/1N1qp3/8/P7/1PP2PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 0 11,"However the follow through to allow a queen/king split is damning.  Not only has black lost the ability to castle with a very exposed king, but now he is down a knight as well.  Not a good place to be if you're black."

The other downside at this point is that I can potentially pin his bishop against his king."

Bringing additional pieces into the fray is often of greater strategic value and should not be neglected.  Do not throw away the chance to grab a piece or retake just to gain position, but do not immediately retake or take because you can.  Analyze the board and see where you can smartly develop an attack."
