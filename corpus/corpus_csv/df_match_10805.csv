1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Standard.
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,The Scandanavian - my personal favorite.
3,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3pP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Advance variation where white opts to play for a big center. The main alternative to this move is 2. exd Qxd 3. Nc3 Qa5 which I see a lot as well. Both variations seem to give equal play to both sides, and it has yet been proven to me that one is better than the other."
4,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2ppP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Natural follow up which hits the central d4 square.
5,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2ppP3/5P2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"?! Perhaps my opponent has seen my annotated game vs. bly_garcia:) With this move, white pushes for an early kingside attack. This is potentially very risky, as white weakens the area around his king."
6,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2ppPb2/5P2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"Getting the light squared bishop outside of the probable pawn chain, and preparing to defend the light squares around the king by playing Nbd7 if needed."
7,d3,d2d3,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2ppPb2/5P2/3P4/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"? I considered this move very, very slow. 3. Bb5 , Nf3, or even the aggressive g4! seem to have more merit."
8,e6,e7e6,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppPb2/5P2/3P4/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,Solidifying d5 and opening a lane for the dark squared bishop.
9,Nf3,g1f3,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppPb2/5P2/3P1N2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"White develops, and hastens 0-0."
10,h6,h7h6,rn1qkbnr/pp3pp1/4p2p/2ppPb2/5P2/3P1N2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Strictly defensive, as 6. Nh4 is strong for white. This move just creates a little hiding space for the Bf5 if needed, while having the added bonus of preventing 6. Ng5."
11,h3,h2h3,rn1qkbnr/pp3pp1/4p2p/2ppPb2/5P2/3P1N1P/PPP3P1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"As his Nf3 blocks his queen's influence on g4, my opponent bolsters the white squares and prepares to expand further by playing g4, which forces black to retreat."
12,Nc6,b8c6,r2qkbnr/pp3pp1/2n1p2p/2ppPb2/5P2/3P1N1P/PPP3P1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,"Simple development. The main issue at hand here for black is the development of the Ng8 and the Bf8, as the white pawn on e5 is very restricting."
13,c3,c2c3,r2qkbnr/pp3pp1/2n1p2p/2ppPb2/5P2/2PP1N1P/PP4P1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"?! Again, I felt this move was a little slow. White does open up a route for his queen (is Qa4 on the horizon?) and overprotects d4, but conversely he loses a potential home for his Nb1. I really expected a developing move or g4 here."
14,Nge7,g8e7,r2qkb1r/pp2npp1/2n1p2p/2ppPb2/5P2/2PP1N1P/PP4P1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,"Being given some tempo, black attempts to solve the problem of developing this knight. While slow and retreating, Nc8 can now be played if needed."
15,Be2,f1e2,r2qkb1r/pp2npp1/2n1p2p/2ppPb2/5P2/2PP1N1P/PP2B1P1/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 8,Developing and preparing 0-0.
16,d4,d5d4,r2qkb1r/pp2npp1/2n1p2p/2p1Pb2/3p1P2/2PP1N1P/PP2B1P1/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,"Not satisfied with putting a knight on c8, black encourages a pawn exchange that will allow the Ne7 to move to d5."
17,Nbd2,b1d2,r2qkb1r/pp2npp1/2n1p2p/2p1Pb2/3p1P2/2PP1N1P/PP1NB1P1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 9,"! Strong move, as this knight belongs on e4."
18,Nd5,e7d5,r2qkb1r/pp3pp1/2n1p2p/2pnPb2/3p1P2/2PP1N1P/PP1NB1P1/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 10,As planned.
19,Ne4,d2e4,r2qkb1r/pp3pp1/2n1p2p/2pnPb2/3pNP2/2PP1N1P/PP2B1P1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 10,As planned.
20,Be7,f8e7,r2qk2r/pp2bpp1/2n1p2p/2pnPb2/3pNP2/2PP1N1P/PP2B1P1/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 4 11,Last piece developed.
