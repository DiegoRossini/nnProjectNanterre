1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi guys, I haven't being annotating any chess game recently, because I was preparing for my exams, and finally I got some free time today, so i decide to use the time and bring you guys a very unprofessional chess annotation. This was a game between me and ruderooks, it's definitely not my best game, but I found it quite interesting, let's get started:  My opponent had white pieces, and he started with e4."
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Just 2 weeks ago, I was studying French defense, so I decided to use it in this game, e6 was played."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"d4, standard."
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,standard!!!
5,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3P4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"exd5! I was soooooo disappointed, after I saw this move, obviously he was trying to avoid the mainline of french defense."
6,exd5,e6d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"what else but exd5, I was thinking to offer him a draw, but then I found out, if I draw the game I would lose 5 points, so I continued with exd5. Just kidding :D"
7,Bf4,c1f4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3P1B2/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,"bf4, a natural developing move"
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/3p4/3P1B2/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 2 5,"Nc6 develops the knight, and adds some pressure on white's center."
9,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/1B1p4/3P1B2/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 3 5,"Bb5, develops the lsb and pins the knight."
10,Bd7,c8d7,r2qkbnr/pppb1ppp/2n5/1B1p4/3P1B2/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 4 6,Bd7 unpins.
11,Bxc6,b5c6,r2qkbnr/pppb1ppp/2B5/3p4/3P1B2/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 0 6,Bxc6 it seems that my opponent hated my knight and captured it straight away. Maybe he was just going for a draw.
12,Bxc6,d7c6,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2b5/3p4/3P1B2/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 0 7,"what else, bxc6"
13,Nd2,b1d2,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2b5/3p4/3P1B2/8/PPPN1PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 1 7,"Nd2 I wasn't sure why this move was played, I think Ne2 would be better, because white would be ready to castle, and take note if Nf3 was played, Bb5 could be a possible response, which stops white from castle, and also the bishop is not doing anything on c6, apart from babysitting d5 pawn."
14,Nf6,g8f6,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2b2n2/3p4/3P1B2/8/PPPN1PPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 2 8,"Nf6 develops the knight, and maybe Nh5 at some point, just to kick away the dsb."
15,Ngf3,g1f3,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2b2n2/3p4/3P1B2/5N2/PPPN1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 3 8,"Ngf3, again if I were white I definitely play Ne2."
16,Bb5,c6b5,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/1b1p4/3P1B2/5N2/PPPN1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 4 9,"Bb5, stops white from castle, and also the bishop is now functioning on a much better diagonal."
17,a3,a2a3,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/1b1p4/3P1B2/P4N2/1PPN1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 9,"a3 this is not a good move at all, white tries to stop black from playing Bb4, but b2 should have being considered by white, and he can play c4 for the next move, kicks away black' lsb, and then castle."
18,Nh5,f6h5,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/1b1p3n/3P1B2/P4N2/1PPN1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 1 10,"Knight on f3 is now blocking white queen from watching over h5 square , so black can now play Nh5, attacks white's dsb."
19,Be3,f4e3,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/1b1p3n/3P4/P3BN2/1PPN1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 2 10,Be3 was played
20,Bd6,f8d6,r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/3b4/1b1p3n/3P4/P3BN2/1PPN1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 3 11,"Bd6, not only develops the dsb, but also gives support on f4 square for the knight to land."
