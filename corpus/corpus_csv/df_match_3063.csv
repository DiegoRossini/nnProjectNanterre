20,a6,a7a6,r2q1rk1/1p1bppbp/p1np1np1/8/2B1P3/2N1BP2/PPPQN1PP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 11,Is this to prevent White's N or B from moving to b5 or to support ...b5?  Or both?
21,Bh6,e3h6,r2q1rk1/1p1bppbp/p1np1npB/8/2B1P3/2N2P2/PPPQN1PP/R3K2R b KQ - 1 11,Fulfilling the purpose of 9. Qd2 but is the timing right?  White doesn't seem to have a convincing follow-up and is still slightly vulnerable due to being uncastled.
22,Ne5,c6e5,r2q1rk1/1p1bppbp/p2p1npB/4n3/2B1P3/2N2P2/PPPQN1PP/R3K2R w KQ - 2 12,Black counters with an attack on the undefended Bc4.

This rather commits White to either castling queenside or not castling at all, which both seem high-risk options, given the way that Black's pieces are arranged."
26,Nc4,e5c4,2rq1rk1/1p1bppbp/p2p1npB/8/2n1P2P/1BN2P2/PPPQN1P1/R3K2R w KQ - 1 14,"The N forks White's Q and bP.  The threat on the Q undermines her support of the B on h6.  I his uncastled position, White needs to be v careful."

32,Rfc8,f8c8,2r3k1/1p1bppbp/p2p1npB/q7/2r1P2P/2N2P2/PPPQN1P1/1K1R3R w - - 4 17,"Black proceeds to increase the pressure on the recently castled K.  White's decision doesn't look too wise at present.  Since the castling, Black has made 2 seriously attacking moves, White is on the defensive."
