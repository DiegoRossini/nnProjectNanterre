6,a6,a7a6,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,Once black plays d6 it is a classical variation. I know some players who are as high rated as this guy who don't like to play black in this position because they feel like a target to white. But this position has been played by the best players in the world so it's nothing wrong with this position for black.

23,Nbd2,b1d2,r1b2rk1/2q1bppp/p2p1n2/npp1p3/3PP3/2P2N1P/PPBN1PP1/R1BQR1K1 b - - 2 12,Well here i wasn't sure how to play so i decided Nd2. I have seen games where white tries to put the b-knight all the way to g3 in this position so that's pretty much what i did.

I didn't see that move coming and exchanging a rather passive knight for a potential dangerous dark squared bishop is a good thing i believe. Even tho black mostly plays something like Nbd7,c4,Nc5."
