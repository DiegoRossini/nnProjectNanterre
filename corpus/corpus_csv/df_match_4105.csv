1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hello. Here is an interesting and enjoyable game that I recently played. I am playing with the black pieces, and again I respond to 1.e4 with my favourite defence: The Sicilian. I manage to gain an advantage of 1 pawn in the middle game, which eventually converted to a win, after a hard-fought endgame. Here is a link to the Gameknot anaylsis if you are interested: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17509783&fb=1&rnd=0.2053531357087195."

7,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"In this position, neither player wants to take the knight, as doing so would benefit the opponent, regardless of which player initiates the exchange."
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,All book moves so far. Black attacks the undefended e pawn.
9,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,"And white obliges to defend it, whilst developing a minor piece."
10,d6,d7d6,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"I used to play 5...e5 in this position, but I feel that this move allows more flexibility in the centre. e5 leads to a closed centre, and potential weaknesses on the Queenside dark squares, which white may be able to exploit later in the game. With this move, I make room for my LSB, and wait to see what my opponent plays before deciding how to contest the centre of the board."
11,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/1B6/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,Pins my knight and threatens to win a pawn.
12,Bd7,c8d7,r2qkb1r/pp1bpppp/2np1n2/1B6/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 7,Neutralising the threat with development.

15,Bg5,c1g5,r2qkb1r/pp1bpp1p/2np1np1/1B4B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 1 8,"According to the gameknot anaylsis, this is the first non-book move, although perfectly playable IMO. Alternatives may have been Bd2."
16,Bg7,f8g7,r2qk2r/pp1bppbp/2np1np1/1B4B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 2 9,Development and preventing damage to my pawn structure if BxN.

19,Be2,b5e2,r2qk2r/p2bppbp/2pp1np1/6B1/4P3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 1 10,My Queens Rook takes control of the half-open b file.

21,Rb1,a1b1,1r1qk2r/p2bppbp/2pp1np1/6B1/4P3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/1R1Q1RK1 b k - 3 11,"b3 is not advisable due to the DSB on g7, so white has to defend with the rook. Here blacks Queen's Rook has much more power than whites."
22,Qa5,d8a5,1r2k2r/p2bppbp/2pp1np1/q5B1/4P3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/1R1Q1RK1 w k - 4 12,"Attacking the bishop on g5 and trying to complicate the position. Moving the Queen tends to alter the position significantly, making mistakes more likely."
23,Bd2,g5d2,1r2k2r/p2bppbp/2pp1np1/q7/4P3/2N5/PPPBBPPP/1R1Q1RK1 b k - 5 12,"Enables a discovered attack on the black Queen, but blocks whites Queen for a few moves."

25,f3,f2f3,1r2k2r/p2bppbp/2pp1np1/4q3/4P3/2N2P2/PPPBB1PP/1R1Q1RK1 b k - 0 13,"I was expecting black to defend with the LSB here, as this move exposes the King. However, in hindsight, this move is probably better, as it also prevents my knight from landing on g4. Now I must move my LSB before I can move my Knight on f6, releasing the power of the DSB. Black is significantly more cramped than white, but it's not a problem yet. Gameknot gives white a very slight at this stage."
26,O-O,e8g8,1r3rk1/p2bppbp/2pp1np1/4q3/4P3/2N2P2/PPPBB1PP/1R1Q1RK1 w - - 1 14,"Here I considered Qc5+ to gain control of the open g1-a7 diagonal, but I could not see it leading to anything useful, so I just decided to play it safe and castle."
