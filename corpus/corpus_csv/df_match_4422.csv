1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"My opponent chose a very sharp opening (King's gambit) but after 6.Ng1 (a very defensive variation) he lingered in the quest for an equal game, at some point I even offered a poisoned pawn that he refused to accept, and I went on to improve my space advantage on the king's wing, undermining his blocking pawns and creating two connected passed pawns.. still I've had some trouble bringing them to promotion until a final imprecision by white precipitated the events allowing me to force the promotion, he resign before!"

10,g4,g5g4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2p1p/3p4/8/3PPppP/5N2/PPP3P1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"now I think Qf6 might be a good choice defending f4 and preparing the long castle, while at the same time removing the queen from the d column that might became open thus not allowing white to exchange queens if the d column opens up, f5, Nf6 and Bh6 are other common choices"

14,Be6,c8e6,rn2kbnr/ppp2p1p/3pbq2/8/3PPppP/2N5/PPP3P1/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 4 8,"controlling the a2-g8 diagonal, and developing preparing the long castle also invites d5 if played I have Bd7"
15,Qe2,d1e2,rn2kbnr/ppp2p1p/3pbq2/8/3PPppP/2N5/PPP1Q1P1/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 5 8,of course now white has Qb5 Nd7 Qxb7 Rb8 Qxc7 but then he loses initiative allowing g3 with the powerful threat Qf2... also with Qxd4 I've created a weakness on white's pawn structure that maybe reveal itself useful on the endgame
