1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"1. d4 - the other ""Best by test"" - just ask Bennett!"
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,COPY CAT.  Not a bad idea to copy though - both sides have one Bishop that can look out onto the chess board and each side has planted a flag on Mt. Everest.  Ok - so I am exaggerating about the whole Mt. Everest flag planting thing - both players are actually controlling part of the center because they have each placed a pawn there.  Which is always a good think!
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,QUEEN'S GAMBIT anyone?
4,dxc4,d5c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2pP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"""Sure... How about the Queen's Gambit Accepted!"" - this is essentially what Sigmund Reppen has replied back to me as signaled by his chess moves."
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2pP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,DEVELOP YOUR TEAM!
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/8/2pP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,DHITTO - like to the max!
7,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/8/2pP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"This allows my Bishop to look at the pawn on c4.  I really, REALLY want to capture that pawn with my Bishop!"
8,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/8/2pP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Controlling the d5 square.  The is a ""LIGHT SQUARED STRATEGY OPENING"".  We will shall talk more about that some other day though."
9,Bxc4,f1c4,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/8/2BP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"""Crunch...crunch...munch...chomp...  Yum."" says my Bishop who really enjoyed eating that pawn!"
10,a6,a7a6,rnbqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p3pn2/8/2BP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,This pawn is getting ready to help it's brother/sister to attack my Bishop on c4.  Penguins Attack!
11,O-O,e1g1,rnbqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p3pn2/8/2BP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 6,"KING SAFETY!  Ok there are three things we want to do in the opening:
1. Control the entire center - or at least our fair share of it.
2. Develop our team.
3. King Safety.
I can safely check off items one and three off of my list now because as the White player I have a pawn on the d4 square and I have castled my King over onto the King's side of the board.  I am still working on number two though.  I have yet to move the Bishop on c1, the Knight on b1 and my Queen on d1.  I will have safely gotten out of the opening and into the middle-game once I have played those pieces out onto the board.
Notice that my opponent's King is still stuck in the center and that he has to catch up in getting his team out onto the board.  That is the trick when you are playing the black pieces because you move second."
12,b5,b7b5,rnbqkb1r/2p2ppp/p3pn2/1p6/2BP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,"Penguins - ATTACK!  The question being asked by this rather rude Penguin is ""MOVE IT OR LOSE IT BISHOP?"".  I think I had better move it!"
13,Bd3,c4d3,rnbqkb1r/2p2ppp/p3pn2/1p6/3P4/3BPN2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 7,...to that square!
14,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/5ppp/p3pn2/1pp5/3P4/3BPN2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,Now my opponent is trying to chip away at my control over the center.  Sigmund once ALL of the center square to himself - how greedy!
15,dxc5,d4c5,rnbqkb1r/5ppp/p3pn2/1pP5/8/3BPN2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,Take you very much!
16,Bxc5,f8c5,rnbqk2r/5ppp/p3pn2/1pb5/8/3BPN2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 9,Take you back very much!  Remember whenever your opponent captures one of your Pieces or pawns you want to be able to recapture back.  If you cannot capture back then you will lose on points in the endgame.
17,Qe2,d1e2,rnbqk2r/5ppp/p3pn2/1pb5/8/3BPN2/PP2QPPP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 1 9,Making way for my Rook on f1 to go stand on the d1 square.  I am hoping to win my opponent's Queen in a line like 9. Qe2 0-0 10. Rd1 Bb7?? 11. Bxh7 CHECK!  Now I will get a Queen and a pawn for my Bishop and Rook - quite a deal actually.  That is 10 points that I will have won for an investment of only 8 points - a real bargain!
18,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/5ppp/p3pn2/1pb5/8/3BPN2/PP2QPPP/RNB2RK1 w - - 2 10,I am liking that move!
19,e4,e3e4,rnbq1rk1/5ppp/p3pn2/1pb5/4P3/3B1N2/PP2QPPP/RNB2RK1 b - - 0 10,First I expand my control over the center.
20,Bb7,c8b7,rn1q1rk1/1b3ppp/p3pn2/1pb5/4P3/3B1N2/PP2QPPP/RNB2RK1 w - - 1 11,Time to weaken his Queen-side but the flip side of this move is that I am unable to take that move back.  Once the pawns move forward they can never go back - so I have created some weaknesses too!
21,a4,a2a4,rn1q1rk1/1b3ppp/p3pn2/1pb5/P3P3/3B1N2/1P2QPPP/RNB2RK1 b - - 0 11,Time to weaken his Queen-side but the flip side of this move is that I am unable to take that move back.  Once the pawns move forward they can never go back - so I have created some weaknesses too!
