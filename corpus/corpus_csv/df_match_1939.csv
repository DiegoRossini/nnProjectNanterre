10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppppb1pp/4pn2/5p2/3P1B1P/4PN2/PPP2PP1/RN1QKB1R w KQ - 1 6,"Accepting the challenge, black castles into the fire."
11,h5,h4h5,rnbq1rk1/ppppb1pp/4pn2/5p1P/3P1B2/4PN2/PPP2PP1/RN1QKB1R b KQ - 0 6,"!? I know by experience that a normal developement doesn't get much, so I try this move. The intention is to force somehow g6, being dangerous for black with a pawn in h5. It is NOT my intention to play h6, since then g6 would be very solid for black, and white just lost tempoes."
12,Nd5,f6d5,rnbq1rk1/ppppb1pp/4p3/3n1p1P/3P1B2/4PN2/PPP2PP1/RN1QKB1R w KQ - 1 7,"Yes, I know."
13,Bg3,f4g3,rnbq1rk1/ppppb1pp/4p3/3n1p1P/3P4/4PNB1/PPP2PP1/RN1QKB1R b KQ - 2 7,"...? But this was a blunder. Bh2 was the right move, and it doesent matter if black presses with Bh4, white just plays f3 and that's all. Of course I plan to castle queenside from h4. But I miss, here, the crushing f4. When I realized it, I thought the best way to save the bishop was exf4, and wait for Nxf4. Black has the f column, but white seems able to stand and get to castle queenside safely."

I need to develop, even by exchanging pieces, and I don't see I have time to create the ""if you f4, I Bxh7+"" threat. This is why I didn't play Bd3. I won't have two more moves to align the queen in c2."
