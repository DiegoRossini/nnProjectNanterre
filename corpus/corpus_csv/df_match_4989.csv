1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I decided to annotate this game because I thought it was interesting to be my first annotation. I hope that you'll enjoy an insight into how I play chess - while I know some chess theory, I play a large amount of my chess on instinct. This was my sixth meeting with sidsidsid in a small amount of time.

I started with 1. e4, as I do every game as white. I know more lines and tend to find more positions that I find comfortable during it."
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Of the three games I played with sidsidsid as white, he started with a different opening move each time (1. ... a6, 1. ... b6 and finally 1. e6) and it definitely made my knowledge of the lines limited. I continued to attack the centre from here..."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,... with 2. d4. A rather standard move to reply with.
4,b6,b7b6,rnbqkbnr/p1pp1ppp/1p2p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Readying to fianchetto the bishop on the queen side for the third game running - I must admit, I was expecting it - even after 1. ... e6."
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/p1pp1ppp/1p2p3/8/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"Developing the knight to attack and defend the centre. I could probably have attacked more with c4 or f4, but I feel more comfortable developing my knights and bishops earlier on."
6,Bb7,c8b7,rn1qkbnr/pbpp1ppp/1p2p3/8/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,"Expected, attacking the light-squared diagonal."
7,Bd3,f1d3,rn1qkbnr/pbpp1ppp/1p2p3/8/3PP3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 4,Defending the pawn while developing another minor piece.
8,Nf6,g8f6,rn1qkb1r/pbpp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/3PP3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 5,Developing the knight into a square that I'm prepared to attack with...
9,e5,e4e5,rn1qkb1r/pbpp1ppp/1p2pn2/4P3/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"I thought about playing Bg5 also, but it really had very little purpose other than developing the bishop. He'll either force it away with h6 or bring his bishop out to e7. So I went with attacking, not letting black settle his pieces!"
10,Nd5,f6d5,rn1qkb1r/pbpp1ppp/1p2p3/3nP3/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 6,"One of the better spots for the knight to sit, but it also blocks the bishops hold on the diagonal momentarily."

Instead, I played a3, happy to trade off his knight for my bishop. Doing so, I remove one of his two active pieces and get my queen into the ball game."
