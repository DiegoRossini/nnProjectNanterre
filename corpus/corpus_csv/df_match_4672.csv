6,d6,d7d6,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,This is the steintz defense. The idea is to protect the e4 pawn and make way for the LSB.
7,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 4,I have fast and easy development.

9,d4,d2d4,r2qkbnr/pppb1ppp/2np4/1B2p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 5,c3 was probably better here so I could establish 2 strong pawns on e4 and d4
10,exd4,e5d4,r2qkbnr/pppb1ppp/2np4/1B6/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 6,7. Qxd4 leads to disaster here after Bxb5! Black has almost equalised here.

13,Bxd7+,b5d7,r2qkbnr/pppB1ppp/3p4/8/3nP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,"Rather dubious. Better here was Nf6, Ne7 or a6 which prepare O-O-O althought the A7 square is extremely weak."

17,Qd3,d4d3,r3kbnr/pp1q1ppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/3Q4/PPP2PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 1 9,The Queen is still nice and centralised which mean it's controlling more squares. Nf6 develops a piece and prepare to castle short.
