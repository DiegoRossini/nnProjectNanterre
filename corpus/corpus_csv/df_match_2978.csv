1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Hi all! This is a game from the Walking the Walk Mini-Tournament Group 4 that I'm annotating on chicoboy's request. Enjoy!
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,White avoids the Ruy Lopez (3.Bb5) and chooses the Scotch Game instead. This opening is characterized by the open center and usually White's strong central presence.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,White avoids the Ruy Lopez (3.Bb5) and chooses the Scotch Game instead. This opening is characterized by the open center and usually White's strong central presence.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,White avoids the Ruy Lopez (3.Bb5) and chooses the Scotch Game instead. This opening is characterized by the open center and usually White's strong central presence.
5,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,White avoids the Ruy Lopez (3.Bb5) and chooses the Scotch Game instead. This opening is characterized by the open center and usually White's strong central presence.
6,exd4,e5d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"This is best. There's no good way for Black to maintain his pawn on e5, and taking with the Knight (3...Nxd4 4.Nxd4 exd4 5.Qxd4) leaves White's Queen on a very strong central square without an easy way to drive her away."
7,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"4...Bc5 or 4...Nf6 are far and away more popular, and safer. This is too early to bring out the BQ, and furthermore she's blocking the King Knight's best square."
8,Qf6,d8f6,r1b1kbnr/pppp1ppp/2n2q2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"4...Bc5 or 4...Nf6 are far and away more popular, and safer. This is too early to bring out the BQ, and furthermore she's blocking the King Knight's best square."
9,Be3,c1e3,r1b1kbnr/pppp1ppp/2n2q2/8/3NP3/4B3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,"A good developing move, defending both the Knight and the f2 pawn."
10,Bc5,f8c5,r1b1k1nr/pppp1ppp/2n2q2/2b5/3NP3/4B3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 3 6,Black piles up on the Knight.
11,c3,c2c3,r1b1k1nr/pppp1ppp/2n2q2/2b5/3NP3/2P1B3/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"White still has adequate defenses, though he's forced to take the c3 square away from his QN."
12,Nxd4,c6d4,r1b1k1nr/pppp1ppp/5q2/2b5/3nP3/2P1B3/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"? Black has nothing to gain from this exchange. At best, he'll give White a formidable center and a developmental edge (7.Bxd4 Bxd4 8.Qxd4 Qxd4 9.cxd4). Better choices would have been 6...d6 or 6...Ne7, to simply continue development."
13,Bxd4,e3d4,r1b1k1nr/pppp1ppp/5q2/2b5/3BP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,White recaptures.
14,Bb6,c5b6,r1b1k1nr/pppp1ppp/1b3q2/8/3BP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,"?? Hugely, Black overlooks the threat to his Queen."
15,Bxf6,d4f6,r1b1k1nr/pppp1ppp/1b3B2/8/4P3/2P5/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,White wastes no time.
16,Nxf6,g8f6,r1b1k2r/pppp1ppp/1b3n2/8/4P3/2P5/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 9,"Black could resign, with a mere Bishop for his Queen, but chooses to fight on--it's still early in the game, and there's plenty of time for White to make mistakes."
17,Bd3,f1d3,r1b1k2r/pppp1ppp/1b3n2/8/4P3/2PB4/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 1 9,"Black could resign, with a mere Bishop for his Queen, but chooses to fight on--it's still early in the game, and there's plenty of time for White to make mistakes."
18,d6,d7d6,r1b1k2r/ppp2ppp/1b1p1n2/8/4P3/2PB4/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 10,Both players get their Kings to safety.
19,O-O,e1g1,r1b1k2r/ppp2ppp/1b1p1n2/8/4P3/2PB4/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 1 10,Both players get their Kings to safety.
20,O-O,e8g8,r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/1b1p1n2/8/4P3/2PB4/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - - 2 11,Both players get their Kings to safety.
21,Nd2,b1d2,r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/1b1p1n2/8/4P3/2PB4/PP1N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 3 11,"? I simply don't see a purpose to this move. It needlessly weakens the Black King's position, when Black *should* be focusing on getting all his pieces out. When you're behind in material, it is absolutely critical to make every move count, and make more use of the pieces you *do* have."
22,g6,g7g6,r1b2rk1/ppp2p1p/1b1p1np1/8/4P3/2PB4/PP1N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 12,"? I simply don't see a purpose to this move. It needlessly weakens the Black King's position, when Black *should* be focusing on getting all his pieces out. When you're behind in material, it is absolutely critical to make every move count, and make more use of the pieces you *do* have."
23,Re1,f1e1,r1b2rk1/ppp2p1p/1b1p1np1/8/4P3/2PB4/PP1N1PPP/R2QR1K1 b - - 1 12,"White is playing soundly, just developing and solidifying his advantage."
24,Kh8,g8h8,r1b2r1k/ppp2p1p/1b1p1np1/8/4P3/2PB4/PP1N1PPP/R2QR1K1 w - - 2 13,"? Again, there's no reason for this move. All the King-related movement suggests that Black is feeling how far behind he is and panicking as a result."
25,Nf3,d2f3,r1b2r1k/ppp2p1p/1b1p1np1/8/4P3/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/R2QR1K1 b - - 3 13,White prepares e4-e5.
26,Rg8,f8g8,r1b3rk/ppp2p1p/1b1p1np1/8/4P3/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/R2QR1K1 w - - 4 14,"I guess this is the point of Black's last move--but what is he going to do with his Rook over here? He should be developing and making active counterplay, not this passive repositioning with no apparent purpose. This Rook belongs on e8 anyway, to contest White's pawn advance."
27,e5,e4e5,r1b3rk/ppp2p1p/1b1p1np1/4P3/8/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/R2QR1K1 b - - 0 14,"Finally, Black starts to pay attention to his other pieces."
28,dxe5,d6e5,r1b3rk/ppp2p1p/1b3np1/4p3/8/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/R2QR1K1 w - - 0 15,"Finally, Black starts to pay attention to his other pieces."
29,Nxe5,f3e5,r1b3rk/ppp2p1p/1b3np1/4N3/8/2PB4/PP3PPP/R2QR1K1 b - - 0 15,"Finally, Black starts to pay attention to his other pieces."
30,Be6,c8e6,r5rk/ppp2p1p/1b2bnp1/4N3/8/2PB4/PP3PPP/R2QR1K1 w - - 1 16,"Finally, Black starts to pay attention to his other pieces."
31,Qf3,d1f3,r5rk/ppp2p1p/1b2bnp1/4N3/8/2PB1Q2/PP3PPP/R3R1K1 b - - 2 16,White forks the Knight and b7 pawn.
