1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Most times played in my camp.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,My move directly met.
3,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,I've taken a liking to this move vs. Nf3.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 3,seemed standard.
5,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 3 3,"I usually play Nf3 here, but then I thought I would have had  the same effect as if I had played 2. Nf3 then 3. Bc4."
6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 4 4,With center pressure and keeping up with development I suppose? Maybe book?
7,d3,d2d3,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 4,Strengthening the center and allowing future queen side development......
8,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 1 5,"In most live games which I've played, I or my opponent usually diverts from quality play and attempts unusual even weird/untried moves. This seems not to be the case here!"
9,Be3,c1e3,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/2NPB3/PPP2PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 2 5,Only know I would not be displeased with trading off for his (good?)Bishop....

11,fxe3,f2e3,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/2NPP3/PPP3PP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 0 6,Dreaded doubled pawns? Or perhaps a benefit?
12,d6,d7d6,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4p3/2B1P3/2NPP3/PPP3PP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 0 7,"Seems solid enough, is there perhaps better here?"
13,Qd2,d1d2,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4p3/2B1P3/2NPP3/PPPQ2PP/R3K1NR b KQkq - 1 7,Trying to put a question in my opponents mind as to which side I may be wanting to castle to.
14,Ng4,f6g4,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/2B1P1n1/2NPP3/PPPQ2PP/R3K1NR w KQkq - 2 8,It just felt like if this was following the book that 7. Qd2 or this Knight move has left us in unmapped territory.
15,h3,h2h3,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/2B1P1n1/2NPP2P/PPPQ2P1/R3K1NR b KQkq - 0 8,Danger lurks!
16,Qh4+,d8h4,r1b1k2r/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/2B1P1nq/2NPP2P/PPPQ2P1/R3K1NR w KQkq - 1 9,"What in the world did I do to myself this time, I THOUGHT, and thought............."
17,Kf1,e1f1,r1b1k2r/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/2B1P1nq/2NPP2P/PPPQ2P1/R4KNR b kq - 2 9,Guess my opponent forced where my King were to reside.
18,Qf6+,h4f6,r1b1k2r/ppp2ppp/2np1q2/4p3/2B1P1n1/2NPP2P/PPPQ2P1/R4KNR w kq - 3 10,Here is the time that a master mind may be needed in explaining why a difference between moving the Queen now or when attacked by my Knight a move later matters?
19,Nf3,g1f3,r1b1k2r/ppp2ppp/2np1q2/4p3/2B1P1n1/2NPPN1P/PPPQ2P1/R4K1R b kq - 4 10,SEEMS THE SAME TO ME?!
