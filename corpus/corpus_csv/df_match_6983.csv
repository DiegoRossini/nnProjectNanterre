1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This is another game from the Knights of Honor Upper Level Tourney.  This game became wildly tactical early on.
2,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Black goes with his favorite defense-The Modern/Robatsch.
3,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"With 3. f4, White initiates the aptly named Three Pawns Attack."
4,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"With 3. f4, White initiates the aptly named Three Pawns Attack."

6,d6,d7d6,rnbqk1nr/ppp1ppbp/3p2p1/8/3PPP2/8/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Here, Black seeks to begin undermining White's center."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk1nr/ppp1ppbp/3p2p1/8/3PPP2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"Here, Black seeks to begin undermining White's center."

9,dxc5,d4c5,rnbqk1nr/pp2ppbp/3p2p1/2P5/4PP2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,5. dxc5.  This move surprised me a bit.  I fully expected 5. d5
10,Qa5+,d8a5,rnb1k1nr/pp2ppbp/3p2p1/q1P5/4PP2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,Black didn't want to take c5 with d6 as it likely would have led to an exchange of Queens and pull the d-pawn out of the center.
11,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1k1nr/pp2ppbp/3p2p1/q1P5/4PP2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 6,"Here again, White surprised me as I expected Bd2"

13,Nd5,c3d5,rnb1k1nr/pp2ppbp/3p2p1/2qN4/4PP2/5N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 7,"7...Nf6  Fritz gave this move a ? and recommended 7.	... Qa5+  8.	Bd2  Qd8  That never crossed my mind but in hindsight, that would have certainly led to a calmer game.  Additionally, I think it was only an oversight by White that I didn't lose my Queen for his LSB in the next couple of moves."
14,Nf6,g8f6,rnb1k2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2qN4/4PP2/5N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 8,"7...Nf6  Fritz gave this move a ? and recommended 7.	... Qa5+  8.

15,b4,b2b4,rnb1k2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2qN4/1P2PP2/5N2/P1P3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,This was a relatively simple move as every other move lost the Queen.
16,Qc6,c5c6,rnb1k2r/pp2ppbp/2qp1np1/3N4/1P2PP2/5N2/P1P3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 9,This was a relatively simple move as every other move lost the Queen.
17,Ne5,f3e5,rnb1k2r/pp2ppbp/2qp1np1/3NN3/1P2PP2/8/P1P3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 9,"9. Ne5  I'm hesitant to offer a ? on a move when my opponent is 250 rating points better.  However, I believe that 9. Bb5  Qxb5  10.	Nc7+	wins Black's Queen.  I didn't see this possibility until after 9. Ne5 as I was certain that a 2000+ player simply didn't see that dxNe5 was possible.  I was literally ready to move 9. dxe5 three times but each time did not click on 'Submit' as I was certain that I was missing something.  Once I saw I could lose the Queen, I came up with a different move."

21,Nc7+,d5c7,rn2k2r/ppN1ppbp/2Np1np1/8/1P2PP2/8/P1P3PP/R1BbKB1R b KQkq - 1 11,This was expected but there was little I could do about it.
