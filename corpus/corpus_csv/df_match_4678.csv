1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,.Black handled badly the opening phase and allowed me to temporarily sacrifice my queen to get a great attack that at least would render me some material advantage
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,Alekhine's defence
3,e5,e4e5,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/4P3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"I prefer a sideline from the mostly played d4, to keep some pressure on the knight and to populate the centre with my pawns, by playing c4 (the Steiner variation) now I plan also to play at some time Nc3 not hampering the c pawn development."
4,Nd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/3nP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"I prefer a sideline from the mostly played d4, to keep some pressure on the knight and to populate the centre with my pawns, by playing c4 (the Steiner variation) now I plan also to play at some time Nc3 not hampering the c pawn development."
5,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/3nP3/2P5/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"I prefer a sideline from the mostly played d4, to keep some pressure on the knight and to populate the centre with my pawns, by playing c4 (the Steiner variation) now I plan also to play at some time Nc3 not hampering the c pawn development."
6,Nb6,d5b6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/1n6/4P3/2P5/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"c4 is protected by Bf1, so d4 is the natural way of progress to populate the centre with pawns psicologicaly is also interesting to contrapose the hyper-modernist ideas behind 1...Nf6 with the more classical approach of gaining space in the center."
7,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/1n6/4P3/2PP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"c4 is protected by Bf1, so d4 is the natural way of progress to populate the centre with pawns psicologicaly is also interesting to contrapose the hyper-modernist ideas behind 1...Nf6 with the more classical approach of gaining space in the center."
8,d6,d7d6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/1n1p4/4P3/2PP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,To create some tension and to open the c8-h3 diagonal for the bishop
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/1n1p4/4P3/2PP4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"I delayed the common exd6 so I can finally develop a piece, I expect Bg4 to pin my knight, have doubts about the recapturing piece if black captures my e5 pawn, probably knight is a better choice to keep the imbalance of the position as f6 is bad for black's pawn structure the knight will be nice planted on e5, although too early on the game, it might prove useful latter on."
10,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/1n1p4/4P3/2PP2b1/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,pins my knight
11,exd6,e5d6,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/1n1P4/8/2PP2b1/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"I was a bit surprised now, expected black recapturing with exd6 instead, although not terribly bad and frequently played it blocks dark squares bishop further more, the d6 pawn can in the future provide a nice target if black opts for development of the e pawn, a fianchetto is an option in-line with the hyper-modernism (main line after 7.Nc3 Nc6 8.Be3 g6)."
12,cxd6,c7d6,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/1n1p4/8/2PP2b1/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"I was a bit surprised now, expected black recapturing with exd6 instead, although not terribly bad and frequently played it blocks dark squares bishop further more, the d6 pawn can in the future provide a nice target if black opts for development of the e pawn, a fianchetto is an option in-line with the hyper-modernism (main line after 7.Nc3 Nc6 8.Be3 g6)."
13,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/1n1p4/8/2PP2b1/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 7,"further development is needed, although with more space I lack developed pieces, My Nc3 looks good behind the pawns as with the early c4 I gained more space in the centre"
14,Nc6,b8c6,r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/1nnp4/8/2PP2b1/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 8,overprotecting d4 to allow Qxf3 if needed and developing one more piece
15,Be3,c1e3,r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/1nnp4/8/2PP2b1/2N1BN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 3 8,overprotecting d4 to allow Qxf3 if needed and developing one more piece
16,g6,g7g6,r2qkb1r/pp2pp1p/1nnp2p1/8/2PP2b1/2N1BN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 9,here it is the expected fianchetto...
17,d5,d4d5,r2qkb1r/pp2pp1p/1nnp2p1/3P4/2P3b1/2N1BN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 9,"and now some little trap instead of the usual and natural h3, black is almost forced to capture Bxf3 as Ne5 allows c5 Nxe5 and Bb5+ to exchange queens with a piece up"
18,Ne5,c6e5,r2qkb1r/pp2pp1p/1n1p2p1/3Pn3/2P3b1/2N1BN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 10,"? but understandable, as exchanging a bishop for a knight is usually perceived as bad, unless it inflicts some structural damage to the pawn structure."
19,c5,c4c5,r2qkb1r/pp2pp1p/1n1p2p1/2PPn3/6b1/2N1BN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 10,And now the trap is set: 10...dxc5 11.Nxe5 Bxd1 12.Bb5+ Nd7 13.Bxd7+ Qxd7 14.Nxd7 Kxd7 15.Kxd1 a piece up for white 10...Bxf3 is slightly better but also not good due to 11.Bb5+ Nbd7 12.gxf3 and white has more space and can still attack black's knight
20,Nc8,b6c8,r1nqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p2p1/2PPn3/6b1/2N1BN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 11,"Up until now we were following Krapivin, V. - Gorbushin, A., 1997, Russia, 1-0; now black deviates but the tactics are still on with this move both Bxf3 and Nbd7 stands any chances against Bb5"
21,Nxe5,f3e5,r1nqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p2p1/2PPN3/6b1/2N1B3/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 11,As Bxd1?? leads to losing material
22,Bxd1,g4d1,r1nqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p2p1/2PPN3/8/2N1B3/PP3PPP/R2bKB1R w KQkq - 0 12,?? black's greed starts a forced sequence
23,Bb5+,f1b5,r1nqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p2p1/1BPPN3/8/2N1B3/PP3PPP/R2bK2R b KQkq - 1 12,only move

27,Bxc8,d7c8,r1Bk1b1r/pp2pp1p/3p2p1/2PPN3/8/2N1B3/PP3PPP/R2bK2R b KQ - 0 14,"? Kxc8 is better as Nxf7 only gains a pawn, but black light squares bishop is miserably placed so black is bond to lose more material anyway.
dxe5 is not better although regaining some material back allows for Bxb7 attacking the rook and after Rb8 then c6 protects the bishop and creates havoc in black's field"
28,Rxc8,a8c8,2rk1b1r/pp2pp1p/3p2p1/2PPN3/8/2N1B3/PP3PPP/R2bK2R w KQ - 0 15,"? Kxc8 is better as Nxf7 only gains a pawn, but black light squares bishop is miserably placed so black is bond to lose more material anyway.
