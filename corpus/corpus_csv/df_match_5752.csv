The real business starts at move 7 in this project.  Jo is a long-time adversary, who has a big plus score against me, so I'm glad I took my opportunities here..."

19,Ne6+,g5e6,rn2qb1r/ppk1p1pp/2p1N3/8/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 2 10,This too is the most popular move.  The knight really clogs up Black's position.
20,Kb6,c7b6,rn2qb1r/pp2p1pp/1kp1N3/8/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 3 11,I think I tried ...Kd6 in another game and got short shrift for my trouble.  This seems much better.
21,Na3,b1a3,rn2qb1r/pp2p1pp/1kp1N3/8/4pPB1/N7/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 4 11,There is a good case for preceding this with 11. a4.  11. d3 is also popular.
22,a6,a7a6,rn2qb1r/1p2p1pp/pkp1N3/8/4pPB1/N7/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 0 12,"Black creates a hole for his K.  The computer prefers 11....a5, leaving the king and knight to argue over a6 and taking control over b4."
23,d3,d2d3,rn2qb1r/1p2p1pp/pkp1N3/8/4pPB1/N2P4/PPP3PP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 0 12,So White aims to cover it with 13. Be3+
24,Nd7,b8d7,r3qb1r/1p1np1pp/pkp1N3/8/4pPB1/N2P4/PPP3PP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 1 13,Black hastens to develop what he can and cover c5.
25,Be3+,c1e3,r3qb1r/1p1np1pp/pkp1N3/8/4pPB1/N2PB3/PPP3PP/R3K2R b KQ - 2 13,"Each has 3 pieces defending c5 but Black can't sustain this indefinitely.  The computer prefers 14...Ka7, making no pretence to defend c5 or develop the R."

Nc4 exd3 19. Ne5 Qd5 20. Nxf8 Rcxf8 21. Nd7+ Kc7 22. Nxf8 Rxf8"

31,O-O,e1g1,2r1qb1r/kp1np1pp/p3N3/2p5/1PN1pPB1/3PB3/P1P3PP/R4RK1 b - - 4 16,This appears to make White's king safer and brings a rook into the action but it also creates opportunities for Black to counter-attack.  The computer prefers the more thematic 16. Nxc5.

34,Rh6,h8h6,2r1qb2/kp1np1p1/p3N2r/2p4p/1PN1pP2/3PB2B/P1P3PP/R4RK1 w - - 2 18,"Black's developmental choices are distinctly restricted, so this move is not as odd as it may look.  The computer prefers Black to clear off the central pawns first, rather than leave the e-pawn hanging."

40,g6,g7g6,4qb2/kp1np3/p1r1Nrp1/2P2P1p/2N1P3/4B2B/P1P3PP/R4RK1 w - - 0 21,Black's turn to attempt to open a file and free up his B.
