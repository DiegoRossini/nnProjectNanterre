1,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Here is my second game of the queen sac arising from Bird's Opening which ended in a welcome victory.  I had the black pieces again but I decided not to put Glenda on e8 this time and try and escape the bind.  This I did and Glenda was instrumental in guiding my rating in a northerly direction, arriving at 1850!  Here is how it happened.  We pick up the action on move 8."
