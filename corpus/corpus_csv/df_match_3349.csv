1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The starting position of the thematic mini-tournament -> the Two Knights Defense, or perhaps more appropriately the Tchigorin Counterattack. This move is more aggressive than 3...Bc5 as it attacks e4 and provokes White to attack f7."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The starting position of the thematic mini-tournament -> the Two Knights Defense, or perhaps more appropriately the Tchigorin Counterattack.

7,Ng5,f3g5,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p1N1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 5 4,"White accepts the challenge, looking to win the pawn, but a complicated tactical game will likely ensue, where Black will try to wrest the initiative."
8,d5,d7d5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3pp1N1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,Also possible are Nd4 and b5 which share related ideas. Black looks to take over by chasing away the bishop/knight and to take control over the center.

11,d3,d2d3,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/n2Pp1N1/2B5/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,A questionable move (but played by none other than Morphy) looking to hold the gambit pawn. Usually white plays 6.Bb5+ c6 7.dxc6 bxc6 8.Be2 h6
12,h6,h7h6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2pp1/5n1p/n2Pp1N1/2B5/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,The principled reply - pushing back with the intent of e4.
13,Nf3,g5f3,r1bqkb1r/ppp2pp1/5n1p/n2Pp3/2B5/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,"Another questionable move, but Black is controlling the game. 8.Qe2 Nxc4 9.dxc4 pinning the e-pawn, or perhaps 8.Ne5 may have been stronger."
14,e4,e5e4,r1bqkb1r/ppp2pp1/5n1p/n2P4/2B1p3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"Another questionable move, but Black is controlling the game. 8.Qe2 Nxc4 9.dxc4 pinning the e-pawn, or perhaps 8.Ne5 may have been stronger."

16,Nxc4,a5c4,r1bqkb1r/ppp2pp1/5n1p/3P4/2n1p3/3P4/PPPN1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,Stronger would have been 9.Nxc4 unblocking his queen from being attacked. (9.Nxc4 Bg4 10.Qd2 Qxd5 11.Nc3 Qc5 12. O-O O-O-O)
17,dxc4,d3c4,r1bqkb1r/ppp2pp1/5n1p/3P4/2P1p3/8/PPPN1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 9,Stronger would have been 9.Nxc4 unblocking his queen from being attacked. (9.Nxc4 Bg4 10.Qd2 Qxd5 11.Nc3 Qc5 12. O-O O-O-O)
18,Bg4,c8g4,r2qkb1r/ppp2pp1/5n1p/3P4/2P1p1b1/8/PPPN1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 10,"I suspect that Bc5 or Bd6 may have been more thematic, but Bg4 certainly adds complications in attacking the kingside at f6."
19,f3,f2f3,r2qkb1r/ppp2pp1/5n1p/3P4/2P1p1b1/5P2/PPPN2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 10,If 11.Nxf3 then 11...Bc5 with the intent to exchange the light-squared bishop for the knight if taken to the task.
20,exf3,e4f3,r2qkb1r/ppp2pp1/5n1p/3P4/2P3b1/5p2/PPPN2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 11,If 11.Nxf3 then 11...Bc5 with the intent to exchange the light-squared bishop for the knight if taken to the task.

22,Bh5,g4h5,r2qkb1r/ppp2pp1/5n1p/3P3b/2P5/5P2/PPPN3P/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 12,Maintaining the pin on the weak f-pawn to the queen and striking into White's center.
23,Qe2+,d1e2,r2qkb1r/ppp2pp1/5n1p/3P3b/2P5/5P2/PPPNQ2P/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 2 12,"Nc3 I suspect was more principled - the Queen check does very little at the moment as it is easily blocked, and it's always dangerous to align your Queen in front of the King."
24,Be7,f8e7,r2qk2r/ppp1bpp1/5n1p/3P3b/2P5/5P2/PPPNQ2P/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 3 13,Simply blocking the check and allowing for castling.
25,Rg1,h1g1,r2qk2r/ppp1bpp1/5n1p/3P3b/2P5/5P2/PPPNQ2P/RNB1K1R1 b Qkq - 4 13,"Black looks to take over the semi-open g-file, but I feel this may have been premature as the minors are hardly involved. The rook threat is mitigated through simply castling."
