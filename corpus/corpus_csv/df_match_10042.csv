6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/3PP3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 4,Perhaps e6 looks better. The knight can be displaced by e4-e5 costing tempo.
7,e5,e4e5,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3pP3/3P4/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 4,A blunder because the knight will be trapped.

9,f3,f2f3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p5/3pP3/3Pn3/3B1P2/PPP3PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,Maybe the best idea for trying to compensate for the blunder 4...Ne4 by siezing control of the center after 6.fxe4 fxe4.

15,Bg4,e2g4,rn1qkb1r/pp2p1pp/2p5/3pPb2/3Pp1B1/8/PPP3PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 3 8,"With the idea of exchanging bishops with white influencing the c8-h3 diagonal, and watching g7, by the Queen."
16,Bxg4,f5g4,rn1qkb1r/pp2p1pp/2p5/3pP3/3Pp1b1/8/PPP3PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 9,Wedging black by blockading the e7 pawn on its home square to restrict black.
17,Qxg4,d1g4,rn1qkb1r/pp2p1pp/2p5/3pP3/3Pp1Q1/8/PPP3PP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 0 9,Wedging black by blockading the e7 pawn on its home square to restrict black.

22,Qc7,d8c7,r3kb1r/ppq1p1pp/2p1Pn2/3p4/3Pp3/7Q/PPP3PP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 3 12,Developing for castling. There is 11...Qa5 for an option with 12.Nc3 a response. It isn't much of an alternate move because there is a lack of pieces to join in an attack queenside. The influence of the pawn wedge on the f8 bishop and lack of mobility for the f6 knight can be observed.
