1,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Another game in freddy's second Annotation Project--In this one, I'm playing my friend Joanne.  While I'm sure others will find other errors made in this game, I believe that this game revolves around Two Errors--the first by Joanne and the second by me.  The action begins at move 9."

Nc3 to avoid 12...Bxc3, hurting her pawn structure in the exchange.  Indeed, I have played Bxc3 in another game in this tourney.  In this game, that Knight never moves again."

Black's Queen is in a good position and Black's King is tucked away.  White has lost her two most active pieces, she is behind in development, and behind in material."

45,Re3,e4e3,r4r2/pkp1p3/1p6/7p/5Pp1/N2PR2P/PPP3PK/1RBq4 b - - 1 23,22. Re3 seems an error to me as it allowed my rook to get much more involved.

I still don't know what my plan was by 24...gxh3.  This was not a rushed move--simply an error in thinking.  Much, much better would have been Rf1.  I worked out a few lines and they all led to a Black win after 24...Rf1."
