7,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2pP4/3P4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,The main problem for Black in Queen's Gambit opening is his bishop on c8. Tarrasch's idea was to solve that problem by this exchange 4...exd5. Now the bishop on c8 is ready to take part in the game much early. The drawback of this opening is the Black pawn on d5 which is likely to become isolated which could be a double edged position. The struggle revolves around the Black's isolani on d5 whether it is a strength or weakness.

Black is probably not inclined to support the hanging pawns and tie-down his pieces. I also thought that this is a trap if the c6 pawn is taken. Black has declared aggressive intentions. After a closer look at the position, I played the next move."

Is White wrong in grabbing a pawn? Tarrasch's ideas are beginning to take shape.
