1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Classic
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Black responds with a classical opening, I prefer a modern opening: The Sicilian Defense, but to each his own."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,?!?!?!?!?!?!  A awful move that not only fails to protect the e5 pawn (See next move) but does not develop any pieces either.
4,f6,f7f6,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,?!?!?!?!?!?!  A awful move that not only fails to protect the e5 pawn (See next move) but does not develop any pieces either.
5,Nxe5,f3e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"! A trick opening that leads to no disadvantages for White.  If Black recaptures than White goes on a forceful attack ...fxe5? 4. Qh5+!, Ke7 (...g6 leads to the capture of Black's Rook) 5. Qxe5+, Kf7 6. Bc4+, d5 (...Kg6 leads to 7. Qf5+, Kh6 8. d4+, g5 9. h4, no move can save black now... 10. hxg5+, Kg7 11. Qf7#) back to the main line 7. Bxd5+, Kg6 8. Bxb7!, (Black cannot take back because it is protecting the f5 square and white wins blacks rook.  That was a long-winded way of saying that 2 ..., f6?? is a terrible move and fxe5??????? is a worse one."
6,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/3p1p2/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"A OK move, but now the dark square bishop is trapped"
7,Nf3,e5f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/3p1p2/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"""Not aggressive but fundamentally sound"" is what someone may say, but they're wrong.  4. Qh5+! leads to a rook capture."
8,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp4pp/2pp1p2/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,? Black removes the best square for his knight and does not accomplish much
9,d3,d2d3,rnbqkbnr/pp4pp/2pp1p2/8/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"A bad move by me for obvious reasons, 5. d4 is better."
10,d5,d6d5,rnbqkbnr/pp4pp/2p2p2/3p4/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Black has not moved a non-pawn piece, he will quickly fall behind in development and center control."
