1,b3,b2b3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Doing this just because I was tired of what I usually move first as White.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,Not committing any central pawns yet.
3,Bb2,c1b2,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/8/1P6/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 2 2,Very conservative by me. My opponent eventually does get quite a space advantage but does not make use of it.
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/8/1P6/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Very conservative by me. My opponent eventually does get quite a space advantage but does not make use of it.
5,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/8/1P2P3/PBPP1PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,Very conservative by me. My opponent eventually does get quite a space advantage but does not make use of it.
6,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/8/1P2P3/PBPP1PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,Clamping down on the white position. C5 would have been interesting here.
7,d4,d2d4,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/3P4/1P2P3/PBP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,Clamping down on the white position. C5 would have been interesting here.
8,d5,d7d5,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3p4/3P4/1P2P3/PBP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,Clamping down on the white position. C5 would have been interesting here.
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3p4/3P4/1PN1P3/PBP2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 1 5,"With this move, the center will stay locked up for a long time."
10,c6,c7c6,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/2p2np1/3p4/3P4/1PN1P3/PBP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"With this move, the center will stay locked up for a long time."
11,Be2,f1e2,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/2p2np1/3p4/3P4/1PN1P3/PBP1BPPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 1 6,"Bd3 might have been better, to contest e4 more and eye the black kingside."
12,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bqk2r/pp1nppbp/2p2np1/3p4/3P4/1PN1P3/PBP1BPPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 2 7,The game is mostly equal here.
13,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqk2r/pp1nppbp/2p2np1/3p4/3P4/1PN1PN2/PBP1BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 3 7,Just developing moveds for a bit.
14,Qc7,d8c7,r1b1k2r/ppqnppbp/2p2np1/3p4/3P4/1PN1PN2/PBP1BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 4 8,"During the game, I decided to mostly move here to tempt black to weaken the C5 square. But it's mostly a feint. Moving the knight in general to the edge of the board is not usually a good move, but in this position it's not bad."
15,O-O,e1g1,r1b1k2r/ppqnppbp/2p2np1/3p4/3P4/1PN1PN2/PBP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 5 8,"During the game, I decided to mostly move here to tempt black to weaken the C5 square. But it's mostly a feint. Moving the knight in general to the edge of the board is not usually a good move, but in this position it's not bad."
16,O-O,e8g8,r1b2rk1/ppqnppbp/2p2np1/3p4/3P4/1PN1PN2/PBP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 6 9,"During the game, I decided to mostly move here to tempt black to weaken the C5 square. But it's mostly a feint. Moving the knight in general to the edge of the board is not usually a good move, but in this position it's not bad."
17,Na4,c3a4,r1b2rk1/ppqnppbp/2p2np1/3p4/N2P4/1P2PN2/PBP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 7 9,"During the game, I decided to mostly move here to tempt black to weaken the C5 square. But it's mostly a feint.

18,Ne4,f6e4,r1b2rk1/ppqnppbp/2p3p1/3p4/N2Pn3/1P2PN2/PBP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 8 10,The black knight won't stay there too long. Premature to do this?
19,Bd3,e2d3,r1b2rk1/ppqnppbp/2p3p1/3p4/N2Pn3/1P1BPN2/PBP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 9 10,"Admitting that Be2 was a mistake. I had other choices here of course, and thought about moving c4. But I did not want the position opening up yet, despite the fact that allowing it to stay closed is better for black right now."
20,f5,f7f5,r1b2rk1/ppqnp1bp/2p3p1/3p1p2/N2Pn3/1P1BPN2/PBP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 11,"I don't like this black move. it leaves the black Kingside really open. I can't take advantage of that for a long while, but I am not going to trade on e4, which is perhaps what black was hoping for."
21,Kh1,g1h1,r1b2rk1/ppqnp1bp/2p3p1/3p1p2/N2Pn3/1P1BPN2/PBP2PPP/R2Q1R1K b - - 1 11,"This was not the best move, but I am planning on moving the f pawn, and want the king off of the a7-g1 diagonal. It's a long preparation for chasing the knight, and black eventually gains an advantage because of it."
22,a5,a7a5,r1b2rk1/1pqnp1bp/2p3p1/p2p1p2/N2Pn3/1P1BPN2/PBP2PPP/R2Q1R1K w - - 0 12,Perhaps black is entertaining ideas of a queenside attack with this move.
23,Ng1,f3g1,r1b2rk1/1pqnp1bp/2p3p1/p2p1p2/N2Pn3/1P1BP3/PBP2PPP/R2Q1RNK b - - 1 12,"This move is too slow, and black has a tiny push now on the queenside."
24,b5,b7b5,r1b2rk1/2qnp1bp/2p3p1/pp1p1p2/N2Pn3/1P1BP3/PBP2PPP/R2Q1RNK w - - 0 13,The best thing for white to do.
25,Nc3,a4c3,r1b2rk1/2qnp1bp/2p3p1/pp1p1p2/3Pn3/1PNBP3/PBP2PPP/R2Q1RNK b - - 1 13,The best thing for white to do.
26,Nb6,d7b6,r1b2rk1/2q1p1bp/1np3p1/pp1p1p2/3Pn3/1PNBP3/PBP2PPP/R2Q1RNK w - - 2 14,"Instead of an immediate push of the queenside pawns, black has moved Nb6 here. This allows me the tempo I needed to move the f pawn, although black's idea is to really strangle the queenside here, and it's not a bad plan."
27,f3,f2f3,r1b2rk1/2q1p1bp/1np3p1/pp1p1p2/3Pn3/1PNBPP2/PBP3PP/R2Q1RNK b - - 0 14,"Practically forced, for black to maintan his initiative on the queenside."
28,Nxc3,e4c3,r1b2rk1/2q1p1bp/1np3p1/pp1p1p2/3P4/1PnBPP2/PBP3PP/R2Q1RNK w - - 0 15,"Practically forced, for black to maintan his initiative on the queenside."
29,Bxc3,b2c3,r1b2rk1/2q1p1bp/1np3p1/pp1p1p2/3P4/1PBBPP2/P1P3PP/R2Q1RNK b - - 0 15,"A sharp move. The intent is to allow the queenside pawn advances. I don't like, finally, white's position here; black has a clear advantage to me. I decide to give up a pawn here, depending on what black does, and blunt his pawn advance."
30,e5,e7e5,r1b2rk1/2q3bp/1np3p1/pp1ppp2/3P4/1PBBPP2/P1P3PP/R2Q1RNK w - - 0 16,"A sharp move. The intent is to allow the queenside pawn advances.

31,e4,e3e4,r1b2rk1/2q3bp/1np3p1/pp1ppp2/3PP3/1PBB1P2/P1P3PP/R2Q1RNK b - - 0 16,"Some may consider this a blunder, but I am thinking about the position; I'd rather have chances with a tactical opportunity by a more open board, than be crushed by black's superior positioning, to this point in this game. My opponent is ranked around the expert level or a bit higher; he's no slouch."
