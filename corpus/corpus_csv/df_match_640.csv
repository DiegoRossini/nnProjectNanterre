1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was a rather painful loss from a couple of years ago. Our knock-out team were away to Pen-y-Ffordd. On paper they seemed a perfect match for us, with 2 stronger players and then a big gap and 4 weaker players. Unfortunately when we turned up, I found that they had a couple of ""ringers"" - Pat Bennett being one of them - who hadn't played for Pen-y-Ffordd before or since. At the time Pat out-graded me, but most of my other players were out-graded by an even higher amount, so although I was black, and faced what was on paper a stronger opponent, I wanted to win!"
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,So it starts conventionally enough.

5,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,I was wondering if this was going to transpose into a Gr端nfeld Defence

10,d5,d7d5,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3p4/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 0 6,"I play this, mainly because it is played in the Gr端nfeld Defence. I play in the same 4NCL league team as my opponent, and I asked him months later whether or not he had specially prepared this opening against me. He replied that he had prepared it, not against me specifically, but generally against Gr端nfeld Defence players."
