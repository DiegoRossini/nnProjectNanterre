1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Getting close to the end of the tournament. I needed a win from this game to rise into sixth place and to retain a chance of fourth place (if I win my last game as well).

13,Bxf7+,c4f7,rn1qkb1r/pp2pBpp/8/2p3N1/4pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 7,I choose Kc6 rather than Kc7 as the latter forces Black to lose time avoiding the Ne6+ fork. I have tried Ke8 in two games in this tournament but it turns out to be the worst option of all (apart from the obviously bad Kd6).
14,Kd7,e8d7,rn1q1b1r/pp1kpBpp/8/2p3N1/4pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 1 8,I choose Kc6 rather than Kc7 as the latter forces Black to lose time avoiding the Ne6+ fork. I have tried Ke8 in two games in this tournament but it turns out to be the worst option of all (apart from the obviously bad Kd6).

17,Bxg4,e6g4,rn1q1b1r/pp2p1pp/2k5/2p3N1/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 0 9,This also has proved to be Black's best option judging by games so far. Black offers the pawn for the chance to catch up on development.
18,e6,e7e6,rn1q1b1r/pp4pp/2k1p3/2p3N1/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 0 10,This also has proved to be Black's best option judging by games so far. Black offers the pawn for the chance to catch up on development.

21,Ngxe4,g5e4,r2q1b1r/pp4pp/n1k1p3/2p5/4NPB1/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 0 11,"(?!) White grabs the e4 pawn, which was doomed in any case, but gives up his threat on the e6 pawn and allows Black's queen in at h4. This does not win material, since Nf2 defends the bishop, but it does increase Black's activity and reduce White's."
22,Qh4+,d8h4,r4b1r/pp4pp/n1k1p3/2p5/4NPBq/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 1 12,Now with the queen on h4 (so Kd1 is ruled out as a defence) this move is good.
