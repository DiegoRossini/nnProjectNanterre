10,Bc5,b4c5,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/P2P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 6,The classical variation of the Evans gambit. Main line is O-O here but instead I strike the centre first.

16,h6,h7h6,r1bqk1nr/pppp1pp1/1bn4p/8/2BPP3/5N2/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 9,Time wasting move although there wasn't really any good moves. Nf6 would get crushed by e5. Na5 or d6was probably best here although i could play Ng5 if he played d6.
17,Bb2,c1b2,r1bqk1nr/pppp1pp1/1bn4p/8/2BPP3/5N2/PB3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 1 9,My bishop is now on the long a1-h8 diagonal and exerts a tonne of pressure.

20,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pppp1pp1/1bn2n1p/8/2BPP3/5N2/PB3PPP/RN1QR1K1 w - - 4 11,Passive square for the knight. Now I am probably overextending my pawns. He/she has a queenside pawn majority of 3-1. ALthough i have a nice space advantage he is still up a pawn and could hold the position together. Hiss extra pawn may win for him in the endgame.
