1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Notes By Travis Colon

My Opponent is not very strong, but I just needed to annotate another game so I can get the feel of what I'm doing. If you guys have any tips for me to help me with my annotating or calculation, it would be much appreciated. Again, this is only my second annotation, so it won't be very good. The game isn't so good either."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"Usually play continues 3.d4 and then 4.e4, yet my opponent chooses e4 and never plays d4. Most likely a lack of experience on his part."

6,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2P1P3/2N5/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"? A bad move. Developing the bishop would have been much better after d4. Now the d-pawn is blocked, and white must spend another tempo to move the bishop."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,"? A bad move. Developing the bishop would have been much better after d4. Now the d-pawn is blocked, and white must spend another tempo to move the bishop."

I would have to retreat my queen, wasting tempo, as 8.nb5 bxb5 9.cxb5 gives white the two bishops and strong queenside play."
