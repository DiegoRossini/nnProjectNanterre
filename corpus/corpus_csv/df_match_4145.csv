1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The start of the game proper.  White is supporting the central e-pawn and activating the dsb, although the computer considers this a weak move.  Castling and taking the bishop are far and away the most popular options, and seem to do well for White."

9,Bxc6,b5c6,r1bqkbnr/1p1ppp1p/p1B3p1/2p5/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,Capturing towards the centre.
10,bxc6,b7c6,r1bqkbnr/3ppp1p/p1p3p1/2p5/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,Capturing towards the centre.
11,c4,c2c4,r1bqkbnr/3ppp1p/p1p3p1/2p5/2P1P3/3P1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,The point of 3. ... g6 was to allow this move.  Black gains decent control of one of the long diagonals.
12,Bg7,f8g7,r1bqk1nr/3pppbp/p1p3p1/2p5/2P1P3/3P1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 7,The point of 3. ... g6 was to allow this move.  Black gains decent control of one of the long diagonals.
13,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk1nr/3pppbp/p1p3p1/2p5/2P1P3/3P1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 2 7,7. ... e6 was obviously intending d5 to follow.  Establishing the rook at e1 makes opening up the centre less palatable for Black.
14,e6,e7e6,r1bqk1nr/3p1pbp/p1p1p1p1/2p5/2P1P3/3P1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,7. ... e6 was obviously intending d5 to follow.  Establishing the rook at e1 makes opening up the centre less palatable for Black.

16,Ne7,g8e7,r1bqk2r/3pnpbp/p1p1p1p1/2p5/2P1P3/3P1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq - 2 9,"Not considered a mistake or inaccuracy by the computer, but it does shift the evaluation down by about 1/3 of a pawn.  Black's aim is to open up for castling without blocking the bishop at g7.  The knight has more opportunity to be useful from here than from h6."
17,e5,e4e5,r1bqk2r/3pnpbp/p1p1p1p1/2p1P3/2P5/3P1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq - 0 9,Seals off the bishop at g7 and is well supported here.  Also creates issues for the lsb developing through the e6 pawn.
18,d6,d7d6,r1bqk2r/4npbp/p1ppp1p1/2p1P3/2P5/3P1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq - 0 10,"Black attempts to break the deadlock.  The computer takes another third of a pawn here, leaving Black at -1."
19,Bf4,c1f4,r1bqk2r/4npbp/p1ppp1p1/2p1P3/2P2B2/3P1N2/PP3PPP/RN1QR1K1 b kq - 1 10,An unnecessary further reinforcing of the pawn.  White can instead win a pawn here with exd6 followed by Nc3.
20,d5,d6d5,r1bqk2r/4npbp/p1p1p1p1/2ppP3/2P2B2/3P1N2/PP3PPP/RN1QR1K1 w kq - 0 11,Black changes plans and opts to try undoubling his pawns.  His bishops are still in trouble and dxe5 was probably better.
21,cxd5,c4d5,r1bqk2r/4npbp/p1p1p1p1/2pPP3/5B2/3P1N2/PP3PPP/RN1QR1K1 b kq - 0 11,An uncertain move for me.  It doesn't seem to have much purpose.
22,cxd5,c6d5,r1bqk2r/4npbp/p3p1p1/2ppP3/5B2/3P1N2/PP3PPP/RN1QR1K1 w kq - 0 12,An uncertain move for me.  It doesn't seem to have much purpose.

26,Qb6,d8b6,r1b2rk1/4npbp/pq2p1p1/2ppP3/5B2/1P1P1N2/P1Q2PPP/RN2R1K1 w - - 3 14,"Bad.  Black has designs on winning a piece and, even if he doesn't, he still claims a small pawn wedge in the middle of the board.  But White can severly cramp his style in a line that, according to the computer, leaves White ahead two pawns.  It prefers 14. ... Bd7 to deter that line."
27,Nc3,b1c3,r1b2rk1/4npbp/pq2p1p1/2ppP3/5B2/1PNP1N2/P1Q2PPP/R3R1K1 b - - 4 14,"Bad.

30,Qd8,b6d8,r1bq1rk1/4npbp/p3p1p1/2p1P3/N2p1B2/1P1P1N2/P1Q2PPP/R3R1K1 w - - 2 16,"Not sure about this move.  Black is under pressure and the pawn at c5 is lost, and he wants to preserve the queen rather than entice the enemy into attempting the exchange and offer protection to the d-pawn.  The computer prefers Qc6 but this scores about the same."
31,Qxc5,c2c5,r1bq1rk1/4npbp/p3p1p1/2Q1P3/N2p1B2/1P1P1N2/P4PPP/R3R1K1 b - - 0 16,Protecting the d4 pawn.

35,Bg5,f4g5,r2q1rk1/1b3pbp/p3p1p1/2Q1PnB1/N2p4/1P1P1N2/P4PPP/2R1R1K1 b - - 4 18,"The only place from which the bishop won't immediately be moved on again, and it allows the bishop to swing over to the queenside.  However, exf6 would have opened up the e-file for White's well-placed rook and would have been better."
