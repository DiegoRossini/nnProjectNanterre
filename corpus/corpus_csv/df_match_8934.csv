1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone, welcome to another match between me and Coach Ion where I was the loser.  Unfortunately in this one there is no pretence of equality as there was between me and Master Freddy (easy19).  I did try to conquer my disease, passivitis, but I had to go the wrong way about it, didn't I?  Ion gives me an opportunity to build a strong pawn centre and get some play with a hypermodern opening such as the Robatsch Defense.  This Defense by black is designed to undermine white's strong pawn centre and to place his dsb on g7 raking down to the white a1 rook, so the b pawn is pinned to that rook unless black moves a knight to f6.  Anyhow, on with the game."
