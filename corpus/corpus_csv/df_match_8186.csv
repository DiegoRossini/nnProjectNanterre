2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The King has been chased off to the Q-side, where it is exposed to attack by White's swarm of minor pieces.  White has garnered two minor pieces for his Q but both of his extra two are as yet undeveloped, so this is his priority, even with the potential fork on f7 available."
