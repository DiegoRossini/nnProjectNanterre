1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This is the first of a hopefully short series of games where I lose primarily after a single blunder. During my current slump in form and rating this has happened a little too often for my liking. I hope that others can learn from my mistakes. This particular game is I believe one of the classic finishes that I totally overlooked.
