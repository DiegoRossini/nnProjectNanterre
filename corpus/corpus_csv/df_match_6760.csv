1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Another chastening defeat at the hands of the Master Mater.  Just when I thought I was learning to avoid destructive trades, what does The Beginner do?  She goes in for one doesn't she?  In mitigation, it was to rid myself of Freddy's rook that had just got into my area of the board and when a piece like that does that you wanna get shot of it at the earliest opportunity, wouldn't you?  Well, sometimes it is better to just hold your horses a bit.  The game starts off with 1. e5 c5 which is a Sicilian Defense."
