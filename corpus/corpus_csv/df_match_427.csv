1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"In this, the third of our 'coaching' games, I relayed my thought processes - in fairly general terms - in the chat column.  It is a pity I didn't preserve them in some way.  Neither side played very accurately - but I think there is plenty of interest here."
2,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Dutch Defence.  Whenever I play this I have the Stonewall in mind.  Very occasionally, though, I follow with the Leningrad Dutch instead."
3,g3,g2g3,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/3P4/6P1/PPP1PP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Theory holds this as one of White's best - certainly a very popular - responses to the Dutch Defence.  For all its solid, defensive appellation and appearance, the Stonewall is in fact quite an aggressive line, as is the Dutch overall.  That f-pawn move rather says to White: 'I going toe to toe with you, so watch it!'  White builds as strong a defence as she can on the K-side."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppppp1pp/5n2/5p2/3P4/6P1/PPP1PP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"Normally I play 2...e6, but this knight development is equally good.  It is just transposing moves."
5,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqkb1r/ppppp1pp/5n2/5p2/3P4/6P1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 3,"The space having been cleared for the bishop, the bishop occupies it at once."
6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1p1pp/5n2/3p1p2/3P4/6P1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 4,"Definitely aiming for the Stonewall formation of pawns at f5, d5 and e6, c6.  It is a very solid and strong centre formation.  There are several of downsides, though. One is that the dark squares, especially e5, can be infiltrated by White.  Another is that Black's light-square bishop can become something of a problem child - what to do with it?  Yet the line was good enough for GM M. Botvinnik to adopt it in World Championship match games.  Indeed both players tried it at least once each the Botvinnik-Bronstein match of 1951."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1p1pp/5n2/3p1p2/3P4/5NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"Interrupting the programme in favour of development.  The move 5...c6 would have been thematic and fine, but the move played is still 'book'.  Incidentally, when playing the Stonewall, I much prefer, if I can, to develop the bishop at d6 rather than e7."
8,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/ppp3pp/4pn2/3p1p2/3P4/5NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"Interrupting the programme in favour of development.  The move 5...c6 would have been thematic and fine, but the move played is still 'book'.  Incidentally, when playing the Stonewall, I much prefer, if I can, to develop the bishop at d6 rather than e7."
9,O-O,e1g1,rnbqkb1r/ppp3pp/4pn2/3p1p2/3P4/5NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 5,"Interrupting the programme in favour of development.

10,Bd6,f8d6,rnbqk2r/ppp3pp/3bpn2/3p1p2/3P4/5NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 6,"Interrupting the programme in favour of development.

11,c3,c2c3,rnbqk2r/ppp3pp/3bpn2/3p1p2/3P4/2P2NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 6,"Rather conservative, I thought.  The move is solid enough, and quite safe, but the drawback (it seems to me) is that subsequently White will have trouble formulating a plan.  I was expecting 6.c4, here, to which I was planning to reply 6...c6.  This would have opened a nice retreat square for the bishop after a possible 7.c5!?"
12,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp3pp/3bpn2/3p1p2/3P4/2P2NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 1 7,At this point the Gameknot Engine (GKE) assesses the game at B0.21 (The B infront of the number indicates a Black edge).  But any margin less than W/B0.50 is really too close to call and denotes an equal game.
13,Nbd2,b1d2,rnbq1rk1/ppp3pp/3bpn2/3p1p2/3P4/2P2NP1/PP1NPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 2 7,"Had White played c4 the previous miove, this knight could have been developed at c3.  Would that have been a more active location?  Possibly not.  By this move, White opens up the possibility of moving the f3-knight to e5, and following with the other knight to f3.  That is quite a thematic motif in play against the Stonewall, but it is no simple matter to arrange.  Black might, for example, choose to exchange on e5 with a knight at d7, or even the d6-bishop."
14,Bd7,c8d7,rn1q1rk1/pppb2pp/3bpn2/3p1p2/3P4/2P2NP1/PP1NPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 3 8,"Blocks the knight, which may not have been the smartest option.  I was planning to bring the bishop back to e8 after which it might find useful employment at h5 or g6.  The GKE now calls the game so nearly equal it makes no difference: W0.03."
15,Ne1,f3e1,rn1q1rk1/pppb2pp/3bpn2/3p1p2/3P4/2P3P1/PP1NPPBP/R1BQNRK1 b - - 4 8,"This retreat might look unnecessary and timid, but it harbours (or ought to do) some nasty intent.  I really did expect that White intended to follow with 9.f4.  That had a big influence on my reply."
16,g5,g7g5,rn1q1rk1/pppb3p/3bpn2/3p1pp1/3P4/2P3P1/PP1NPPBP/R1BQNRK1 w - - 0 9,"[!?] GKE calls this an inaccuracy, offering the following line: 8â€¦ g5 9. Ndf3 h6 10. Ne5 Nc6 11. Nxd7 Qxd7 12. Nd3 ...  But as its assessment is just W0.27 (from B0.30 the previous move) there really isn't a lot in it.  I accepted the line was probably too aggressive too early, but I was prepared to take the risk.  As it happens White probably had a better move than 9.f4 in mind, but rather to bring the knights to d3 and f3, training them against e5.  That would have been a very good plan and well executed too: 8...Nc6 9. Nd3 Qe8 10. Nf3 Ne4 11. Be3 Qh5 12. Nc5 Bxc5 13. dxc5 g5 14. Qc2 f4 15. gxf4 gxf4 (GKE).  But this line looks fine for Black, in my view."
17,c4,c3c4,rn1q1rk1/pppb3p/3bpn2/3p1pp1/2PP4/6P1/PP1NPPBP/R1BQNRK1 b - - 0 9,"Possibly better would have been 9.Ndf3 as suggested by the GKE, and let this pawn push wait upon activating the White pieces."
18,c6,c7c6,rn1q1rk1/pp1b3p/2pbpn2/3p1pp1/2PP4/6P1/PP1NPPBP/R1BQNRK1 w - - 0 10,"Black was not interested in exchanging pawns on c4, which would have been very pleasing for White.  Instead I invite 10.c5 Bc7.  White doesn't bite. All the same the GKE mislikes this, and suggests White would have done well to follow up with 10.c5: ...Bc7 11. Nd3 g4 12. Nb3 Na6 13. Bh6 Re8 14. Ne5 Bxe5 15. dxe5 Ne4 16. Qd4 b6 17. cxb6 axb6.  It prefers ...Nc6, but if then 10.c5!?, Be7 leaves the bishop on a less active diagonal.  Having said all that, neither line led to a definable edge to either side, the assessment still being well within the W/B0.50 range."
19,Nc2,e1c2,rn1q1rk1/pp1b3p/2pbpn2/3p1pp1/2PP4/6P1/PPNNPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 10,"This bespeaks possibly too defensive an attitude of mind.  Much better was 10.Nd3, prodding that tender point, e5.  True, Black would have repsonded with 10...g4, stopping the other knight reaching f3, but then White could have begun preparations for Queen side operations.  GKE offers this: 10. Nd3 g4 11. c5 Bc7 12. Nb3 Na6 13. Bh6 Re8 14. Ne5 Ne4 15. Nxd7 Qxd7 16. f3 gxf3 17. exf3, which looks pretty good for White."
20,h5,h7h5,rn1q1rk1/pp1b4/2pbpn2/3p1ppp/2PP4/6P1/PPNNPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 11,"Really announcing my intention to attack all out on the King side.  This is actually fairly risky, as Black can point to no real advantage to justify this.  Nor is the centre fully closed.  I am rather trusting that the centre is sufficiently locked up that it won't explode under some counter action by White in that part of the board.  The alternative 10...Na6 never crossed my mind at all, and I doubt I would have played it if it had.  I think I might have chosen 10...Be8 instead."
21,cxd5,c4d5,rn1q1rk1/pp1b4/2pbpn2/3P1ppp/3P4/6P1/PPNNPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 11,"For the first time, the GKE gives the advantage .... to White!  I admit that in normal circumstances I would have chosen to recapture with the c-pawn, with an even game.  But I wanted to keep the g2-bishop's long diagonal closed up as much as possible, and open up the c8-h3 diagonal for my own light-square bishop (LSB, c.f. DSB).  The main risk lies in the slight loosening of the centre, which can only favour White."
22,exd5,e6d5,rn1q1rk1/pp1b4/2pb1n2/3p1ppp/3P4/6P1/PPNNPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 12,"For the first time, the GKE gives the advantage .... to White!

23,Nf3,d2f3,rn1q1rk1/pp1b4/2pb1n2/3p1ppp/3P4/5NP1/PPN1PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 12,"By attacking the g5-pawn in this way, White maintains a slight edge."
24,Ne4,f6e4,rn1q1rk1/pp1b4/2pb4/3p1ppp/3Pn3/5NP1/PPN1PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 2 13,"Possibly safer would have been 12...Nh7, but I wasn't interested in 'playing safe'.   But it was not going to be easy maintaining the knight at this outpost.  The Queen's knight is far too distant."
