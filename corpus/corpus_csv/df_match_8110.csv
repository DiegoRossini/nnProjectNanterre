1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is my fourth annotation. In this annotation I would like to show you how you can come back from being the underdog near the beginning. As said in previous annotations, I always start with the king's pawn."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,One of the most common defences for this move. I was actually expecting this.
3,Qf3,d1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 1 2,Probably not the best option. Blocking a knight and a pawn. Attacking the black pawn on e5 would have been better.
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 2 3,"Just in case I went for the early checkmate, it was blocked."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/2N2Q2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 3 3,So my knight comes out to further defend the king's pawn.
6,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1p1p/5np1/4p3/4P3/2N2Q2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Could have played a move that opened up the centre of the board a bit more.
7,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1p1p/5np1/4p3/2B1P3/2N2Q2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 1 4,The bishop comes out and my pieces start to take territory on the board.
8,c6,c7c6,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1p1p/2p2np1/4p3/2B1P3/2N2Q2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 0 5,A move which opens up a queen and closes off a knight.
9,d3,d2d3,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1p1p/2p2np1/4p3/2B1P3/2NP1Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 0 5,Opening up the bishop on c1 to dominate the centre of the board.
10,b5,b7b5,rnbqkb1r/p2p1p1p/2p2np1/1p2p3/2B1P3/2NP1Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 0 6,Comes to attack my bishop.
11,Bb3,c4b3,rnbqkb1r/p2p1p1p/2p2np1/1p2p3/4P3/1BNP1Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 1 6,The only place I could move without being taken.
12,a5,a7a5,rnbqkb1r/3p1p1p/2p2np1/pp2p3/4P3/1BNP1Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 0 7,"About to close in my bishop. This is unstoppable, so I keep playing until he decides to attack."
13,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/3p1p1p/2p2np1/pp2p1B1/4P3/1BNP1Q2/PPP2PPP/R3K1NR b KQkq - 1 7,The defence for the knight. Also defending his queen in the process.
14,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/3pbp1p/2p2np1/pp2p1B1/4P3/1BNP1Q2/PPP2PPP/R3K1NR w KQkq - 2 8,The defence for the knight. Also defending his queen in the process.
15,O-O-O,e1c1,rnbqk2r/3pbp1p/2p2np1/pp2p1B1/4P3/1BNP1Q2/PPP2PPP/2KR2NR b kq - 3 8,"I castle queen side. Time to defend the king. Castling usually puts the king away and pretty safe if the pawns in front are there. Give the king a bit of room to move around though, otherwise if trapped, the game could be over in a few moves."
