1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone, I found this game in my old folder.  This, I suppose you could call a king hunt.  I did not get to deliver checkmate but I did net a big material gain as a result of it which did at least force eventual resignation.

To put the result of this game into perspective, well, it was my second game against Andrew that evening.  It was Andrew's first evening and he had an estimated BCF rating of 120 - translated into ELO above.  The first game which I played against him as black ended in disaster as follows:-

1. d4 d5 
2. c4 dxc4 
3. Nc3 Nf6 
4. e4 e5 
5. d5 Bb4 
6. Qa4  c6 
7. Qxb4 cxd5 
8. exd5 Nxd5 
9. Qb5  Resigns"
