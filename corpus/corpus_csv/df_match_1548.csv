My knight position improves, but white's queen position does not, so this is a free beneficial move."

Then 12...Nxc2+ wins a rook, but there likely would be tactical complications with open lines on the kingside and the a1 knight trying not to get trapped. I considered 11...Bg5 but preferred a lead in development, pressure, active pieces, and the bishop pair to being up the Exchange with complications."
