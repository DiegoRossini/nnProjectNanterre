1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"My very oldest and latest thought in this opening. To the chess
addict nurtured on spineless convention, this move comes like a
slap in the face--but calm down, dear reader; after all, you cannot
be expected to understand such moves. (Forgive me - it is not your
fault, until now no one has opened your eyes and ears.) Wait just a
little while, and there will pass before you a miracle of
overprotection of more than earthly beauty. (I assume that I rightly
surmise that you are quite familiar with my great theory of
overprotection.)"

4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/4P2P/8/PPPP1PP1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Black of course has no suspicion of What is coming and continues
serenely in classical style."
5,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3pP3/7P/8/PPPP1PP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"A move of elemental delicacy. (We detest, as a matter of principle,
such words as ""power"" and ""strength""; in the first place, such banal
expressions make us uncomfortable; and, in the second place, we
like even less the brutalizing tendency which such words imply.)

Wherein lies the beauty of 3 e5? Why is this move so strong?

The answer is as simple as it is astonishing. The move is strong
because it is weak! Weak, that is, only in the traditional sense! In
reality, that is to say, it is not the move but the Pawn on K5 that is
weak--a tremendous difference! In former times, it is true, it was
customary to reject any move ,which created a weakness. Today,
thanks to me, this view is obsolete. For, look, my dear reader, the
fact that the Pawn on e5 is weak obliges White to protect the Pawn
more and more until at last the state of overprotection arises as it
were of itself. But, as we have seen (cf. My System),
overprotection is practically equivalent to victory. Hence it follows
automatically that the ""weak"" move, 3 e5, is a certain road to
triumph. The rest is more or less a matter of technique."
6,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/7P/8/PPPP1PP1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Here it is quite clear that it is more profitable for White first to
provoke c5 and then play d4, rather than the other way round,
which is the customary course. For, if White first plays d4, there
follows c5 and White's d-pawn is under attack. But my clever
transposition of moves changes the situation completely. For now
Black's c-pawn is suddenly attacked by White's d-pawn!"

9,h5,h4h5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/3pP2P/3p4/8/PPP2PP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"All very clever, original and decisive! Of course the ordinary run
of people who envy my every spark of genius but cannot follow
my line of reasoning for even three paces, outdo themselves in
sneering at me with the poison-dripping epithet, ""bizarre.""

The text move creates confusion in the whole Black army and
prepares for the annihilating invasion by the Queen 18 moves later."
10,Qb6,d8b6,rnb1kbnr/pp3ppp/1q2p3/3pP2P/3p4/8/PPP2PP1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,"Naturally not 5...Nc6 6 Bb5! etc. Why should Black play the
French Defense only to allow the Ruy Lopez Bishop move after
all?! (See Diagram)"

Pawn sacrifice."

with Bg7. But White forestalls this."

revelation! All the previous maneuvers now become clear! White
has completed his development brilliantly and proceeds to
overprotect e5. Against this, Black is helpless."

broad backs of these sturdy blockaders."

had only been a trap and Bg7 had not been intended at all. The
position of Black's Bishop at g7 is now quite pointless. 11...Be7

continuation of his strategy of overprotection."
