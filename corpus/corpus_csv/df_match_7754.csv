1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Everything standard up to here. Blocks the d-pawn, and thus the black lsb, but not completely horrible."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Everything standard up to here. Blocks the d-pawn, and thus the black lsb, but not completely horrible."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Everything standard up to here. Blocks the d-pawn, and thus the black lsb, but not completely horrible."
4,Bd6,f8d6,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/3b4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"Everything standard up to here. Blocks the d-pawn, and thus the black lsb, but not completely horrible."
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/3b4/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"Opens up the center, especially trying to take advantage with the e5 pawn push due to the weakness of the bishop on d6."
6,exd4,e5d4,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/3b4/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"e5 here helps Black by developing his bishop to the more active c5 square though. 
More importantly Black cannot play Nf6 because of e5 Qe7 Qe2 losing a piece. Also Black cannot play Ne7 because Ng5 0-0 Qh5 loses material."
7,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/3b4/8/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"e5 here helps Black by developing his bishop to the more active c5 square though. 
More importantly Black cannot play Nf6 because of e5 Qe7 Qe2 losing a piece. Also Black cannot play Ne7 because Ng5 0-0 Qh5 loses material."
8,h6,h7h6,rnbqk1nr/pppp1pp1/3b3p/8/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"Stops the idea of Ng5, but is also very slow."
9,O-O,e1g1,rnbqk1nr/pppp1pp1/3b3p/8/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 5,"White is in no hurry to take the pawn, Black cannot hold on to it."
10,c5,c7c5,rnbqk1nr/pp1p1pp1/3b3p/2p5/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 6,"? Positionally this move makes little sense because white can play c3 and win back the pawn if he wants to. 

But more importantly Black is wasting development on pawn moves."
11,c3,c2c3,rnbqk1nr/pp1p1pp1/3b3p/2p5/2BpP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 6,Obviously the pawn cannot be taken due to Qxd6.
12,Qc7,d8c7,rnb1k1nr/ppqp1pp1/3b3p/2p5/2BpP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 7,Protecting the bishop but leaves Black with other problems.
13,Qb3,d1b3,rnb1k1nr/ppqp1pp1/3b3p/2p5/2BpP3/1QP2N2/PP3PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 2 7,! Oddly the f7 square cannot be defended because of the misplaced bishop on d6 and the misplaced pawn on h6.
