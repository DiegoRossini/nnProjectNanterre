1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"...there are more mistakes, and psychology IS a bigger thing than I thought. I was asked by one of my opponents why I waited so long to join the USCF etc etc.... oh that's right, my age is on a need to know basis. Although I'll bet not too many of you would beat me in a crit or a cycling road race. ;) Anyways, my response is I've always enjoyed chess more as a fun hobby; to reach my full potential, I would have to give up far too many other interests I currently enjoy... back to the game. Nf3, an interesting opening that can transpose into many different setups..."
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,"Well, I'm going to see his intentions immediately, by playing - if you've seen ANY of my games, you'll know I like the Caro-Kann. I'll have something now to look into... 1. ...c6 is probably not best here! Oh well."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,"And his response is not the best response either. Although we can transpose into book, I don't think this is mainstream so far."
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,Maybe the Reti? Anyone? I'm not up at all on the Reti or English variations. I really don't know what white is doing here. This could transpose into one of the Caro-Kann variations I haven't seen much of. We'll see.
5,b3,b2b3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2P5/1P3N2/P2PPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"White has played a passive move, albeit it will allow the dark-squared bishop to exert pressure from the flank. Reti? Nimzowitsch? This is what happens when you get a white player who wants to play a certain way with a black player who wants to play a certain way. An odd opening that ends up being not quite what either of us is shooting for. One problem for white that occurs later, is that flank openings should be played with the idea of pressuring the center. White fails to do this properly, and you'll see the result soon."
6,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p1b2/2P5/1P3N2/P2PPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,"Playing as if it's a regular Caro-Kann. At this point, why not."
7,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p1b2/2P5/1PN2N2/P2PPPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,"I decided not to take that pawn. Here I thought about moving d4, forcing the knight to retreat or move to the side of the board. But I felt little was to be gained; one consideration for certain flank openings is to try to get your opponent's center overextended, and I didn't want to take that on quite so early until I had time to think on it more."

10,Nd7,b8d7,r2qkbnr/pp1n1ppp/2p1p3/3p1b2/2P5/1PNP1N2/P3PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,"Well I'm developing. At this point of the opening I was a little dumbfounded by this move. See, here's why: is white considering a kingside pawn storm? If so, then why is his queenside pawns wide open? Where will his king find safety? When one's opponent is good but a little bad, or bad but a little good, well then, all one can do is play the board. I decide just for fun to see what happens if..."

Maybe he'll play with those pawns over there and leave his king vulnerable. Such a move against a really strong player would be a little dangerous for black. At this point, none of Fritz's evaluations indicate any danger towards black, even if this looks awful positionally."

Why move the bishop to threaten the queen unless you expected to trade bishop for bishop, as there is no real other move for black? Well, okay; you might say f6 or Ne7. But I wanted to meet aggression with aggression, and wanted my bishop on that diagonal if I could; f6 would have made that plan too slow."
14,Be7,f8e7,r2qk1nr/pp1nbpp1/2p1p3/3p1bBp/2P5/1PNP1N1P/P3PPP1/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 8,"Here my opponent wastes a tempo.

The bishop needed to be there anyways for that plan, another reason to not move the knight there, which would not help. Without that plan, Nf6 is really only slightly better. At this point, I see no rhyme or reason to my opponent's moves here, unless he were to immediately crash down on the center hard..."

It's a good way of getting a space advantage if my opponent chooses not to open the board. At this point, he's been neglecting to really pressure the center, and this results in white ending up being passive for a good while."

I am thinking since my opponent has been playing passively, that I can lock up the center, and then my knights will be more useful to me if I can keep things locked up. And that is what happens. This is why over the board chess, when one has time to understand what one's opponent's playing style is, has the psychological aspect that online blitz chess lacks."

That particular bishop ends up missing out on most of the action, in effect, white plays much of the game a piece down. Nearly two pieces down, because his other bishop is a really bad bishop! At least my 'bad' bishop is not as bad as his, as you'll see later. Here it's possible because of ...h5, white thinks I'll castle queenside and thus is trying to keep the bishop on that diagonal. But he's also mishandled the whole flank thingy. You're supposed to pressure the center from a distance, and I get to advance my pawns with tempo due to the way he played."
