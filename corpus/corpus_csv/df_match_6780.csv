22,Qxg5,d8g5,r3kb1r/2p2ppp/p1n1b3/1pn1P1q1/3p4/1BP5/PP1N1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 12,I temporarily give up my knight because I have threating Qf3 now.

24,Qd8,g5d8,r2qkb1r/2p2ppp/p1n1b3/1pn1P3/3p4/1BP2Q2/PP1N1PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 2 13,He instead played Qd8. Here I didnt expect this move from my opponent and I didnt concentrate on his mistake.Here Bb3xBe6 was the best move.
25,Qxc6+,f3c6,r2qkb1r/2p2ppp/p1Q1b3/1pn1P3/3p4/1BP5/PP1N1PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 0 13,"So I took Knight with a check. Now just think of if i exchanged bishops before taking the Knight with ""in between"" move. He would have to play Kf7 which is not good for black and I would just take the pawn on d4."
26,Bd7,e6d7,r2qkb1r/2pb1ppp/p1Q5/1pn1P3/3p4/1BP5/PP1N1PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 1 14,So he defended with Bishop.
27,Qf3,c6f3,r2qkb1r/2pb1ppp/p7/1pn1P3/3p4/1BP2Q2/PP1N1PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 2 14,I retreated my Queen to f3 threating Qxf7.

29,Nxb3,d2b3,r2qkb1r/2pb1ppp/p7/1p2P3/3p4/1NP2Q2/PP3PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 0 15,I took the pawn with queen because I didnt want to spoil my pawn structure.
30,dxc3,d4c3,r2qkb1r/2pb1ppp/p7/1p2P3/8/1Np2Q2/PP3PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 0 16,I took the pawn with queen because I didnt want to spoil my pawn structure.
31,Qxc3,f3c3,r2qkb1r/2pb1ppp/p7/1p2P3/8/1NQ5/PP3PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 0 16,I took the pawn with queen because I didnt want to spoil my pawn structure.
32,Rc8,a8c8,2rqkb1r/2pb1ppp/p7/1p2P3/8/1NQ5/PP3PPP/R1B2RK1 w k - 1 17,Preparing a pawn push.
33,Be3,c1e3,2rqkb1r/2pb1ppp/p7/1p2P3/8/1NQ1B3/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b k - 2 17,I prevented c5.
34,Be6,d7e6,2rqkb1r/2p2ppp/p3b3/1p2P3/8/1NQ1B3/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w k - 3 18,Redeploying his bishop.
35,Rad1,a1d1,2rqkb1r/2p2ppp/p3b3/1p2P3/8/1NQ1B3/PP3PPP/3R1RK1 b k - 4 18,So I payed d1 here. Simply developing my rook.Maybe Rfd1 would be better.
36,Qe7,d8e7,2r1kb1r/2p1qppp/p3b3/1p2P3/8/1NQ1B3/PP3PPP/3R1RK1 w k - 5 19,His only move was Qh4. This move just loses a tempo. Because I have a chance to simplify now.I can just exchange Bishops and he will not be able to castle anymore. And his rook on h8 will need some free moves to get in to the battle.
37,Bc5,e3c5,2r1kb1r/2p1qppp/p3b3/1pB1P3/8/1NQ5/PP3PPP/3R1RK1 b k - 6 19,So I go for my plan.
38,Qh4,e7h4,2r1kb1r/2p2ppp/p3b3/1pB1P3/7q/1NQ5/PP3PPP/3R1RK1 w k - 7 20,Now he plays his only move that should have played on previous move.
