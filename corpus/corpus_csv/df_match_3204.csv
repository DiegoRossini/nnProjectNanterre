1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,E4 or d4 are my only choices as White. I am comfortable with either and do take time to look into the history of my opponent to see which way to go.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Black is trying the Ruy Lopez against me. I have a surprise since I learned chess from my father who won every time I tried the Ruy.
3,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,The King's Gambit.
4,exf4,e5f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,The King's Gambit Accepted.
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,This is my favorite although I could have done Bc4....
6,g5,g7g5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/6p1/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,Black really has to either come up with an attack or defend that f4 pawn (and counter attack). Black is doing what I usually did against my dad back in the 1960s when he taught me chess. This is a good move for Black but it doesn't really stop the pacing of White to really come on strong....
7,h4,h2h4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/6p1/4Pp1P/5N2/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,The King Side attack is the whole idea with the King's Gambit. Get an attack going fast on the King Side and worry about the (your White King) King later. There are measures in the King's Gambit you can take to protect your White King should this attack be subdued....
8,g4,g5g4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/8/4PppP/5N2/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,This is a usual move by Black to try and upset the King Side attack....
9,Ne5,f3e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/4N3/4PppP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"I would consider Black to have two ""passed pawns"" before I jumped. I always thought a pawn crossed over the center line was ""passed"" (at least it was ""passed"" in my days with my dad who taught me chess). 

However, my knight that has to move is conveniently set to move again to e5...."
10,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1p1p/5n2/4N3/4PppP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,Black moves to develop and defend g4.
11,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1p1p/5n2/4N3/2B1PppP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 6,"I apply pressure to the f7 Black pawn. It is a standard King's Gambit practice...
You can see why, right? It really upsets things down in Black's King Side area....and King! 
The King's Gambit is an Attack instead of a slow moving game that a Ruy will do to an end game. 
This is why I don't use the Ruy Lopez.  My dad taught me not to use that defense against e4. I then learned Sicilian and Caro-Kann and Alekhine's instead to deal with e4. I became biased against the Ruy Lopez. I am still biased to this day even though I have used it a couple of times here just to see if it is really as good as others say (and do what) it is."
12,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2p1p/5n2/3pN3/2B1PppP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"This means I do have to stack pawns. Using the bishop is not correct. Also, remember the King Side is very busy right now!"
13,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2p1p/5n2/3PN3/2B2ppP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,I want that bishop in line with the f7 Black pawn straight into the 0-0 area.
14,Bd6,f8d6,rnbqk2r/ppp2p1p/3b1n2/3PN3/2B2ppP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 8,Black is blocking and putting forth pressure on my e5 Knight.  What shall I do to make things a bit more saucy around here (in the King's Gambit you can easily make things more sparky or fiery or explosive...)?
15,d4,d2d4,rnbqk2r/ppp2p1p/3b1n2/3PN3/2BP1ppP/8/PPP3P1/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,I push a pawn into the fray that is rapidly getting complicated.
16,Nh5,f6h5,rnbqk2r/ppp2p1p/3b4/3PN2n/2BP1ppP/8/PPP3P1/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 9,His passed pawns (as I understood it in the 60s from my dad) are targets for the King Side attack.
17,Bb5+,c4b5,rnbqk2r/ppp2p1p/3b4/1B1PN2n/3P1ppP/8/PPP3P1/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 9,Time to shift the attack to threaten the Black King...
18,Kf8,e8f8,rnbq1k1r/ppp2p1p/3b4/1B1PN2n/3P1ppP/8/PPP3P1/RNBQK2R w KQ - 3 10,Black knows castling on King Side ain't gonna happen...
19,Nxg4,e5g4,rnbq1k1r/ppp2p1p/3b4/1B1P3n/3P1pNP/8/PPP3P1/RNBQK2R b KQ - 0 10,He takes my Knight if he wants and my Queen is ready.....
20,Ng3,h5g3,rnbq1k1r/ppp2p1p/3b4/1B1P4/3P1pNP/6n1/PPP3P1/RNBQK2R w KQ - 1 11,So down comes his Knight...
