My opponent is probably very good, however if you play a new opening make sure you know a lot about it. Not just moves, but plans and ideas. That way when you're opening memory runs out you know enough to still be working toward your goals. Also in correspondence you can use a database, which using will also help you in otb games. Thank you. And yes, I've lost one game which ended my 17 game win streak. And to be blunt I am not annotating it (for a while, maybe later), because it depresses me."
