1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"is it just me, or is once popular e4 fading into nonexsistence. I see it less and less."
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,ten best?

6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,"this is the first problem with my opening. I'm almost defenseless against the obvious e5 push. my only response would be to throw my knight over to d5, offering a trade which messes up my pawn structure that I like so much about this opening."
7,d3,d2d3,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,o...k....

11,d4,d3d4,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/5n2/2pp4/3P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"offering a trade, which would basically ruin my entire 'control' of middle board."
12,c4,c5c4,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/5n2/3p4/2pP4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,there is a really awesome move coming up really soon.

notice, though, possible 14 ...Nxc3 15... Qxe2#"
