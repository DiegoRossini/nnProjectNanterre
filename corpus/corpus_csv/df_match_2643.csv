For I want to keep the LSB on his square as long as possible because it could be usefull on e2 or d3 and I have no moves to lose, for both players have castled on the opposite side. The rush at the Kings will soon begin. Will black defend or will he try to attack the white king and if so he does, who will be the quickest ? (I analysed the game as deep as I could and was not sure at all)."

In this position I think that white is better because his piecs on the center can be used wether to attack or to defend, which i not the case for black."
