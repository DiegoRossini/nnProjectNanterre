1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"In our first game, I played Nf3. I was playing that quite a bit back then. Since then I've read that is not a good opening move against those above the rating of 1800 or so. I've been using KP for a while now and having success at my level."
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"This is the French Defense starting position. A future move for black is d5. From what I've read and experienced, this defends the a2-g8 diagonal and reduces the f7 pawn weakness. However, it also blocks the black LSB. So in a sense, moves the weakness to the back row. A better player would probably know how to exploit this weakness, but I am not yet that experienced."
3,g4,g2g4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P1P1/8/PPPP1P1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Black will naturally want to move d5, so I'd prefer to do something else. I think moving g4 may take him out of this mindset."
4,h5,h7h5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1pp1/4p3/7p/4P1P1/8/PPPP1P1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Well, it worked. Now, I'm thinking this through. If I pass the pawn, I lose it, not an option. if I take the pawn, I trade, keep him from castling king side (one of my stretch goals!) and take his rook. That said, my queen ends up in the open, that's NEVER worked out in the past."
5,h4,h2h4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1pp1/4p3/7p/4P1PP/8/PPPP1P2/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"So I advance the h rook, hoping he takes the pawn... which I may pick up later. I want to disturb the kingside further."
6,hxg4,h5g4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1pp1/4p3/8/4P1pP/8/PPPP1P2/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"He takes the pawn. While I wanted him to do this, it always concerns me when a higher level player does exactly what you expect. It probably means I missed something."
7,h5,h4h5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1pp1/4p3/7P/4P1p1/8/PPPP1P2/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,But I stick to my plan.
8,Nh6,g8h6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1pp1/4p2n/7P/4P1p1/8/PPPP1P2/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"This move stops the advance and protects the g4 pawn, foiling my earlier idea of ""picking it up later.""  Knights can be so pesky. Now I'm -1. I don't like being -1. Does anyone really?"
9,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1pp1/4p2n/7P/3PP1p1/8/PPP2P2/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"I think the black bishop will ultimately land on b4, so I want to get my pawn in play before then. This makes my DSB happy, because he can bear down on the pesky knight. In addition, it develops the center. I am thinking perhaps the next move will put me in bishop check."
10,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2pp1/4p2n/3p3P/3PP1p1/8/PPP2P2/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"But, black continues with his original plans as well, pausing things on the kingside."
11,Bxh6,c1h6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2pp1/4p2B/3p3P/3PP1p1/8/PPP2P2/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,Death to the pesky knight!
12,Rxh6,h8h6,rnbqkb2/ppp2pp1/4p2r/3p3P/3PP1p1/8/PPP2P2/RN1QKBNR w KQq - 0 7,"Stretch goal almost complete, black will not castle kingside! However, that DSB is bound to check me soon."
13,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb2/ppp2pp1/4p2r/3p3P/3PP1p1/2N5/PPP2P2/R2QKBNR b KQq - 1 7,"Waiting on the pin. I need to castle queenside now, so think this move will get things prepared."
14,Qg5,d8g5,rnb1kb2/ppp2pp1/4p2r/3p2qP/3PP1p1/2N5/PPP2P2/R2QKBNR w KQq - 2 8,"Well, I didn't see that coming. After reviewing this for quite a while, it appears I won't be able to castle in this game at all. I don't see anyway to interpose a piece and I certainly am not castling kingside. Having the black rook and queen in this configuration really I really miss my DSB. In fact, now that I'm looking at the pawn configuration, I REALLY miss my DSB. Don't think the pesky knight was worth it."
15,Qd2,d1d2,rnb1kb2/ppp2pp1/4p2r/3p2qP/3PP1p1/2N5/PPPQ1P2/R3KBNR b KQq - 3 8,"My thought process: (1) stalhandske can do a lot more damage with a queen than I. (2) the black advanced queen is more dangerous than my queen on the back rank. (3) I'm not going to be able to castle anyway, so exchange and get the king active."
16,Qxd2+,g5d2,rnb1kb2/ppp2pp1/4p2r/3p3P/3PP1p1/2N5/PPPq1P2/R3KBNR w KQq - 0 9,Black believes the exchange is a good idea. I am somewhat relieved because my rook was definitely in danger.
17,Kxd2,e1d2,rnb1kb2/ppp2pp1/4p2r/3p3P/3PP1p1/2N5/PPPK1P2/R4BNR b q - 0 9,King flexing his muscles.
18,Bb4,f8b4,rnb1k3/ppp2pp1/4p2r/3p3P/1b1PP1p1/2N5/PPPK1P2/R4BNR w q - 1 10,There's the pin I expected a few moves ago.
19,a3,a2a3,rnb1k3/ppp2pp1/4p2r/3p3P/1b1PP1p1/P1N5/1PPK1P2/R4BNR b q - 0 10,"I think black will take the knight and that ends up with me losing my e pawn. I would say ""I'll pick it up later"", but we'll see how that will work out later. Good news is, I think my pawns in the center will be in good shape."
20,Bxc3+,b4c3,rnb1k3/ppp2pp1/4p2r/3p3P/3PP1p1/P1b5/1PPK1P2/R4BNR w q - 0 11,"Black does what I expected, which again, gives me pause."
