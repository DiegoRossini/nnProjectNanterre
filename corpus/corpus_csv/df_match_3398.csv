1,b4,b2b4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/1P6/8/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,leaving the center fight for after. Is it a good strategy ? I think that there is no hurry to place paws in the center.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/1P6/8/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,this pawn will be soon exposed and then black will have to defend it
3,Bb2,c1b2,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/1P6/8/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"starting the agressivity from the second move ! this is funy ! Of corse the ""grob trap"" is Bf7xb4 Bb2xe5 treatening g7 ...etc"
4,f6,f7f6,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4p3/1P6/8/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"preventing the treath on g7, but opening the h5/e8dangerous diagonal. It will serve me after"
5,a3,a2a3,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4p3/1P6/P7/1BPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"now we will start to fight for the center...I wanted to do d4, but my mouse slip (or maybe my mind ?!) and i played e4 !"
6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/5p2/3pp3/1P6/P7/1BPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"now we will start to fight for the center...I wanted to do d4, but my mouse slip (or maybe my mind ?!) and i played e4 !"
7,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/5p2/3pp3/1P2P3/P7/1BPP1PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"i can tak this risk because the black queen cannont go to h5 for the moment, so i have the time to play this gambit, taking back with queen or knight, i still dont decided it"
8,dxe4,d5e4,rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/5p2/4p3/1P2p3/P7/1BPP1PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"i can tak this risk because the black queen cannont go to h5 for the moment, so i have the time to play this gambit, taking back with queen or knight, i still dont decided it"

10,exf3,e4f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/5p2/4p3/1P6/P4p2/1BPP2PP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,better with the knight in order to castle

12,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkbnr/ppp3pp/5p2/4p3/1P4b1/P4N2/1BPP2PP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,"this is good, but if i play carrefully, there is no problem for the moment i can go on"
13,Bc4,f1c4,rn1qkbnr/ppp3pp/5p2/4p3/1PB3b1/P4N2/1BPP2PP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 2 7,"more safy whould be Be2, but less agressive, and i think this kind of opening, like grob 's ones, need a lot of aggressivity to compense strange opening and weak center"
