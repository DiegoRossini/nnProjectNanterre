1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This is a game with one of my favorite combinations I've played on GameKnot.  I'll skip the opening analysis for the most part and focus on the end of the game.  Enjoy.

Centralizing the knight with d5 is the move that most players would prefer, but I actually like the knight in more direct opposition of the enemy king.  By controlling both a7 and c7, the black king is now potentially vulnerable to back-rank checkmates if one of the black rooks comes off the back rank.

This move also has the benefit of directly threatening the pawn on d6."

Other attempts fail to moves such as 26) ... Qc5 or Rxf2
There is a nice double-threat from Qe7.  The first is 27) Qa3+ Kb8 28) Qa7+ Kc8 29) Qa8+.  Note that if white tried to approach a3 via b2 instead, then black would be able to stop the threat with 26) ... Qc5.  With the white queen on e7, however, the second threat comes into play.

If black now tries to defend with 26) ... Qc5, then 27) Rd8+ Rxd8 28) Qxd8+ Qc8 29) Qxc8#.  Note that if 27) ... Qc8, then 28) Qa3+ Kb8 29) Qa7#.

Finally, if black tries to defend with 26) ... Kb8, then white still plays 27) Qa3, as there is no way for black to stop Qa7+ and Qa8# without drastic loss of material, as the knight and rook perfectly lock in the black king.

The particularly interesting bit about this entire combination is that it all hinged on the decision to move the knight to b5 rather than d5."
