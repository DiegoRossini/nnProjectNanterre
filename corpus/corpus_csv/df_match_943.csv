3,Bf4,c1f4,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/3P1B2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"I like this instead of c4, creating a solid defence against the B. It can become very tricky."

10,d6,d7d6,rnbqk1nr/pp2p1bp/2pp2p1/5p2/3P1B2/2P2N2/PP1NPPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"!? Very defensive, but d5 would have closed the center for a very closed game."
11,e4,e2e4,rnbqk1nr/pp2p1bp/2pp2p1/5p2/3PPB2/2P2N2/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"He can take and position his lsb in f5, but I need air."

31,Qd3,b3d3,rnbq2k1/p4rbp/4p1p1/1B1pPp2/R2P4/3Q1NP1/1P1N1PP1/4K2R b K - 3 16,"? Avoiding ideas of Rb8, pinning the Q, and defending the B since the b2 pawn is not defended. But it was a mistake, as after a6 my B is almost lost. It saves me Ra2, so I can retire the B on a4 after Bb7, defending the R."
