1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Standard opening move for me
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"Trying to play into the BDG with 1. d4 Nf6 2. f3 d5 3. e4, in more recent games I have played 2. Nc3 which I found got me to the position I wanted more frequently

The idea was from this article http://sawyerbdg.blogspot.co.nz/2011/08/blackmar-diemer-gambit-huebsch-after.html"

4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/3P4/5P2/PPP1P1PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"I was not sure how to respond to this at the time, initial thoughts were e5 and Nc3 both of which would have given me a more familiar position"
5,Be3,c1e3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/3P4/4BP2/PPP1P1PP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"I ended up looking at the GameDB and the options were limited, I hadn't considered Bg5 at that point and discounted it because GameDB suggested it was more favourable for black 46%-53%

I ended up playing Be3 which seemed more favourable for white, however it cramped my normal position and didnt allow me to play e5 and blocked the a6-f1 diagonal"
6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3P4/4BP2/PPP1P1PP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"This again was a GameDB move, which suggested it was the best option for white at this stage

I was aware of the rule of not moving a piece more than once in the opening but felt no choice, other options looking at this position could have been Nc3 but not really comfortable with the position of the bishops"

8,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/3P4/5P2/PPP1PBPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,pawn is protected by the bishop on f2 and expecting him to play 5..Bxc5 6. Bxc5 Qa5+ to regain the bishop
9,dxc5,d4c5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2Pp4/8/5P2/PPP1PBPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,pawn is protected by the bishop on f2 and expecting him to play 5..Bxc5 6. Bxc5 Qa5+ to regain the bishop
10,Qc7,d8c7,rnb1kb1r/ppq2ppp/4pn2/2Pp4/8/5P2/PPP1PBPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,This seems to put pressure on the c2 square with Bxc5 Bxc5 and Qxc5
11,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1kb1r/ppq2ppp/4pn2/2Pp4/8/2N2P2/PPP1PBPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 2 6,Trying to get back to development
12,Bxc5,f8c5,rnb1k2r/ppq2ppp/4pn2/2bp4/8/2N2P2/PPP1PBPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,"elyhim: 7. Bd2 is a bad move. For one you moved the bishop three times. Second, 7...e5 will over run you in the centre

I understood what elyhim was saying about moving the bishop 3 times, I was sure he meant Bd4 - the logic I feel looking at the position is that I wanted to play Bxd4 Qxd4 which gave me more control in the centre, I didn't take into account e5 properly

Better options could have been e4 which would challenge the centre and after dxe4 fxe4 Nxe4 Nxe4 I would be able to play Nf3 and have some more emphasis on the centre. Another obvious option is Bxc5 Qxc5 e4"

14,e5,e6e5,rnb1k2r/ppq2ppp/5n2/2bpp3/3B4/2N2P2/PPP1P1PP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 8,Essentially the previous bishop move was a waste of tempo for me plus 4th move of the bishop
15,Bxc5,d4c5,rnb1k2r/ppq2ppp/5n2/2Bpp3/8/2N2P2/PPP1P1PP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 8,Essentially the previous bishop move was a waste of tempo for me plus 4th move of the bishop
16,Qxc5,c7c5,rnb1k2r/pp3ppp/5n2/2qpp3/8/2N2P2/PPP1P1PP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 9,I felt this was probably my best move now expecting dxe4 fxe4 Nxe4 Nxe4 threatening the queen
17,e4,e2e4,rnb1k2r/pp3ppp/5n2/2qpp3/4P3/2N2P2/PPP3PP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 9,I felt this was probably my best move now expecting dxe4 fxe4 Nxe4 Nxe4 threatening the queen
18,d4,d5d4,rnb1k2r/pp3ppp/5n2/2q1p3/3pP3/2N2P2/PPP3PP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 10,"Hmmmfff.. forcing me to move my knight again with options at Na4 Nb1 Ne2, I discounted Nd5
Na4 threatens the queen but was countered with Qb4+
Nb1 seemed to be a backwards move with no real benefit

Interestingly the post game analysis didnt identify inacuracies or blunders from move 3 to move 17 alsthough the score was -2.25 for elyhim

PGA advice on move 3 was Best: -0.38 Â» 3. e4 Nc6 4. Nh3 Bb4+ 5. c3 Be7 6. Bd3 O-O 7. Be3 d6 8. O-O e5 9. Na3 Bxh3 10. gxh3 Qd7"
