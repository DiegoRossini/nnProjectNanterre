1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Before I started the game I checked my opponent's repertoire and saw that he uses the Nimzo-indian as a defence to 1. d4 and the Sicilian as a response to 1. e4. I'm still working my way around finding a good line against the Nimzo so I chose to take battle in more familiar territory.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"As expected, my opponent went with the Najdorf. It's endorsed by just about everyone that plays the Sicilian but for some reason it's not as popular anymore in GM practice. Much more popular are the Ruy Lopez, especially the Berlin wall line, and the Petroff, which I dread myself."

12,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"A rather rare sideline but it does have a few points to it. I actually play it myself on occasion. The purpose of this idea is to save a move in normal lines, namely Be7. It can lead to quite a few sharp lines but it can be positional as well. Kasparov used this line on a number of occasions. Trying to play Nbd7, preserving the pawn structure, allows White to play Bc4, so it's generally accepted that this is the more exact move."

15,f5,f4f5,rnb1kb1r/1pq2ppp/p2ppn2/5PB1/3NP3/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,This move tries to take advantage of Qc7 and weaken the pawn chain. As an extra bonus the Bg5 can travel back the diagonal if needed. The drawback is that e5 is now in Black's hands.
16,Be7,f8e7,rnb1k2r/1pq1bppp/p2ppn2/5PB1/3NP3/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 9,"Black decides he doesn't want a compromised pawn structure and is ready to castle. There is another point behind Qc7, that being that Nc6 can be played, which in normal lines would be met with Nxc6 followed by e5."

18,Nc6,b8c6,r1b1k2r/1pq1bppp/p1nppn2/5PB1/3NP3/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 3 10,Attacking the Nd4 and taking control of e5.

21,Kb1,c1b1,r1b2rk1/1pq1bppp/p1nppn2/5PB1/3NP3/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/1K1R1B1R b - - 6 11,"A typical move that makes sure there won't be any tactical resources against my King. In these types of positions it's also a good waiting move. For example, in many positions it's better to capture on c6 only after the Bc8 has moved to d7 because capturing with the b-pawn will be weaker then."
22,Bd7,c8d7,r4rk1/1pqbbppp/p1nppn2/5PB1/3NP3/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/1K1R1B1R w - - 7 12,"This pattern of developing pieces, including the pawn structure and the piece placement is seen in many lines and is very elastic since many plans are available to Black."
23,Nxc6,d4c6,r4rk1/1pqbbppp/p1Nppn2/5PB1/4P3/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/1K1R1B1R b - - 0 12,Releasing the central pressure in order to focus the pieces on a K-side attack. It's very interesting the developing the Bishop to d7 makes the capture with the b-pawn less desirable.
24,Bxc6,d7c6,r4rk1/1pq1bppp/p1bppn2/5PB1/4P3/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/1K1R1B1R w - - 0 13,"After 12...bxc6 White can quickly get an attack going, for example 13. g4 Rab8 14. Bc1 (having this square free for a Bishop retreat is another bonus of playing an early Kb1. Now b2 is secure and Black's counterplay is delayed) d5 (hitting in the centre in reply to a flank attack) 15. g5 Nxe4 16. Nxe4 dxe4 17. Qxe4 c5 (with the idea of Bc6) 18. f6! (and White gets a powerful initiative)"
25,Bd3,f1d3,r4rk1/1pq1bppp/p1bppn2/5PB1/4P3/2NB1Q2/PPP3PP/1K1R3R b - - 1 13,Defending e4. With the Knights on the board this move wouldn't have been possible and the more passive Be2 would have to been played.
26,Nxe4,f6e4,r4rk1/1pq1bppp/p1bpp3/5PB1/4n3/2NB1Q2/PPP3PP/1K1R3R w - - 0 14,A common trick in the Sicilian but it doesn't work so well here.
27,Bxe4,d3e4,r4rk1/1pq1bppp/p1bpp3/5PB1/4B3/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/1K1R3R b - - 0 14,Taking with the Knight is weaker because of the pin.
28,Bxg5,e7g5,r4rk1/1pq2ppp/p1bpp3/5Pb1/4B3/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/1K1R3R w - - 0 15,With no nasty check. If you've played the White side of the Sicilian you'll learn that moves like Kh1 and Kb1 aren't a waste of time at all.
29,fxe6,f5e6,r4rk1/1pq2ppp/p1bpP3/6b1/4B3/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/1K1R3R b - - 0 15,Getting ready to win the pawn back with a slight edge.
30,fxe6,f7e6,r4rk1/1pq3pp/p1bpp3/6b1/4B3/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/1K1R3R w - - 0 16,"A natural move, 15...Rae8 looks interesting but after the almost forced 16. exf7+ Rxf7 17. Qd3 Bxe4 18. Nxe4 Bf4 19. g3 Qc6 20. Rhe1 Rfe7 21. Nf6+ gxf6 22. Rxe7 Rxe7 23. gxf4, White has a much better endgame position."
