1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I open with a Classical move.
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Joe's response is cautious but solid.
3,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"The natural move, forming an ""ideal center""."
4,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Joe wastes no time challenging said center.
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,I develop and defend.
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,Joe counters by developing his own Knight.
7,d5,d4d5,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2pP4/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"Rather than exchange, I push the Pawn."
8,exd5,e6d5,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n5/2pp4/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,Joe opts to trade...
9,exd5,e4d5,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n5/2pP4/8/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,...and I complete the central exchange.
10,Nce7,c6e7,r1bqkbnr/pp1pnppp/8/2pP4/8/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,"5... N-N5 was the more aggressive alternative, but I could then have chosen to play 6 P-QR3, forcing the Knight's retreat."
11,d6,d5d6,r1bqkbnr/pp1pnppp/3P4/2p5/8/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,I jab at the Knight...
12,Nc6,e7c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2nP4/2p5/8/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,...which returns to its natural square.
13,Qe2+,d1e2,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2nP4/2p5/8/5N2/PPP1QPPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 2 7,"Black has to interpose, as the King lacks a flight square."
14,Nge7,g8e7,r1bqkb1r/pp1pnppp/2nP4/2p5/8/5N2/PPP1QPPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 3 8,"7... B-K2 would force my hand, as the King would then have a flight square and Black could break the pin at any time. As things stand, I don't have to play PxN just yet."
