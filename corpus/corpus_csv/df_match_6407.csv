Kaufman's repertoire opening book is worth having a look at if you're searching for practical openings that aren't too analysed to death (Najdorf, Sveshnikov etc) or too drawish. The point of 3...c6 instead of 3...Nf6 is to avoid the Queens Gambit Declined exchange variation (4.cxd4) which is supposedly good for white because he hasn't yet committed his kings knight (to f3), so can more easily play f3 and e4 (after e3, Bd3 and Ne2-g3 etc). This move order means that black has to be prepared for the Marshall Gambit (4.e4) which is tricky but, for a clued-up black player, is probably not quite sound (though I have been on the wrong end of this in an over-the-board game!)."

It does, however, invite the enormous complications of the Botvinnik Variation, which is nicely explained in Glenn Flear's interesting book 'Starting Out: Slav and Semi-Slav' (Everyman, 2005). Please note, however, that this book is five years old, which is light years when it comes to Slav and Semi-Slav opening theory. Kaufman, instead, recommends avoiding the Botvinnik by playing 5...h6 (this is called the Moscow Variation). However, the Anti-Moscow Gambit (in which white gives up a pawn after 6.Bh4 g5 7.Bg3 dxc4) gives white a lasting positional advantage and is not easy to play against."
