1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Here is my situation.  I normally have less than 20 games on my active games list but after I came back from my Cornish holiday I found I had 27.  How did that happen?  Well, firstly, I took part in another mini-tournament which involved some buddies who I had not played with for quite a while, so I thought, why not?  Then my team captain gave me some team games, well it is about time I played some for my team as I had not played team games for quite a while.  Then a couple of people reinstated their timed out games and I thought it was unsportsmanlike to refuse.  So it all added up - and found myself with 15-20 new games.  I found myself relying on the database more than ever, so much so that it was a complete blur of black and white bars and facts and figures.  Sadly I became more focussed on that than on the actual position and so I felt on auto-pilot.  I chose a bad option and paid dearly for it.  Anyhow, on with the game.  This opening starts off as a double king pawn opening and turns into the Ruy Lopez."

Funnily enough in another game against an Expert I decided to try the Open Lopez which is Nxe4.  That game is in progress so I may annotate that one at its conclusion, but here I choose the conservative Be7."

This move was played in the World DB and had a black bar against it.  It should have a skull and cross bones painted on it!  Still, I suppose it has some merit.  It busts up white's queenside pawn structure slightly and black has the bishop pair.  But is this sufficient compo for the pawn minus?"
