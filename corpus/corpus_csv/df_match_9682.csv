1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I've picked this game for annotation because it resulted in an improbable victory from a near impossible position - (at one stage I was down 2 knights, 1 bishop, 1 rook and 4 pawns and had only captured a single pawn in return)

Tolemac has subsequently thrashed me in every game since."
