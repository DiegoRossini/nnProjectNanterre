1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game is only public so cannycap can see it.
I make a habit of starting with e4, so I'm not confusing myself with too many different openings."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"The most popular move in gameDB. And it's aggressive, which I like."

4,Nd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/3nP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,Still in GameDB. This is called Alekhine's defense. W seems to be getting a firm grip on the centre.

6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4p3/3nP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"GameDB main lines are c4, NF3 and Bc4. I'm initially tempted by NF3 as it's getting a piece off the back rank. But playing through the common line from there, it looks as if c4 is pretty much bound to comeup. So I may as well do it now, while the board is less cluttered."

Black gets to move the N again. We'e getting to the end of the gameDB moves, 
and I have a very weird start, for me, with lots of pawn moves and no pieces. A lot
of control of the centre but a very exposed back rank."

and kill 2 birds with one stone. Just get on with developing pieces."

Glad I didn't sacrifice the knight. We each have one blocked bishop, two useless rooks, semi-effective queen lines. You are one up on knight development. What do you think?"
15,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2p1p/n3p1p1/3PP3/3P4/P1N2N2/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,"I considered: c4xd5 f1-d3 Q-a4  c1-g5. I really liked the idea of developing a piece, 
but on refection decided I was just getting twitchy about the general principle.
All the specific piece moves just seemed to lose me tempo for no real gain. 
c1-g5 was the most tempting alternative, as it makes a mess of black's planned fianchetto."

pawn structure less useful than black might have wished. Also my N can pick off 
the pawn with a threat to the Q. (And now she knows that and may avoid it.)"
18,Qd7,d8d7,rnb1kb1r/pppq1p1p/n5p1/3pP1B1/3P4/P1N2N2/1P3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 10,"CC said,  apperox: This was the obvious one to me; I don't want to lose the B so early."

It seemed nice because it's developing with a threat, but it's an empty threat and allowed the 
d pawn to be protected."
