8,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b5/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,Takes away the mating threat and protects the knight. I had never planned on making a serious mating threat on f2 but a mating threat no matter how simple must always have a plan to take care of it.

10,Qf6,d8f6,r1b1k1nr/pppp1ppp/2n2q2/2b5/3NP3/4B3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 3 6,This was to add another attacker of the d4 square and make black think about the mating threat

14,a6,a7a6,r1b1k2r/1pppnppp/p1n2q2/1Bb5/3NP3/2P1B3/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 8,I liked this move because it meant the bishop was under attack and meant the knight could attack from d4 at a later date when it was free from the bishops wrath. However this was the third time this knight moved in 9 moves and if not for the Bishop v Bishop I would have Been able to have castled and been up two tempos. However O-O was probably a weak mvoe as If the knight was sacrificed then my king is opened up.

Qxf3 15.Nxf3 Bxe4 makes knight stay at f3 or move to h4 which means it is on a weak square to protect the pawn on b2 or risk going down by 5 points.Also if he plays 15.gxf3 forced him to castle queen because of half-open b-file. Although there is nothing wrong with castling Queen side because it controls the half open d file
