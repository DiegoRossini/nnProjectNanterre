10,exd4,e5d4,r1bqkbnr/ppp2pp1/2np3p/8/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,A few exchanges. I have a slight lead in development and control more of the center.

32,Rg8,h8g8,r2q2r1/ppp4k/3bb1pp/4p3/6n1/2N5/PPPQ1PPP/R1BR2K1 w - - 2 17,I really don't like this move. I would have moved my king to g8.
33,h3,h2h3,r2q2r1/ppp4k/3bb1pp/4p3/6n1/2N4P/PPPQ1PP1/R1BR2K1 b - - 0 17,Now black is in some trouble
34,Nf6,g4f6,r2q2r1/ppp4k/3bbnpp/4p3/8/2N4P/PPPQ1PP1/R1BR2K1 w - - 1 18,He should have moved his king to g7 and let the knight get taken
35,Qxh6#,d2h6,r2q2r1/ppp4k/3bbnpQ/4p3/8/2N4P/PPP2PP1/R1BR2K1 b - - 0 18,And I get a lucky win. Please comment If you see a better move somewhere
