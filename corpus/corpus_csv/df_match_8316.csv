1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"My 3rd annotation and this was a particularly painful loss as I had a solid advantage but lost due to my tactical inferiority and a lack of confidence that I could play a game equal to an opponent 200 rating points better than me.  He starts with an English opening.  I don't know much about defending the English opening.

As always, comments/criticism is welcome."
