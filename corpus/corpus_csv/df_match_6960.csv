1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

This is a very old match, at one stage I looked like losing it, then my opponent blundered somewhere and I got into a winning position and then I blew it big time and I ended up taking a Low Draw.  This match starts off as a Philidor with a double king pawn opening, me playing 2. Nf3 and black (Daniel) responding with d6."
