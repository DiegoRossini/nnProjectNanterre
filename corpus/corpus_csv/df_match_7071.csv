17,O-O,e1g1,r1bq1rk1/ppp1bpp1/4pn1p/3p4/1nPP3B/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 5 9,Often times Black will play this move earlier in the game and it does often lead to sharp encounters

20,Nbxd5,b4d5,r1bq1rk1/pp2bpp1/4pn1p/2pn4/3P3B/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 11,I'm not sure 12. ... Nxe7 is better but I don't like the Queen on the e7 square and it does end up costing Black in this game.
21,Nxd5,c3d5,r1bq1rk1/pp2bpp1/4pn1p/2pN4/3P3B/3BPN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 11,I'm not sure 12. ... Nxe7 is better but I don't like the Queen on the e7 square and it does end up costing Black in this game.

25,Rc1,a1c1,r1b2rk1/pp2qpp1/4p2p/2pn4/3P4/3BPN2/PP3PPP/2RQ1RK1 b - - 1 13,I didn't like 13. dxc5 Qxc5 letting out Black's Queen and any continuation that led by my knight occupying the d4 square seemed fine to me
26,b6,b7b6,r1b2rk1/p3qpp1/1p2p2p/2pn4/3P4/3BPN2/PP3PPP/2RQ1RK1 w - - 0 14,Now it is different because Black cannot capture with the Queen and must again place a pawn on c5 both blocking the Queen and becoming isolated.
27,dxc5,d4c5,r1b2rk1/p3qpp1/1p2p2p/2Pn4/8/3BPN2/PP3PPP/2RQ1RK1 b - - 0 14,Now it is different because Black cannot capture with the Queen and must again place a pawn on c5 both blocking the Queen and becoming isolated.
28,bxc5,b6c5,r1b2rk1/p3qpp1/4p2p/2pn4/8/3BPN2/PP3PPP/2RQ1RK1 w - - 0 15,My thinking here was that I wanted Qd3 forcing Black to retreat the well placed Knight with Nf6 or weaken his pawn structure with f5 or g6 in order to prevent Qh7#. None of this happens in the game.

31,Bd3,b1d3,r4rk1/p3qpp1/b3p2p/2pn4/8/3BPN2/PP3PPP/2RQ1RK1 b - - 3 16,The other choice is 16. Re1 which I just did not like although in this case I'm moving a piece back to the square it just occupied.
32,Bxd3,a6d3,r4rk1/p3qpp1/4p2p/2pn4/8/3bPN2/PP3PPP/2RQ1RK1 w - - 0 17,If not a capture then Black must play either 16. ... Qd6 or 16. ... Qb7 or retreat the Bishop. I'm not sure any of those is better but I was glad to see that light squared Bishop off the board

But, for the moment it is a good spot. My plan was 20. a3 Na6 putting Black's remaining Knight in a bad spot"

39,Ng6,e5g6,3r1rk1/p3q1p1/4ppNp/2p5/1n6/1Q2P3/PP3PPP/2R2RK1 b - - 1 20,I thought something a little more aggressive with the Queen might be in order at this point. 20. ... Qc7 is probably best protecting the c pawn
