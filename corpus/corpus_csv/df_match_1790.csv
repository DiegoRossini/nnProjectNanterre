1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Here's a game where White experiments with a double opening sacrifice and... it works!  Interesting variation for anyone who likes to get their light-squared bishop on c4 early in the game.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Everything normal so far.  White now goes for the super-agressive, and totally unknown, to me, ""haywire attack"" (if it's not called this, it should be)."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Everything normal so far.  White now goes for the super-agressive, and totally unknown, to me, ""haywire attack"" (if it's not called this, it should be)."

5,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,"Everything normal so far.  White now goes for the super-agressive, and totally unknown, to me, ""haywire attack"" (if it's not called this, it should be)."
6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,"Everything normal so far.  White now goes for the super-agressive, and totally unknown, to me, ""haywire attack"" (if it's not called this, it should be)."
7,d3,d2d3,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,Yes - just had to solid-up that pawn there first...
8,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 5,This is book

11,Nxe5+,f3e5,r1bq3r/pppp1kpp/2n2n2/2b1N3/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQ - 0 6,Gosh - he's trashed another piece.  This can't be going to end well..
12,Nxe5,c6e5,r1bq3r/pppp1kpp/5n2/2b1n3/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 0 7,"But... reminiscent of that kp opening for Black, we fork the two front pieces... oh yes, and that kp's hanging as well - what's going to happen?"
13,d4,d3d4,r1bq3r/pppp1kpp/5n2/2b1n3/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQ - 0 7,"he takes, now I have the option - and go for the Bish, of course, mainly based on the horrible-looking continuation of B or N taking my f-pawn if I go for the knight (though it would give me check with the queen on f3 next go - leave that one for someone else to look into..)"
