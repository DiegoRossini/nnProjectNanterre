1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Here's an entertaining battle that swings one way then another, mainly due to our mistakes rather than cleverness.  Enjoy!"
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"A relatively rare response to the Najdorf.  This bishop usually adopts a more attacking posture on c4 or prepares to occupy the long diagonal with B-e2-f3.  On d3, it's blocked in by the pawn on e4 and not actually attacking anything.  The main line of the Najdorf continues with 6. Bg5 and extremely complex theoretical battles.  I started a Najdorf tournament at the same time as this one and in one game we're still in the book at move 17 ..."

12,e5,e7e5,rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2p1n2/4p3/3NP3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,especially after this move prevents the e4 pawn from moving.  The drawback to this move is the weakening of d5.
13,Nf3,d4f3,rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2p1n2/4p3/4P3/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,"and the drawback of this is that it prevents White from playing a quick f4, the most direct route to attacking Black's centre.  7. Ne2 or 7. Nb3 or 7. Nf5 are preferable in my view."
14,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkb1r/1p3ppp/p2p1n2/4p3/4P1b1/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 8,"So I've been provoked into an unusually active move with my QB.  After 6...e5, this B normally heads straight for e6."

19,hxg4,h3g4,rn1qkb1r/1p3ppp/p2p4/4p2b/4P1P1/2NB1N2/PPP2P2/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 10,So Black has two pawns for a B and an annoying pin on White's N.  White's Kingside is in ruins but Black has yet to castle and has a gaping hole at d5.  The scene is set for more fireworks.
