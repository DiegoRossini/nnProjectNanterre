1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The 'King's Pawn Opening (B00)' is what white starts with. It is the most popular chess opening, and also one I am accustomed to opening with now. I had strange openings in the past, but now I'm just keeping it simple."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I, black, continue with the 'King's Pawn Game (C20)', a standard response. For about the fist 10 moves, these are all book moves, so really nothing exciting."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Another popular move, the 'King's Knight Opening (C40)'. This is something I've played very often, so I'm used to it."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,Black continues the 'King's Pawn Game (C44)'.
5,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 3,"Ah, another position I've played a lot, called the 'Three Knights Game (C46)'. I think we all see why it's named this."
6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 4 4,Probably no surprise that I played this. Also probably no surprise that's this is called the 'Four Knights Game (C46)'.
7,d4,d2d4,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"'Four Knights (C47), Scotch Variation'. Okay, not something I've encountered as much, but definitely no worry here."
8,exd4,e5d4,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/3pP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Black plays the 'Four Knights (C47), Scotch, 4...exd4'. Yes, that is the full name of this move."
9,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"Still continuing with the Four Knights Scotch. Again, not much excitement in the beginning, but I'm doing my best to make the right moves of course."
10,Bb4,f8b4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/1b1NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,"Although this is a position I'm not that used to seeing, I may not know the perfect moves to make, but I know which moves are wrong, which I'm sure is helping me here."
11,Nxc6,d4c6,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2N2n2/8/1b2P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,I was actually expecting that move.
12,bxc6,b7c6,r1bqk2r/p1pp1ppp/2p2n2/8/1b2P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"I could of played 6. dxc6, but that would of most likely resulted in a Queen's exchange, and I decided it was a little too early for that."
13,Bd3,f1d3,r1bqk2r/p1pp1ppp/2p2n2/8/1b2P3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,Protecting the e4 pawn I'd say.
14,d5,d7d5,r1bqk2r/p1p2ppp/2p2n2/3p4/1b2P3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,The exchange of pawns was pretty obvious.
15,exd5,e4d5,r1bqk2r/p1p2ppp/2p2n2/3P4/1b6/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,The exchange of pawns was pretty obvious.
16,cxd5,c6d5,r1bqk2r/p1p2ppp/5n2/3p4/1b6/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,The exchange of pawns was pretty obvious.
17,Qe2+,d1e2,r1bqk2r/p1p2ppp/5n2/3p4/1b6/2NB4/PPP1QPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 1 9,"If you look at the games Database, most of these moves are the most popular made. So far it seems black has made all the most popular moves, per the game database. White has not in all cases, including this one. Most popular was to castle, but I'd say white is being the aggressor, which is no problem for him. I think both me and him work better with fewer pieces on the board, and I think white is working toward exchanges here."
18,Be7,b4e7,r1bqk2r/p1p1bppp/5n2/3p4/8/2NB4/PPP1QPPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 2 10,"Black could of played Be6 or Qe7, but this move would prove to be the best move. Be6 could make my king more vulnerable and Qe7 would of likely led to a Queen's exchange, which I still did not want as of yet."
19,Bb5+,d3b5,r1bqk2r/p1p1bppp/5n2/1B1p4/8/2N5/PPP1QPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 3 10,"Not quite the move I was expecting. Of course, expect the unexpected, but I would of thought white would of castled. I'm planning to do so myself, thus I won't be moving my king."
20,Bd7,c8d7,r2qk2r/p1pbbppp/5n2/1B1p4/8/2N5/PPP1QPPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 4 11,I use my LSB to protect my king.
21,Bxd7+,b5d7,r2qk2r/p1pBbppp/5n2/3p4/8/2N5/PPP1QPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 0 11,Well that I was expecting.
22,Qxd7,d8d7,r3k2r/p1pqbppp/5n2/3p4/8/2N5/PPP1QPPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 0 12,"I could of done 3 other moves, but they weren't as good as this one. Kxd7 would of opened my king up to white more and prevented me from castling. Nxd7 would of lost me a pawn. Of course Kf8 is useless. Thus, Qxd7 was the best move, as it gets my queen involved as well. ."
