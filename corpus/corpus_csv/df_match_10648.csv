1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game is me vs my father on the chessclub. I was very lucky in this game. My dad could have won a lot of different ways, but he didn't. When I play chess against my dad at home, whether its blitz or not, I mostly win. Even this time, but with a lot of luck. 

I start with e4, thats how I mostly start."

Because I like playing f4 after 0-0, (I learned f4 on gameknot) I used the knight to block the check."

7,Nge2,g1e2,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/4q3/8/8/2N5/PPPPNPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 4,getting my bishop out
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1b1kbnr/ppp1pppp/2n1q3/8/8/2N5/PPPPNPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 4 5,getting my bishop out
9,d3,d2d3,r1b1kbnr/ppp1pppp/2n1q3/8/8/2NP4/PPP1NPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,getting my bishop out
10,Nd4,c6d4,r1b1kbnr/ppp1pppp/4q3/8/3n4/2NP4/PPP1NPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,This is a wasted move. I told him so when we analysed.
11,Be3,c1e3,r1b1kbnr/ppp1pppp/4q3/8/3n4/2NPB3/PPP1NPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 2 6,See? lost a tempo.
12,Nf5,d4f5,r1b1kbnr/ppp1pppp/4q3/5n2/8/2NPB3/PPP1NPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 3 7,See? lost a tempo.
13,g3,g2g3,r1b1kbnr/ppp1pppp/4q3/5n2/8/2NPB1P1/PPP1NP1P/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,Note black can do Nxe3 already. But we both didn't see it just yet. I did g3 to get my bishop out.
14,Nf6,g8f6,r1b1kb1r/ppp1pppp/4qn2/5n2/8/2NPB1P1/PPP1NP1P/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,I still didn't see Nxe3.
15,Bg2,f1g2,r1b1kb1r/ppp1pppp/4qn2/5n2/8/2NPB1P1/PPP1NPBP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 2 8,I still didn't see Nxe3.
16,Nxe3,f5e3,r1b1kb1r/ppp1pppp/4qn2/8/8/2NPn1P1/PPP1NPBP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 9,But he does.
17,fxe3,f2e3,r1b1kb1r/ppp1pppp/4qn2/8/8/2NPP1P1/PPP1N1BP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 9,black wins a pawn and has a queen on e3! seems very serious. White has deployed his pieces a little more though.
18,Qxe3,e6e3,r1b1kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/8/8/2NPq1P1/PPP1N1BP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 10,black wins a pawn and has a queen on e3! seems very serious. White has deployed his pieces a little more though.
19,Qd2,d1d2,r1b1kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/8/8/2NPq1P1/PPPQN1BP/R3K2R b KQkq - 1 10,I had to get his queen out of there right now.
20,Qxd2+,e3d2,r1b1kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/8/8/2NP2P1/PPPqN1BP/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 11,I cannot castle anymore.
21,Kxd2,e1d2,r1b1kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/8/8/2NP2P1/PPPKN1BP/R6R b kq - 0 11,I cannot castle anymore.
22,e6,e7e6,r1b1kb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/8/8/2NP2P1/PPPKN1BP/R6R w kq - 0 12,For getting his bishop out.
23,Rad1,a1d1,r1b1kb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/8/8/2NP2P1/PPPKN1BP/3R3R b kq - 1 12,"And look, I've castled long! :P"
24,Bd6,f8d6,r1b1k2r/ppp2ppp/3bpn2/8/8/2NP2P1/PPPKN1BP/3R3R w kq - 2 13,"And look, I've castled long! :P"

26,O-O,e8g8,r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/3bpn2/8/8/2NP2P1/PPP1N1BP/2KR3R w - - 4 14,This was because I thought Ng4 is a thread
27,Bf3,g2f3,r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/3bpn2/8/8/2NP1BP1/PPP1N2P/2KR3R b - - 5 14,This was because I thought Ng4 is a thread
28,c6,c7c6,r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/2pbpn2/8/8/2NP1BP1/PPP1N2P/2KR3R w - - 0 15,"He did this to save b7 (he wanted to move his white bishop)
I dont know if I would have done that. Getting the b-file for a pawn isn't such a bad deal. Rb8 is also possible."
29,h4,h2h4,r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/2pbpn2/8/7P/2NP1BP1/PPP1N3/2KR3R b - - 0 15,"Well, my idea was to push my g and h pawns forward to destroy the kingside pawns and win the game."
30,Re8,f8e8,r1b1r1k1/pp3ppp/2pbpn2/8/7P/2NP1BP1/PPP1N3/2KR3R w - - 1 16,Why Re8? Because I think a lot of chess players play Re1/Rd8 after castle-kingside of Rd1/Re8 after castle queen-side. D & E files are important files in the game.
31,g4,g3g4,r1b1r1k1/pp3ppp/2pbpn2/8/6PP/2NP1B2/PPP1N3/2KR3R b - - 0 16,Pushing my pawns forward to continue the idea
32,Kf8,g8f8,r1b1rk2/pp3ppp/2pbpn2/8/6PP/2NP1B2/PPP1N3/2KR3R w - - 1 17,I think this is just a wasted move.
33,Ne4,c3e4,r1b1rk2/pp3ppp/2pbpn2/8/4N1PP/3P1B2/PPP1N3/2KR3R b - - 2 17,"black had two choices; taking my knight, and having my bishop on e4 having a good thread on the pawns, or Be7, having a good knight on e4."
