5... Qa5  and 5... Ndb4 are both good responses to this speculative pawn push."

11,d5,d4d5,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n5/2pPP3/1nP5/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,"Looks like black can't continue on the best path.  The intentional pawn sacrifice will allow white large amounts of space, which provide free development and a half-open e-file to play with, which provides full compensation for the pawn.  A better response for black was 6... Nd4 taking the positional advantage instead of the material one."

At this point, you can see how white's compensation is realized.  Black's pieces are tied down, struggling to develop, and his knights are more of liabilities than assets."

If (13... Be7 14. Ng5), capturing the knight seems like suicide with open e- and f-files against the uncastled king.  Better is to leave the Ng5 alone in this situation, but forget ideas about castling king side.

13... h6 with the idea of preventing Ng5 will eventually leave the black king stuck in the center after the simple 14. Re1 .  Possible continuations involve (14.... Be7 15. Qe2 Nf8 16. Nc3 Nc7) with a strong attack or (14... Ne7 15. Be4) simply restraining black's king and queen sides."

15...  Bf5 with the idea of queen-side castling holds better for black.  Castling into where all of white's pieces are directed loses on the spot."
