I had shortly before playing this played another of these games where I won using this move and easy19 challenged me to this game to show me the correct way that white should respond to this move.
16,Kc6,d7c6,rn1q1b1r/pp2p1pp/2k1B3/2p3N1/4pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 3 9,And here we have the point of this game. I had shortly before playing this played another of these games where I won using this move and easy19 challenged me to this game to show me the correct way that white should respond to this move.

18,h5,h7h5,rn1q1b1r/pp2p1p1/2k5/2p3Np/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 0 10,And here we have the point of this game. I had shortly before playing this played another of these games where I won using this move and easy19 challenged me to this game to show me the correct way that white should respond to this move.
19,Bf5,g4f5,rn1q1b1r/pp2p1p1/2k5/2p2BNp/4pP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 1 10,by far the best move here. It keeps white playing actively as well as keeping the pieces in touch with each other.
20,e5,e7e5,rn1q1b1r/pp4p1/2k5/2p1pBNp/4pP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 0 11,A very poor choice by me. I even new that this is a bad move in this opening but for some reason I seemed to be under the impression that having played h5 somehow changes that. God only knows why I thought that.
21,Bxe4+,f5e4,rn1q1b1r/pp4p1/2k5/2p1p1Np/4BP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 0 11,At first glance it appears white is getting greedy and only seeking the fork of the queen and h rook. In reality White is only using this square as a stopping station to get to a much better square (Being e5)
22,Kb6,c6b6,rn1q1b1r/pp4p1/1k6/2p1p1Np/4BP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 1 12,At first glance it appears white is getting greedy and only seeking the fork of the queen and h rook. In reality White is only using this square as a stopping station to get to a much better square (Being e5)
23,Nf7,g5f7,rn1q1b1r/pp3Np1/1k6/2p1p2p/4BP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 2 12,At first glance it appears white is getting greedy and only seeking the fork of the queen and h rook. In reality White is only using this square as a stopping station to get to a much better square (Being e5)
24,Qe7,d8e7,rn3b1r/pp2qNp1/1k6/2p1p2p/4BP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 3 13,? again I think a poor choice of moves. For some reason I seemed to think white might play Nxh8 then I could follow up with exf4. really all this does is misplace my queen and block in my own DSB.
25,Nxe5,f7e5,rn3b1r/pp2q1p1/1k6/2p1N2p/4BP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 0 13,it is here I began getting glimpses of how bad my position really was. I began to realised the potential of forks  knowing full well that White would play Nc3! the move I just made is still good seeking to trade off even if it cant do so yet.
26,Nc6,b8c6,r4b1r/pp2q1p1/1kn5/2p1N2p/4BP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 1 14,it is here I began getting glimpses of how bad my position really was.

27,Nc3,b1c3,r4b1r/pp2q1p1/1kn5/2p1N2p/4BP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 2 14,"! as I said, black would like to play Nxc5 but because of the fork threat it is impossible."
28,Rd8,a8d8,3r1b1r/pp2q1p1/1kn5/2p1N2p/4BP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 3 15,white has good piece co-ordination and realises that this move takes advantage of blacks lack of piece of coordination.
29,Ng6,e5g6,3r1b1r/pp2q1p1/1kn3N1/2p4p/4BP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 4 15,white has good piece co-ordination and realises that this move takes advantage of blacks lack of piece of coordination.
30,Qf6,e7f6,3r1b1r/pp4p1/1kn2qN1/2p4p/4BP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 5 16,cements the knight in place.
31,f5,f4f5,3r1b1r/pp4p1/1kn2qN1/2p2P1p/4B3/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 0 16,cements the knight in place.
32,Rd4,d8d4,5b1r/pp4p1/1kn2qN1/2p2P1p/3rB3/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 1 17,White just has time t do everything whereas black seems to be scrambling around with no real idea of whats going on.
33,O-O,e1g1,5b1r/pp4p1/1kn2qN1/2p2P1p/3rB3/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1B2RK1 b - - 2 17,White just has time t do everything whereas black seems to be scrambling around with no real idea of whats going on.
34,Rh7,h8h7,5b2/pp4pr/1kn2qN1/2p2P1p/3rB3/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1B2RK1 w - - 3 18,poor move but I could not think of any better. Having played Qf6 my queen is still vulnerable to king/queen forks. I would have liked to play Rxe4 but unfortunately the rook needs to stay on the d file to guard against Nd5+
35,Nxf8,g6f8,5N2/pp4pr/1kn2q2/2p2P1p/3rB3/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1B2RK1 b - - 0 18,White is suddenly looking very very good. I'm afraid to say it just got even worse from here. I think I probably should have taken this opportunity to rid myself of whites annoying bishop.
36,Qxf8,f6f8,5q2/pp4pr/1kn5/2p2P1p/3rB3/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1B2RK1 w - - 0 19,White is suddenly looking very very good. I'm afraid to say it just got even worse from here. I think I probably should have taken this opportunity to rid myself of whites annoying bishop.

38,Rh8,h7h8,5q1r/pp4p1/1kn5/2p2P1p/3rB3/2NP4/PPP3PP/R1B2RK1 w - - 1 20,makes my earlier Rd4 just look silly. Best here was most likely Qd8.
39,Be3,c1e3,5q1r/pp4p1/1kn5/2p2P1p/3rB3/2NPB3/PPP3PP/R4RK1 b - - 2 20,makes my earlier Rd4 just look silly. Best here was most likely Qd8.

41,b4,b2b4,5q1r/pp4p1/1knr4/2p2P1p/1P2B3/2NPB3/P1P3PP/R4RK1 b - - 0 21,And this is where my opponent said in chat OK here we go... I could see I was in a heck of a lot of trouble. anyone could see white is dictating this game. and has most pieces all in position for the attack.
