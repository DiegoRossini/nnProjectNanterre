1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,So I start conventionally
2,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,He plays the Dutch Defence.
3,g3,g2g3,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/3P4/6P1/PPP1PP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,I play the main line.
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppppp1pp/5n2/5p2/3P4/6P1/PPP1PP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,Very conventional!
5,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqkb1r/ppppp1pp/5n2/5p2/3P4/6P1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 3,The logical follow-up to my last.
6,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/ppppp2p/5np1/5p2/3P4/6P1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 4,"I threaten e4, but I found out later that this move actually scores very badly in practice."
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/ppppp2p/5np1/5p2/3P4/2N3P1/PPP1PPBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 4,"I threaten e4, but I found out later that this move actually scores very badly in practice."
8,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppppp1bp/5np1/5p2/3P4/2N3P1/PPP1PPBP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 2 5,"He ignores my ""threat"", but d5, stopping it, scores better on the opening database."
9,e4,e2e4,rnbqk2r/ppppp1bp/5np1/5p2/3PP3/2N3P1/PPP2PBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,So I continue with the logical move.
10,fxe4,f5e4,rnbqk2r/ppppp1bp/5np1/8/3Pp3/2N3P1/PPP2PBP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,"He correctly takes, rather allow me to eventually get in e4-e5, see Charles Higgie (BCF158) vs. TimHilton (BCF141), where I gained a massive opening advantage, but eventually lost."
11,Nxe4,c3e4,rnbqk2r/ppppp1bp/5np1/8/3PN3/6P1/PPP2PBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 6,So I take back.
12,Nxe4,f6e4,rnbqk2r/ppppp1bp/6p1/8/3Pn3/6P1/PPP2PBP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 7,He takes again
13,Bxe4,g2e4,rnbqk2r/ppppp1bp/6p1/8/3PB3/6P1/PPP2P1P/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 7,I take back
14,d5,d7d5,rnbqk2r/ppp1p1bp/6p1/3p4/3PB3/6P1/PPP2P1P/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 8,"This scores badly on the databases, and I am not surprised - it leaves black with a backward e pawn on the semi-open e file (in other words, given time I can pile up my rooks against it. While in some openings, black can live with a backward pawn in a semi-open file (for instance e7-e5 systems in the open Sicilian), it is dubious here."
15,Bg2,e4g2,rnbqk2r/ppp1p1bp/6p1/3p4/3P4/6P1/PPP2PBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 8,So I drop back.
16,c6,c7c6,rnbqk2r/pp2p1bp/2p3p1/3p4/3P4/6P1/PPP2PBP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 9,He re-enforces the d pawn. He can't immediately play e7-e5? as I can take on e5 followed by taking on d5.
17,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk2r/pp2p1bp/2p3p1/3p4/3P4/5NP1/PPP2PBP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 9,"Now this is where we leave the opening databases. In both the games where this position can up, white has played Ne2. But my move seems to me more logical - preventing e7-e5 and leaving the e file open for my rooks. What do you think dear reader?"
18,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qk2r/pp2p1bp/2p3p1/3p4/3P2b1/5NP1/PPP2PBP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 10,"A logical move from his, if he wants to get in e7-e5."
19,O-O,e1g1,rn1qk2r/pp2p1bp/2p3p1/3p4/3P2b1/5NP1/PPP2PBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 3 10,"This move prevents e7-e5 as I can exchange on e5, followed by Rf1-e1, and win the Be5."
20,O-O,e8g8,rn1q1rk1/pp2p1bp/2p3p1/3p4/3P2b1/5NP1/PPP2PBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 4 11,So he castles
21,Re1,f1e1,rn1q1rk1/pp2p1bp/2p3p1/3p4/3P2b1/5NP1/PPP2PBP/R1BQR1K1 b - - 5 11,"and I prevent e7-e5 again. He started to play very slowly now, perhaps a sign he was concerned with his position."
