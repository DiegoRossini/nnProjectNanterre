3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"I ignore the problem and proceed as normal hoping for a (perhaps impossible?) transposition somewhere down the road into QGA, the only thing I know."
4,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,Still pretending like I don't notice the fianchetto

6,d6,d7d6,rnbqk1nr/ppp1ppbp/3p2p1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,I reckon I need to take control of the center now.  I begrudingly do as I've been told.

8,Nd7,b8d7,r1bqk1nr/pppnppbp/3p2p1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,I'm dying to castle right now.  I feel very uncomfortable and naked.
9,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqk1nr/pppnppbp/3p2p1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,I'm dying to castle right now.  I feel very uncomfortable and naked.
10,e5,e7e5,r1bqk1nr/pppn1pbp/3p2p1/4p3/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Well here it comes, a direct attack on my D guy.  I knew we couldn't just stay friends and move around on the board forever."
11,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqk1nr/pppn1pbp/3p2p1/4p1B1/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,I want him to move his f pawn up to block in the G bishop.  Shot in the dark.
12,f6,f7f6,r1bqk1nr/pppn2bp/3p1pp1/4p1B1/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"To my surprise, black does what I wanted.  I thought for sure Ngf6 would be the move.  But I guess it's right to put pressure on my bish here too."
13,Be3,g5e3,r1bqk1nr/pppn2bp/3p1pp1/4p3/2PPP3/2N1BN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 7,"I don't mind moving the bish back because I've seen it done by the masters.  So right now I feel like a master, moving him back and forth."
14,Ne7,g8e7,r1bqk2r/pppnn1bp/3p1pp1/4p3/2PPP3/2N1BN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 8,White castles sound good right now

16,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pppnn1bp/3p1pp1/4p3/2PPP3/2NBBN2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 4 9,I imagine Black Castle would be like Krystal's.
17,O-O,e1g1,r1bq1rk1/pppnn1bp/3p1pp1/4p3/2PPP3/2NBBN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 5 9,"At this point I could put down about 9 or 10 sliders, White Castle or Krystal I don't care.  Kobeyeshi (sp) endorses Krystal's so I'm leaning that way right now, plus there's one close to my home.  The only White Castles around here are in the frozen section of Stop n Shop."

21,a3,a2a3,r1bq1r1k/1ppnn1bp/p2p1pp1/4p3/2PPP3/PQNBBN2/1P3PPP/R4RK1 b - - 0 11,I usually do a3 when I'm not sure what else to do.
