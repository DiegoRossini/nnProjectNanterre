2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"black responds symmetrically for 1.e4 with e5, this keeps options opens for both sides."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,With this natural move 2.Nf3 white threatens the e5 pawn and clears the way for castling.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,Black protect his e5 pawn and creates a direct threat to d4. This defends the centre and plays to reach an equal position.
5,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,"The start of the Ruy lopez, the Spanish game, By 3.Bb5 white puts the pressure on the knight and creates a potential threat to win the e5 pawn by Bxc6 followed with Nxe5. But it is not yet time to win the e-pawn. If he plays Bxc6 dxc6 Nxe5 Black will win the pawn back with a Queen Fork: Qd4 with a good position.

It is designed to maintain long-term pressure on Black's center. If driven away, the King's Bishop will take up a position at b3 or c2 to focus on a Kingside attack or on the central squares.

We can regroup the ruy lopez in two major lines:

A-defensive systems without the move 3...a6.
1-Cordel defense 3...Bc5.
2-Bird defense 3...Nd4.
3-Jannisch gambit 3...f5.
4-Berlin defense 3...Nf6.
5-Steinitz defense 3...d6.
6-rare schemes: other responds to Bc5 except 3...a6

 
B-defensive systems with 3...a6 
1-Exchange variation 4.Bxc6
2-Moeller system 4.Ba4 Bc5
3-The improved steinitz defense 4.Ba4 d6
4-Open variation 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Nxe4
5-Chigorin system 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 d6
6-Marshall counter attack 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 0-0 8.c3 d5 9.exd5
7-Variation with 4.Ba4 f5"

7,Ba4,b5a4,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"White makes no sense to 3.Bb5 if he moves other than Ba4 or Bxc6.
White chooses to stay on the diagonal, White can take by the bishop! and enter the exchange variation of the ruy lopez, but delays the capture of the e5 pawn.
If white tries to capture the e5 pawn with 4.Bxc6 then follows 4...dxc6 5.Nxe5 Qd4!! White forks the knight and takes the pawn with check it leads to the loss of the favor of castling for white and a good attack chances for black. with the variation 5...Qd4!! 6.Nc3 Qxe4  7.Qe2 Qxe2  8.Kxe2 ."
