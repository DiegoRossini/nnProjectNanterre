Alas, posts do get deleted from the general forums after a while so I thought it was high time to annotate it here, especially as I have recently played another game which involved a player promoting a pawn two moves before me which I will annotate as Jo's Great Escape Part 2."

7,Qxd4,d1d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/3QP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"Ion stated here that he prefers 3.Nxd4 rather than the queen recapture, even if it does mean the knight being moved twice. After 3.Qxd4 Black could have developed with gain of tempo by a timely ...Nc6 (though 3...Nc6 at once is met by 4.Bb5)"
8,Qf6,d8f6,rnb1kbnr/ppp2ppp/3p1q2/8/3QP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"Ion stated here - I would also criticise Black's 3...Qf6. You could have done better than to exchange at once on f6 with almost any developing move. Clearly Black wanted to exchange queens. Very well, your queen is protected, let him exchange in his time. E.g. 4.Nc3 (say) 4...Qxd4 5.Nxd4 and you have some threats coming up against the c7-square. 4...Nc6 won't help him much after 5.Bb5."
