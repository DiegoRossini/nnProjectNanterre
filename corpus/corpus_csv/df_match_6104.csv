However, white has two major positional victories #1 strong and mobile pieces and creating a weakness on ...c6. The drawback of the exchange varation for white is that he has a weak centre. It is instructive how black manages to undermine it."
15,O-O,e1g1,r2qkb1r/pp1b1ppp/2n1pn2/1B1p4/3P1B2/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 1 8,intending to wreck whites pawn structure with Bxc3 which weakens whites control of the important d5 and e4 squares.

To add to this e4 is now available for a knight. Because e4 is now available the black knight the balance of power in the centre as shifted in black's favor.
