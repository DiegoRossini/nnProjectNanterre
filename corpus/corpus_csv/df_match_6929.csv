1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"In our openings, we need to consult the databases and opening books, and there are reasons why departures from established theory are bad -- they are dross in the crucible of experience.  In this game, black's first error comes on the fourth move, and a crucial blunder at move seven makes white's win inevitable.  Yet white, confident in the outcome, makes a lazy decision at move 14, prolonging the game unnecessarily."
