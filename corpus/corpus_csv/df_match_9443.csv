1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!  As I recently played the Latvian against Ion, who kindly e-mailed me the following game, I thought it was worth annotating because Ion handled this opening very well and took full advantage of his opponent's innacuracies.  As for the king hunt at the end of the game, well, in my book, king hunts are always worth annotating!  I hope you have some happy reading here.  Cheers everyone - Joanne"

Yes, this seems Ok, Ion but I think it is how white subsequently plays that turns things down south."

7,Qe2,d1e2,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/5P2/4p3/5N2/PPPPQPPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 1 4,4. Qe2 - pinning the pawn on e4 but blocking in white's lsb.
8,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/8/3p1P2/4p3/5N2/PPPPQPPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 5,5. d4 is possible here because black cannot take the pawn ep because it is illegal!  d4 opens up the line for the dsb to move to g5 with a pin should Ion choose to put his knight there.  He does and the knight gets pinned.

Yup, agreed here, maybe a possible alternative to 7. Bg5 was g3 followed by a kingside fianchetto either here or instead of 8. Nxd7.  What do you the jury think?"

The plethora of exchanges on d7 has helped black's development.  White still needs to develop his queen knight and lsb - it will take at least 2 moves to develop this bishop."

Yes, Ion, I understand, been there myself in a game I am currently playing against a 1200  player.  I don't think it will affect the result but I think it has delayed it.  That game may well appear in the public annotations as it is a rather unusual opening when it is finished."
