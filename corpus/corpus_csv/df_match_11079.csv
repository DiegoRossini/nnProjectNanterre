2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"My coach taught us the Center-Counter Defense that day, and was testing my knowledge of it, although he usually plays the Sveshnikov. Whenver he teaches his students a new opening, he plays it against them all at the same time. In the Center-Counter, Black sacrifices one tempo in the opening for imbalanced positional play."
