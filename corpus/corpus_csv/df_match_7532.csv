7,Be2,f1e2,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/4q3/8/2N5/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 3 4,This contests control of d5 and provides a bolt hole for the adventurous Queen.

13,d4,d2d4,rn2kbnr/ppq1pppp/2p5/5b2/3P4/2N2N1P/PPP1BPP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,I didn't want to castle too early as this would enable Black to point everything at my King.  This move contests the centre and enables my QB to develop.

20,Bd6,f8d6,rn2k2r/ppq2ppp/2pbpnb1/8/3P4/2NBBN1P/PPP2PP1/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 6 11,"This is a strong attacking position for this Bishop, supported as it is by the Q on c7 but it doesn't actually threaten anything serious."

That would obviously be too good to be true but thinking about it gave me other attacking ideas.  I expected Black to castle immediately, which would have suited me because I thought he was probably planning .... 0-0-0, so I would have been satisfied at foiling his (supposed) plan."

From my point of view, I didn't really mind which way he went as my pieces ere centrally placed to attack on either wing but if he did want to castle long, I wanted to frustrate him, so..."

White also has to be careful about abandoning the defence of the Rook on e1.  Yesterday's Guardian featured a nice finish by Bronstein which exploited the fact that all Black's pieces were over on the Queenside, including the Q on a5.  I wish I'd seen it before I played this game!"

Now, if I'd seen Bronstein's game, I'd undoubtedly have launched an all-out assault on Black's castled King.
