5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 3,"If I played, I prefer 3.Nf3 instead of 3.Bc4, because it avoids the annoying 3...Qh4+."
6,Qh4+,d8h4,rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1Pp1q/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 4,"What was that? I think that Kieseritsky tried to activate the light squared bishop on a6-f1 diagonal by some moves later, where the white King was."

9,Bxb5,c4b5,rnb1kbnr/p1pp1ppp/8/1B6/4Pp1q/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1KNR b kq - 0 5,"As I think, 5.Nf3 followed by 6.Bb3 and 7.d3 (or d4 if possible) will give white a better control over the center. On the other hand, it was recapturing the pawn he offered in the second move."
