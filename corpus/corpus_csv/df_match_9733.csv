13. Nb5!! (either knight, doesn't essentially matter)

now the knight forks queen and d6. obviously the queen must move, but even then i must be very careful where, a white square is best to avoid another knight attack in a few moves...
14... Qc6
15. Nxd6...
now knight forks bishop and, more importantly, the weak f7. i can do nothing to stop the queen moving in on f7, forcing the king onto d8, where he is in deep trouble.
if...
15... Kd8
16. Nxf7  and the rook is lost
anything else and...
16. Qxf7  Kd8
17. Nxb7
