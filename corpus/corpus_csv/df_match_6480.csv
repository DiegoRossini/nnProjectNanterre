21,Bd2,c1d2,rnb2rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/q7/3PP3/5N2/P2BBPPP/1R1QK2R b K - 2 11,The endgame after 11. Qd2 Qxd2+ 12. Bxd2 is no problem for Black. Without the Queens it's much easier to make use of the Q-side pawn majority.

One comment said that sacrificing a pawn like this leads to nowhere after 12...b6 13. Qc1. Little did they know about the times to come. The most pertinent game in that line is Ivanchuck - Svidler, Linares 1998, where White slowly used his central control to build up his position to achieve a winning advantage."

24,Bg4,c8g4,rn3rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/8/3PP1b1/5N2/q2BBPPP/1R1Q1RK1 w - - 2 13,The modern way of handling the variation. Black wastes no time in completing his development. 12...Nd7 is another attempt to clench the position without returning material but it gives White a very free hand and Black has to confide himself to the back three ranks for quite some time.

28,Nc6,b8c6,r4rk1/pp2ppb1/2n3pp/8/3PP1b1/4BN2/q3BPPP/1R1Q1RK1 w - - 2 15,"Developing the last piece and putting more pressure on d4. Central pressure is the main way that Black can achieve counterplay in the Gruenfeld and it's also one of the reasons why Black has no ""bad"" pieces, i.e. the Bc8 is bad for Black in quite a few systems, the Benoni and the French, the Bf8 is bad in some lines of the Kid, the Nb8 is bad in some lines of the Ruy Lopez and again in some KID lines. But one of the perks of the Gruenfeld is that Black has no bad pieces in almost all the lines, everything on the board works together, provided you know what you're doing and this game is a good example of that. For example in this position, all the three light pieces create pressure on the d4 pawn, which was the reason why the first Knight and the two pawns were exchanged in the opening. It's interesting to note that the Qa2 isn't necessarily misplaced. I'm sure many chessplayers have seen the very good game Nimzowitsch - Capablanca, St. Petersburg 1914, where White lost just because he withdrew his Queen from the enemy camp after capturing a pawn and lost just enough time to hand the initiative over to the Cuban, who never returned the favour and won the game in a modern fashion."
29,d5,d4d5,r4rk1/pp2ppb1/2n3pp/3P4/4P1b1/4BN2/q3BPPP/1R1Q1RK1 b - - 0 15,"The best way to relieve the pressure on the d4 pawn. Other moves don't promise White anything. Now Black has to make a difficult choice. Not only where to move the Knight but if to capture on f3 before. 15...Na5 is considered weaker here, mainly because h6 has been played. Also, I remembered reading an old article by Khalifman about his game with Leko, which was just whitewashed after 15...Ne5. So I chose to exchange on f3 first, in order to make the e5 square more secure."
30,Bxf3,g4f3,r4rk1/pp2ppb1/2n3pp/3P4/4P3/4Bb2/q3BPPP/1R1Q1RK1 w - - 0 16,"White has to recapture on f3 now and he has a difficult choice before him. There are good points to each recapture. For example, capturing with the pawn gets rid of the back rank weakness, strengthens the pawn chain and especially the e-pawn in case the e-file should open, it also keeps the Bishop available to come to the a2-g8 diagonal and make use of the weakened Black K-side. The drawback is that it weakens the squares around the King and especially h2. Capturing with the Bishop doesn't create any weakness, it also puts the unopposed Bishop on the long diagonal, but behind its own pawn and it also gives Black a relatively stable Knight on e5. In my database, the pawn recapture is played more often and with better results, probably for the reasons given above."

34,a5,a7a5,r4rk1/1R2ppb1/6pp/p2Pn3/4P3/4BB2/q4PPP/3Q1RK1 w - - 0 18,"A very good line for counterplay. I believe Black has equalized here because even though White's d-pawn is closer to the Queening square, it's less supported than Black's. Also, by advancing the pawn, the Ra8 is directly activated and thus the time lost in capturing the a2 pawn is restored."
35,Rxe7,b7e7,r4rk1/4Rpb1/6pp/p2Pn3/4P3/4BB2/q4PPP/3Q1RK1 b - - 0 18,"White has won another pawn but the Rook is more stranded than the Black Queen and it will need to waste time to return to a safe square. Also, the Qa2 is a better piece to support the advancement of the pawn than the Re7."

37,Be2,f3e2,r4rk1/4Rpb1/6pp/3Pn3/p3P3/4B3/q3BPPP/3Q1RK1 b - - 1 19,"This is almost an acknowledgement of the wrong choice of recapture on move 16. White wants to cover c4 and be ready to kick the Knight with f4. The game in my database continues with 19. Bd4 and that looks like a better move, even though it allows Black to equalize comfortably."
38,Qb2,a2b2,r4rk1/4Rpb1/6pp/3Pn3/p3P3/4B3/1q2BPPP/3Q1RK1 w - - 2 20,"Remember the point about not retreating pieces that exert pressure on the enemy position? With this quite shuffle, the path of the pawn is cleared and the key move 20. Bd4 is prevented, after with would follow 20...Nf3+ 21. gxf3 Bxd4 and with opposite coloured Bishops, the a-pawn is even more dangerous."
