1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Each player was given the colour of choice for them and if they chose black they could chose whites first move provided it is something he would normally play. I chose to play white.
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I went for the queens gambit here as it is something I am familer with and scores well for white. Prehaps what I should have done was create an extremly sharp tatical game considering he was playing something like twenty games at once.

4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Queens gambit declined. Blacks looking for a boring simple opening where he doesn't need to spend time thinking about the moves.
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,I actually meant to move Nc3 but I'm so used to this move that I just made it without thinking.
6,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,Once again I made the wrong move! I actually meant to move a4 but instead made this.
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3p4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,Once again I made the wrong move! I actually meant to move a4 but instead made this.

10,b5,b7b5,rnbqkbnr/p4ppp/2p1p3/1p6/2pPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,Now black should be able to hold on to his extra pawn.
11,a4,a2a4,rnbqkbnr/p4ppp/2p1p3/1p6/P1pPP3/2N2N2/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,In hopes to undermine his pawn chain.
12,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk1nr/p4ppp/2p1p3/1p6/PbpPP3/2N2N2/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,With a powerful pin on my King I can't move my knight.
13,axb5,a4b5,rnbqk1nr/p4ppp/2p1p3/1P6/1bpPP3/2N2N2/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,If I can get his Bishop to take my knight then I will have a nice pawn centre and should be able to get back my pawn later on.

15,Be2,f1e2,rnbqk1nr/p4ppp/4p3/1p6/1bpPP3/2N2N2/1P2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 8,I wanted to castle as soon as possible and didn't want to move my DSB just yet.
16,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqk2r/p4ppp/4pn2/1p6/1bpPP3/2N2N2/1P2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 9,I could protect my e pawn with something like Bd2 but I didn't want to isolate my b pawn.
17,e5,e4e5,rnbqk2r/p4ppp/4pn2/1p2P3/1bpP4/2N2N2/1P2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 9,Adds an extra attacker on My knight.
18,Nd5,f6d5,rnbqk2r/p4ppp/4p3/1p1nP3/1bpP4/2N2N2/1P2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 10,Adds an extra attacker on My knight.
19,Qc2,d1c2,rnbqk2r/p4ppp/4p3/1p1nP3/1bpP4/2N2N2/1PQ1BPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 2 10,This is a fairly strong square for my queen and it also protects my knight on c3.
20,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk2r/p4ppp/2n1p3/1p1nP3/1bpP4/2N2N2/1PQ1BPPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 3 11,Naturally a master feels no need to trade off just yet. instead he develops another piece. A piece which proves to be fairly troublesome a little bit later on.
21,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk2r/p4ppp/2n1p3/1p1nP3/1bpP4/2N2N2/1PQ1BPPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 4 11,Well at the very least I got him to waste some tempo retreating the bishop.
22,Nxc3,d5c3,r1bqk2r/p4ppp/2n1p3/1p2P3/1bpP4/2n2N2/1PQ1BPPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 0 12,Well at the very least I got him to waste some tempo retreating the bishop.

26,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/p3bppp/2n1p3/1p2P3/2pP4/2P1BN2/2Q1BPPP/R4RK1 w - - 3 14,I didn't have a definite plan yet but I figured to bring my rook to here couldn't be so bad with ideas of a central pawn push and maybe doubling up on the d file.
27,Rfd1,f1d1,r1bq1rk1/p3bppp/2n1p3/1p2P3/2pP4/2P1BN2/2Q1BPPP/R2R2K1 b - - 4 14,I didn't have a definite plan yet but I figured to bring my rook to here couldn't be so bad with ideas of a central pawn push and maybe doubling up on the d file.

29,Rd2,d1d2,r1bq1rk1/p3b1pp/2n1p3/1p2Pp2/2pP4/2P1BN2/2QRBPPP/R5K1 b - - 1 15,With a blatantly clear plan to double up.
