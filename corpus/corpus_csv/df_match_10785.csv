10,Bd6,f8d6,r1bqk1nr/1pp2ppp/p1pb4/4p3/4P3/5N1P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 6,Protecting e5.

Seriously, I'm rated 1700  and this is what my game comes down to -- a counterattack where I have to hope my opponent makes a huge mistake.  This is the strategy I stick by, by the way -- if you make it easy for your opponent he'll come and get you, but if you make as many complications as you can and create pitfalls, he just may fall into one!"
