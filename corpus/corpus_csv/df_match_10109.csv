1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,Why not c4 here? It would stake claim to some of the center immediately.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 2,Why not c4 here? It would stake claim to some of the center immediately.

6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,Similar to the Bogo-Indian but made with the Samisch variation in mind. 3. e3 allows for the exchange of bishops without the doubling of pawns commonly associated with the Samisch.
7,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,Similar to the Bogo-Indian but made with the Samisch variation in mind. 3. e3 allows for the exchange of bishops without the doubling of pawns commonly associated with the Samisch.
8,Bb4+,f8b4,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/1bPP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,Similar to the Bogo-Indian but made with the Samisch variation in mind. 3. e3 allows for the exchange of bishops without the doubling of pawns commonly associated with the Samisch.
9,Bd2,c1d2,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/1bPP4/4PN2/PP1B1PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,Exchanging the bishops made me very happy. It makes it a little harder to attack the kingside with bishop-queen barrage.
10,Bxd2+,b4d2,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/4PN2/PP1b1PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,Exchanging the bishops made me very happy. It makes it a little harder to attack the kingside with bishop-queen barrage.
11,Nbxd2,b1d2,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/4PN2/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"Why did White not take with the Queen and just simply develop on the next move with Nc3? I suspect he was expecting me to take the c pawn, and after taking with the bishop to follow up with e4 posting control over the center."
12,c5,c7c5,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/2PP4/4PN2/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,Immediately challenging the d4. I think this move was better then dxc4 in that it at least develops a piece and gains space.
13,Nb3,d2b3,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/2PP4/1N2PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 7,I suppose this move was a matter of taste. Nbxd4 would have been acceptable as well I suspect. At least with Nbxd4 White would cover the e5 square in preparation to the eventual pawn push.
14,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/4pn2/3p4/2Pp4/1N2PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,I suppose this move was a matter of taste. Nbxd4 would have been acceptable as well I suspect. At least with Nbxd4 White would cover the e5 square in preparation to the eventual pawn push.
15,Nfxd4,f3d4,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PN4/1N2P3/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,I suppose this move was a matter of taste. Nbxd4 would have been acceptable as well I suspect. At least with Nbxd4 White would cover the e5 square in preparation to the eventual pawn push.
16,dxc4,d5c4,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/4pn2/8/2pN4/1N2P3/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 9,This move violates one of those addressed in My System. It allows for White to exchange while developing a piece. Perhaps Nc6 would have been in order to challenge the knight and possibly building a pawn chain after the exchanges of the knights.
17,Bxc4,f1c4,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/4pn2/8/2BN4/1N2P3/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 9,"A development move was in order at this point. By playing e5 would have lead to the exchange of the queens but since White is more developed, he would have been in better shape come the endgame ruling out this move. Interesting was Nbd7, however it blocks in the bishop."
18,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/8/2BN4/1N2P3/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 1 10,"A development move was in order at this point.

21,Qf3,d1f3,rnbq1rk1/1p3ppp/p3pn2/8/2BN4/1N2PQ2/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b - - 1 11,This move makes it impossible to play Nc6 right away since White would win the pawn after the exchange. The move also prevents Bd7 with the hope of playing Nc6 under more favorable conditions.
22,Qe7,d8e7,rnb2rk1/1p2qppp/p3pn2/8/2BN4/1N2PQ2/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w - - 2 12,Over-protection of the b7 allowing for Nc6 again after Bd7.
