After 5. d4 exd4 6. cxd4 Black can play Bb4+ with a reasonable game. So instead I play a version of the Giuoco Pianissimo, ""Very quiet Game"", going for a slow build-up, castling first and maybe playing d4 when I am better develped. Black has played well so far."

Bxc4 may be OK too. Instead he seems to miss my threat, and also makes another mistake, that of moving a piece twice in the opening, for no good reason."
