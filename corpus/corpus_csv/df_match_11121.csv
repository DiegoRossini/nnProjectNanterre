1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I am white in this gameknot mini-tournament. It shows how I didn't give up after losing a piece and ended up with a brilliant tactical attack.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"This move, and 1...c5 are the openings with the best reputations against e4. Still playable, but less common and slightly more passive are 1...e6 and 1...c6."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,The accurate move since I develop a piece while attacking a pawn.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"2...d6 is a more solid move, but it is also passive."
5,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,I believe the best choices for White's 3rd move are 3.Bb5 or 3.d4. I don't think any other moves will give White a slight advantage.
6,a6,a7a6,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,This is the main line of the Ruy Lopez.
7,Ba4,b5a4,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,Main line.
8,f6,f7f6,r1bqkbnr/1ppp2pp/p1n2p2/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"This is not the main line. Black does not develop anything, and cramps his position. I thought about the complicated sacrifice, Bxc6 dxc6 Nxe5 fxe5 Qh5 , but it is too risky and unsound. I should be able to get an advantage another way."
9,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/1ppp2pp/p1n2p2/4p3/B2PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,Black's wasted tempo justifies me wanting to open up the centre.
10,Bd6,f8d6,r1bqk1nr/1ppp2pp/p1nb1p2/4p3/B2PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 6,"Black is obstructing his d-pawn and developing his bishop to an unimportant square,  while all my moves have been toward development."
11,c3,c2c3,r1bqk1nr/1ppp2pp/p1nb1p2/4p3/B2PP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"This move gives my bishop the c2 retreat square if it wants to give additional support to my e-pawn, while also giving me the option of recapturing with the pawn if Black plays exd4."
12,Qe7,d8e7,r1b1k1nr/1pppq1pp/p1nb1p2/4p3/B2PP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 7,I don't want to go to c2 yet. I wanted to attack Black's weakened a2-g8 diagonal.
13,O-O,e1g1,r1b1k1nr/1pppq1pp/p1nb1p2/4p3/B2PP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 2 7,I don't want to go to c2 yet. I wanted to attack Black's weakened a2-g8 diagonal.

17,Re1,f1e1,r3k1nr/1bppq1pp/p1nb1p2/1p2p3/3PP3/1BP2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq - 3 9,Castling kingside would be hard to do because of my strong light bishop. But now I have a target on the queenside.
