1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"King's Pawn Opening - my only repertoire as White. I have not run this through either GK or any other computer analysis as I would prefer to learn from my approach, so please comment wherever you think my analysis is flawed and tell me why. I'm not perfect - yet! :)"
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Black responds with the Sicilian Defense, an opening that 1. e4 players must feel competent against due to it's popularity."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"If Black had played 2... d6 instead, I would probably have continued with a Moroxy Bind with 3. c4, delaying d4 for later."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"If Black had played 2... d6 instead, I would probably have continued with a Moroxy Bind with 3. c4, delaying d4 for later."
5,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,I used to play some strange Anti-Sicilian methods like 2. b4? but have come to realise this is the best response for my style of play - and probably in general.
6,cxd4,c5d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"A position reached for White in many variations of Sicilian's, with Black's second move being the variant of either Nc6, d6 or e6, in my experience."
7,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"A position reached for White in many variations of Sicilian's, with Black's second move being the variant of either Nc6, d6 or e6, in my experience."
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,Developing his other knight with pressure on e4.
9,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,"I develop my second knight, defending the pawn and keeping a grip on e4 and d5."
10,e5,e7e5,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"While this is still a Sicilian position, I'm happy to see this as it feels more like a position that I, as an 1. e4, would like to be in. I considered 5. Nf3, but it didn't appear to offer me much for the loss of time enforced on me. 5. Nb3 seemed a very solid choice, holding d4 and stopping Black's DSB from coming to c5. However, I went for the more adventurous..."
11,Ndb5,d4b5,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/1N2p3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"... 6. Ndb5. An attacking move with the purpose of questioning Black's decision not to play a6, a popular move in most Sicilian systems for it's potential. My knight pressures the weak d6 square, seeming to force 6... d6. The d-pawn becomes a target on d6. The issue with my knight move is that it's going to be forced to a3 by the inevitable a6 pawn push."
12,d6,d7d6,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2np1n2/1N2p3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,Holds the position for Black and provides support to e5.
13,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2np1n2/1N2p1B1/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 7,"Creating a pin on the knight, White is establishing a stronger grip on e4 and d5. White's immediate threat being Nd5."
14,a6,a7a6,r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1np1n2/1N2p1B1/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,"Black kicks away the dangerous knight on b5, and I think rightly so. If 7... Be7, 8. Bxf6 Bxf6 (or gxf6) 9. Nd5 O-O 10. Nbc7, in which White gets both his Knight's into enemy territory, holding quite firm and having plenty of potential."
15,Na3,b5a3,r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1np1n2/4p1B1/4P3/N1N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 8,"After Black questions 7. Bg5 with 8. h6, White takes on f6 with every intention of 10. Nd5, and kicking the queen or creating king-side weakness."
16,h6,h7h6,r1bqkb1r/1p3pp1/p1np1n1p/4p1B1/4P3/N1N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 9,"After Black questions 7. Bg5 with 8. h6, White takes on f6 with every intention of 10. Nd5, and kicking the queen or creating king-side weakness."

18,gxf6,g7f6,r1bqkb1r/1p3p2/p1np1p1p/4p3/4P3/N1N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 10,"Black makes the choice to take with his g-pawn - as White, I can't help but think that Black will be weak castling either side and try to make a conscious decision to attack the king where it sits now. After 9... Qxf6, 10. Nd5 Qd8, maybe Black would have been a little better, if still undeveloped."
19,Nd5,c3d5,r1bqkb1r/1p3p2/p1np1p1p/3Np3/4P3/N7/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 10,White quickly seeks the outpost on d5 attempting to hold many key squares on the board. It also opens up my queen side to allow a possible c3 to keep out the Black knight.
20,Be6,c8e6,r2qkb1r/1p3p2/p1npbp1p/3Np3/4P3/N7/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 11,"Black wants to dislodge the outpost made by White. I wonder if 10... f5 might have been stronger first, getting rid of the doubled pawn and pressuring e4."
21,Nc4,a3c4,r2qkb1r/1p3p2/p1npbp1p/3Np3/2N1P3/8/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 3 11,"I've made six knight moves in my first 11 moves - I'm not certain they are all necessary. However, my knight on a3 was doing very little and could do with becoming involved in the action. Nc4 pressures both b6 and e3, threatening to make the outpost on d5 a permanent fixture."
22,Bxd5,e6d5,r2qkb1r/1p3p2/p1np1p1p/3bp3/2N1P3/8/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 12,Black eliminates the problematic d5-Knight

26,Nf5,d4f5,r2qkb1r/1p3p2/p2p1p1p/3Ppn2/2N5/2P5/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 14,"Upon reflection, I'm not sure this was best. Maybe 14. Bd3 might have been a better choice but I was worried about 14... e4. After Nh4 and Ng6, Black appears to cover most of his weaknesses."
