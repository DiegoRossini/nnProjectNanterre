1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"1. e4 often leads to open games, characterized by pawn exchanges in the center and freedom of movement for the pieces.  Notice that two lines have been opened already, one for the bishop on f1 and one for the queen."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,The Sicilian defense.  Only one line is opened (for the queen) and black may fall behind in development.  The main idea is to trade a wing pawn (black's c-pawn) for a center pawn (white's d-pawn).  The reasoning is that the extra center pawn will allow black to eventually control the center.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Developing towards the center.  This move paves the way towards early castling, and increases white's chances of controlling the center."
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"The fianchetto (wing development) of the bishop caught many classic players off guard.  At first glance it doesn't seem to have any centralizing effect.  However, the bishop is going to move to g7, where it will strike at the center squares on d4 and e5.  It is fairly difficult to challenge this bishop, and the fianchetto has proven a tough nut to crack.  This variation of the Sicilian is called the Accelerated Dragon."
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"Immediately challenging the center.  The great Danish player Larsen called this a strategic mistake, but most theorists consider this the most promising way to challenge black's intentions."
6,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,Black has achieved his initial goal of captuing white's d-pawn with the c-pawn.
7,Nxd4,f3d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"At first glance White seems to have an advantage both in development and space.  Generally, such an advantage would prompt you to initiate an attack.  It is too early to do so now, and the challenge wll be to preserve this advantage while completing the rest of white's development."
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"Black challenges the control over d4 and e5.  Notice that 5. Nxc6 plays into blacks hands.  After 5. ...bxc6 black is no longer behind in development, has a sound pawn structure and better prospects for long term control over the center."
9,c4,c2c4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/8/2PNP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"Establishing the Maroczy bind, named after the great Hungarian master of old.  White is trying to prevent black from ever playing d7-d5.  White will maintain an advantage in space, but the extra pawn move allows black to start catching up in development."
10,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppp1p/2n2np1/8/2PNP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,Developing towards the center.  Note that 6. Nxc6 bxc6 7. e5 fails to 7. ...Qa5 .
11,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppp1p/2n2np1/8/2PNP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 6,"Developing towards the center and protecting the e-pawn.  Now, 7. Nxc6 and 8. e5 is threatened."
12,d6,d7d6,r1bqkb1r/pp2pp1p/2np1np1/8/2PNP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,Black spends a tempo (one unit of time) to defend against that threat.
13,Be2,f1e2,r1bqkb1r/pp2pp1p/2np1np1/8/2PNP3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,"White wants to complete his development, and 7. Be2 prepares castling."
14,Nxd4,c6d4,r1bqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p1np1/8/2PnP3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,An important refinement over 7. ...Bg7.  Black wants to force white's queen onto the d4 square where it will later be harrassed by black's bishop on g7.
15,Qxd4,d1d4,r1bqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p1np1/8/2PQP3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 0 8,Reestablishing material equilibrium.
16,Bg7,f8g7,r1bqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PQP3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 1 9,"Black intends to castle, complete his development and only then strike out at white's center."
17,Be3,c1e3,r1bqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PQP3/2N1B3/PP2BPPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 2 9,White usually plays the bishop to e3 or g5 in order to have the d2 square available for the queen.
18,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PQP3/2N1B3/PP2BPPP/R3K2R w KQ - 3 10,"Now, Black threatens 10. ...Ng4 with a double attack (on white's queen and on the bishop on e3.)  White does not want to exchange the dark square bishop for the knight.  That would leave the bishop on g7 as the best minor piece on the board."
19,Qd1,d4d1,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/2P1P3/2N1B3/PP2BPPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 4 10,"More usual is 10. Qd2, although the text is by all means playable.  White may have wanted to get out of the well known lines and go down a side path."
20,Be6,c8e6,r2q1rk1/pp2ppbp/3pbnp1/8/2P1P3/2N1B3/PP2BPPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 5 11,"Typically, black tries for counter play on the queenside.  The bishop develops towards the center and attacks white's c-pawn."
