1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"In this game, I played e4 or the King's Pawn Opening.."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,My opponent responded with c5 or the Sicilian Defense..
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,This is one of the main lines of the Sicilian defense.. The knight is in a good position as it controls the e5 square and supports the thrust of the d-pawn on d4.. Now I could have played d4 at this point but I wanted to play it safe so I opted to play Nf3 instead..
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,Black was preparing to fianchetto his bishop to g7.. Black was also intending to play the Sicilian Hungarian Variation or should I say the hyper-accelerated dragon..
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,I played d4 to open up the lines..
6,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk1nr/pp1pppbp/6p1/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,Black fianchettoed his bishop to g7 and looked to play a hypermodern style of play and control the center of the board from the flanks..
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk1nr/pp1pppbp/6p1/2p5/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,I played Nc3 to control the d5 square and at the same time protect the e4 pawn..
8,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqk1nr/pp1pppbp/6p1/8/3pP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,Getting the queen out this early in the game has some risks as it exposes the queen to enemy attacks.. Better continuation would be 5. ... Nc6..
9,Nxd4,f3d4,rnbqk1nr/pp1pppbp/6p1/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,Getting the queen out this early in the game has some risks as it exposes the queen to enemy attacks.. Better continuation would be 5. ... Nc6..
10,Qa5,d8a5,rnb1k1nr/pp1pppbp/6p1/q7/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,Getting the queen out this early in the game has some risks as it exposes the queen to enemy attacks.. Better continuation would be 5. ... Nc6..
11,Be3,c1e3,rnb1k1nr/pp1pppbp/6p1/q7/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 2 6,"My favorite attack against the Sicilian Dragon, the Yugoslav attack (although this game is not a Sicilian Dragon Variation but rather a Hungarian Variation a.k.a. hyper-accelerated dragon).. The plan is to exchange the white's dark square bishop with black's dark square bishop on g7 by playing Qd2 on the next move connecting the queen and bishop on c1-h6 diagonal, then Bh6 afterwards."
12,Nc6,b8c6,r1b1k1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/q7/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 3 7,Proceeding with my plan..
13,Qd2,d1d2,r1b1k1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/q7/3NP3/2N1B3/PPPQ1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 4 7,Proceeding with my plan..
14,d6,d7d6,r1b1k1nr/pp2ppbp/2np2p1/q7/3NP3/2N1B3/PPPQ1PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 8,"I decided to attack his queen to alleviate the pressure on c3 and to kick his queen out with a tempo.. I expected his next move would be 8. ... Qd8.. If 8. ... Bxc3 then 9. Nxa5! Bxd2 10. Bxd2 Nxa5 11. Bxa5, I would have a pair of bishops in an open position which would give me a huge advantage in the game.."
15,Nb3,d4b3,r1b1k1nr/pp2ppbp/2np2p1/q7/4P3/1NN1B3/PPPQ1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 1 8,"I decided to attack his queen to alleviate the pressure on c3 and to kick his queen out with a tempo.. I expected his next move would be 8. ... Qd8.. If 8. ... Bxc3 then 9. Nxa5! Bxd2 10. Bxd2 Nxa5 11. Bxa5, I would have a pair of bishops in an open position which would give me a huge advantage in the game.."
16,Qb4,a5b4,r1b1k1nr/pp2ppbp/2np2p1/8/1q2P3/1NN1B3/PPPQ1PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 2 9,"This was an error.. I think Qd8 was much safer.. He was then forced to exchange queens on my next move.. Not 9.a3!? Bxc3!, if 10.bxc3 Qxe4 and if 10. Qxc3 Qxc3 11.bxc3 and Black would be in a good shape because of white's doubled pawns on the c-file.. Or if 10. axb4 Bxd2 11. Bxd2 Nf6 12. Bc3 e5! and black would equalize with a strong center and good attacking chances.."
17,Nd5,c3d5,r1b1k1nr/pp2ppbp/2np2p1/3N4/1q2P3/1N2B3/PPPQ1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 3 9,Now he was forced to exchange queens..
18,Qxd2+,b4d2,r1b1k1nr/pp2ppbp/2np2p1/3N4/4P3/1N2B3/PPPq1PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 10,"Now, if 10. ... Bxb2 then 11. Rb1 and his bishop is in danger and at the same time the knight on d5 threatens Nc7+ forking the rook and the black king.."
19,Bxd2,e3d2,r1b1k1nr/pp2ppbp/2np2p1/3N4/4P3/1N6/PPPB1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 10,"Now, if 10. ... Bxb2 then 11. Rb1 and his bishop is in danger and at the same time the knight on d5 threatens Nc7+ forking the rook and the black king.."
20,Kd7,e8d7,r1b3nr/pp1kppbp/2np2p1/3N4/4P3/1N6/PPPB1PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 1 11,"I don't know if this was a good move.. Although it defends the c7 square, it exposes the king to enemy attacks.. Better was Kd8.."
21,O-O-O,e1c1,r1b3nr/pp1kppbp/2np2p1/3N4/4P3/1N6/PPPB1PPP/2KR1B1R b - - 2 11,Not only this move protects the b2 pawn but it also puts the rook in the center and controls a semi-open file.. It also places the king into safety..
22,Nf6,g8f6,r1b4r/pp1kppbp/2np1np1/3N4/4P3/1N6/PPPB1PPP/2KR1B1R w - - 3 12,I was thinking of 12. Bc3.. Then I saw this variation.. 12. Bc3 Nxe4 13. Bxg7 Rg8! 14. Bd4 Nxd4 15. Nxd4 Nxf2 forking the two white rooks.. Hmm... But what I didn't see was that even though I would be down a point in the exchange I would have 4 pieces against his three pieces and all of my pieces would be active and his king would still be stuck in the middle.. This is the possible continuation 16. Bb5+ Kd8 17. Rhf1 Nxd1 18. Rxd1.. Maybe it's worth the gamble or maybe not.. What do you think?
23,f3,f2f3,r1b4r/pp1kppbp/2np1np1/3N4/4P3/1N3P2/PPPB2PP/2KR1B1R b - - 0 12,"So I decided to play f3 instead, bolstering the e4 pawn.."
24,a6,a7a6,r1b4r/1p1kppbp/p1np1np1/3N4/4P3/1N3P2/PPPB2PP/2KR1B1R w - - 0 13,And then my opponent made a blunder.. The best continuation would be Nxd5 to eliminate white's centralized knight..
25,Nb6+,d5b6,r1b4r/1p1kppbp/pNnp1np1/8/4P3/1N3P2/PPPB2PP/2KR1B1R b - - 1 13,My opponent resigned...
