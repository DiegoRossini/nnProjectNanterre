This should be fun, hopefully I can hang with the lad!! I meant to play the Fried Liver, but that would have been Bc4 not Bc5, oh well maybe next time"

Black's main choices are; Steinitz, Cozio, Berlin, Bird, Classical, Schliemann, and let's not forget Morphy. There are of course a slew of less traveled roads. Personally, Morphy's Defense would be cool. Let's see what blacks does!"
