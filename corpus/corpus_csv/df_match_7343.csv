5,Nxe5,f3e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4Np2/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"Better than exf5, which allows White a solid centre after 3...d6"
6,Qf6,d8f6,rnb1kbnr/pppp2pp/5q2/4Np2/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,"basic chess rules state that the queen should not come out too early, but it makes sense here - both protecting the f-pawn and chasing away the knight. Besides, I was just relying on the database at this point (though I guess there must be some refutation to 3...Bd6, which does not appear on the DB)"
7,d4,d2d4,rnb1kbnr/pppp2pp/5q2/4Np2/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,solidifying the centre
8,d6,d7d6,rnb1kbnr/ppp3pp/3p1q2/4Np2/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Black really doesn't want the knight on such a powerful square, so he chases the knight away (I don't really like these moves - it makes Black look weak with the pawns all over the place)"
9,Nc4,e5c4,rnb1kbnr/ppp3pp/3p1q2/5p2/2NPP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"making my f-pawn a centre pawn, and regaining material equality - why not?"

11,Ne3,c4e3,rnb1kbnr/ppp3pp/3p1q2/8/3Pp3/4N3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"?! Preventing Black solidifying the centre with 6...d5, but White's knight has already ended up moving four times out of White's six moves (the point of the Latvian?) I would have preferred Nc3, which achieves the same objective with another piece developed"
12,Nc6,b8c6,r1b1kbnr/ppp3pp/2np1q2/8/3Pp3/4N3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 7,"?! maybe Ne7 was better, once again allowing d5? I considered it, but dismissed it due to the fact that it seemed to cramp Black's style..."
13,Bb5,f1b5,r1b1kbnr/ppp3pp/2np1q2/1B6/3Pp3/4N3/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 7,"But if Nge7 had been played, c6 would be forced here, as 7...Nc6? 8.d5! I'm not sure whether that's a good thing or a bad thing"
