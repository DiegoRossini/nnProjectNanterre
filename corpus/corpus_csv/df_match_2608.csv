1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Another game from Modern Benoni Tournament VIII.  From an even opening, White makes a slip that allows Black to win a pawn.  Shortly afterwards Black returns it to obtain a far advanced passed pawn on the Q-side.  White's defences seem to be holding until two apparently insignificant errors in a row puts the game out of White's reach."

11,g3,g2g3,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3p1n2/2pP4/8/2N3P1/PP2PP1P/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,"The Fianchetto line.  White begins solidly and in fairly non-committal fashion.  At some point she may be considering bringing the King's knight out via f3 and d2 to c4 - a thematic spot for the knight.  This would be accompanied or followed by a general expansion in the centre, intending to break through at e5.  This is just one of several plans she could have adopted.  Also playable at this juncture are 6.e4 and 6.Nf3."
12,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pp3p1p/3p1np1/2pP4/8/2N3P1/PP2PP1P/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,"Thematic.  It is possible for Black to develop the bishop at e7, or perhaps to delay its development for the moment, but in my view, the fianchetto is so called for, it might as well be carried out at once."
13,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pp3p1p/3p1np1/2pP4/8/2N2NP1/PP2PP1P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 7,White could as well have played Bg2 at once.  I do not believe though that the change in move order is independently significant.
14,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/8/2N2NP1/PP2PP1P/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 8,"In a lot of Benoni games you will find ...0-0 at this point, or ...a6, or even ...Qe7.  In this line, the knight is intended to pull back to c7, putting pressure upon d5, and also supporting the subsequent pawn expansion (...a6; ...b5) on the Q-side.  Again, one plan - or at least, one approach to a plan - among many possible."

But equally possible is 8...0-0 9.0-0 Qe7.  I have played both lines in Correspondence Chess (in the distant past), with good success."

19,h3,h2h3,r1bq1rk1/pp3pbp/n2p1np1/2pP4/8/2N2NPP/PP2PPB1/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 10,"A move associated with Viktor Korchnoi.  Its purpose is to deny Black the use of g4 (often a place where a bishop, or sometimes a knight arrives to outflank White's centre).  His right flank thus guarded, White plans in the centre may go ahead the more smoothly.  That is (or was) the idea, at any rate."

After 10...Nc7  11.e4 b5?!  12.e5! is 'very strong', according to Bill Hartston.  Meanwhile, the game Korchnoi-Tal USSR Championship, 1962 went 11...Nd7  12.Re1 Ne8, and Black's game never really did get going after that.  Although he did conjure up play on the Q-side, White always had the ascendancy in the centre and on the K-side, where they counted."

There is, however, a potential downside to that, namely 12...a6  13.a5 - a real nuisance if I want my Q-side play to counter-balance White's operations in the centre.  This way, when the time is right I can force the b-pawn forward without worrying about axb6e.p."

It serves two possible functions: to keep the White knight out of c4, but also to put pressure on the e2-square.  Black will want to advance his Q-side pawns, so the bishop will eventually have to make way for the a-pawn..."
