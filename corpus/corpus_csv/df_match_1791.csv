From about 1960 to about 1980 it wasn't played much, it being replaced by Smyslov's idea of 10....Qc7 followed by 11. Rc1 Rd8, but this was rather put out of business by 12. Bf4! so players went back to this older system.

This seems logical, hitting g4 and putting the queen on a white square - which seems logical as white squared bishops have been indirectly exchanged."
