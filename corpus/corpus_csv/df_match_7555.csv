Another game with the Master Mater and another game where Jo gets Freddied.  Henry gets the dubious honour of being ""Knighted"" at the end.  How does this happen, well, read on.  We pick up the action on move 8."

If I play Nc3 then BxN breaks up my pawns.  In hindsight though maybe it would have been better to have allowed that trade for although it may have broken up my pawns it may have opened up some lines onto the exposed black king.  I now trade my developed knight for that dsb.  Freddy said it was a mistake and so it proved.  Fou Lenoir stays at home the entire game!
