13,Qc2,d1c2,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/P4N2/1PQBPPPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 1 7,This seems like a nice outpost for blacks knight.

Perhaps I should have let it be then if black was to capture with dxc then I would have a nice pin on his king and only one pawn would be supporting the knight on e4.
20,exd5,e6d5,r1bq1rk1/ppp3pp/2n5/3p1p2/3Pn3/P2BPN2/1PQB1PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 11,Yes a bishop pair is a good thing however in this case to save the bishop I need to move it to the awkward c1. Besides this bishop isn't doing much at the moment yet blacks knight is doing more. Should I entice black to take with Nxc3 then Get a nice solid pawn structure and a shiny new open file to play with.

22,f4,f5f4,r1bq1rk1/ppp3pp/2n5/3p4/3Pnp2/P1BBPN2/1PQ2PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 12,Bu black doesn't take my bishop and instead gives away a free pawn?
23,Bxe4,d3e4,r1bq1rk1/ppp3pp/2n5/3p4/3PBp2/P1B1PN2/1PQ2PPP/R3K2R b KQ - 0 12,This move is a mistake. It just gives away yet another pawn. Better was simply fxe.

30,Bg4,f5g4,r4rk1/ppQ3pp/2n5/3q4/3P2b1/P1B1PN2/1P3PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 1 16,finally a decent move.
31,Qxb7,c7b7,r4rk1/pQ4pp/2n5/3q4/3P2b1/P1B1PN2/1P3PPP/R3K2R b KQ - 0 16,!? I wasn't sure about this move I felt it was just pawn grabbing as it was. I realised black had the option of Bxf3 gxf3Qxf3 winning back the pawn. After a while looking at the position I thought I could get away with this further consolidating my advantage with Rg1?? and a checkmate threat. It's not till I made the move that I realised this wouldn't work since after Bxf3 gxf3 Rg1?? fails since Blacks queen would have the rook protecting it allowing for Qxf2+!.
32,Bxf3,g4f3,r4rk1/pQ4pp/2n5/3q4/3P4/P1B1Pb2/1P3PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 17,This is the only move really. As I outlined earlier I can't make the move Rg1 like I would have liked to.

36,Rab8,a8b8,1r3rk1/pQ4pp/2n5/8/3P4/P1B1Pq2/1P3P1P/R3KR2 w Q - 2 19,"Computer lists this move as an innacuracy coming up with the continuation  Qc7 Rbe8 20. Kd2 Qe4 21. Rae1 Rf7 22. f3 Qd5 23. Qg3 Nxd4 24. exd4 Rxe1 25. Rxe1 Rxf3 Which atually is very good for white because of the bank rank weaknesses. I admit though I didn't look into it that depeely, I just made this move because I saw no better square for my queen."

39,d5,d4d5,4rrk1/p1Q3pp/2n5/3P4/8/P1B1Pq2/1P3P1P/R3KR2 b Q - 0 20,?? I'm glad both me and my opponent missed the mate here. Can you see it?
40,Ne7,c6e7,4rrk1/p1Q1n1pp/8/3P4/8/P1B1Pq2/1P3P1P/R3KR2 w Q - 1 21,"The correct moves were  d5 Rxe3+ 21. Kd2 Qe2+ 22. Kc1 Qxf1+ 23. Kd2 Rxf2+ 24. Kxe3 Qe2#
Instead this move bodes badly for black."
41,d6,d5d6,4rrk1/p1Q1n1pp/3P4/8/8/P1B1Pq2/1P3P1P/R3KR2 b Q - 0 21,This pawn is making some nice headway and chasing the knight away at the same time.
