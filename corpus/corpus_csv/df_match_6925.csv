1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I have never had very good results against the sicillian when 2..e6 has been played so decided to learn some book against it which i employed with good effect here. I am sure there is room for improvement with the black handling of this line as what was played allowed me a pretty finish.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Standard Start
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Natural and considering is played by most of the worlds top GM's has to be right
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,Against me this has always been a good move as i am never comfortable with the bishop coming to b4.
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,Again if it is good enough for the worlds best i should play it.
6,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,Natural
7,Nxd4,f3d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,Unlike if black plays d6 i do not have the choice of Qxd4 as Nc6 is just good for black.
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,Challenging the centre got to be right for Black
9,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,Instead of the text c4 is a choice but i feel strongly that black gets too much time to counter attack if played so i feel this is best.
10,Qc7,d8c7,r1b1kbnr/ppqp1ppp/2n1p3/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 3 6,This move i feel is not quite as good as Nf6 further challenging the centre but Qc7 does prevent e5 at some point so has merit.
11,Be2,f1e2,r1b1kbnr/ppqp1ppp/2n1p3/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 4 6,Be2 time to get castled.
12,Nf6,g8f6,r1b1kb1r/ppqp1ppp/2n1pn2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 5 7,Got to be best though i feel the move before is better because then can be combined with Bb4 before i castle.
13,O-O,e1g1,r1b1kb1r/ppqp1ppp/2n1pn2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 6 7,Now Bb4 does not have as much bite.
14,Nxd4,c6d4,r1b1kb1r/ppqp1ppp/4pn2/8/3nP3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,I understand this move but also question it. White is castled and ready to start attacking. Black has three pieces out but is not ready to castle so the exchange to me is wrong. Bc5 or Bb4 seems more natural.
15,Qxd4,d1d4,r1b1kb1r/ppqp1ppp/4pn2/8/3QP3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 0 8,Obviously the only move
16,Bc5,f8c5,r1b1k2r/ppqp1ppp/4pn2/2b5/3QP3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 1 9,The point of the previous move so he can castle with tempo.
17,Qd3,d4d3,r1b1k2r/ppqp1ppp/4pn2/2b5/4P3/2NQ4/PPP1BPPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 2 9,Not a happy move for the queen but from here she has a lot of options and i am ready to connect my rooks
18,O-O,e8g8,r1b2rk1/ppqp1ppp/4pn2/2b5/4P3/2NQ4/PPP1BPPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 3 10,Natural and best
19,Bg5,c1g5,r1b2rk1/ppqp1ppp/4pn2/2b3B1/4P3/2NQ4/PPP1BPPP/R4RK1 b - - 4 10,I was not sure what was best here. I considered the move Be3 and if taken would take with my f pawn to free up my rook and was not convinced i could make it pay.
20,Qe5,c7e5,r1b2rk1/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2b1q1B1/4P3/2NQ4/PPP1BPPP/R4RK1 w - - 5 11,Good move making my last look silly. Qg3 was a plan but i do not want the queens off the board.
