It is passive, weakens White's king-side, and gives Black the lead in development, something important in a symmetric structure. However, it does prevent a pin on White's knight, but ...Bg4 presents no immediate threat, since the knight is protected by the queen. Better would have been 5. Nc3, keeping the lead in development."

Firstly, since the game is currently closed in the middle, a knight is slightly more valuable than a bishop. Trading a bishop for a knight in a closed game is a good trade. However, White is trading an active bishop for a passive knight: Black's knight had no central squares to move to. Secondly (and much more importantly), White is trading his good bishop for Black's knight. Since White's pawn structure is locked down on the light squares, White's dark-colored bishop is much more valuable than his light-colored bishop since it isn't blocked by his pawns. The game will soon open up, leaving White with one weak bishop and Black with a powerful bishop pair. Better would have been more development, such as 7. Nc3 or 7. Be2."

Black's pawns on b4 and a5 have shut in White's queen, bishop, and rook on the queen-side. Black's f-file rook is important to the protection of the king-side, where White still has good attacking chances. Naturally, the a-file rook is the correct rook to move. Black is slightly ahead, heading into the middlegame."
