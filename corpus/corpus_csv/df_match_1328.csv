1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"1.e4 one of the strongest moves in the opening,opens lines for the bishop and Queen,the pawn keeps a check on d5 and f5.if d4 where allowed to be played at a later date then a strong center control would be achieved."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"1...c5 the Sicilian response to 1.e4 this means black intends to make a fight of it,there is a huge amount of theory behind this move and can take a life time to learn the many variations and themes."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"2.Nf3 develops a piece the old rule Knight's before Bishops here,the knight has a good post here looks to the d4 square e5 and g5 just to name a few good spots.the knight can support an eventual d4 pawn advance spring into action at a moments notice to g5 hitting the black kings f7."
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"2..d6 opens up a flight for the white squared bishop on c8 to possibly spring to a pin on g4 if the white knight were to remain on f3,the move played supports the c5 pawn but does expose the black king a little
not that this is to much of a problem for black as the knight on b8 can be played to a favorable square such as Nc6,or the bishop could be played to Bd7 if a check is delivered by white via Bb5+."
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"3.d4 now states whites intention to try and make a claim to the center,this is a good move it is well supported by the Queen on d1 the Knight on f3.
the move played by white also has the added bonus of opening a line for the black squared bishop on c1 this now to the trained eye shows a control of the g5 square on the white king side which is now monitored by the bishop on c1 and the knight on f3.
look a little deeper and one can see that the white Queen has the possibility of been placed on d3 or c2 when the c2 pawn moves afforded as such by the pawn cover given by the pawns on d4 and e4.
Look even deeper and you will see the Knight on b1 can be played to d2 giving further support to the e4 square and the f3 knight if the present f3 knight were to be captured it could be quickly replaced by the d2 knight."
6,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"3..cxd4 standard move in this opening black wants to break up that center grip by white, and by doing so creates a semi half open C file from where black can at some point if white does not keep him in check can launch an offensive."
7,Nxd4,f3d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"4.Nxd4 best response here for white as the pawn has to be retaken, if the Queen was to have taken the pawn then this would only facilitate blacks development as he may respond with 4...Nc6 chasing the queen away and resulting in white loosing a tempo."
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"4..Nf6 this move at first states the obvious attack on the e4 pawn,but more of importance is it's ability to keep a watchful eye on the g4 square along with it's comrade the bishop on c8.
Further to this it looks to the cover of the d5 square for a possible future push of the d6 pawn or even just keeping an eye on the d5 square to prevent white gaining an outpost there in the future.
Further to this by playing 4..Nf6 it develops a minor piece which in chess you need to develop as many men as quickly as possible,the more pieces developed in the arena the better.
Hence the saying one man does not make an army."
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,"5.Nc3 this keeps in with the developing of ones pieces rapidly in the opening,the knight now on c3 provides well needed protection of the e4 pawn.We now have the knight on c3 and the pawn on e4 keeping guard on the d5 square,both of White's knights now keep a watch on the b5 square and lastly the knight now been on c3 covers the a4 square in White's camp in case of a later possible incursion by blacks bishop or queen."
10,a6,a7a6,rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"5..a6 Solid move by black the 2 white knights are looking a little menacing along with the bishop on f1, 3 pieces of white raining down on the b5 square into blacks camp and the exposed black king on the a4-e8 diagonal.
let's take stock here WHITE has open lines for it's 2 bishops, both knights are developed, and a half open D file.
BLACK has the half open C file a knight developed and open lines for it's bishop on c8 and queen on d8.

If black had not played 5...a6 then white had the possibility of a check on b5 developing a piece with attack gaining a tempo resulting in forcing black to respond to the check! by white achieving that goal 
it would of left the opportunity for white to castle later due to the absence of the bishop in it's present position on f1."
11,f3,f2f3,rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N2P2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"6.f3 i do not like this move it creates a draught around the white king by breaking his pawn cover,
6.Be2 would of been better here freeing space so white can castle and keeping a watchful eye on d1 to g4 diagonal."
12,e5,e7e5,rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2p1n2/4p3/3NP3/2N2P2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"6...e5 this move stakes a claim in the center attacks the knight and keeps a hold on the c5 outpost.
the pawn on d6 is still protected by the Bishop on f8 and Queen on d8"
13,Nb3,d4b3,rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2p1n2/4p3/4P3/1NN2P2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 7,7.Nb3 the only real good square to retreat to! if the knight was played to 7.Nf5 and if black played 7.. Bxf5 then we would have doubled pawns after 8.exf5
14,Be6,c8e6,rn1qkb1r/1p3ppp/p2pbn2/4p3/4P3/1NN2P2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 8,"I like this move 7..Be6 gives support to the d5 square if black wanted at a later stage to push the pawn to d5,frees the c8 square up for the Queen to shuffle across to if so required.Keeps a hold on the g8 to a2 diagonal,and defends the f7 square.and still looks to the c8 to h3 diagonal."
15,Be3,c1e3,rn1qkb1r/1p3ppp/p2pbn2/4p3/4P3/1NN1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 3 8,"8.Be3 good move develops another piece, one should develop as quickly as possible.
this move now allows the Bishop to cover the g1 to a7 diagonal,the Knight on b3 and the newly developed Bishop keeps an eye on the c5 square.the Bishop now on e3 and Queen on d1 also the Knight on b3 hold the d4 square.The bishop on e3 now can drop back to f2 or g1 if needed,the bishop still controls the c1 to h6 diagonal."
16,Be7,f8e7,rn1qk2r/1p2bppp/p2pbn2/4p3/4P3/1NN1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 4 9,"8..Be7 clears the way for black to castle,increase of power on the d8 to h4 diagonal and if the knight moves from Nf6 the bishop could land there to attack on the h8 to a1 diagonal if white ever castles Queen side."
17,Qd2,d1d2,rn1qk2r/1p2bppp/p2pbn2/4p3/4P3/1NN1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 5 9,"9.Qd2 clears the way for white to castle Queen side,increases power on the c1 to h6 diagonal in case of black castling king side.After white castles Queen side the rook will land on d1 behind the Queen giving support on the d1 to d8 file.The Queen on d2 also keeps an eye on the g2 square,the queen could move to f2 then g3 or h4 to prepare for action on the king side."
18,O-O,e8g8,rn1q1rk1/1p2bppp/p2pbn2/4p3/4P3/1NN1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3KB1R w KQ - 6 10,9.0-0 good standard developing move here the rook is well placed if the pawn on f7 ever needed advancing.
19,O-O-O,e1c1,rn1q1rk1/1p2bppp/p2pbn2/4p3/4P3/1NN1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR1B1R b - - 7 10,10.0-0-0 as stated in notes on 9.
20,Nbd7,b8d7,r2q1rk1/1p1nbppp/p2pbn2/4p3/4P3/1NN1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR1B1R w - - 8 11,"10...Nbd7 Excellent move the knight comes into action defends the Knight on f6 eyes the square c5and b6.
If the white Bishop on e3 was ever thinking of landing on b6 then it will think twice now the knight keeps a hold on the e5 pawn as well."
