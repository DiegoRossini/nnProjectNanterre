12,Kf8,e8f8,r1bq1knr/pppp1Bp1/2n4p/2b5/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 1 7,!? This move completely shocked me. This is probably a much better move over 6...Kxf7
13,Nxc6,d4c6,r1bq1knr/pppp1Bp1/2N4p/2b5/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQ - 0 7,Fearing 8...Bxf2+ 9 Kxf2 Qf6+ 10 Qf3 Qxf7 making things fairly equal. It forces Black to develop though. Perhaps 8 Bxg8 would have been better. It would be trading a very useful bishop away but it would prevent the future pains to come.

I seriously considered 12 Nd1! which would have given Black no targets, and White time to repel Black's knight with 13 h3. I dismissed it though, because it was such an odd move and I considered it risky (because it was odd), silly thinking on my part, but that was my logic at the time."
