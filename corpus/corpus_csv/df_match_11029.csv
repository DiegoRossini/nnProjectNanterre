1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The theme here is development.  So far we have played 6 games and 50% of them have been decided by developmental problems.  This game is no exception.  I manage to get some very active piece play and once White steps out of theory, I am able to simplify the position to one in which Black has a winning engame."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,My friend chooses this move order to avoid my well studied Bogo-Catalan lines with an early ...Bb4 .

7,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3P4/5NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,Sharper lines see White delay castling.
8,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/3P4/5NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,Sharper lines see White delay castling.
9,O-O,e1g1,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/3P4/5NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 3 5,Sharper lines see White delay castling.
10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/3P4/5NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 4 6,Heading for the lines of the open Catalan.  White does not have the option of Qa4 .  This is the main difference in the Geller system.
11,c4,c2c4,rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 0 6,Heading for the lines of the open Catalan.  White does not have the option of Qa4 .  This is the main difference in the Geller system.
12,dxc4,d5c4,rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/8/2pP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 0 7,Heading for the lines of the open Catalan.  White does not have the option of Qa4 .  This is the main difference in the Geller system.
13,Qc2,d1c2,rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/8/2pP4/5NP1/PPQ1PPBP/RNB2RK1 b - - 1 7,"Ne5, Na3, and Nc3 are all possible."
14,a6,a7a6,rnbq1rk1/1pp1bppp/p3pn2/8/2pP4/5NP1/PPQ1PPBP/RNB2RK1 w - - 0 8,"Now the main line runs Qxc4, b5; Qc2, Bb7."
15,a4,a2a4,rnbq1rk1/1pp1bppp/p3pn2/8/P1pP4/5NP1/1PQ1PPBP/RNB2RK1 b - - 0 8,"This is by far the most interesting move, as White wants to interfere with Black's plan of queenside expansion, and with it, his queenside development.  White does have to be careful, as it is a weakening move and he hopes that his center control will offset the weakenss of b4 and b3.  As often is the theme in the Catalan, Black's chances will most likely be tied to the activation of his queen's bishop."
16,Bd7,c8d7,rn1q1rk1/1ppbbppp/p3pn2/8/P1pP4/5NP1/1PQ1PPBP/RNB2RK1 w - - 1 9,The best method of developing the light-squared bishop to oppose its opposite number.
17,Ne5,f3e5,rn1q1rk1/1ppbbppp/p3pn2/4N3/P1pP4/6P1/1PQ1PPBP/RNB2RK1 b - - 2 9,A very natural move which unleashes the power of the fianchetto bishop and prepares to recapture the c4-pawn with the knight.
18,Nc6,b8c6,r2q1rk1/1ppbbppp/p1n1pn2/4N3/P1pP4/6P1/1PQ1PPBP/RNB2RK1 w - - 3 10,Other lines are drawish and this move offers Black the best practical chances to play for the full point.
19,Qxc4,c2c4,r2q1rk1/1ppbbppp/p1n1pn2/4N3/P1QP4/6P1/1P2PPBP/RNB2RK1 b - - 0 10,This keeps the position as complicated as possible without any spatial or positional concessions.
20,Nd5,f6d5,r2q1rk1/1ppbbppp/p1n1p3/3nN3/P1QP4/6P1/1P2PPBP/RNB2RK1 w - - 1 11,This keeps the position as complicated as possible without any spatial or positional concessions.
21,a5,a4a5,r2q1rk1/1ppbbppp/p1n1p3/P2nN3/2QP4/6P1/1P2PPBP/RNB2RK1 b - - 0 11,"An interesting move which proves to be a little to slow.  11. Nxd7 Na5; 12. Qc2 Nb4; 13. Qc3 Qxd7 gives Black an excellent position, due to the weakness of the b4 and b3-squares."
22,Nxe5,c6e5,r2q1rk1/1ppbbppp/p3p3/P2nn3/2QP4/6P1/1P2PPBP/RNB2RK1 w - - 0 12,Here I opt to exchange the centralized knight and effectively nullify White's pawn advantage in the center.  Now simplification would yield a won endgame for Black due to the queenside majority.
23,dxe5,d4e5,r2q1rk1/1ppbbppp/p3p3/P2nP3/2Q5/6P1/1P2PPBP/RNB2RK1 b - - 0 12,Completing development and preparing to play ...Nb4 and exchanging the light-squared bishops.
24,Bc6,d7c6,r2q1rk1/1pp1bppp/p1b1p3/P2nP3/2Q5/6P1/1P2PPBP/RNB2RK1 w - - 1 13,Completing development and preparing to play ...Nb4 and exchanging the light-squared bishops.
25,Bf3,g2f3,r2q1rk1/1pp1bppp/p1b1p3/P2nP3/2Q5/5BP1/1P2PP1P/RNB2RK1 b - - 2 13,Protecting the e-pawn against a nonexistant threat. better is Nc3 or Be3.  Basically any move that attempts to get the queenside pieces active.
26,Rc8,a8c8,2rq1rk1/1pp1bppp/p1b1p3/P2nP3/2Q5/5BP1/1P2PP1P/RNB2RK1 w - - 3 14,"Fritz likes ...Nb4, which does make Bf3 look a bit silly, however, ...Rc8 will fit in naturally with my plan, while keeping a trap set for my opponent, which he falls into on the next move."
27,Rd1,f1d1,2rq1rk1/1pp1bppp/p1b1p3/P2nP3/2Q5/5BP1/1P2PP1P/RNBR2K1 b - - 4 14,"This allows a simplifying combination which gives Black the winning endgame, due to the weakness of e5, b2 and the nonexistant queenside development."
28,Ne3,d5e3,2rq1rk1/1pp1bppp/p1b1p3/P3P3/2Q5/4nBP1/1P2PP1P/RNBR2K1 w - - 5 15,Its also Fritz approved!
