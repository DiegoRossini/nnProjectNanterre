This marks the first moment in the match when I could not restrain my aggressive impulses.  Although this move is not necessarily bad, it demands very accurate play from White. A simpler way to play was 7 e5 which gives White an advantage in space without any tactical headaches."

Of course I had reckoned on this possibility when playing my 7th move, but I had misjudged my chances. I should pull in my horns now and play 8 Nc3! Nxc3 9 bxc3 Nb8 10 Ne5 and white has good play in return for his pawn investment."

A critical moment in the game. White has some very tempting continuations here. Originally I had planned 11 Bb5 b6 12 c7  Bd7 13 Ba6 e6 14 Bb7 Rc8 15 Bxc8 Bxc8 15 Kf1. The end result will be that Black will lose his knight on h1 but will have three healthy pawns and a solid position to offset his piece deficit. 

Also worth considering were 12 g3 or 12 g4 to play for Bg2 and the quick capture of Black’s cornered knight. But in that case, Black would boast of 3 pawn and a rook vs two pieces - a very favorable material count for the second player. 

Instead of playing either of these sensible continuations, I went in for a long-winded tactical line that results in a pawn plus ending for CM9k."

  Black has an extra pawn and very well placed pieces and king. His only problem is the fractured pawn structure. 9K plays to steadily improve the position of his king and rook while keeping an eye on stopping White's counter-play.
