57,Kf2,g1f2,4b3/1pk5/p2p3p/8/8/3B3P/PP3KP1/8 b - - 1 29,Kf2. The point of this move is to centralize the king. In the opening and middle game you want your king to be as protected as possible but in the end game the king is an important active attacker. The best thing to do with the king in the end game is to centralize it I.E. putting it as close to the center as possible. Having a centralized king can be the difference between a winning game and a loosing game. From the center the king can go fastest to any side of the board where action is taken and having the center makes it more difficult for black.
58,d5,d6d5,4b3/1pk5/p6p/3p4/8/3B3P/PP3KP1/8 w - - 0 30,a wrong move. I would suggest for black to compete in the centralization competition with Kc6. Now he basically gives up the center for my king.
59,Ke3,f2e3,4b3/1pk5/p6p/3p4/8/3BK2P/PP4P1/8 b - - 1 30,Moving further to the center
60,Kd6,c7d6,4b3/1p6/p2k3p/3p4/8/3BK2P/PP4P1/8 w - - 2 31,"Well this looks good for white. his king is more centralized than black's king and it is a strong blockader of the passed pawn on d5. Yes,blockading a passed pawn could be considered passive but black will need to defend the passed pawn somehow and since it's isolated,his king will also be passive."

62,a5,a6a5,4b3/1p6/3k3p/p2p4/3K4/3B3P/PP4P1/8 w - - 0 32,"well the point of that move is just to move a piece away from the light squares, you see, now that i have a light squared bishop moving away everything from the light squares is good because now my bishop can't attack the piece, that's why the passed pawn on d5 would be better of on d6 or d4."
63,g4,g2g4,4b3/1p6/3k3p/p2p4/3K2P1/3B3P/PP6/8 b - - 0 32,"g4. In the end game you'd want to get a passed pawn. Passed pawns are extremely dangerous in the end game and this is how white creates a passed pawn. after g4,h4,g5 black can choose to exchange the pawn or just play it to h4, but white will have a passed pawn after that. you see when you create a passed pawn you look on where you have more pawns then black,then exchange and in the end you will have 1 passed pawn."
64,b5,b7b5,4b3/8/3k3p/pp1p4/3K2P1/3B3P/PP6/8 w - - 0 33,well this is a wrong move now he focuses on just exchanging since he dont know that much theories but he is actually putting the pawn closer to my king which just makes it an easy taget
65,a3,a2a3,4b3/8/3k3p/pp1p4/3K2P1/P2B3P/1P6/8 b - - 0 33,not just for getting the pawn out of light squares but also when he plays b4 then 34. ab ab and the pawn will be closer to my king.
66,b4,b5b4,4b3/8/3k3p/p2p4/1p1K2P1/P2B3P/1P6/8 w - - 0 34,now no one will advance their pawn to keep them in dark squares. especially black because b3 gives up the square c3.

70,Bd7,e8d7,8/3b4/3k3p/3p4/1p1K2PP/3B4/1P6/8 w - - 1 36,My opponent isn't that experienced in end game theories so he decides to just attack the pawn but that isn't a good move white will just play g5 and the bishop will have to move back. so what should black instead play? well this game looks kinda lost for black now. white has the center and is about to get a passed pawn so maybe Bf7 would be a little better.

74,Be6,d7e6,8/8/3kb3/3p2P1/1p1K4/3B4/1P6/8 w - - 1 38,the point of this move is to be a strong blockader on g8

White's advantage in this position is that he has the center and black's pieces are very passive,king protects pawn on d5,so does the bishop while blockading the passed pawn on g6. How ever the tricky part is how white should proceed. Well in this bishop ending game white should focus on taking advantage that he has a passed pawn and so..."

77,Bb5,d3b5,6b1/8/3k2P1/1B1p4/1p1K4/8/1P6/8 b - - 2 39,"Bb5!! Now white actually has a winning game and there's nothing black can do to stop it. The point of it is to move the bishop to f7  forcing black to take white's bishop and afterwards,when white takes back with pawn the black king will have to rush down to stop the passed pawn and when he does that white can simply take blacks pawns and push his own pawn to b8 which is unstoppable. How ever you shouldn't play g7,getting the pawn out of a light square in this position because then white wouldn't have any more attacking tactics and it would be a draw."
78,Ke7,d6e7,6b1/4k3/6P1/1B1p4/1p1K4/8/1P6/8 w - - 3 40,Ke7! in order to stop white from moving his bishop to e8 and f7.
79,Kc5,d4c5,6b1/4k3/6P1/1BKp4/1p6/8/1P6/8 b - - 4 40,"How ever now he gave up the c5 square. now white can just take the b4 pawn,d5 pawn and push his b pawn."
80,Kf6,e7f6,6b1/8/5kP1/1BKp4/1p6/8/1P6/8 w - - 5 41,quickest way to get rid of that passed pawn on g6 how ever now white can proceed with this move...
81,Be8,b5e8,4B1b1/8/5kP1/2Kp4/1p6/8/1P6/8 b - - 6 41,and now even someone who wouldn't know any end game theories could win in this position as white.
