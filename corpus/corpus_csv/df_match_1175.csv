1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"Oh joy an opening I wasn't familiar with. I kept calm and thought it trough. Either he's gonna play d4 or fianchetto. In both cases I want to play d5. Either to go into some strange queen pawn opening, the opening I'm most familiar with ( d4 d5 is my openingrepertoire as white ), or I make his white Bishop a tiny bit less powerful, by blocking that diagonal."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,Please for the love of .... just play d4 so I can actually go into theory lines I'm familiar with.
3,g3,g2g3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5NP1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,"Guess we're leaping in the unknown, oh joy. Well Bishop g2 will follow, that much I'm sure of."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/8/5NP1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 3,"Perhaps I should have waited with bringing my knight out. Maybe Bishop f5 and then Knight from b8 to d7 would have been better. No point in thinking about it now, my opponent is  over 1750 elo, it'd surprise me if he didn't know the theory behind both knight moves."
5,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/8/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 3,"Perhaps I should have waited with bringing my knight out.

7,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3p4/8/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 4 4,Preparing to bring his bishop out and planning e4.
8,Bf5,c8f5,r2qkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3p1b2/8/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 5 5,Preparing to bring his bishop out and planning e4.
9,d3,d2d3,r2qkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3p1b2/8/3P1NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 5,Preparing to bring his bishop out and planning e4.
10,e6,e7e6,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/3p1b2/8/3P1NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 6,"I was told afterwards by my opponent that this move might already be a tiny error. e5 is more aggressive and takes more central control, I'll soon notice why e5 was better."
11,Nbd2,b1d2,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/3p1b2/8/3P1NP1/PPPNPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 6,"His position is something I'd expect to see from black, not something from white. The e4 square is being targeted once again and he's preparing to eventually bring his knight to b3 I suppose."
12,Bc5,f8c5,r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/2bp1b2/8/3P1NP1/PPPNPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 7,"If I had played e5 then theory suggests d6 would have been a better square. Well I'm not following the main lines anyway. I figured I'd prevent a shove of the f2 pawn in the future. This might be a mistake since Knight b3 might follow, costing me a tempo, but I figured he'd lost the tempo when playing knight d2 anyway."
13,c3,c2c3,r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/2bp1b2/8/2PP1NP1/PP1NPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,"And here the fun starts, oh jeebus christ. d4 is obvious, but it'd make my bishop a rather funny looking piece. I didn't feel like my bishop would do well on d6 so I decide to play it differently."
14,e5,e6e5,r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/2bppb2/8/2PP1NP1/PP1NPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,And for this reason I should have played e5 immediately. So this kind of BS isn't in his plans to begin with.
15,Nxe5,f3e5,r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/2bpNb2/8/2PP2P1/PP1NPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,"I'll be painfully honest here, I didn't see this combination when I played e5. What looks like losing a knight, is actually opening the centre."
16,Nxe5,c6e5,r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/2bpnb2/8/2PP2P1/PP1NPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 9,"Now there're 3 options. Option A, take the pawn with my bishop and win back the material, option B, move my knight to d7 or option C: move my bishop to d6, he takes, i take back. I didn't really consider option B and option C didn't feel right. I can't really tell you why, it just felt wrong. Perhaps because I valued my Knight so much. I know bishops are usually better in an endgame, but I felt like I needed the knight to prevent losing the centre."

22,O-O,e8g8,r2q1rk1/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3p1b2/3P4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 3 12,"??? I didn't understand this move. I guess he wants to do a minority attack on the queen side, but with 2 pawns and no minor pieces? Maybe he wanted to prevent Knight b4 followed by Knight c2, I guess that must be it. Since then I'd get a nasty attack going after he moves his Rook. I wonder if he could have prevented that combination if he didn't immediately play a3."
