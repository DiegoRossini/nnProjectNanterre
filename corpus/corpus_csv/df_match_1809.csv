Obviously offering up a trade for black's weak knight on d7 and eventually leading to the queen exchange and busted pawn structure that you will see for white in the next few moves.

If you want to analyze it further you could go back to when the pawn structure was weakened and the c pawn and a pawn were left hanging causing the need for white to play defensively in this situation. If the structure was solid there would be more opportunity to play for open files and such.

The king will eventually capture the h5 pawn without resistance. I spent a lot of time studying this position and found this little move 33. Bf8. It indirectly protects the h5 pawn for the moment due to the fact that if Kxh5 is ever played then Bxg7 will follow. Also note that the g7 pawn cannot be pushed because of the h5 pawn and in this position the white king is dominating the black bishop not allowing it to protect.
