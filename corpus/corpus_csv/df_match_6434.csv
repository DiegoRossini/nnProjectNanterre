1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This is a strong move. This controls the center and gives room for development.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,This does the same but also resists my control of the center.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,This attacks the pawn and develops a piece.
4,f6,f7f6,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,This is the Damianov's Defense. This is not a good opening for black because this weakens the king-side.
5,Nxe5,f3e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,Another option is d4. I choose this because this leads to more unpredictable games and has a trap to it.
6,fxe5,f6e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,Not a good move. Qe7 would be better rather than falling into a trap.
7,Qh5+,d1h5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4p2Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 1 4,This attacks the e-pawn.
8,Ke7,e8e7,rnbq1bnr/ppppk1pp/8/4p2Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQ - 2 5,"If g6, Qxe5+ will win the rook. This is worse than losing the rook."
9,Qxe5+,h5e5,rnbq1bnr/ppppk1pp/8/4Q3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQ - 0 5,I win the pawn and move his king again.
10,Kf7,e7f7,rnbq1bnr/pppp1kpp/8/4Q3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQ - 1 6,"The only move, moving towards the corner."
11,Bc4+,f1c4,rnbq1bnr/pppp1kpp/8/4Q3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 2 6,This forces the king to move farther.
12,Kg6,f7g6,rnbq1bnr/pppp2pp/6k1/4Q3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 3 7,"An OK move, either way black should lose fast."
13,Qf5+,e5f5,rnbq1bnr/pppp2pp/6k1/5Q2/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 4 7,I move the king farther.
14,Kh6,g6h6,rnbq1bnr/pppp2pp/7k/5Q2/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 5 8,The king is trapped.
15,d4+,d2d4,rnbq1bnr/pppp2pp/7k/5Q2/2BPP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 0 8,I take control of the center with a check.
16,g5,g7g5,rnbq1bnr/pppp3p/7k/5Qp1/2BPP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 0 9,Now g7 is playable.
17,h4,h2h4,rnbq1bnr/pppp3p/7k/5Qp1/2BPP2P/8/PPP2PP1/RNB1K2R b KQ - 0 9,"I do not remember what to do here, but I think this is right. I make a discovered check and pressure a pin."
18,d6,d7d6,rnbq1bnr/ppp4p/3p3k/5Qp1/2BPP2P/8/PPP2PP1/RNB1K2R w KQ - 0 10,I was thinking d5 or Kg7. This loses faster.
19,Bxg5+,c1g5,rnbq1bnr/ppp4p/3p3k/5QB1/2BPP2P/8/PPP2PP1/RN2K2R b KQ - 0 10,I capture and I win fast.
20,Qxg5,d8g5,rnb2bnr/ppp4p/3p3k/5Qq1/2BPP2P/8/PPP2PP1/RN2K2R w KQ - 0 11,"If Kg7, Qf7#. If Kh5, g4#."
