1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is an English Opening by my opponent. It is also known as the ""Bird's Eye"" or ""Reverse Sicilian"" in the archives. 
The Sicilian is a good defense against e4 and actually it can even work as an offense--it is that good."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,When I get a reverse Sicilian open against me I find it is fine to mirror the open for awhile.  So I did.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"This move is a bit different for me and mirroring may not be the best way to go; but I am not convinced, yet, that mirroring is a problem."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"The fianchetto from White is a sort of Sicilian (reverse) Dragon.  I am familiar with the Dragon as Black against e4.  I am also a bit wary of using a fianchetto because this opens up the King's ""box"" in the event the King should be behind the fianchetto. 
Fianchettos are always risky business."
5,g3,g2g3,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/2P5/5NP1/PP1PPP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"The fianchetto from White is a sort of Sicilian (reverse) Dragon.  I am familiar with the Dragon as Black against e4.  I am also a bit wary of using a fianchetto because this opens up the King's ""box"" in the event the King should be behind the fianchetto.

6,d6,d7d6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/2p5/2P5/5NP1/PP1PPP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,Now I am reverting to a Sicilian and should be thinking hard about the Queen's Knight for development.
7,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/2p5/2P5/5NP1/PP1PPPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,White is completing the fianchetto.
8,Bd7,c8d7,rn1qkb1r/pp1bpppp/3p1n2/2p5/2P5/5NP1/PP1PPPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,I thought getting the Queen's Bishop ready was better than dealing with her knight.
9,O-O,e1g1,rn1qkb1r/pp1bpppp/3p1n2/2p5/2P5/5NP1/PP1PPPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 3 5,"Now White has committed to residing the King under a ""broken box (fianchetto)"" and that (to me) is a weakness.  In most, if not all of my Sicilian Defense records I rather try to avoid the Dragon.  The Dragon with the fianchetto is classical (so I like it) but many times I find when using it (in the Sicilian Defense) I slowly lose or extend a game beyond reasonable time.  I do not know all the proper moves by heart for the Dragon.  I rarely see it today by any opponent.  There must be a reason!"

11,Nc3,b1c3,r2qkb1r/pp1bpppp/2np1n2/2p5/2P5/2N2NP1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 5 6,"Well, now! It looks like I am reverting to a Dragon Sicilian! The board can be split in half (I.e. a-d; e-h) and the MIRROR comes back! 

Remember, I am defending here!"

The mistake from White comes at move Number 24 when White allows me to take advantage....."
