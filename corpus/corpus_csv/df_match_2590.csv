1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Queens pawn opening
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I play e5 hoping to develop my pieces faster than my opponent and put pressure on him from the start.
3,dxe5,d4e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/8/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,This is pretty standard and most people should and do take the e5 pawn with dxe5
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4P3/8/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"If white opts to take then I develop my black bishop and i am able to develop all my other pieces (except rooks) in 1 move. White's options when I play d6 include Nf3, Nc3 and sometimes exd5."
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4P3/8/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,The reason behind Nf3 is because white doesn't want black to develop his pieces so quickly and make an attack.
6,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4Pb2/8/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,Bc5 is because if I decide to play Nb6 it gives my opponent the chance to play Bg5 which means I must play Qd7 which will trap my Bishop and ruin what attack i may muster for a few moves (by then my opponent could force me to defend).
7,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4Pb2/8/2N2N2/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 4,"(White= Move 4-Nc3) Now that I play Nc6; it is attacking the e5 pawn I was orignally down, if white now plays Bg5 I can play my queen to d7 without blocking any pieces."
8,Nc6,b8c6,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4Pb2/8/2N2N2/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 4 5,"(White= Move 4-Nc3) Now that I play Nc6; it is attacking the e5 pawn I was orignally down, if white now plays Bg5 I can play my queen to d7 without blocking any pieces."
9,e4,e2e4,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4Pb2/4P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,At this stage I am down -1.73  but i expect this being a pawn down.
10,Bg4,f5g4,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4P3/4P1b1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,"The reason behind Bxf3 was because I wanted white to have double pawns on the f file which isn't always bad, it can protect pawns close together, but in this case I thought it helped me. White can respond with Qxf3 or gxf3 but that gives me my pawn back on e5. Qxf3 is the better move."
11,Bf4,c1f4,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4P3/4PBb1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 2 6,"The reason behind Bxf3 was because I wanted white to have double pawns on the f file which isn't always bad, it can protect pawns close together, but in this case I thought it helped me. White can respond with Qxf3 or gxf3 but that gives me my pawn back on e5. Qxf3 is the better move."
12,Bxf3,g4f3,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4P3/4PB2/2N2b2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"The reason behind Bxf3 was because I wanted white to have double pawns on the f file which isn't always bad, it can protect pawns close together, but in this case I thought it helped me.

13,gxf3,g2f3,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4P3/4PB2/2N2P2/PPP2P1P/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"The reason why this is a blunder is it gives white his pawn back and weakens the king side, from here I had to attack until my opponent defended it."
14,dxe5,d6e5,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/4p3/4PB2/2N2P2/PPP2P1P/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,"7. dxe5, 8. Be3"

16,Bb4,f8b4,r2qk1nr/ppp2ppp/2n5/4p3/1b2P3/2N1BP2/PPP2P1P/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 9,"In my opinion this isn't exactly a blunder (Qd3, the game is still even) it's an ok move. I planned from here what I wanted to do and it worked out due to a blunder by my opponent, it was all avoidable of course but so are most things in chess and I felt good that it paid off."
17,Qd3,d1d3,r2qk1nr/ppp2ppp/2n5/4p3/1b2P3/2NQBP2/PPP2P1P/R3KB1R b KQkq - 3 9,"In my opinion this isn't exactly a blunder (Qd3, the game is still even) it's an ok move.

18,Qxd3,d8d3,r3k1nr/ppp2ppp/2n5/4p3/1b2P3/2NqBP2/PPP2P1P/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 10,So I could keep the knight pinned and so that I could play Nd4 next
19,cxd3,c2d3,r3k1nr/ppp2ppp/2n5/4p3/1b2P3/2NPBP2/PP3P1P/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 10,"Black has a 0.53 advantage in this position, I played Nd4 so I could attempt Nc3 or Nxf3 if white blundered. White could also have played 11. Bxd4, exd4, 12. a3."
20,Nd4,c6d4,r3k1nr/ppp2ppp/8/4p3/1b1nP3/2NPBP2/PP3P1P/R3KB1R w KQkq - 1 11,"Black has a 0.53 advantage in this position, I played Nd4 so I could attempt Nc3 or Nxf3 if white blundered. White could also have played 11. Bxd4, exd4, 12. a3."
21,Rc1,a1c1,r3k1nr/ppp2ppp/8/4p3/1b1nP3/2NPBP2/PP3P1P/2R1KB1R b Kkq - 2 11,"The reason black can't take f3 with Nd4 is because after Nxf3, 12. Ke2, Nd4+, 12. Bxd4, exd4, 13. Nd5. Threatening both my Bishop on B4 and pawn on c6 (with both rook and Knight), so Ba5 isn't much use, and it will hurt by defence and losing the c pawn."
22,O-O-O,e8c8,2kr2nr/ppp2ppp/8/4p3/1b1nP3/2NPBP2/PP3P1P/2R1KB1R w K - 3 12,To stop the attack on c7 if white seen it.
23,Be2,f1e2,2kr2nr/ppp2ppp/8/4p3/1b1nP3/2NPBP2/PP2BP1P/2R1K2R b K - 4 12,To protect the f3 pawn from Nd4

25,O-O,e1g1,2kr3r/ppp1nppp/8/4p3/1b1nP3/2NPBP2/PP2BP1P/2R2RK1 b - - 6 13,Blunder- after this move white has lost the game as he goes down a rook and ends up resigning.
26,Bxc3,b4c3,2kr3r/ppp1nppp/8/4p3/3nP3/2bPBP2/PP2BP1P/2R2RK1 w - - 0 14,"So I can play Nxd2 if white takes back the bishop with his pawn, or if he plays Bxd4 I reply with bxd4 and up a piece."
