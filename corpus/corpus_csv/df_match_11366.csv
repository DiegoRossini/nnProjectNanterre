7,dxc5,d4c5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2PpP3/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"This is questionable as it dosnt cause black as many problems as the main line, which continues 4:c3 Nc6 5:Nf3 Qb6. This holds the pawn centre and the game will be black trying to break it down and white trying to defend it. Best play usually results in an equal game."
