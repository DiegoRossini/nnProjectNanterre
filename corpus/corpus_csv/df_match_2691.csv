1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"Hi everyone!

In this game, all looked lost.  I ended up blundering a pawn on the long a8-h1 diagonal very early in the game.  However, Steve's lsb ended up getting traded off later on and his castled position suddenly got very draughty and Glenda seized on it!  She was aided by a trusty steed and both pieces created a persistent mating threat on g2.  It seemed, however, impossible to deliver that coup de grace, until my rooks found a secondary target to distract Steve from the fundamental, primary task of defending his king.  So, how did this all happen?  Well, we start with 1. Nf3 which is the Reti Opening which is what Dynamic Dave played against me in our latest drawn game which transposed into a queen pawn opening.  This becomes more of an English Opening as the game pans out."
