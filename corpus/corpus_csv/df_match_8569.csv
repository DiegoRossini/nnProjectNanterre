1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,A very flexible opening move that could lead anywhere.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 2,"An unexpected continuation.  White clearly plans a Queenside fianchetto attacking Black's potential kingside castled position.  How should Black respond?  He can either choose to oppose the finachetto with one of his own, either Kingside or Queenside, or to develop his bishops centrally.  2...d6 will contest the e5 square and release the wsb.  2...e6 will lay claim to d5 and release the dsb.  Other possibilities were 2. c5, contesting the d4 square and postponing the question of where to develop the Bs, or 2...d5, laying claim to e4, or 2...Nc6, contesting d4 and e5."

4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/8/1P3N2/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,I opt to contest the long dark diagonal immediately with my own dsb.  I realise that this could be risky but I feel the need to play combatively.
5,Bb2,c1b2,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/8/1P3N2/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"This pawn's second move may appear to defy opening principles but by attacking the N it forces Black to move that N a second time and prepares to break up Black's castled position, so it is quite justified by the concrete considerations of the actual position on the board."

But even if Black avoids this, he is doomed: his only other move is 36...Ke8, when 37. Nxd6+ forks K and Rf7, so 37...Ke7 38. Nxf7 Kxf7 and White has a winning position, though I haven't worked out exactly how he converts it into a mating one."

PS My ECF grade is 124, his is 136.  I've been converting these to ELO by multiplying by 8 and adding 650.  I've been told by Paul Trewhela, also of Banbury, that I'm using the wrong conversion equation but I'm sticking to it for now as at least I'm being consistent."
