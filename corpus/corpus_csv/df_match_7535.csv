2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,e5..typical reply..i prefer it from the c5..
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,I'm playing typically in the beginning..
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,And he plays the same...Typical reply again...
5,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,Opening the bishop helps me rockie later...
6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,He's playing typical so far....
7,d3,d2d3,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,I prefer d3 at first and then Nc3 but it's almost the same thing...
8,d6,d7d6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4p3/2B1P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,d6 for black in the beginning is like playing Filidor's defence. So this is an old and pathetic move...i would have played 4...Bc5 and then d6 as with that move he's blocking his black bishop...
