Marin then pushes his pawn to d5.  Because my e pawn is under so much pressure I decide to exchange it.  Marin asked me whether I had considered e5?  Oops - maybe I have made the wrong decision.  There then follows a plethora of exchanges and I come off worse.
31,axb4,a3b4,2r2rk1/1bq1bppp/p1nppn2/8/1P2PP2/1NNQBB2/1PP3PP/3R1RK1 b - - 0 16,"22. ........ a5 - a pawn push threatening a removal of the guard by playing a4 so I move my queen off the pin line.  Maybe this was another mistake, judging by what followed next and I would have done much better to get my KING off the pin line instead!"

Bf6 (attacking the b pawn so I defend it by playing c4?? but this move loses because of the queen fork on b6 - maybe I should have played b3 instead).  Hindsight is always 20/20 vision (I think you have heard this before and may hear this many more times from me when playing 2000  players!!) so I now lose a pawn.

54,a3,a4a3,2r2rk1/5ppp/4pb2/8/2P2P2/p7/1q4PP/N1RQ1R1K w - - 0 28,"33. Rd1 - I attack the bishop but I have just seen what is about to happen.  He will play B x N, I will have to reply with R x B and he will then play 34....... Rb8 - this will lead to mate on the back rank (if 35. Rxa2) or ruinous loss of material - he will crown his pawn on if 35. g3, h3 or Kg1).  So I decided to resign the game.

So that is five games against five experts and 5 blobs to me.  At the moment, except for my Expert game in Battle of the Wings I have looked way, way out of my depth against the Experts so far - but I will not give up, although I will continue to play unrated games below master level).  The only thing I can say is that this week I managed to draw against two 1600s players (my record against the complete 1600s games is played 3, drawn 2, lost 1) so maybe I am on the upward curve - only time will tell."

At the moment, except for my Expert game in Battle of the Wings I have looked way, way out of my depth against the Experts so far - but I will not give up, although I will continue to play unrated games below master level).  The only thing I can say is that this week I managed to draw against two 1600s players (my record against the complete 1600s games is played 3, drawn 2, lost 1) so maybe I am on the upward curve - only time will tell."
62,Rca8,c8a8,r4rk1/5ppp/4p3/8/2Pb1P2/R7/p5PP/N4R1K w - - 2 32,"33. Rd1 - I attack the bishop but I have just seen what is about to happen.  He will play B x N, I will have to reply with R x B and he will then play 34....... Rb8 - this will lead to mate on the back rank (if 35. Rxa2) or ruinous loss of material - he will crown his pawn on if 35. g3, h3 or Kg1).  So I decided to resign the game.

So that is five games against five experts and 5 blobs to me.
