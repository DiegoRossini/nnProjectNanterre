1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game is The Proof, once for all, that ""My Scandinavian"", doesn't work against d5. I, regretfully, have to admit that. 
""My Scandinavian"" is a way to proceed into the Scandiavian that gave me very nice moments, surprisingly tactic games, won by black with sacs on the queenside. 
I suspected that it won't hold against d5, but the truth is that ALMOST NOBODY goes for an early d5, not even (standard) chess engines (I don't use them, but I remember I tried sometimes in the last years). 
Now, I tested the opening with a strong player, and I fell miserably. 

Incidentally, the game could have been the scenario for an interesting tactic strike by black, and I wonder if I (black) could have sustained my ""crazy"" sac."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"This seems a ""naive"" move. It is not. The queen is going to c7, taking advantage of the check tempo. White can avoid that, of course, but has to half-scramble his game in order to do that, and there is no need for it since white is in no danger."

7,Be2,f1e2,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/4q3/8/2N5/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 3 4,"The most common answer. Qe2 is seldom seen, and I personally go QxQ. It is not clear (form me, but I don't read books :-( ) if after this black can catch up in developement and reach equality. I have a nice win in my early annotated games. Ne2 is not bad, since it helps in supporting f5 (that will become very important later) and the lsb can try to fianchetto. Nobody does that, but I think I would go for it as white."
8,c6,c7c6,rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/4q3/8/2N5/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,Necessary to avoid knight's jumps.

11,d4,d2d4,rnb1kbnr/ppq1pppp/2p5/8/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"This is the first moment I go ""my way"", really. I just don't like the bishop to be trapped in after e6. I know that this bishop can be exchanged with the knight in 3, eventually, but it's ok, provided I use this to open the h column to my rook. This compensates black's position enough to equalize. In most cases. But I think that 7. d5 is just crusching for black. But nobody goes for it."

14,e6,e7e6,rn2kbnr/ppq2ppp/2p1p3/5b2/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,"Now, the point is that if exd5, after Re1 white has so many threats over black's position that I just consider that it is not a desirable game for black. Nxd5, cxd5, Bb5++ and only a miracle can save black. Similar destiny happened after cxd5. Now, I had to opt among several moves, considering both white pawns' take on the next move..."

By experience, I know that this knight will be soon under heavy attack, and that it is much better to have a pawn in c6 (at ""any cost"") than a knight. This also opens a quick way for a surprise queenside castling, bringing the rook junt in front of white's queen. This can be a good resource, in this line. I hold white's attacks on the queenside."

But after I retire it to g6 (no N moves were good to cover it), dxe6 leaves black in a very weak position, and I didn't want to play in such a disastrous position. So, once I assumed that ""My Scandinavian"" is just crap, I tried to have fun and get tactic."

Now, I realize it NOW. During the game, I was looking for Nf3 (in order to avoid f5, that ruins all my plan), and a lot of tactic lines came to my mind. It was fun, but confusing.
