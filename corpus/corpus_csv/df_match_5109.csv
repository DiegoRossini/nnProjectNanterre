1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"~ Always 1. e4 ... 2. f4 ... 3. Nf3 ... (gambits by nature are not fundamentally sound, but when I saw someone using it against me in Afghanistan I fell for the novelty of it! Lively play and it can be beaten.)"
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,1. ... e5 (the most popular response)
3,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,~ Will he accept? It's too tempting! Also available is the gambit declined and the gambit accepted.
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,~ Be advised: Bishops before Knights is a no-no! The c8-g3 diagonal open but easily dismissed.
5,fxe5,f4e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4P3/4P3/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,~  I've decided not concede his Bishop pin on my Knight. This could have been a disastrous decision if he would have caught it (3. ... Qh4+ 4. g2 Qxe4 5. Be2 Qxh1 followed by more self-inlflicted wounds)
6,dxe5,d6e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,~ Advantage declined by Black!
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,~ Breathing easier now. An experienced player would not have lost to me.
8,Bd6,f8d6,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3b4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,~ It would be much better to guard the King's pawn with 4. ... Nc6 (Bishops should be attacking!)
9,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3b4/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 5,~ I'm cooking up some fried liver. The f7 pawn is on the grill!
10,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/3b1n2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 6,"~ ""Stop kidding yourself. It's too late to Castle Kingside!"""
11,Bxf7+,c4f7,rnbqk2r/ppp2Bpp/3b1n2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,~ Should the King capture? Or just get out of the way!
12,Kxf7,e8f7,rnbq3r/ppp2kpp/3b1n2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 0 7,"~ Again, the bait is taken!"
13,Ng5+,f3g5,rnbq3r/ppp2kpp/3b1n2/4p1N1/4P3/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQ - 1 7,~ Black is not in bad shape. Not until a fatal decision in the next move.
14,Kg6,f7g6,rnbq3r/ppp3pp/3b1nk1/4p1N1/4P3/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 2 8,~ Heaps of trouble in front of your own pawns. Don't play in the traffic if you're the King!
15,h4,h2h4,rnbq3r/ppp3pp/3b1nk1/4p1N1/4P2P/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQK2R b KQ - 0 8,~ Hunting my Knight would be much easier for the pawns.
16,Bg4,c8g4,rn1q3r/ppp3pp/3b1nk1/4p1N1/4P1bP/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQK2R w KQ - 1 9,~ Threatening my Queen won't work. There is no safe place to hide for Black.
17,h5+,h4h5,rn1q3r/ppp3pp/3b1nk1/4p1NP/4P1b1/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQK2R b KQ - 0 9,"~ who would have thought the most important pawns on the Board were at d2, e4, and h5? 8. ... h5 would have prevented this Check!"
18,Kxg5,g6g5,rn1q3r/ppp3pp/3b1n2/4p1kP/4P1b1/8/PPPP2P1/RNBQK2R w KQ - 0 10,~ Does it look hopeless for the Queen? No!
19,d4#,d2d4,rn1q3r/ppp3pp/3b1n2/4p1kP/3PP1b1/8/PPP3P1/RNBQK2R b KQ - 0 10,"~ With Black's Queen and Knight sitting on the Back Rank, the King learns a painful lesson in development. Match Over, 1-0 !"
