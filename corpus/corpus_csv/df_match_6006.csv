What will I do if he plays Bd3? Maybe trade bishops, and then he's threatening Qxh7, so I can play Qh5 to guard the pawn and attack his knight."

I've never had anyone trade on f5 before. I wonder if he's planning to follow up with Bd3 and threaten Bxh7. But after Bd3, I'm going to move Qd5 with my attack on g2."

There's the blunt threat of Bd3 that attacks the queen and the pawn on h7. But worse is Bg2. I''m not going to be able to stop d5, and that's when the game falls apart for me."
