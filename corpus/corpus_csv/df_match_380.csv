1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Hi everyone. This is shena gupta from India. I am a chess leaner and prefer to play relatively fast. I am black in this game. Please give your valuable feedback for my improvement.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Sicilian defense is my favorite as a black pieces.
3,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,It seems he want to develop fast and take advantage. My best response is e6 but i would rather prefer the followup move kc6.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 3,He repay as usual
5,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,He repay as usual
6,f6,f7f6,r1bqkbnr/pp1pp1pp/2n2p2/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,The rather week pawn at f7 pushed forward to f6 for blocking white knight move at g5 and e5 both because after the development i need my c6 knight at d4. This is the move which decide the game also. I know very well a GM level player easily humiliate me for my f6 move but my this opponent easily overlooked and make a surprise move.
