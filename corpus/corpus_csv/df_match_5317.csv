(Fun fact; he is the only player to have beaten nine undisputed world champions!) As far as I'm aware, this isn't one of his more famous games, but definitely one to check out!"

Nope - Hort doesn't fall for the trap and instead ensures the win of the pawn - Keres has to answer the threat to his rook.

However, it looks like an extreme loss of tempo when a bishop that has already moved five times (soon six) has to be exchanged off for one that will only have moved once! White could still play 9.Qxd4 here, but would need to play a3 to have an escape hole for his bishop (9...Bd7 or 9...Ne7 and the Noah's Ark trap is renewed with c6, c5 and c4)"
