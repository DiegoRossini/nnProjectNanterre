1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"(This game was Round 16 of the Bled-Zagreb-Belgrade Candidates Chess Tournament, this particular game played I believe in Zagreb, Yugoslavia.) Fischer opens with e4, a widely known trademark of his. He was about 16 years old around the time of this tournament. You'll find people saying that d4 has more success in grandmaster play, but Fischer was apparently not one of those grandmasters who'd ever claim or play such a thing. e4 was his preference in the opening."
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"And ""Iron Tiger"" Petrosian opens with the Caro-Kann. I'm less sure of his frequency to play passive openings like the Caro-Kann, but from what I hear, his attention and accuracy in regard to defense was one of the most unique qualities to him in particular. So it goes, he was one of the most difficult grandmasters ever to actually defeat..."
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"More popular is 2. d4 nowadays. Nc3 seems okay, but a tad passive in comparison IMO."
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Common for Black, and the best reply, I think as well."
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"And Fischer tries to possess the center using his two knights. The approach is fine, but in the Flohr varation (2. d4 d5, Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4), White looks fine and comfortable with maneuverability, and I've found this in my own experiences with the opening as well. Instead, when playing Two Knights here, White has to concern himself with..."
6,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4P1b1/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,"And frankly, early knight pins are annoying! Perhaps this is why we see 2. d4 played more often."
7,h3,h2h3,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4P1b1/2N2N1P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"Fischer doesn't seem so easily annoyed by opening pins, however, and invites Black's reply."
8,Bxf3,g4f3,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4P3/2N2b1P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"More common is this. If the bishop is already here, you might as well not lose tempo to bring it back."
9,Qxf3,d1f3,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4P3/2N2Q1P/PPPP1PP1/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"And the Queen takes. Personally, I also avoid (g/b)x(f/c)(3/6) whenever possible. It tends to be a nasty hole in the pawn structure, and it just isn't worth the hassle when another back rank piece is within reach to capture instead... mostly. White usually castles short here as well..."
10,Nf6,g8f6,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/4P3/2N2Q1P/PPPP1PP1/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 1 6,"Black can now take advantage of the lonely e4 pawn. White's going to need to be a bit more passive in development now, making sure to cover all bases before launching a strike."
11,d3,d2d3,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/4P3/2NP1Q1P/PPP2PP1/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"Fischer plays this double-edged move. Once again I'm going to go on a bit more of an opening rant- it's a fair move, guarding e4 again and letting the dark bishop come into the game to target g5 eventually, but it also traps the light bishop. Meaning, if White is planning to castle kingside, it's all too obvious what the best plan that way will be- g3 has to be played, followed by Bg2, and then O-O. Otherwise, the light bishop takes on e2, but that won't be very effective if e4 is being pressured like this. So I feel as though Fischer is making his motives a little too obvious here for Petrosian. All in all, I just don't think two-knights is an ideal opening for White to play himself into."
12,e6,e7e6,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/4P3/2NP1Q1P/PPP2PP1/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"Still, Petrosian seems to form his own agenda. With his own light bishop already gone, he brings the other into the game. He's already used the most ideal piece to harass White's f3 with, which is a tad unfortunate. Black looks solid so far..."
13,g3,g2g3,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/4P3/2NP1QPP/PPP2P2/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"And as I thought, now Fischer begins his K-side fianchetto plans, eyeing to castle short."
14,Bb4,f8b4,rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/1b2P3/2NP1QPP/PPP2P2/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 1 8,"Petrosian puts a halt to that plan by setting up yet another harassing bishop pin. He seems to really enjoy bishop -> knight trades, but his plan appears sound."
15,Bd2,c1d2,rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/1b2P3/2NP1QPP/PPPB1P2/R3KB1R b KQkq - 2 8,"Playing anything else would force bxc3 after Bxc3+, again threatening to disrupt White's pawns."
16,d4,d5d4,rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/8/1b1pP3/2NP1QPP/PPPB1P2/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 9,"Petrosian is relentless about that knight. It's almost as though we've got a hit called on a simple horse. Well, they are in the right time period for that, I guess? At any rate, I'm not sure I see better moves, but I don't know if I can commit to the effect that perhaps Black is overreaching here. Yet if I were going to play anything else, it'd have been O-O, and I suppose that'd have been a tad passive."
17,Nb1,c3b1,rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/8/1b1pP3/3P1QPP/PPPB1P2/RN2KB1R b KQkq - 1 9,"This is forced. If the knight doesn't move, then dx. The only other decent looking square is then Ne2, but if White plays that, then..."
18,Bxd2+,b4d2,rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/8/3pP3/3P1QPP/PPPb1P2/RN2KB1R w KQkq - 0 10,"...White's king would be forced to capture. Now, as for Black, the saying goes again: ""If the bishop is already here, you might as well not lose tempo to bring it back."" Perhaps a little less true here than with the other bishop. Could Bd6 have helped any?"
19,Nxd2,b1d2,rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/8/3pP3/3P1QPP/PPPN1P2/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 10,"The knight now comes to rescue White's castling rights, but Black is holding the initiative. White is slightly ahead in development, but Black can grab space more easily on the board. White has slightly more use of his back pieces, but..."
20,e5,e6e5,rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/2p2n2/4p3/3pP3/3P1QPP/PPPN1P2/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 11,"Black's pawns have more potential to inhibit White's ability to grab more control of the white squares after the fianchetto. With e4 stuck in place, the White Queen is virtually forced to move away eventually in order to free Fischer's ability to stake a claim to the kingside. The game is still early, but I'm pegging Black to have a slight edge over White here. I think there's a few more choices over the opposition, and for every bonus White has, Black has one too, but the drawbacks seem slightly harsher against White."
