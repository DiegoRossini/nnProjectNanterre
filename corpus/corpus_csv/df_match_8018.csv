15,c3,c2c3,r1bq1rk1/2ppbppp/p1n2n2/1p2p3/4P3/1BP2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQR1K1 b - - 0 8,"Classical way to play with d4, trying to gain the center. Although c3 allows the Marshall Attack, and thus if white does not want to play against the Marshall he can play several antimarshall variations: mainly a4 or h3"
16,d5,d7d5,r1bq1rk1/2p1bppp/p1n2n2/1p1pp3/4P3/1BP2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQR1K1 w - - 0 9,The Marshall Attack. A strong pawn sacrifice.
17,Bxd5,b3d5,r1bq1rk1/2p1bppp/p1n2n2/1p1Bp3/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQR1K1 b - - 0 9,"? Just wrong. The main line exd5 nxd5 nxe5 rxe5 bd6 qh4 g3 qh3 offers black attacking chances, but both sides have to play carefully and black is down a pawn. This line just gives black the advantages of the Marshall without the downside (the gambit of the e pawn)"

Normally the Black Queen is on h3 and the black LSB is on g4, setting up nice mating nets. Here though Qh3 drops a pawn, so deploying the bishop along the a8 h1 diagonal seems effective."
