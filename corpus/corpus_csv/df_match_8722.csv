Along the way it feels as if black just claims little advantage after little advantage, piling them on, until the pile is overwhelming, but white doesn't let black get any easy checkmates until he runs out of defenders."

But I found that now, when annotating, not during the game. So maybe black's 4th move isn't the best line, bringing out white's queen and making d5 a difficult square for black to occupy. First advantage in the pile."
