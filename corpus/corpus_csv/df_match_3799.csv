1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"This opening goes by a variety of names (Reti is the one I've encountered most frequently), or sometimes by no name at all--1.Nf3 is a transpositional move, used in a variety of ways to avoid certain lines (generally those including an early ...e5) in other common openings. In this game, for example, White wants to play the English, but avoid a reversed-Sicilian (1.c4 e5)."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,More popular are 1...Nf6 and 1...d5. With this move Black offers a transition to the main-line Sicilian (after 2.e4).
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,"But White was intending to play the English, so now we have a Symmetrical English opening instead."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 3,"Black makes a claim for the center before White's King's Bishop can get in the game, aiming at d5. The game still has a large amount of transpositional potential; the move order is not critical. White will continue to attack the center from the wings, while Black seeks to occupy it directly."
5,g3,g2g3,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/2P5/5NP1/PP1PPP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"Black makes a claim for the center before White's King's Bishop can get in the game, aiming at d5.

Even his Queen is not trivial to harass right away, as the loss of White's QN restricts his options--only the Bg2 is available to attack the Queen, and that only via moving his Knight to a much more marginal location (either Nh4 or (after castling) Ng5-h3 (after Black's Queen's retreat and ...h6))."
