1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Patzer opening.  (Your opponent is looking toward the four move check mate--will come out with Bc4 if you let him).

4,Qf6,d8f6,rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/5q2/4p2Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 2 3,"Nc6 is the most typical response for black.  It defends the pawn and although it does not discourage Bc4, black ends up chasing the white queen while developing his pieces with 3...Pg6 (in response to Bc4).

Putting the queen out on the field early is not bad when playing lower rated amateurs.  It is a powerful piece.  But the move is considered risky.  White's leading responses all do well."
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/5q2/4p2Q/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 3 3,With this move black loses Pe5.  I like Pd6 which protects Pe5 from white's marauding queen.

17,Qxb7,b3b7,r3k1nr/pQ2bp1p/n2pbqp1/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 9,"This doesn't save the knight, of course, but black could at least recoup one point with Rc8.  QxNa6, RxPc2.  On second thought, that isn't any good either, as white would move Qa4+ and seize Rc2.  The white queen has become a gnawing cancer in black's side."

20,Rxb2,b8b2,4k1nr/p3bp1p/Q2pbqp1/8/4P3/5N2/PrPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQk - 0 11,"While this might look like a bad move at first blush, it is actually quite good.  Black would end up trading a pawn, bishop, AND rook for black's rook provided white takes the bait.  White's best response here appears to be Pe5.  Black must then move the queen, giving white a cheap rook."

26,Rxc3,c2c3,5knr/4bp1p/3pbqp1/8/Q3P3/2r2N2/P2P1PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ - 0 14,"Actually, this is a great move for black.  PxRc3 and white loses the pawn with QxPc3+ AND the a rook.  I take back what I said earlier about the black rook being trapped.  Nice recover!  There is one small fly in the ointment, though--Bb2.  This pins the black rook against the black queen.  Black can trade the rook for the bishop with Rc1+, RxRc1, QxBb2.  White can then kind of force a queen trade (all trades are white's advantage while white enjoys material) with Qd4."
