2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,The French.
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Standard.   If black's going to offer me the centre, it'd be rude not to accept."
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,And an immediate challenge.
5,Nd2,b1d2,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"The Tarrasch.   At various stages, I've played the advance and the Winawer as well, but I've settled on the Tarrash the past couple of years.   Maybe that'll change again in the future!"
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3PP3/8/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,This or 3. ... c5 are the most common; a matter of taste for black really.
7,e5,e4e5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3pP3/3P4/8/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"The best diagonal for white's light-squared bishop in the French, usually.   Here, it targets h7, which is that bit weaker now that black's knight can't get to f6."

O-O cd 9. cd NxP?! 10. NxN QxN 11. Nf3 with a natural attack.   I've played this line four times between here and over the board games, winning each time."
