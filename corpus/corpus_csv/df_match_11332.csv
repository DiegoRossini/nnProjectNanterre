3,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"An alternative to the main variation of this opening. White wants to attack on the kingside. If Black is not prepared for this opening, he could end up having difficulties, but when properly dealt with, 2.f4 is rather harmless."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,I need to fianchetto this bishop to add to my control of the central dark squares.

7,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/2p5/4PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"Is sort of a pointless move, because after Bxc6 bxc6, I have another centre pawn and my position becomes more solid."
8,Bg7,f8g7,r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/2p5/4PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,"Is sort of a pointless move, because after Bxc6 bxc6, I have another centre pawn and my position becomes more solid."

11,e5,e4e5,r1bqk1nr/pp1p1pbp/2n1p1p1/1Bp1P3/5P2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,A premature pawn push. You shouldn't advance a pawn into your opponent's territory if he has pawns on the adjacent files which can undermine it. I can attack White's pawn with f6 or d6.

White's bishop has no active role in the game, so he should've either exchanged it for my knight, or retreated to f1 to get it out of the way."
