1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,more experimentation of the d4 opening.
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"this is one of the first times ive seen e6 as a response. there's probably some
devious methodology to it."
3,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"by this point you've pretty much got this opening memorized, if you've followed these games (i don't know why you would) please tell me where i made mistakes, because i need some help with this kind of game"
4,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"this is extremely unorthadox, but note the f8 bishop."
5,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/2PP4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"I'm not gonna let this throw off my opening. I should mention this was game 3 with 5 second delay, it will explain some mistakes."

7,exd4,e3d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/8/2PP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"this is justified next move, I know these two pawns are extremely over extended, but thats a risk im willing to take at this point."
8,e5,e6e5,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/8/4p3/2PP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,if you EVER want to tick someone off: push the pawn when they offer a trade. this also provided protectioin against Nc6 and helps really later on.

11,Bd2,c1d2,rnbqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/8/3Pp3/1bP5/8/PP1B1PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 2 6,this is actually a trigger response
12,Bxd2+,b4d2,rnbqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/8/3Pp3/2P5/8/PP1b1PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,"that knight is actually defending c4, allowing you to move/fiancetto that bishop on f1. note how the rook could easily take control of the c file right now."
