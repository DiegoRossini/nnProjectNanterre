2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,I show that I am going to use an Indian defense.   If he plays d4 straight away then I can play ...e6...Bb4 going into the nimo-indian.  If he plays Nf3 and avoids Nc3 then I can go into my usual Kings Indian set up.

5,b4,b2b4,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/1PP5/5N2/P2PPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"This is Reti's setup against the King's Indian.  He won a famous game against the great Capablanca with this opening.  You can see it at chessgames.com ( http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1102101 )
The idea behind this move is to gain space on the queenside, since black has made no move in the center.  This keeps with the hypermodern approach."
6,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/1PP5/5N2/P2PPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,This move may not be the best.  I think that it is best to develop the bishop on the h1-a8 diagonal.  on the f1-h6 diagonal the bishop does not do much.
