9,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,I think this is a fairly standard approach to supporting the centre against the Dragon.  I was already contemplating queenside castling and a kingside storm against his castled position ...

14,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp1pppbp/2n2np1/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 1 8,"I had three main thoughts when making this move: 1. to set up long term pressure on f7; 2. to help defend my eventually castled King; 3. not to occupy e2, which I anticipated would be needed by one of my knights.  I think this worked quite well, even though I did eventually lose.  I couldn't see any significant benefit in advancing to b5 now that Black had already castled."

18,Ne5,c6e5,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/4n3/2BNP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3K2R w KQ - 2 10,! I hadn't expected this yet.  This N becomes a serious nuisance.  The initial threat is easily dealt with by retreating my B but soon I'm given more serious headaches.
19,Bb3,c4b3,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/4n3/3NP3/1BN1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3K2R b KQ - 3 10,"I was already having doubts about my strategy as Black was obviously going to exploit the half-open c-file and eventually create further threats with his fianchettoed B, but at this stage I thought he was equally well placed to attack a kingside castled position and I could soon launch my kingside attack."

Now, expecting to need to retreat the Nd4 to e2 in order to defend the Nc3, I mistakenly moved this rook to the f-file to over-defend the f-pawn so that I could play Ne2 with impunity.  Unfortunately, Black soon demonstrated that I had more important things to worry about and that the rook was needed on the d-file.  I couldn't afford this waste of tempi."

It also creates a battery on the c-file and gets out of the way of Black's a and b pawns, which are poised to storm White's position and harrass the defending minor pieces."

Having weighed up my defensive options, I decided to stay put and not create any further weaknesses in my castled position (eg by playing 17.a3), but revert to plan A and dislodge his N before it could join his attack.  I was also thinking of advancing my f-pawn and didn't want to leave the g-pawn hanging if I did so.  Unfortunately there is an undesired consequence of forcing the N to move ..."

The bad things were that now my Nd4 was under immediate attack and I couldn't yet move my h-pawn without allowing him to fork my rooks from g3."
