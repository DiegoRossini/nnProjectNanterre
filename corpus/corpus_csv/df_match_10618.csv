5,b4,b2b4,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/1PP5/5N2/P2PPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,I'll bet that's not in your book.  Grabbing space on the queenside immediately and preparing to play Bb2 to counter the g7-bishop.
6,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/1PP5/5N2/P2PPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,5. e3 is acceptable also and is a favorite of Vassily Smyslov.

10,d6,d7d6,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/1PP5/5NP1/PB1PPP1P/RN1QKB1R w KQ - 0 6,5...d5 6. cd Nxd5 7. Bxg7 Kxg7 8. Qb3 Qd6 is an interesting continuation.  But not 8...Nf6?! when white's straightforward development leaves him lasting initiative as in Reti-Pokorny 1923.
11,Bg2,f1g2,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/1PP5/5NP1/PB1PPPBP/RN1QK2R b KQ - 1 6,Most players prefer 7...Nh5 or 7...Ne8 followed by a quick ...f5.  This move just lets me gain space.

This move also keeps the b1-knight flexible.  Sometimes Black will bring his knight to c5 and it is useful to be able to play Nbd2 and Nb3 to challenge."
20,f5,f7f5,r1bq1rk1/pppnn1bp/3p2p1/1P2pp2/2P5/3P1NP1/PBQ1PPBP/RN3RK1 w - - 0 11,Gaining space on the kingside in preparation for an attack.

This move also causes Black to move the d7 knight to c5, where I create a strucural weakness in Black's camp.  The e7 knight will be a weak attacking piece as it wont be as well coordinated with the Black queen as its parter on f6 would have been."
