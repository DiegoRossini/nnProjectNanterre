This prepares a sort of English Attack (Be3) with a Maroczy Bind.  The pawn on f3 allows White to develop his B to e3 without being attacked by Black's KN.  It also sets up a strong central pawn chain.  Finally, because White hasn't yet played Nc3, he has the option of advancing his c-pawn (the Maroczy Bind)."

10,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3ppn2/8/3NP3/5P2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"I respond cautiously, with a standard Sicilian developing move, while delaying the characteristic Najdorf move ...a6 till it's needed.  It may not be necessary against White's formation, so I hold it back till I know.  I'm already out of my book learning, though I'm sure this game doesn't leave ""The Book"" for a long while yet."
11,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3ppn2/8/2PNP3/5P2/PP4PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,This has the advantage of controlling d5 but it does shut in White's wsb
12,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/3ppn2/8/2PNP3/5P2/PP4PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,now I feel the need for ...a6 so that I can play ...Qc7 and develop my queenside normally

14,a6,a7a6,rnbqk2r/1p2bppp/p2ppn2/8/2PNP3/2N2P2/PP4PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,"Having established his pawn structure, White calmly completes his development before launching operations.  The direction of those operations will depend on where Black exposes weaknesses in his defences.  For example, White could develop his B to e3 and Q to d2, castle queenside and launch the g-pawn at a castled king (the English Attack), or alternatively, White may castle kingside and exploit the hole at b6 with Be3 and Na4.  The pawn on c4 encourages this approach."

This Q move prepares potential queenside castling but also supports ...Nc6 so that if White swaps Ns on c6, Black doesn't have to give himself an isolated pawn on a6 (something which jstevens1 of this parish has exploited against me in the past)"
