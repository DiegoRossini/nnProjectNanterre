1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Here is my final round game from the Georgia State Championship. I was sitting on 2 points going into it, and since I was already out of the money this game was just for pride. I arrived at the board 35 minutes late after spending an hour or so hanging out with a couple of buddies of mine (one is a Life Master and the other a Fide Master). I was so engrossed listening to them talk chess that I totally lost track of time. Good thing this tournament had long time controls! When I finally approached the board, I noticed two main things - more than 20% of my time had already transpired and my opponent was obviously not very happy that I was late. So I simply looked at him and the clock one more time, smiled, and walked away to watch some other games for a bit. I figured that if I was already psyching him out, I might as well try to put him on full tilt. I had the white pieces, so I would at least have the initial advantage. I would simply play a system that I was very familiar with and play the opening very quickly. With over 45 minutes of my time now gone, I return to the board and play my standard 1. d4."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"A standard response played very quickly. After this move, and approximately the 15 or so to follow, my opponent looks at the clock and smiles to himself. I'm betting that he is counting on his huge time advantage to carry the day. That is precisely what I want him to think - if he is concentrating more on his time than on his game, I can steer the game into familiar territory for me and attempt to to play some themes that I have had much success with."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 2,Intending any variation of the QGA or QGD (my personal favorites).
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,Black intends the KID.
5,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,4...d5 is stronger IMHO. Black cedes white a little tempo.
6,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,4...d5 is stronger IMHO. Black cedes white a little tempo.
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,4...d5 is stronger IMHO. Black cedes white a little tempo.
8,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 3 5,4...d5 is stronger IMHO. Black cedes white a little tempo.
9,h3,h2h3,rnbq1rk1/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/2N2N1P/PP2PPP1/R1BQKB1R b KQ - 0 5,"Given the time, I go ahead and play a defensive move to stall the progress of black's light squared bishop."
10,d6,d7d6,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PP4/2N2N1P/PP2PPP1/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 0 6,"? Again, 5...d5 was stronger."
11,e4,e2e4,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N1P/PP3PP1/R1BQKB1R b KQ - 0 6,White claims the center. It is interesting to note that my last six moves were played in approximately 30 seconds.
12,Nc6,b8c6,r1bq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/2np1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N1P/PP3PP1/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 1 7,"Black makes what seems to be a logical developing move, but it has a very real weakness that white exploits."
13,d5,d4d5,r1bq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/2np1np1/3P4/2P1P3/2N2N1P/PP3PP1/R1BQKB1R b KQ - 0 7,! I did spend about a minute on this one. The aim is to either harrass the Nc6 knight OR double black's pawns on the e file.
14,Ne5,c6e5,r1bq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/3Pn3/2P1P3/2N2N1P/PP3PP1/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 1 8,As intended.

19,O-O,e1g1,r1bqnrk1/ppp1ppbp/6p1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N4P/PP2BPP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 3 10,Whoa....black makes a huge commitment very early that weakens what was once a very solid castled position.
20,f5,f7f5,r1bqnrk1/ppp1p1bp/6p1/3Ppp2/2P1P3/2N4P/PP2BPP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 11,Whoa....black makes a huge commitment very early that weakens what was once a very solid castled position.
21,Qb3,d1b3,r1bqnrk1/ppp1p1bp/6p1/3Ppp2/2P1P3/1QN4P/PP2BPP1/R1B2RK1 b - - 1 11,"Hitting b7 which slows down black's light squared bishop, but just as importantly x-rays the black king."
22,Rb8,a8b8,1rbqnrk1/ppp1p1bp/6p1/3Ppp2/2P1P3/1QN4P/PP2BPP1/R1B2RK1 w - - 2 12,Black prepares to develop his light squared bishop and/or start a queenside push.
23,c5,c4c5,1rbqnrk1/ppp1p1bp/6p1/2PPpp2/4P3/1QN4P/PP2BPP1/R1B2RK1 b - - 0 12,! Stymying the Ne8 and preparing a discovered check.
24,Kh8,g8h8,1rbqnr1k/ppp1p1bp/6p1/2PPpp2/4P3/1QN4P/PP2BPP1/R1B2RK1 w - - 1 13,Black sees the check coming and sidesteps.
25,Be3,c1e3,1rbqnr1k/ppp1p1bp/6p1/2PPpp2/4P3/1QN1B2P/PP2BPP1/R4RK1 b - - 2 13,"This move was made with the hope that black would push his f pawn, therefore closing down pawn threats in the center."
26,f4,f5f4,1rbqnr1k/ppp1p1bp/6p1/2PPp3/4Pp2/1QN1B2P/PP2BPP1/R4RK1 w - - 0 14,"Black obliges. Again, it is important to realize that my opponent is moving lightening quick to preserve his huge time advantage. I'm betting the farm that my experience in these type lines is greater than his. White now intends to play for a big space advantage."
