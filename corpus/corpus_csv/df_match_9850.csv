 A very interesting game with many complex parts to it. If anyone understands why 31. Qxa6 is a bad move please enlighten me, if not chalk it up to a mistake by both sides. 

Fatal to White here (other than missing the free queen which would also have  lead to a captured knight at least) was the premature attack against Black's King. With just the knight white was able to fork the rooks, but Black's response not only won back the material it also enabled strong pressure on White's King putting it on the defensive almost the entire conclusion of the game."
