1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was my first win, that I can acknowledge to myself. I didn't play my h3 or a3 rather a regular opening.
It's the second game I comment here, after the lost one (http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/lets-play-chess.pl?gm=23489)

I am prompted to comment my games because I saw that some people comment on my analysis and give precious feedback of which I can draw much advises and understanding."

In this position I'd like to examine things and try see yourself what you can play. Give yourself a few seconds or even minutes."
25,Qd2,d1d2,r4rk1/pp1nppbp/3p2p1/q7/3PP3/2N1BP2/PP1Q2PP/R4RK1 b - - 4 13,"You may think that I played this naturally to give more freedom to my rooks in the a-rank. My queen is pinned and if not because of the bishop this can be dangerous in the future.

My idea instead to give possibility for Nd5 which attacks two pieces in one moment : the Queen at a5 and the pawn at f7.
If QxQ, then Nxf7+ then after K moves I just take the queen and win a pawn."
26,Rfe8,f8e8,r3r1k1/pp1nppbp/3p2p1/q7/3PP3/2N1BP2/PP1Q2PP/R4RK1 w - - 5 14,"I was hoping that my opponent places one of his rooks at d8 so that when I go with my plan of Nd5 the queen no more can retreat at d8 to secure e7.
After he played Re8 I noticed that my plan was bad from the start.
In fact if Qa5 takes my queen and Nxe7+, Kh8  and that I take the queen with my bishop e3, d4 will be undefended :
blacks will play Bxe4+ and after K escape, Bxb2 : Now blacks have an extra pawn when they were down a pawn. Note that If Rb1 then Bf6 forces me to retreat the Knight that took the pawn and f7 and hence I loose the time that I would have used to take b7 and balance the material.

Two choices were available to me :
1. Either correct the weaknesses in my position (for instances, employ the rooks to secure d4 and b1) or attack so not to let my opponent find the time to strengthen his position."
