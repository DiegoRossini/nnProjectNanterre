1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"First off, This game was a blitz chess game that I played at 4:00 in the morning If you didn't get that to start. It has some interesting moves. I will be annotating this from the first person so I can give thoughts and opinions on the matter, lets get started shall we?"

9,c3,c2c3,r1bqkbnr/p1pp1ppp/1pn5/8/4P3/2P1Q3/PP3PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"This move blocks both of our knight's mobility. Nc3 would have been a much stronger option, developing a knight and giving extra coverage to the e4 pawn."

White could have played 13. Bxf3...Nxe4 Then he would have a few options If he chooses to take the knight then he's in some mega trouble 14. Bxe4...Bxe4 then he can either lose the rook and have mate once again threatened or 15. Rh2...Bd3+ 16. Kd2...Be3 and I win white's queen for my bishop, stranding his king on a very unsafe d3.

after hypothetical 13. Bxf3...Nxe4, if white had played something like 14. Kf1 then ...Ng5 threatening mate with the queen on d1. 15. Bd2 and i get a free knight and because after 15. ...Nxf3 16. Nxf3...Qd2# ... This option results in a huge loss of material and position as well.

14. Kd1 is the white kings best option here although it still lands him down a pawn and in a precarious spot: 14.Kd4...Nf2+ 15. Kc2...Bxf3 16.Qxf3...Nh1 17. Qxh1...Bxg1 18. Qxg1...Qe4+ then 19. Kb3 is forced due to his other options being mate in 1 for me."

Because my opponent spent all of his time with that pawn attack he could not get many pieces developed and now is in a tight spot although he has a one pawn material advantage.
27,Rh4,h1h4,r3r1k1/pbppqppp/1p6/2b3PP/4nQ1R/2P2N2/PP2B3/RNB1K3 b Q - 1 14,White sees that his rook is in danger by way of the bishop on b7. Rh2 would have been a much better option.
28,Nxg5,e4g5,r3r1k1/pbppqppp/1p6/2b3nP/5Q1R/2P2N2/PP2B3/RNB1K3 w Q - 0 15,Material is even and white is now in danger of checkmate in 1! I have a crushing position now
