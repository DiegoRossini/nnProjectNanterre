1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,So he starts with the usual
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,and I play the Sicilian
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Mark usually plays the open variation against it.
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"I normally play Nc6, but I had several games with Mark a week ago, so I decided to play something different from what I was playing last week."
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,So he continues
6,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,I take
7,Nxd4,f3d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,He takes back
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,I hit the e pawn
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,He defends
10,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bqkb1r/pp1npppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 3 6,So this is the move that I used to play at university.
11,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqkb1r/pp1npppp/3p1n2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 4 6,"He continues with what he normally plays in the main line. However now of course, there is no threat to double my f pawns, so it is probably not the best move."
12,Qa5,d8a5,r1b1kb1r/pp1npppp/3p1n2/q5B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 5 7,"I am now threatening Nxe4 and Qxg5, but this is easily met, so perhaps it is not the best move. I see on the opening databases, there is no record of 6....Qa5 being played before."
13,Qd2,d1d2,r1b1kb1r/pp1npppp/3p1n2/q5B1/3NP3/2N5/PPPQ1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 6 7,Preparing 0-0-0
14,a6,a7a6,r1b1kb1r/1p1npppp/p2p1n2/q5B1/3NP3/2N5/PPPQ1PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 8,So I prepare queen side advances.
15,O-O-O,e1c1,r1b1kb1r/1p1npppp/p2p1n2/q5B1/3NP3/2N5/PPPQ1PPP/2KR1B1R b kq - 1 8,He castles
16,b5,b7b5,r1b1kb1r/3npppp/p2p1n2/qp4B1/3NP3/2N5/PPPQ1PPP/2KR1B1R w kq - 0 9,"I start my queen side advances, threatening b4 followed by Nxe4"
17,f3,f2f3,r1b1kb1r/3npppp/p2p1n2/qp4B1/3NP3/2N2P2/PPPQ2PP/2KR1B1R b kq - 0 9,Which is easily met
18,b4,b5b4,r1b1kb1r/3npppp/p2p1n2/q5B1/1p1NP3/2N2P2/PPPQ2PP/2KR1B1R w kq - 0 10,I attack
19,Nb1,c3b1,r1b1kb1r/3npppp/p2p1n2/q5B1/1p1NP3/5P2/PPPQ2PP/1NKR1B1R b kq - 1 10,He retreats. If now Qxa2 11. Qxb5 and my queen is very much out of play. He can play Bc4 forcing Qa1 and even more out of the game. I have to be careful now about move like Nc6 and/or a6 winning my pawn on b4
20,e6,e7e6,r1b1kb1r/3n1ppp/p2ppn2/q5B1/1p1NP3/5P2/PPPQ2PP/1NKR1B1R w kq - 0 11,"So I prepare d4, opening up the a3-f8 diagonal, so my pawn is supported by my Bf8"
