1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I was playing Black. One satisfying thing about this game is that I spent most of it focused on the d4 square, and that's where the decisive blow was struck (albeit not how I expected). Annotation was mainly done as the game progressed, but edited after the game."

My long term plan was something like Nc6, Ne8-c7-e6 (but Bg4 before Ne6 to remove a defender of d4), a6, b5-b4 to kick Nc3 from the attack on d5, and an eventual f6 to open the diagonal for the bishop. I did not expect to be able to win the pawn, just to exert pressure on White's position. I knew that White's play was likely to alter this course, but I always need a concrete plan. (Fritz: +0.20)"

Nevertheless, I think this an excellent move. The centre is closed, White's pawns are pointing kingside, and opening the h-file carries serious threats.

What should Black do? h6 or h5 are overly committal and would encourage White. ""The best response to an attack on the flank is a counter-attack in the centre"", but the only move available to prise open the centre (11...f6) would be premature. A simple queenside pawn march is too slow. I chose a move I had intended anyway, exploiting the negative aspect of 11. h4, which I hoped would put doubt in White's mind. (Fritz is not particularly keen on 11. h4: +0.16)"

Black can chase the queen around on the queenside, and perhaps White was hoping h5 might be met by gxh5. Still, it prevents White connecting rooks or doubling them on the h-file. Qd3 or Qa3 look stronger. (Fritz: -0.01)"

In fact, Black's at least level in development, which is remarkable considering the position after 8... Ne8. Prompted by 14. Qd1, I was no longer so desperate to make use of the c-file.
