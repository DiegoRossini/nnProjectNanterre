1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,So far the opening has been quite easy to play. I was expecting him to play d5 and move into the grunfeld defence at this point. Nf3 is more of a waiting move with the hopes that he plays d5. I was sort of hoping for it since it was one of the few openings that I actually had prepared for that day. However my opponent didn't play with a lot of ambition and just sort of turtled up.

8,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 4 5,"Not the move I was hoping for, but a valid move. For as far as I understand the position he'll turtle up and wait for me to go on the offensive and then hope to somewhere gain an edge."
9,e4,e2e4,rnbq1rk1/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQ - 0 5,"I accept his challenge. I'm not familiar with having this much control over the center, but it can't possibly be a bad thing."
10,d6,d7d6,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 0 6,Setting up for his bishop to come to g4 and make a break via either e5 and c5 in the hopes to undermine my center.
11,Bg5,c1g5,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/6B1/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 1 6,"This was the first move on which I spent more then 5 minutes, surprising my opponent. It may seem like an easy move to make, but I had to calculate potential c5 and e5 plans. I figured that I was okay with e5 being played. I'd probably respond with d5 and suddenly his bishop on g7 becomes a lot less valuable. If he played c5 then I was okay with dxc5 since  I could potentially get a stronghold for my knight on d5. Granted that's looking many many moves into the future, but still. I was also considering to put my bishop on f4 since it puts a halt to e5 ideas, but didn't find a lot of value there. The d6 pawn is rock solid. I also could have put it on e3 but felt that wasn't ambitious enough."
12,h6,h7h6,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppb1/3p1npp/6B1/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 7,"The idea is to chase away my bishop, but this move weakens his structure considerably and is the start of me slowly building towards a decisive attack."
13,Bh4,g5h4,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppb1/3p1npp/8/2PPP2B/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 1 7,"Retreating the bishop and provoking him to play g5, seriously weakening his position."
14,c6,c7c6,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppb1/2pp1npp/8/2PPP2B/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 8,Creating another diagonal for his queen and supporting an eventual b5 push. He won't play d5 since it doesn't actually accomplish a lot so I was sure that his plan was b5. I wasn't too afraid of it since him trading on c4 could create an interesting home for my light squared bishop.
15,Be2,f1e2,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppb1/2pp1npp/8/2PPP2B/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 1 8,Another prep move for b5. He really seeks counterplay via the queenside of the board. I still wasn't terribly concerned.
16,a6,a7a6,rnbq1rk1/1p2ppb1/p1pp1npp/8/2PPP2B/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 9,Another prep move for b5. He really seeks counterplay via the queenside of the board. I still wasn't terribly concerned.
17,Qd2,d1d2,rnbq1rk1/1p2ppb1/p1pp1npp/8/2PPP2B/2N2N2/PP1QBPPP/R3K2R b KQ - 1 9,"This move took me a surprising long time to make. The idea is very simple, but I had to look into the entire b5 affair.The idea is to capture the knight on f6. He loses a pawn if he recaptures with the bishop so he'll recapture with the f-pawn. It creates a nice open e-file for black, but his bishop is temporarily rather bad and the doubled pawns don't help a lot in defending his position. The open e-file can also serve as a way to get my own pieces into the attack."
18,b5,b7b5,rnbq1rk1/4ppb1/p1pp1npp/1p6/2PPP2B/2N2N2/PP1QBPPP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 10,"The dreaded b5 move, at this point I already had an idea on how I'd handle the situation. I had about an hour and 5 minutes left on my clock ( we started from 1 hour and a half ), he had spent 3 minutes."
19,Bxf6,h4f6,rnbq1rk1/4ppb1/p1pp1Bpp/1p6/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP1QBPPP/R3K2R b KQ - 0 10,"Creating doubled pawns, since he'd lose a pawn otherwise."
20,exf6,e7f6,rnbq1rk1/5pb1/p1pp1ppp/1p6/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP1QBPPP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 11,"Creating doubled pawns, since he'd lose a pawn otherwise."
21,a3,a2a3,rnbq1rk1/5pb1/p1pp1ppp/1p6/2PPP3/P1N2N2/1P1QBPPP/R3K2R b KQ - 0 11,"Preventing b4 before he gets that idea in his head. Maybe I should have castled instead, inviting b4 so I'd have a reason to play Nd1 -> Ne3, but I felt like there might be better things in the position rather then castling. Let's asses the position for a second. My control over the center is arguably better, he got doubled pawns and his pieces are still stuck on the 8th rank. On the other hand he got a nice open e-file and some questionable counterplay on the queenside. f5 is also coming after which the position becomes quite a bit more complicated and sadly all those complications are mine to calculate. I have about 55 minutes left on my clock."
22,f5,f6f5,rnbq1rk1/5pb1/p1pp2pp/1p3p2/2PPP3/P1N2N2/1P1QBPPP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 12,"Let the complications start! The difficulty of this position is that if I allow bxc4 or fxe4 I lose material. Let's say I play a hypothetical 12. h3 bxc4 13. Bxc4 fxe4 and I can't recapture with the knight because of d5! forking bishop and knight. At this point I start calculating every possible way of capturing and if I can get away somehow with leaving the position as is. The conclusion I come to is that I can't  ignore it. Now I need to make a decision on whether I capture on b5 or on f5. There's also the issue of Re8 that's coming, pinning my bishop and king."
23,cxb5,c4b5,rnbq1rk1/5pb1/p1pp2pp/1P3p2/3PP3/P1N2N2/1P1QBPPP/R3K2R b KQ - 0 12,"This variation seemed the best result for White. Now there are 3 possible moves for black. axb5 which activates his rook, but makes his c6 pawn very vulnerable. cxb5 which isn't bad, but I could get a pawn on d5 and create a strong square for my knight on c6 or I could maybe get my bishop on f3, push e5. and then threaten to win material. The other option is fxe4 and it's the variation I was most worried about. fxe4 Nxe4 and with Bf5 he gets his bishop active again. That or he could play Re8 and threaten my knight. Either way my response will be the same."
24,axb5,a6b5,rnbq1rk1/5pb1/2pp2pp/1p3p2/3PP3/P1N2N2/1P1QBPPP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 13,"Winning back the pawn, but his knight will have issues developing to a good square. and his c6 pawn is rather weak."
25,exf5,e4f5,rnbq1rk1/5pb1/2pp2pp/1p3P2/3P4/P1N2N2/1P1QBPPP/R3K2R b KQ - 0 13,I am okay with him moving his bishop to f5. I have ideas after Bxf5 to play d5. If he trades cxd5 I can capture on b5 first and his doubled pawns in the center will become an easy target.
26,b4,b5b4,rnbq1rk1/5pb1/2pp2pp/5P2/1p1P4/P1N2N2/1P1QBPPP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 14,"Not the response I was expecting, but it's definitely more challenging then the ideas I had in mind. I can't take axb4 since Rxa1 follows. I don't have the time to castle either because of bcx3. I start looking for ideas along the lines of 13. fxg6 bxc3 14. gxf7+ Rxf7 15. Qxc3, but came to the conclusion that his now weakened kingposition wasn't worth the knight on c3. I also had some concerns still about Re8 that can come at any moment, but it's then that I noticed that if my knight was on g3 then it'd also defend my bishop on e2 and as a result I don't need to fear Re8 since I'd have enough time to castle out of the pin."
27,Ne4,c3e4,rnbq1rk1/5pb1/2pp2pp/5P2/1p1PN3/P4N2/1P1QBPPP/R3K2R b KQ - 1 14,"Defending the bishop on e2 and threatening to create yet another weakness in his position with Nxf5.  At this point in time I had about half an hour left, my opponent had 1 hour and 16 minutes left. With the additional 30 minutes still nowhere in sight I became a little bit frightened, but I knew my position should be winning."
28,Bxf5,c8f5,rn1q1rk1/5pb1/2pp2pp/5b2/1p1PN3/P4N2/1P1QBPPP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 15,"Defending the bishop on e2 and threatening to create yet another weakness in his position with Nxf5.

30,bxa3,b4a3,rn1q1rk1/5pb1/2pp2pp/5b2/3P4/p4NN1/1P1QBPPP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 16,"I didn't see it coming and most would have just played bxa3 or Rxa3 in an instant here however I  notice that capturing the pawn on h6 comes with check. I know what I want to play here, but still spent quite some time recounting the material over and over again. I may not have a lot of time left, but with a 30 second increment per move I won't run out."
