5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 3,"I have started playing 3 Bc4 exclusively. I don't like 3. Nf3 because we'd be in the database for 15 moves. I'd rather the database be all my games and my opponent's think, ""What have I done?!"""
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/8/2B1Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 4,What I consider as the best response.
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/8/2B1Pp2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 3 4,Don't worry pawn I still need you.
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/2B1Pp2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 4 5,This is unorthodox to say the least. I already started thinking of all the bad things I'm about to do. I like c6 as a move more.
9,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/2B1Pp2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 5 5,"I was once told that, if someone played a Fischer d6 move in the 3. Bc4 lines it's a bad idea, but there are always exceptions. This isn't the exception. Bb4 or Na5 are more accurate."

11,d4,d2d4,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/8/2BPPp2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,I love having the center with no resistance against me. Black must be accepting my reign as king.
12,Nh5,f6h5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np4/7n/2BPPp2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 7,"Protecting the pawn, but what protects you?"
13,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np4/7n/2BPPp2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 2 7,"I think 7. ...g6 was the best move here.and I might go as far as saying this moves a blunder. It looks nice, but the bishop gets scared easy."

15,h3,h2h3,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np4/7n/2BPPpb1/2N2N1P/PPP3P1/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,Run you sniper. You can't fight hand to hand.
16,Bd7,g4d7,r2qkb1r/pppb1ppp/2np4/7n/2BPPp2/2N2N1P/PPP3P1/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 1 9,"e5 or Nd5 was my choices here in my mind. I like this move more just because the N that starts on b1 is never a part of the attack and get's lonely. Seriously though, I have complete control of the center and nothing to deter me from making these moves, so I happily take them."

18,Be7,f8e7,r2qk2r/pppbbppp/2np4/3N3n/2BPPp2/5N1P/PPP3P1/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 3 10,Be6 seemed to be the only move to me here. Not sure why we are avoiding tactics against a KGA. It's asking for trouble.
19,Ng5,f3g5,r2qk2r/pppbbppp/2np4/3N2Nn/2BPPp2/7P/PPP3P1/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 4 10,"Ok so here was my plan with this move. I had decided that I had enough pieces on the kingside, but I needed to take away my opponent's key pieces on the kingside. And here comes the boom."
20,Bxg5,e7g5,r2qk2r/pppb1ppp/2np4/3N2bn/2BPPp2/7P/PPP3P1/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 11,only move.

24,Bxf4,g5f4,r2q1rk1/pppb1ppp/2np4/3N3Q/2BPPb2/7P/PPP3P1/R4RK1 w - - 0 13,"Ok so this is a blunder (not the only move did I trick you?), but I don't blame her for not seeing the attack. It's a pretty cool one. h6, Bh4 Be7 are some of the better moves."
25,Rxf4,f1f4,r2q1rk1/pppb1ppp/2np4/3N3Q/2BPPR2/7P/PPP3P1/R5K1 b - - 0 13,"Just look at this position. Of the 16 middle squares I have pieces in 5 of them, and I technically control all the ones behind my pieces. I could claim I have control of 12 or 13 of the most important squares. That's a big deal folks."
26,h6,h7h6,r2q1rk1/pppb1pp1/2np3p/3N3Q/2BPPR2/7P/PPP3P1/R5K1 w - - 0 14,It didn't matter here my next move was coming no matter what pretty much.
