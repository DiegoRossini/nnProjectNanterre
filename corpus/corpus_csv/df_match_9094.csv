1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Hi everyone!  Hope you have enjoyed looking through Part 1 - I thought I would again try out the black side of the Fried Liver Attack against Ion (interestingly enough the rating differentials are similar here to the ones in the Fried Pt 1 Brandon game) to see if I could improve upon it.  No such luck!  Joanne
