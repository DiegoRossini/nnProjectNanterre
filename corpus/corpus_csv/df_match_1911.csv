9,h3,h2h3,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N4P/PP3PP1/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,It's in the book but not very common.  I think it's a fairly pointless move at this stage as I have not intention of putting either my B or my N on g4 in the near future.
10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N4P/PP3PP1/R1BQKBNR w KQ - 1 6,This is another move I don't come across very often.  It's a nuisance because it hinders my normal plan of ...e5 followed shortly after by ...Ne8 or ...Nd7 or ...Nh5 and then ...f5.  I don't like to try pushing it away immediately as it makes the pawn on h6 a target for White's Q & B.
11,Bg5,c1g5,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/6B1/2PPP3/2N4P/PP3PP1/R2QKBNR b KQ - 2 6,This is another move I don't come across very often.  It's a nuisance because it hinders my normal plan of ...e5 followed shortly after by ...Ne8 or ...Nd7 or ...Nh5 and then ...f5.  I don't like to try pushing it away immediately as it makes the pawn on h6 a target for White's Q & B.
12,c6,c7c6,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2pp1np1/6B1/2PPP3/2N4P/PP3PP1/R2QKBNR w KQ - 0 7,I don't think I've tried this before.  The main purpose was to prevent Nd5 but it also increases the Q's scope on the Q-side.  I think I've usually met Bg5 with ...Qe8 but for some reason I decided against that this time.
13,Nf3,g1f3,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2pp1np1/6B1/2PPP3/2N2N1P/PP3PP1/R2QKB1R b KQ - 1 7,"The standard King's Indian central break, but this time it pins my own N."

17,d5,d4d5,r1bq1rk1/pp1n1pbp/2pp1np1/3Pp1B1/2P1P3/2NB1N1P/PP3PP1/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 9,"Making use of my new hole on the Q-side, but I wasn't sure this was the right square, given that White can quickly oppose it with his rook.  ...Qb6 would have had the virtue of aiming at f2 and b2 simultaneously but I think the b2 pawn would have been fairly poisonous."
18,Qc7,d8c7,r1b2rk1/ppqn1pbp/2pp1np1/3Pp1B1/2P1P3/2NB1N1P/PP3PP1/R2QK2R w KQ - 1 10,"Making use of my new hole on the Q-side, but I wasn't sure this was the right square, given that White can quickly oppose it with his rook.  ...Qb6 would have had the virtue of aiming at f2 and b2 simultaneously but I think the b2 pawn would have been fairly poisonous."
19,Qd2,d1d2,r1b2rk1/ppqn1pbp/2pp1np1/3Pp1B1/2P1P3/2NB1N1P/PP1Q1PP1/R3K2R b KQ - 2 10,White retains the option of castling either side and prepares to attack the fianchettoed bishop.
20,Ne8,f6e8,r1b1nrk1/ppqn1pbp/2pp2p1/3Pp1B1/2P1P3/2NB1N1P/PP1Q1PP1/R3K2R w KQ - 3 11,Pressing on with my plan.
21,Rc1,a1c1,r1b1nrk1/ppqn1pbp/2pp2p1/3Pp1B1/2P1P3/2NB1N1P/PP1Q1PP1/2R1K2R b K - 4 11,Now White is committed to either castling kinside or staying in the middle.
22,f5,f7f5,r1b1nrk1/ppqn2bp/2pp2p1/3PppB1/2P1P3/2NB1N1P/PP1Q1PP1/2R1K2R w K - 0 12,"Now White is in danger of having his B cut off or trapped, so the swap on f5 seems forced."

26,Ndf6,d7f6,r1b1nrk1/ppq3bp/2pp1n2/3PppB1/2P5/2N2N1P/PP1Q1PP1/1BR1K2R w K - 2 14,"This frees up my QB and prepares to take the battle into White's half of the board.  Meanwhile, the other N looks after the weak pawn on d6."

I needed to play this before I developed my QB as the QB would have prevented my Q from getting across to the kingside, where I wanted it."

30,bxc6,b7c6,r1b1nrk1/p4qbp/2pp1n2/4ppB1/2P5/2N2N1P/PP1Q1PP1/1BR2RK1 w - - 0 16,I would have preferred to develop this B to b7 but had to maintain my defence of f5.  My priority at this stage was to connect my rooks but I couldn't do this while I needed to defend d6 with the Ne8.

34,Nh5,f6h5,r3nrk1/p2b1qbp/2pp4/4ppBn/2P4N/1PN4P/P2Q1PP1/1BR2RK1 w - - 3 18,Solely to defend f5.

38,Nc7,e8c7,3r1rk1/p1nb1qbp/2pp3B/4ppQn/2P4N/1PN4P/P4PP1/1BR2RK1 w - - 7 20,"This move looks odd because it takes the N away from the action but it connects my rooks and threatens to counter-attack the Q with ...Ne6.  It isn't needed to defend d6 any more, nor g7, which is defended, albeit awkwardly, by the Nh5 as well as by Q and K."
39,Bxg7,h6g7,3r1rk1/p1nb1qBp/2pp4/4ppQn/2P4N/1PN4P/P4PP1/1BR2RK1 b - - 0 20,Attacking the Nh5 with g4 might have been better.  White never quite brought enough power into his attack.
