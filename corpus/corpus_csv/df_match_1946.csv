4,dxc4,d5c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2pP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Defend pawn curious about the white side of things?  No. develop some minor pieces.

6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/8/2pP4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,Thar she goes. Let the bsb out for early castling.

9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/8/2BP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,"At this point GKDB does not give black a win, and off-book looks even more dangerous. Life in the suburbs? (pushed to either or both flanks)"
10,a6,a7a6,rnbqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p3pn2/8/2BP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"a6 is sometimes called a 'waiting' move, but it makes sense to a weaker player, and the knight is not supposed to post on a or h files without a good reason."
11,O-O,e1g1,rnbqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p3pn2/8/2BP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 6,I do not fancy aggressive pawn movements like b5 - defensive development seems best.

15,Qe2,d1e2,r1bqkb1r/2pn1ppp/pp2pn2/8/P1BP4/4PN2/1P2QPPP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 1 8,"a3 is pressured and pushes the bishop to remain at hand. But the white knight on f3 will need to have support, or move if an exchange here would expose the king."
16,Bb7,c8b7,r2qkb1r/1bpn1ppp/pp2pn2/8/P1BP4/4PN2/1P2QPPP/RNB2RK1 w kq - 2 9,"a3 is pressured and pushes the bishop to remain at hand. But the white knight on f3 will need to have support, or move if an exchange here would expose the king."
