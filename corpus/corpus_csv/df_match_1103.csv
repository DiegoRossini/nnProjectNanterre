1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"My bread and butter. Because of a forfeit in our team I had the white pieces for once. The elo difference between the opponent's board 3 and 4 player was about 10 elo points, so in other words they're more or less the same strenght. The difference between both boards is of course the colour I play with. I wasn't sure before the game started whether or not the forfeit would affect anything, turns out it didn't and thus I was destined to play with the black pieces... until they threw me for a loop hole and suddenly I was playing with the white pieces. Apparently my teamcaptain registered me as the third board player. I complain a lot about my chess club, but them setting me up with the white pieces was really good thinking of our chess captain.  Kudos to him."

That being said, it allows white to decide the way the game will go from here. White can play e4, which could get met with d5 and we'd be playing a french opening. Whatever I wish to play, d5 will be played sooner rather then later, that much I'm confident of."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"I decide to play a sort of waiting move. c4 or e4 were good if not better alternatives, however they give black the choice on how he wants to fight those openings. I'll allow him to get some play in first, see what he wants to do and go from there. Most likely I'll go into a queens gambit though, which is the opening I play in nearly all my games as white."
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,This opening is called the queen gambit. A versatile opening which immediatly questions the center and allows for solid development.

6,dxc4,d5c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/2pP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"The queen gambit accepted. I'll be honest here, I wasn't expecting this. The queen gambit is a gambit which most people just refute since the queen gambit declined lines, allow a variaty of solid positions for black. The QGA at the other hand sometimes leads to wild tactical battles, the reverse of the QGD."
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/2pP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"I could play e3 immediatly or Qa4+ if I really cared that much about the pawn. That being said, theory shows that the pawn on c4 is really difficult to hang on to if white plays it correctly. I don't think I'm amazing at chess, but I'd say I'm good enough to win back the pawn at a later occasion."
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/8/2pP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,"e4 is a choice of preference. I used to play e3, which is a different variation on itself, but found to have more succes with e4. It's slightly more dangerous, but quickly seizes the initiative. Plant a knight on e5, recapture the lost pawn with the bishop, and all kind of sacrifices come to mind. The usual response of black here is either Bb4 or c5. I'm not 100% certain, but I think c5 is better. After that the QGA gets divided into 2 sidelines. The one where white captures on c5 or the one where black captures on d4."

10,h6,h7h6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2pp1/4pn1p/8/2pPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"I don't really like this move. Yes it stops Bg5, however black can always play Be7 defending the knight and then later on chase away the bishop. The fact that c5 or Bb4 wasn't played indicate that my opponent isn't too familiar with this opening."
11,Bf4,c1f4,rnbqkb1r/ppp2pp1/4pn1p/8/2pPPB2/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"I decide to play my bishop on f4 instead, targeting the rather weak c7 pawn. Be3 was also a possiblity, but this feels sligtly stronger. I'm not too scared of g5 since it completely destroys his king side pawn structure. The computer would probably recommend Bxc4 first, but I don't think it matters too much."
12,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2pp1/2n1pn1p/8/2pPPB2/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 7,"This seems okay at first, but it makes things troublesome for black since c5 is no longer a possibility. It's going to be hard after this to make a break and force my center wide open."
13,a3,a2a3,r1bqkb1r/ppp2pp1/2n1pn1p/8/2pPPB2/P1N2N2/1P3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"Preventing Bb4. This might be unnecessary, but I felt like I had a tempo to spare. It makes it so that his bishop can't really go anywhere aside from Be7, which isn't a lot to be scared of. Bb4 and Bc5 aren't an option and Bd3 gets met with e5, forking the knight and the bishop."

19,Ba2,c4a2,r1bqk2r/2p1bpp1/p1n1pn1p/1p6/3PPB2/P1N2N2/BP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 1 10,"I'm not too certain, but I believe it was fisher who liked his bishops like this. I think it's well placed and it protects the c4 square on which he could potentially place his knight. after Nc6->Na5->Nc4."

I start calculating Nd5 ideas, but quickly find that it's not worth it. It took me about 15 minutes to  even realize that e4 was being targeted by the bishop and that ideas like 12. h3 b4 13. axb4 Bb4 are rather annoying since the knight on c3 is the only defending piece of e4. My other knight can't help out either since it'd give away the pawn on d4."
23,Re1,f1e1,r2qk2r/nbp1bpp1/p3pn1p/1p6/3PPB2/P1N2N2/BP3PPP/2RQR1K1 b kq - 5 12,"Fully developed in 12 moves, it's a miracle. To give you an insight on how rare that is for me. If I showed this game to my fellow chess players/tutors they would refuse to believe I was the one playing this game, just because of the developing aspect. That being said, it's time to punish him a bit now that e4 is taken care of."
24,c6,c7c6,r2qk2r/nb2bpp1/p1p1pn1p/1p6/3PPB2/P1N2N2/BP3PPP/2RQR1K1 w kq - 0 13,"This move looks like it completely loses. But believe it or not, but this move is recommended by the computer for reasons I don't understand just yet. The computer probably says this is correct because after 13 moves black somehow equalizes, but we're not magnus carlsen, playing 13 moves correctly is far too much of a stretch at this elo. I guess he didn't want to risk losing it, but it takes both his knight and bishop out of the game. The next few moves will take me a very long time since I was determined to reach a won position before he was able to relocate his pieces."
