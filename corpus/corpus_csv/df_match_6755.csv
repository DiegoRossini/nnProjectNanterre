1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I believe this is the best reply to 1. e4 and because it's so good I have a hard time convincing myself to learn a second defence to 1. e4. The Sicilian is so rich with ideas and the games are very dynamic and full with counter-chances for Black, something you really don't get in other openings. The only other opening I dabble in is the Alekhine, but that's just for blitz purposes."

3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,The open Sicilian. The battleground on which many games have been fought and there is still some discussion on the correctness of White's approach. Some have called this exchange positionally wrong but in practice White has a lot of attacking chances.

The positional line, that was my opponent play and the sharper line, exchanging on f6, after which there are many lines and many ideas for both sides."

24,gxf6,g7f6,r1bqk2r/4np1p/p2p1p2/1p2p3/4P3/N1P5/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 13,"13. c4 is the more brutal way of playing but after 13...Bb7 14. cxb5 Bxe4 15. Qa4 d5 16. bxa6+ Kf8, Black has enough compensation."

26,d5,d6d5,r1bqk2r/4np1p/p4p2/1p1pp3/4P3/N1PB4/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 14,One of the perks of this system is that you can play d5 early and get rid of the weak pawn.
27,Qe2,d1e2,r1bqk2r/4np1p/p4p2/1p1pp3/4P3/N1PB4/PP2QPPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 1 14,"A sensible move, White develops his Queen and overprotects e4. There is another fine point to this move. White is waiting to see what I'm going to do about the King. There are a few positions where an early castle is very perilous."
28,Be6,c8e6,r2qk2r/4np1p/p3bp2/1p1pp3/4P3/N1PB4/PP2QPPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 2 15,"Not particularly spirited, developing on the long diagonal was probably better at this point, but after that the elegance of White's 14th is revealed. White could reply with 15. 0-0-0, now that the Bishop is aimed at the K-side, White places the King on the other flank. However, Black's best move is 14...Ng6 and after 15. g3 d4 16. cxd4 Qxd4 17. Rd1 Qb4+ 18. Qd2 Qxd2+ 19. Rxd2 h5, there is still a tense struggle going on on both sides of the board."
29,Nc2,a3c2,r2qk2r/4np1p/p3bp2/1p1pp3/4P3/2PB4/PPN1QPPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 3 15,The bad Knight is getting recycled and sent to a better spot. White is still in no rush to castle.
30,Qb6,d8b6,r3k2r/4np1p/pq2bp2/1p1pp3/4P3/2PB4/PPN1QPPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 4 16,"The best place for the Queen in this line. This is connected to castling long, since without the dark square Bishop, the K-side is a perilous place."
31,Ne3,c2e3,r3k2r/4np1p/pq2bp2/1p1pp3/4P3/2PBN3/PP2QPPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 5 16,White has regrouped his pieces and is now ready to castle.

33,Qc2,e2c2,2kr3r/4np1p/pq2bp2/1p1pp3/4P3/2PBN3/PPQ2PPP/R3K2R b KQ - 7 17,It looks like White wants to take complete control of e4 and f5. Also the Queen is very well placed for an a4 strike.
34,Rhg8,h8g8,2kr2r1/4np1p/pq2bp2/1p1pp3/4P3/2PBN3/PPQ2PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 8 18,The advantage of doubled pawns are open lines. I activate my Rook and prompt White to castle.
35,O-O,e1g1,2kr2r1/4np1p/pq2bp2/1p1pp3/4P3/2PBN3/PPQ2PPP/R4RK1 b - - 9 18,18. a4 leads to a forced sequence where most of the pieces come off after 18...dxe4 19. Bxe4 f5 20. Nxf5 Nxf5 21. Bxf5 Rxg2 22. axb5 axb5 23. Ra8+ Kc7 24. Rxd8 Kxd8 25. Bxe6 Qxe6 26. Qxh7. White has won a pawn but the ending is about equal.
