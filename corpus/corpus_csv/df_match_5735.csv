I believe Spielmann might classify this as a vacating sacrifice, since the object of a vacating sacrifice is to clear a certain square for a certain piece (the e6 square for the pawn on e5--if Black takes the knight with the pawn on e6).  It could also be classified as a line-clearing sacrifice, since White chose to capture the Knight on d5 with his Queen, thereby keeping his pawn on e6.  

The main points to note are the two White rooks and queen on the d, e, and f files (with no other pieces to obstruct the White rooks from moving freely along his first rank), the advanced pawn on f6, the advanced pawn on e5 ready to move on to e6 if given an opportunity, the unobstructed mobility of the queen, and the knight on d4, which can quickly penetrate into Black's position.  Black's king in the center is always a huge red flag, especially since both Black bishops are still on their original squares!"
