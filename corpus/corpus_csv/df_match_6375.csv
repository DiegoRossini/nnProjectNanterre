1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

I would like to draw your attention to the fact that when you castle kingside, your h and your g columns can become very vulnerable to mating attacks.  Black, who is a Class D player did not sort out his problems with the h column in a timely manner and as a result got Freddied.  This was really sad because Freddy had made a horrible blunder costing him a rook for a pawn.  If Waxwing (John) had done something about the h column then he could well have gone on to the Chessic Upset of the Century!  This game came from the Stonewall project which I am not taking part in but I did see this game and thought it very interesting to annotate.  The game starts with Freddy playing 1. d4."

Nc2+ - and here is the main course, that cadaverous black steed will gobble up Freddy's rook in the corner.  John (Waxwing) was a very happy man at this point.  Now, wouldn't we all be happy with this position against Freddy?  Yup, but before you get that chamfers out of the fridge, just hold your, erm, horses until he either cops Old Matey (preferably) or waves the white flag, then and only then can you go absolutely and utterly besom!"
