1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Mikhail Tal was perhaps the best attacking player of all time. The eighth World Champion was a calculating monster who loved to sacrifice pieces during attacking combinations. The game that follows was played during the 23rd USSR Championship (about four years before he won the title). Living up to his reputation as ""the attacker's attacker"", Tal forces Simagin to move his king 20 times out of 44 total moves! Enjoy:)"

This game was played before a big crowd of people. When Tal played 12. Nxf7, the place erupted. It got so loud in the hall that the arbiter threatened to kick out all of the spectators! Can you imagine being held ""in contempt of court"" at a chess match?"
