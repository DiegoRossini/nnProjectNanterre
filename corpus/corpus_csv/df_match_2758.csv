1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"One of my most unsuccessful openings. Almost all the games in which I chose it led to my defeat -- fortunately, there weren't that many of them. Those I can remember now were with A. Bannik (USSR Championship, Riga 1958) and L. Portisch (at the European Team Championship, Oberhausen 1961). At that point my 'French Career' came to an end, I feel the losses were not accidental. Black, in the French, has to play with great accuracy, and this is a quality I never had a great measure of, neither now nor in my earlier days."

I remember examining the position arising from 13...Nxc5 14.Bd3 Ne4 (the threat was 15.Bxh7+ while 14...Nxd3 lets White have the initiative) 15.Qe1 and I decided that Black would either have to exchange on c3 or weaken his position by 15...f5. In neither case did I like the look of my position. Then, while examining 13...Nxc5, I found myself distracted by the vague idea that capturing the e-pawn must in fact be much stronger. I worked through one variation and came to the conclusion that I would be able to occupy the center with my pawns. I stopped analysing beyond the 20th move, and this very position arose in the game! According to all rules, which I already knew quite well those days, to have a pawn center was a good thing. Now I am inclined to think that I was also influenced by the tournament position - I had made a good start and scored 4.5/5 before this game, so I was even more inclined than usual to an optimistic view of things.

After the game it was established that 13...Nxc5 would have given Black a fine game. The point is that after 14.Bd3 Ne4 15.Qe1 Black has the quiet but strong move 15...Bb7. Since the pawn is taboo - 16.Bxe4 dxe4 17.Qxe4 Ne7 - Black holds the e4 point and can look to the future with confidence. The move I actually played was probably a decisive mistake though it takes White's exemplary play to demonstrate this."
