1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This was a recent short game that I really enjoyed playing.  It starts off with my standard e4.
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Black responds with e6 - the French defence.
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"The Winawer variation.  In this position I think white normally plays 4.e5, and then black responds with 4...c5, exerting some pressure on the centre."
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"The Winawer variation.  In this position I think white normally plays 4.e5, and then black responds with 4...c5, exerting some pressure on the centre."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"The Winawer variation.  In this position I think white normally plays 4.e5, and then black responds with 4...c5, exerting some pressure on the centre."
6,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/1b1PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"The Winawer variation.  In this position I think white normally plays 4.e5, and then black responds with 4...c5, exerting some pressure on the centre."
7,a3,a2a3,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/1b1PP3/P1N5/1PP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"But I am not one for lots of opening theory so I played 4.a3.  This is probably some sort of established line but the idea is to sacrifice the pawn on e4, to exert some pressure on black's kingside."
8,Bxc3+,b4c3,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/P1b5/1PP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,Black captures the knight.
9,bxc3,b2c3,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,I re-capture.
10,dxe4,d5e4,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/3Pp3/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,And now the pawn sac is accepted.
11,Qg4,d1g4,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/3Pp1Q1/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 1 6,Black now has a choice as to which pawn to return.  The one on e4 or the pawn on g6.
12,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/8/3Pp1Q1/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 2 7,Offering the pawn on g6 in return for some piece development but losing the ability to castle kingside.
13,Qxg7,g4g7,rnbqk2r/ppp2pQp/4pn2/8/3Pp3/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 0 7,"This is all pretty standard stuff I think.  In terms of material, both sides are level.  Black is slightly ahead in development but must castle queenside and his pawn on e4 is weak.  A fairly balanced position in my view."
14,Rg8,h8g8,rnbqk1r1/ppp2pQp/4pn2/8/3Pp3/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQq - 1 8,"This is all pretty standard stuff I think.  In terms of material, both sides are level.  Black is slightly ahead in development but must castle queenside and his pawn on e4 is weak.  A fairly balanced position in my view."
15,Qh6,g7h6,rnbqk1r1/ppp2p1p/4pn1Q/8/3Pp3/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQq - 2 8,"This is all pretty standard stuff I think.  In terms of material, both sides are level.  Black is slightly ahead in development but must castle queenside and his pawn on e4 is weak.  A fairly balanced position in my view."

17,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqk1r1/pppn1p1p/4pn1Q/6B1/3Pp3/P1P5/2P2PPP/R3KBNR b KQq - 4 9,A useful pin.
18,b6,b7b6,r1bqk1r1/p1pn1p1p/1p2pn1Q/6B1/3Pp3/P1P5/2P2PPP/R3KBNR w KQq - 0 10,Black is looking to fianchetto his bishop to protect e4 and potentially exert some pressure on g2.  It also assists with castling.
19,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqk1r1/p1pn1p1p/1p2pn1Q/1B4B1/3Pp3/P1P5/2P2PPP/R3K1NR b KQq - 1 10,Threatening the knight on f6.

23,Bxd7+,b5d7,r2qk3/pbpB1p1p/1p2pnr1/6B1/3Pp2Q/P1P5/2P2PPP/R3K1NR b KQq - 0 12,Now black must recapture with his king or face losing the knight on f6.
24,Kxd7,e8d7,r2q4/pbpk1p1p/1p2pnr1/6B1/3Pp2Q/P1P5/2P2PPP/R3K1NR w KQ - 0 13,Now black has a horrible pin and his king is out of position.  Can I exploit this?
25,Ne2,g1e2,r2q4/pbpk1p1p/1p2pnr1/6B1/3Pp2Q/P1P5/2P1NPPP/R3K2R b KQ - 1 13,Catching up on development but threatening Nf4.
