1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Pirc Attack!
 
 
As noted it's actually a defence that focueses around the four black moves: d6 Nf6 g6 and usually Bg7, and on White's side d4 e4 (or in a different order) Nc3. White has a lot of options and kind of controls what will be the style of the game with the following moves (e.g. 4 f4, 4Nf3 4Be3 or 4 g3).

I'm trying to get into this with the book Pirc Alert by Albert and Chernin :)"
2,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Pirc Attack!

3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Natural reaction from White, occupying the centre"
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p1n2/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"develops, attacks e4, most common move here in the Pirc I guess"
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p1n2/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 3,defends e4 the natural way
6,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,preparing to give the dark-squared bishop a home on the long diagonal
7,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/2BPP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 4,uncommon variation?
8,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2BPP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 2 5,"overdefending e4, developing the queen

As noted by Chesscentral there would have been the possibility of:
4 ... Sxe4 5 Sxe4 d4 :) thx for the comment"
9,Qe2,d1e2,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2BPP3/2N5/PPP1QPPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 3 5,"overdefending e4, developing the queen

10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2BPP3/2N5/PPP1QPPP/R1B1K1NR w KQ - 4 6,"maybe developing to Nc6 was attractive here, which also guards the critical point e5?"
11,Nf3,g1f3,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2BPP3/2N2N2/PPP1QPPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 5 6,"developing, preparing to king-side castle"
12,Bg4,c8g4,rn1q1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2BPP1b1/2N2N2/PPP1QPPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 6 7,"pins the knight, attractive for a later Nc6xe4 threat"
13,e5,e4e5,rn1q1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/4P3/2BP2b1/2N2N2/PPP1QPPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 0 7,"cracking up the centre, preparing a deadly king attack ;-)"

16,Ne8,f6e8,rn1qnrk1/ppp1ppbp/6p1/4P3/2B3b1/2N2N2/PPP1QPPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 1 9,"? a bad decision, as the knight has no future here (only c7 which is not free yet). It would have been happier on h5, even it's on the dim.


Comment: My fear was that after Nd7 e6 woud follow. Of course fxe6 would yield Bxe6 Bxe6 Qxe6+. I did not feel that comfortable with that thought... Kh8 would have to follow since white could do Ng5! well... :)"
