1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Vienna game, at first glance this appears to be less aggresive than the more standard Nf3, but the point is that white has not given up the option of f4. black must play actively so as to not to end up in a bad line of the kings gambit."

4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,"this leads to a quiet game after 4.d3, a more exciting game occurs after 3...Nxe4 4.Nxe4 d5"

8,Nxe4,f6e4,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1nP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,now f4 seems like a wasted tempo
9,Nxe4,c3e4,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1NP2/8/PPPP2PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,as good a way as any to keep the material balance.

12,dxc4,d5c4,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/4p3/2p1NP2/8/PPPPQ1PP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 0 7,"much better than capturing the knight, black gains development and the bishop pair for free"
13,Qxc4,e2c4,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/4p3/2Q1NP2/8/PPPP2PP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 0 7,gaining tempo on the exposed white queen
14,Be6,c8e6,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1b3/4p3/2Q1NP2/8/PPPP2PP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 1 8,gaining tempo on the exposed white queen
15,Qc3,c4c3,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1b3/4p3/4NP2/2Q5/PPPP2PP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 2 8,"? allowing black yet another tempo, Qf1 and Qe2 seem to be better and more natural than this"
16,Bb4,f8b4,r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2n1b3/4p3/1b2NP2/2Q5/PPPP2PP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 3 9,"?? now whites position is terrible, black has an endgame with a development advantage, some lovely doubled isolated pawns to aim at and an extra pawn to boot. Now black just has to convert these advantages to the full point"

23,Nf3,g1f3,r3k2r/ppp1bppp/2n1b3/8/4Np2/P2P1N2/1P1P2PP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 2 12,getting the rook on the open file and keeping the king fairly near the centre as he may be needed at the frontline in the near future
24,O-O-O,e8c8,2kr3r/ppp1bppp/2n1b3/8/4Np2/P2P1N2/1P1P2PP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 3 13,getting the rook on the open file and keeping the king fairly near the centre as he may be needed at the frontline in the near future
25,Nf2,e4f2,2kr3r/ppp1bppp/2n1b3/8/5p2/P2P1N2/1P1P1NPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 4 13,defending the horribly weak d pawns.
26,g5,g7g5,2kr3r/ppp1bp1p/2n1b3/6p1/5p2/P2P1N2/1P1P1NPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 0 14,blacks pieces are nicely positioned so black starts to push his kingside pawn majority toward its goal. as a result white will be discouraged from castling kingside so the white king will likely remain in the centre where it will be easily attacked
27,h3,h2h3,2kr3r/ppp1bp1p/2n1b3/6p1/5p2/P2P1N1P/1P1P1NP1/R1B1K2R b KQ - 0 14,else the kingside pawns will crash through with g4 and g3
28,Rhe8,h8e8,2krr3/ppp1bp1p/2n1b3/6p1/5p2/P2P1N1P/1P1P1NP1/R1B1K2R w KQ - 1 15,encouraging white to castle into a pawn storm
29,O-O,e1g1,2krr3/ppp1bp1p/2n1b3/6p1/5p2/P2P1N1P/1P1P1NP1/R1B2RK1 b - - 2 15,white decides the pawnstorm will be easier to weather than the discovered check
30,f5,f7f5,2krr3/ppp1b2p/2n1b3/5pp1/5p2/P2P1N1P/1P1P1NP1/R1B2RK1 w - - 0 16,"in stark contarst to whites d pawns the doubled black f pawns are of great atacking value and will be used to great effect to open the white kings position. This prefectly illustrates the strengths and weaknesses of doubled pawns, here the white pawns are completely immobile and so are very weak as they need to be defended with pieces therefore the white position is very passive. Blacks doubled pawns, on the other hand, are very mobile and are under no pressure from the white pieces and so can be used as a battering ram to smash open the white position"
31,Re1,f1e1,2krr3/ppp1b2p/2n1b3/5pp1/5p2/P2P1N1P/1P1P1NP1/R1B1R1K1 b - - 1 16,attempting to get some counter play by contesting the e file but maybe white should start by trying to develop the queenside
32,Bf6,e7f6,2krr3/ppp4p/2n1bb2/5pp1/5p2/P2P1N1P/1P1P1NP1/R1B1R1K1 w - - 2 17,defending the e6 bishop and making whites queenside development even harder than it already is
33,a4,a3a4,2krr3/ppp4p/2n1bb2/5pp1/P4p2/3P1N1P/1P1P1NP1/R1B1R1K1 b - - 0 17,"? this achieves nothing, white should try Rb1 with b4 and Bb2 to follow"
