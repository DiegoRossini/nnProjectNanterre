2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"1. ... c6! Caro-Kahn! pet-line of former world champion Anatoly Karpov. Seldom seen on today chess play. Most variation rich with solid and close play. But todays theory on Caro-Kahn include the gambit variation is tactically drench your will power. I once play white in a tournament on this line, medium profile tournament in my country where my tp = 2050! something which I'm proud of. My opponent was a veteran (50-60  ). When he play this at that point in time, we have a solid caro-kahn advance with light bishops exchange on g6 (black h pawn on g6). Till then, I was out of knowledge to proceed the attack! End up I lose. From that on, I'm searching for best method to counter Caro-kahn."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/2P1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,I found out that Panov-Botzinnik Attack is more suit my repertoire! But that doesn't mean I did not tap with today theory on gambit or advance open line. ;) I may play it sometimes soon.
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2P1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Exchange all the pawn. To excel in this variation, white need to have knowledge on Isolated Queen Pawn (IQP). My first knowledge on IQP was through queen pawns opening and my former coach teach me some tips on playing it. After years of searching on Caro-kahn reply, panov-botzinnik attack give this structure! great."

8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3P4/8/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,4. ... Nf6!? Usual Qxd5 is too tempi late as queen will be chased around the board. Nf6 is an improvement in sense it develop piece and d5 pawn is nowhere to be save anyway. Kinda of Scandinavian gambit in Center-Counter.
