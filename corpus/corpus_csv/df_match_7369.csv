7,Ng5,f3g5,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p1N1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 5 4,"There are some ways Black can answer to this threat; 4...d5, gaining centre control and blocking the attack on f7; 4...Bc5, the Traxler variation (I was half hoping that my opponent would play that because of the mini-tournament I'm in) and, checking the Database, there's even 4...Nxe4, sacrificing a knight to relieve the pressure (as much as I love sacrifices though, I wouldn't be comfortable with this particular one)"
8,Rg8,h8g8,r1bqkbr1/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p1N1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQq - 6 5,"? Definitely not this move, though. I guess Black only saw Nxf7 when he made this move (though it still loses in the exchange because of 4.Nxf7 Qe7 5.Nd6+)"
9,Bxf7+,c4f7,r1bqkbr1/pppp1Bpp/2n2n2/4p1N1/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQq - 0 5,"and now Black is down three points, with no compensation for the lost material (in fact, he's worse off, with all but the knight undeveloped and his own king hindering the development of his Queen and bishop)"

13,b3,b2b3,r1bq1bn1/ppppk1pp/2n5/4p1N1/4P3/1P6/P1PP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQ - 0 7,I don't know why I didn't take the h-pawn straight away...
14,Ke8,e7e8,r1bqkbn1/pppp2pp/2n5/4p1N1/4P3/1P6/P1PP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 1 8,"but when the knight was threatened, I happily went along with the plan"
15,Nxh7,g5h7,r1bqkbn1/pppp2pN/2n5/4p3/4P3/1P6/P1PP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQ - 0 8,"development, and threatening to regain the lost material with Qh4! (White loses his knight as he has to protect against the mating threat) my next move stops that, but I didn't see Qh4..."
16,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk1n1/pppp2pN/2n5/2b1p3/4P3/1P6/P1PP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 1 9,"development, and threatening to regain the lost material with Qh4! (White loses his knight as he has to protect against the mating threat) my next move stops that, but I didn't see Qh4..."
17,d4,d2d4,r1bqk1n1/pppp2pN/2n5/2b1p3/3PP3/1P6/P1P2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQ - 0 9,"! I saw the chance to attack! Of course, Black has to deal with the threat of the pawn to stop more material from being lost..."
18,Nxd4,c6d4,r1bqk1n1/pppp2pN/8/2b1p3/3nP3/1P6/P1P2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 0 10,"but that gives Black no time to protect himself from the next threat...(I'd say, though, that this was the best capture for Black, threatening a fork should White move his queen)"
19,Qh5+,d1h5,r1bqk1n1/pppp2pN/8/2b1p2Q/3nP3/1P6/P1P2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 1 10,the attack begins!
20,Ke7,e8e7,r1bq2n1/ppppk1pN/8/2b1p2Q/3nP3/1P6/P1P2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 2 11,"my knight also takes part in this attack; Black would have dearly loved to have played Kf8, as it is much safer, but this move is now the only move available thanks to the knight"
21,Bg5+,c1g5,r1bq2n1/ppppk1pN/8/2b1p1BQ/3nP3/1P6/P1P2PPP/RN2K2R b KQ - 3 11,This was the reason for White's d4 earlier on
22,Nf6,g8f6,r1bq4/ppppk1pN/5n2/2b1p1BQ/3nP3/1P6/P1P2PPP/RN2K2R w KQ - 4 12,"forced, if Black wants to preserve his queen"
23,Nxf6,h7f6,r1bq4/ppppk1p1/5N2/2b1p1BQ/3nP3/1P6/P1P2PPP/RN2K2R b KQ - 0 12,"this actually wins another piece, as gxf6 is met with 13.Bxf6+ Kxf6 14.Qh4+, winning the queen. I had actually set up a load of conditional moves for this scenario, but none of them are activated because of..."
24,Nxc2+,d4c2,r1bq4/ppppk1p1/5N2/2b1p1BQ/4P3/1P6/P1n2PPP/RN2K2R w KQ - 0 13,logical now I see it - Black needs to counterattack to have a chance in this game. But White had an interesting counter to this...
25,Ke2,e1e2,r1bq4/ppppk1p1/5N2/2b1p1BQ/4P3/1P6/P1n1KPPP/RN5R b - - 1 13,"but doesn't see it; Kd2 was what I had in mind. I say interesting instead of crushing because after 13...gxf6 [best move now] 14.Bxf6+ Kxf6 15.Qh4+ {the king moves} 16.Qxd8 Nxa1 {the knight moves} 17...Nxb3 axb3, and it's 6 points in the favour of White making it all some sort of crazy trade (which favours White, of course) I think I was just afraid of an attack from the bishop"
26,Kd6,e7d6,r1bq4/pppp2p1/3k1N2/2b1p1BQ/4P3/1P6/P1n1KPPP/RN5R w - - 2 14,Black saves his queen...
27,Rd1+,h1d1,r1bq4/pppp2p1/3k1N2/2b1p1BQ/4P3/1P6/P1n1KPPP/RN1R4 b - - 3 14,but White continues the attack!
28,Nd4+,c2d4,r1bq4/pppp2p1/3k1N2/2b1p1BQ/3nP3/1P6/P3KPPP/RN1R4 w - - 4 15,"?! It gives Black tempo, but it gives up the attack on the rook"
29,Kd3,e2d3,r1bq4/pppp2p1/3k1N2/2b1p1BQ/3nP3/1P1K4/P4PPP/RN1R4 b - - 5 15,Wanting to keep the pressure on Black
