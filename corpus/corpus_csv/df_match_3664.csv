7,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"if no exchange on d4, I would play Bc4 or Nc3"

9,Qxd4,d1d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 5,Centralising my Queen - Now you will note that the black pawns are blocking in all his pieces except the Queen and there has to be pawn movement to open up and develop

12,Ne7,g8e7,r1bqkb1r/pp1pnppp/4p3/8/3QP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 2 7,Stil 1-0 as his knight now blocks the line that was opened for the queen and bishop - but he was scared of e5 - which would chace the knight around....
13,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkb1r/pp1pnppp/4p3/8/2BQP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 3 7,2-0 minor pieces

18,Bb7,c8b7,r2qkb1r/pb1p1ppp/1pn1p3/1N6/2B1P3/4Q3/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 2 10,I wanted to stop Be7 or c5 which would have been nice development for him and- also looking at Nc7 - and this would stop black from castling queen side - while I had the bishop allocated to defence of g7 - there would thus be no castling..... or atleast not without blood loss
19,Qg3,e3g3,r2qkb1r/pb1p1ppp/1pn1p3/1N6/2B1P3/6Q1/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 3 10,I wanted to stop Be7 or c5 which would have been nice development for him and- also looking at Nc7 - and this would stop black from castling queen side - while I had the bishop allocated to defence of g7 - there would thus be no castling..... or atleast not without blood loss

21,Bf4,c1f4,2rqkb1r/pb1p1ppp/1pn1p3/1N6/2B1PB2/6Q1/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQk - 5 11,I wanted to force the issue on c7 which he could not further defend - except with a bad move
22,e5,e6e5,2rqkb1r/pb1p1ppp/1pn5/1N2p3/2B1PB2/6Q1/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQk - 0 12,Going one pawn up - note that untill now white had 3 active minor pieces against a knight that blocked in his bishop and another bishop that has to defend g7
23,Bxe5,f4e5,2rqkb1r/pb1p1ppp/1pn5/1N2B3/2B1P3/6Q1/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQk - 0 12,Going one pawn up - note that untill now white had 3 active minor pieces against a knight that blocked in his bishop and another bishop that has to defend g7

26,Qe7,d8e7,2r1kb1r/pb1pqppp/1p6/1N2Q3/2B1P3/8/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQk - 1 14,"So here we have the windmill!!  Starting with a check and ending in victory!

Note that the King only has D8 & E8 open and as long as I could keep him in check I could clean up around him
black can also never take the white queen as every move forces him from one square to another - keeping him in check

I worked it out to find the best combination"
