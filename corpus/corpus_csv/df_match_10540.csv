Indeed, with black up an entire minor piece and white's pawn structure in shambles, it's natural for black to want to simplify. Nevertheless, the annotation is entirely warranted: black is completely lost in this position, being defenseless against the attack that is to come. (Interestingly, it takes my Crafty engine 1.4 billion nodes and  about twenty minutes to discover that white is far better here. I'm sure someone running Fritz or Rybka on a fast machine will get a quicker result, but this is still surprising given how intuitive the approaching tactics are.)"
