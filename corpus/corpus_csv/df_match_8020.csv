Black's knight seeks to prevent white from playing a pawn to f4 where it would support that advanced e5 pawn. This position bears a little resemblance to Alekhine's Defense, one move delayed with the pawns on c3 and c5. That extra oomph in the center makes this stronger for black than Alekhine's is."
