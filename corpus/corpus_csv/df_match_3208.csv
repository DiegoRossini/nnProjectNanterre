1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Because I know the e4 and d4 open I know the proper response according to what I learned from the 1960's when Fischer and Spassky were at it...
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,I like the Nimzo Attack by you know who. I also like King's Indian Defense.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,The usual for White.
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,I go for the NIMZO ATTACK instead of the King's Indian. Either will do.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,The usual.
6,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"The Nimzo Attack. I learned this as an attack and not a defense. I learned it in the 60's against White. Today they call it a Defense; however, in my days it was an attack."
7,e3,e2e3,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"White is willing to suffer stacked pawns on ""c"" rank for the trade. 
However, my bishop is still attacking and I can develop a pawn to the front to apply extra pressure without mercy."
8,d5,d7d5,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/1bPP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,This does not alleviate the NIMZO ATTACK. It can develop rapidly to complicate White.
9,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/1bPP4/2NBP3/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 5,I want c7 to c5 anyway. It is the NIMZO ATTACK. Nothing here is changing this.
10,c5,c7c5,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/1bPP4/2NBP3/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,Now the Classical NIMZO ATTACK is in operation with my c5.
11,Nge2,g1e2,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/1bPP4/2NBP3/PP2NPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,He is clearing and defending house here; but the NIMZO ATTACK is on schedule.
12,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/4pn2/3p4/1bPp4/2NBP3/PP2NPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,His knight at c3 is useless.
13,exd4,e3d4,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/4pn2/3p4/1bPP4/2NB4/PP2NPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,A forthright pawn trade to diminish the NIMZO ATTACK.
14,dxc4,d5c4,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/4pn2/8/1bpP4/2NB4/PP2NPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,It results in an isolated pawn for white
15,Bxc4,d3c4,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/4pn2/8/1bBP4/2N5/PP2NPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,He should get his king 0-0'd.
16,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/8/1bBP4/2N5/PP2NPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 1 9,I do mine first.
17,O-O,e1g1,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/8/1bBP4/2N5/PP2NPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 2 9,He follows.
18,Nc6,b8c6,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/8/1bBP4/2N5/PP2NPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 3 10,I am developing whilst seeing I may have to move my knight that just JUMPED out.
19,a3,a2a3,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/8/1bBP4/P1N5/1P2NPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 10,Pressuring my bishop to another place....
20,Bd6,b4d6,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2nbpn2/8/2BP4/P1N5/1P2NPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 11,If he wants to continue pushing my bishop let him do so...
