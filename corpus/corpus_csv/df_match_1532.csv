18,Bxb2,d4b2,r1bq4/pppp1kpp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/4B3/PbP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - - 0 10,"Ok what?  BxR!  BxR!  The rook is worth five (5) points, the bishop a mere three.  The reason is that the rook can cover the entire board, while black's black bishop is blind to the white squares.  In that respect a bishop is worth about half a rook.  We give it 3/5ths the value."

While a knight/bishop exchange usually confers no advantage, black is four points ahead.  EVERY trade improves white's ultimate power.  And this one doubles up white's pawns, even though the black king ends up in discovered check, unless white responds with Qe1 or (probably better) Qc3."

30,Bd7,c8d7,r7/pppb1kpp/2np4/4p1q1/2P1P3/4nP2/P2N1KPP/Q1R5 w - - 4 16,I think I like Be6 better.  Puts pressure on Pc4.  NxPg2 is another.
31,c5,c4c5,r7/pppb1kpp/2np4/2P1p1q1/4P3/4nP2/P2N1KPP/Q1R5 b - - 0 16,?  This does nothing for white.  I prefer RxPc5.
