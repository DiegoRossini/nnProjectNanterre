1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"A little passive, as allowing the pawn to be taken (with, for example, 5. 0-0 Nxe4) offers no advantage after 6. d4 or 6. Rd1. Not a bad move, but I'd prefer 0-0."

11,Bb3,a4b3,r1bqkb1r/2pp1ppp/p1n2n2/1p2p3/4P3/1B1P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"Bc5 is also good, but with white having played d3, I'm thinking that c7-c5 is looking good down the line, working the center and queenside."

In many variations of the Ruy Lopez, black will play Na5, trying to either force the exchange of white's bishop or allowing for the queenside expansion. White's bishop is normally dangerous in the Ruy because it winds up on the b1-h7 diagonal; but white's a3 instead of c3 prevents that."
14,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/2ppbppp/p1n2n2/1p2p3/4P3/PB1P1N2/1PP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 1 8,"So that gives us our plan: castle, protect the pawn on e5, play Na5, play c5. Let's see where that gets us."
15,Nc3,b1c3,r1bq1rk1/2ppbppp/p1n2n2/1p2p3/4P3/PBNP1N2/1PP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 2 8,"0-0 is still good here, but Nc3 is fine as well."

17,h3,h2h3,r1bq1rk1/2p1bppp/p1np1n2/1p2p3/4P3/PBNP1N1P/1PP2PP1/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 9,"I didn't expect him to be afraid of Bg4, which is reasonable, I suppose, but now I get to execute my Na5, c5 plan *and* his king is still in the center."

21,b4,b2b4,r1bq1rk1/4bppp/p2p1n2/npp1p3/1P2P3/P1NP1N1P/B1P2PP1/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 11,"A reasonable move, fighting back on the queenside and preventing b4, although I had no intention of playing b4."

23,Be3,c1e3,r1bq1rk1/4bppp/p1np1n2/1pp1p3/1P2P3/P1NPBN1P/B1P2PP1/R2QK2R b KQ - 2 12,"Interesting. White decides to allow black to win the b4 pawn (13... cxb4 and if 14. axb4, Nxb4 is good for black). 12. Nd5 was the way to contest it."
24,Bb7,c8b7,r2q1rk1/1b2bppp/p1np1n2/1pp1p3/1P2P3/P1NPBN1P/B1P2PP1/R2QK2R w KQ - 3 13,"And I miss it, of course. This isn't necessarily the best square for the bishop, even, as d7 also offers promise."
25,O-O,e1g1,r2q1rk1/1b2bppp/p1np1n2/1pp1p3/1P2P3/P1NPBN1P/B1P2PP1/R2Q1RK1 b - - 4 13,Again offering the b4 pawn; Nd5 once again would have protected it.
26,Nd4,c6d4,r2q1rk1/1b2bppp/p2p1n2/1pp1p3/1P1nP3/P1NPBN1P/B1P2PP1/R2Q1RK1 w - - 5 14,"...and I miss it again. cxb4 was still better, although this creates a lot of tension in the center, and the knight cannot be taken without consequences."
27,Bxd4,e3d4,r2q1rk1/1b2bppp/p2p1n2/1pp1p3/1P1BP3/P1NP1N1P/B1P2PP1/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 14,"Not as bad as 14. Nxd4 exd4, and white loses a piece, but Bxd4 gives black a very strong presence on d4."
28,cxd4,c5d4,r2q1rk1/1b2bppp/p2p1n2/1p2p3/1P1pP3/P1NP1N1P/B1P2PP1/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 15,"A better capture than exd4, as this half-opens up the c-file for the rook."
29,Ne2,c3e2,r2q1rk1/1b2bppp/p2p1n2/1p2p3/1P1pP3/P2P1N1P/B1P1NPP1/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 15,Pretty much the only move in town; Nd5 and Nb1 accomplish nothing good for white.
30,Re8,f8e8,r2qr1k1/1b2bppp/p2p1n2/1p2p3/1P1pP3/P2P1N1P/B1P1NPP1/R2Q1RK1 w - - 2 16,"Qd7 and Rc8 are also worth considering here. Re8 sets up the potential for d5 down the road, a strike for control of the center."
31,Nd2,f3d2,r2qr1k1/1b2bppp/p2p1n2/1p2p3/1P1pP3/P2P3P/B1PNNPP1/R2Q1RK1 b - - 3 16,"Now this is unfortunate; white simply abandons his pressure on the e5 pawn, allowing black to play d5 with no consequence."
32,d5,d6d5,r2qr1k1/1b2bppp/p4n2/1p1pp3/1P1pP3/P2P3P/B1PNNPP1/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 17,"At this point, I'd say black has a nice little advantage. The pressure in the center, the space, and the reach of his pieces are all superior to his white counterpart."
33,f3,f2f3,r2qr1k1/1b2bppp/p4n2/1p1pp3/1P1pP3/P2P1P1P/B1PNN1P1/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 17,"Threatening to half-open the f-file if dxe4, but this has the effect of weakening the dark squares around the white king. If black can find a way to effectively attack them, white could lose his king."
