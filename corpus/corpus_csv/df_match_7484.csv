1,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

After dropping 6 points to Yoshark after conceding yet another unnecessary Low Draw late this afternoon, things worked out fine for The Beginner at 1146 GMT.  One little pawn move and then a few moves later I ended up delivering checkmate!  This victory almost cancelled out the points lost from the Low Draw in the Yoshark game so not such a bad day after all.  This is the Annotations Project Pt. 2  and we take up the action on Move 9 when I elect to play e6."
