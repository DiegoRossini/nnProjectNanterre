1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,The game opens with a novelty for me; the Pirc Defence
2,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,The game opens with a novelty for me; the Pirc Defence
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"A natural move to me, taking control of the centre."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p1n2/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,It's clear from the opening moves that Black is playing hypermodernly. White has more control of the centre but Black will be looking for counterattacking opportunities
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p1n2/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 3,It's clear from the opening moves that Black is playing hypermodernly. White has more control of the centre but Black will be looking for counterattacking opportunities
6,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,It's clear from the opening moves that Black is playing hypermodernly. White has more control of the centre but Black will be looking for counterattacking opportunities
7,Bf4,c1f4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PPB2/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,It's clear from the opening moves that Black is playing hypermodernly. White has more control of the centre but Black will be looking for counterattacking opportunities
8,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PPB2/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 2 5,It's clear from the opening moves that Black is playing hypermodernly. White has more control of the centre but Black will be looking for counterattacking opportunities
9,Qd2,d1d2,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PPB2/2N5/PPPQ1PPP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 3 5,With the idea of a future Bh6 to get rid of the fianchettoed bishop
10,c6,c7c6,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/2pp1np1/8/3PPB2/2N5/PPPQ1PPP/R3KBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"taking it slow, but safe..."
11,O-O-O,e1c1,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/2pp1np1/8/3PPB2/2N5/PPPQ1PPP/2KR1BNR b kq - 1 6,"By the look of it, this may become a case of opposite side castling"
12,Qa5,d8a5,rnb1k2r/pp2ppbp/2pp1np1/q7/3PPB2/2N5/PPPQ1PPP/2KR1BNR w kq - 2 7,"Black makes the first aggressive move of the game. The a2 pawn, of course, is defended, but the c3 knight may end up overloaded e.g. 7...Nxe4! 8.Nxe4 Qxa2 9.[Q move] Qa1+ 10.Kd2 Qxb2 - advantage to Black [an alternate variation to this line is 9.Nc3 Qa1+ 10.Nb1 Be6, and White is feeling the cramp!] I used this trick in another game of mine with successful long-term results"
13,Bd3,f1d3,rnb1k2r/pp2ppbp/2pp1np1/q7/3PPB2/2NB4/PPPQ1PPP/2KR2NR b kq - 3 7,"Stops any idea of Nxe4, but this is also the most logical move for the bishop anyway"
14,Nbd7,b8d7,r1b1k2r/pp1nppbp/2pp1np1/q7/3PPB2/2NB4/PPPQ1PPP/2KR2NR w kq - 4 8,The best place to put the knight - perhaps it will head to b6 later on?
15,Bh6,f4h6,r1b1k2r/pp1nppbp/2pp1npB/q7/3PP3/2NB4/PPPQ1PPP/2KR2NR b kq - 5 8,Now's a good a time as any - time to remove the bishop!
16,Bxh6,g7h6,r1b1k2r/pp1npp1p/2pp1npb/q7/3PP3/2NB4/PPPQ1PPP/2KR2NR w kq - 0 9,"Black could have also castled, and frankly I can't see anything wrong with it. With this move, Black will never be able to castle kingside, and the limited mobility of the c8 bishop will mean that it will take awhile before he can castle queenside as well - a small victory for White."
17,Qxh6,d2h6,r1b1k2r/pp1npp1p/2pp1npQ/q7/3PP3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/2KR2NR b kq - 0 9,"I like this move - not only does it open up a path for the bishop, it also threatens 10...b4!, driving away the only defender of the a2 pawn"
18,b5,b7b5,r1b1k2r/p2npp1p/2pp1npQ/qp6/3PP3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/2KR2NR w kq - 0 10,"I like this move - not only does it open up a path for the bishop, it also threatens 10...b4!, driving away the only defender of the a2 pawn"
19,Kb1,c1b1,r1b1k2r/p2npp1p/2pp1npQ/qp6/3PP3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/1K1R2NR b kq - 1 10,neutralising the threat.
20,Nb6,d7b6,r1b1k2r/p3pp1p/1npp1npQ/qp6/3PP3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/1K1R2NR w kq - 2 11,"Sure enough, the knight comes to b6, only now it doesn't block the advanced b-pawn. Things are actually looking pretty good for me..."
21,e5,e4e5,r1b1k2r/p3pp1p/1npp1npQ/qp2P3/3P4/2NB4/PPP2PPP/1K1R2NR b kq - 0 11,"! and now it's looking even better for White. This is a similar idea to Black's b5 in that it drives away a defender of a pawn - h2. The other defender, the rook, will be dealt with very shortly..."
22,dxe5,d6e5,r1b1k2r/p3pp1p/1np2npQ/qp2p3/3P4/2NB4/PPP2PPP/1K1R2NR w kq - 0 12,White doesn't want doubled pawns (which would also cripple the defence around the king) so he exchanges the knights.
23,dxe5,d4e5,r1b1k2r/p3pp1p/1np2npQ/qp2P3/8/2NB4/PPP2PPP/1K1R2NR b kq - 0 12,White doesn't want doubled pawns (which would also cripple the defence around the king) so he exchanges the knights.

26,Nxd5,b6d5,r1b1k2r/p3pp1p/2p3pQ/qp1nP3/8/3B4/PPP2PPP/1K1R2NR w kq - 0 14,"White can now win a pawn... but he also needs to note the potential pressure that could build up on a2 (the knight can jump to b4) Because of that, it made me think a little about my next move (14.a3 might work...)"
27,Qg7,h6g7,r1b1k2r/p3ppQp/2p3p1/qp1nP3/8/3B4/PPP2PPP/1K1R2NR b kq - 1 14,"In the end, I decided that it was safe to grab the pawn. The rook only has one place to go..."
28,Rf8,h8f8,r1b1kr2/p3ppQp/2p3p1/qp1nP3/8/3B4/PPP2PPP/1K1R2NR w q - 2 15,"...and White gets his pawn. Hopefully, he may be able to use the queen to pressurise Black even more... in fact, he already has an idea of how to do that..."
29,Qxh7,g7h7,r1b1kr2/p3pp1Q/2p3p1/qp1nP3/8/3B4/PPP2PPP/1K1R2NR b q - 0 15,"...and White gets his pawn. Hopefully, he may be able to use the queen to pressurise Black even more... in fact, he already has an idea of how to do that..."
30,Be6,c8e6,r3kr2/p3pp1Q/2p1b1p1/qp1nP3/8/3B4/PPP2PPP/1K1R2NR w q - 1 16,And I guess that Black had not seen it (though this is further pressure on a2)
