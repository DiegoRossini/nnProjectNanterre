1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Mistake here I think on my part. In retrospect I would probably either move f6. The issue with that though is that if they move 4.Bxf7 then I need to take with the king leaving him in a vulnerable position. Any idea on a better play here?

7,Ng5,f3g5,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n4n/4p1N1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 5 4,Again I think 4... f6 would probably have been a better option.

9,d3,d2d3,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np3n/4p1N1/2B1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,Whilst not perfect the knight did the intended job perfectly avoiding me having to move my queen though still vulnerable to 7.Bxf7 forcing the king to move.

27,Bxd4,e3d4,r1bq1bkr/1p4pp/p1pp1p2/8/2nBPP2/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/R4RK1 b - - 0 14,A second fork and this time with a two point gain on offer.

Next turn I can attack the pawn with either the bishop or the queen developing them at the same time. However I've managed to totally miss the fact that c4 is now undefended and has a clear line to my king...

But I could see a potential queen rook dilemma with my white bishop. Innocous move on my part that was hiding the bishop move.
