1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"?! The Latvian Gambit. I have a whole bunch of annotated games in this opening, take a look at them for the main lines. It is generally pretty unsound, but can be strong in blitz if White is not prepared!"
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"?! The Latvian Gambit. I have a whole bunch of annotated games in this opening, take a look at them for the main lines. It is generally pretty unsound, but can be strong in blitz if White is not prepared!"
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"?! The Latvian Gambit. I have a whole bunch of annotated games in this opening, take a look at them for the main lines. It is generally pretty unsound, but can be strong in blitz if White is not prepared!"
4,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"?! The Latvian Gambit. I have a whole bunch of annotated games in this opening, take a look at them for the main lines. It is generally pretty unsound, but can be strong in blitz if White is not prepared!"
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"Too passive for my tastes. Better are 3.Nxe5, 3.exf5, or 3.d4."
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/2n5/4pp2/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,"? Put simply, this move accomplishes nothing. It doesn't make way for development; it doesn't prevent any threats, and it doesn't threaten anything. Much better was 4.d4."
7,h3,h2h3,r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/2n5/4pp2/4P3/2N2N1P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"? Put simply, this move accomplishes nothing. It doesn't make way for development; it doesn't prevent any threats, and it doesn't threaten anything. Much better was 4.d4."
8,Bb4,f8b4,r1bqk1nr/pppp2pp/2n5/4pp2/1b2P3/2N2N1P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,!? Very aggressive. Black cannot win the e-pawn right off since the Bishop is hanging after 6...Nxe4? 7.Bxc6 bxc6 8.Nxb4.
9,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqk1nr/pppp2pp/2n5/1B2pp2/1b2P3/2N2N1P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 5,!? Very aggressive. Black cannot win the e-pawn right off since the Bishop is hanging after 6...Nxe4? 7.Bxc6 bxc6 8.Nxb4.
10,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/pppp2pp/2n2n2/1B2pp2/1b2P3/2N2N1P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 3 6,!? Very aggressive. Black cannot win the e-pawn right off since the Bishop is hanging after 6...Nxe4? 7.Bxc6 bxc6 8.Nxb4.
11,Nd5,c3d5,r1bqk2r/pppp2pp/2n2n2/1B1Npp2/1b2P3/5N1P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 4 6,!? Very aggressive. Black cannot win the e-pawn right off since the Bishop is hanging after 6...Nxe4? 7.Bxc6 bxc6 8.Nxb4.
12,Bc5,b4c5,r1bqk2r/pppp2pp/2n2n2/1BbNpp2/4P3/5N1P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 5 7,Now Black threatens ...Nxe4.
13,Bxc6,b5c6,r1bqk2r/pppp2pp/2B2n2/2bNpp2/4P3/5N1P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,"I don't like this, even though there's nothing obviously wrong with it. White initiates a series of trades that leaves him with only one developed piece and a hanging pawn, all while accelerating Black's development. Better was 7.d3, or even 7.d4."
14,dxc6,d7c6,r1bqk2r/ppp3pp/2p2n2/2bNpp2/4P3/5N1P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"Anticipating 8.Nxf6+ Qxf6, Black is making ready to castle queenside, so this move is preferable to 7...bxc6."
15,Nxf6+,d5f6,r1bqk2r/ppp3pp/2p2N2/2b1pp2/4P3/5N1P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,Black releases the tension in the center in preparation for castling; he must close off the White Bishop's scope. This also foreshadows the massive kingside attack that is Black's signature in this opening.
16,Qxf6,d8f6,r1b1k2r/ppp3pp/2p2q2/2b1pp2/4P3/5N1P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,Black releases the tension in the center in preparation for castling; he must close off the White Bishop's scope. This also foreshadows the massive kingside attack that is Black's signature in this opening.

19,c3,c2c3,r1b1k2r/ppp3pp/2p2q2/2b1p3/4Pp2/2PP1N1P/PP3PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 10,"Developing while subtly preventing 11.d4, since 11...O-O-O would pin, and subsequently win, the d-pawn."
20,Be6,c8e6,r3k2r/ppp3pp/2p1bq2/2b1p3/4Pp2/2PP1N1P/PP3PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 11,"Developing while subtly preventing 11.d4, since 11...O-O-O would pin, and subsequently win, the d-pawn."

22,Bb6,c5b6,r3k2r/ppp3pp/1bp1bq2/4p3/1P2Pp2/2PP1N1P/P4PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 12,"This seems to be intended to prevent 12...c5, but Black is obviously ready to castle here. Developing the Bishop or simply castling were preferable; this just wastes a tempo."

25,Qc2,a4c2,2kr3r/ppp3pp/1bp1bq2/4p3/1P2Pp2/2PP1N1P/P1Q2PP1/R1B1K2R b KQ - 4 13,"With his King safely tucked away, Black begins to march on the White kingside. Black is now completely developed, whereas White still hasn't castled and is at least a move away from being able to (unless he wants to go kingside, but that looks... risky)."
26,g5,g7g5,2kr3r/ppp4p/1bp1bq2/4p1p1/1P2Pp2/2PP1N1P/P1Q2PP1/R1B1K2R w KQ - 0 14,"With his King safely tucked away, Black begins to march on the White kingside.

31,hxg4,h3g4,2kr3r/ppp5/1bp1bq2/4p2p/PP2PpP1/2PP1N2/1BQ2PP1/R3K2R b KQ - 0 16,"I think the immediate 16.Nh2 would be better, to prevent giving Black the h-file uncontested."

The text just needlessly weakens his position by removing the defense of the Rook--so now White's Knight is pinned, as well."
