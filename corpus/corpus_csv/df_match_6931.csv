1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is a fascinating win against one of the leaders of the fast ladder: my 20th game against him.  I'd achieved no wins and only 4 draws previously, so this is rather sweet.  It also represents a success for my Caro-Kann Advance Variation, in which I've been having a theoretical struggle against a number of players recently, few of whom have cooperated as much as my OTB opponent, Nathan Manley."
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Probably the best response to the Advance, though it's counter-intuitive, moving the pawn a second time."

7,dxc5,d4c5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2PpP3/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,As recommended by all the resources.
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/2PpP3/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,Black uses the square vacated by the pawn to attack White's advanced pawn.
9,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/1BPpP3/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 5,"So White pins the knight.  According to Kotronias in his book ""Beating the Caro-Kann"", this was recommended by Boleslavsky.  The game is already assuming a completely different character from the 3...Bf5 variations."
10,e6,e7e6,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/1BPpP3/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,"Black lives with the pin, counter-attacking White's surplus pawn.  The game is already very cut and thrust - and out of Kotronias's book, which only gives 5...Qa5+"
11,Be3,c1e3,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/1BPpP3/8/4B3/PPP2PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 1 6,Both sides develop their pieces according to the tactical demands.
12,Nge7,g8e7,r1bqkb1r/pp2nppp/2n1p3/1BPpP3/8/4B3/PPP2PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 2 7,Both sides develop their pieces according to the tactical demands.

14,Nf5,e7f5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1p3/1BPpPn2/8/4BN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 4 8,Black simultaneously resumes the attack on c5 with an attack on its main defender at e3.  This position is identical with one given in Kotronias's book except that Black hasn't played ...Qa5+ with White responding Nc3.  The game veers sharply into unknown territory hereafter.
15,Qd2,d1d2,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1p3/1BPpPn2/8/4BN2/PPPQ1PPP/RN2K2R b KQkq - 5 8,"Black seizes the opportunity to gain the advantage of the bishop pair, though both his prelates are still at home.  You'll see later how advantageous they are though!"

17,Qxe3,d2e3,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1p3/1BPpP3/8/4QN2/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R b KQkq - 0 9,"A classic disruptive check, forking King and Bishop, while developing Black's own Queen."
18,Qa5+,d8a5,r1b1kb1r/pp3ppp/2n1p3/qBPpP3/8/4QN2/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R w KQkq - 1 10,"A classic disruptive check, forking King and Bishop, while developing Black's own Queen."
19,Nc3,b1c3,r1b1kb1r/pp3ppp/2n1p3/qBPpP3/8/2N1QN2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 2 10,White meets it with a normal developing move.

21,Bxc6+,b5c6,r1b1kb1r/1p3ppp/p1B1p3/q1PpP3/8/2N1QN2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 0 11,White gives up his other Bishop to avoid loss of tempo and hoping that the pawn structure (including an isolated Black a-pawn) will favour the Knights as much as Black's Bishops.

24,Bxc5,f8c5,r1b1k2r/5ppp/p1p1p3/q1bpP3/8/2N1QN2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w kq - 0 13,This move was aimed not so much in expectation of winning any material as inducing a pawn weakness on Black's kingside.
25,Qg5,e3g5,r1b1k2r/5ppp/p1p1p3/q1bpP1Q1/8/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b kq - 1 13,This move was aimed not so much in expectation of winning any material as inducing a pawn weakness on Black's kingside.

The Ra1 was chosen for this purpose rather than the Rf1 because that R had responsibility for defending f2.  White now has to guard against Black preparing and playing ...Ba6, winning the exchange of the immobile Rf1."
