""If I don't find a way to break through and wipe Black out, that lost pawn will come back to haunt me.  In other words, I must attack!""  Well, I have a considerable lead in development, so I harass Black's kingside!  Of course, this is a totally normal move."

Kd3, but I hope he doesn't see it.  Otherwise, I'm slightly better: both players have the bishop pair, I'm slightly ahead in material (+1), and I should be able to trade off pawns.  On the other hand, Black has less pawn islands to defend (3 against 2) and he has a little more space."
