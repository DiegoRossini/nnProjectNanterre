1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Today I try for the first time a Bishop Opening after reading a little about the Boden-Kieseritsky Bishop Opening, which of the various flavors of this opening appeals to my style of play."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Today I try for the first time a Bishop Opening after reading a little about the Boden-Kieseritsky Bishop Opening, which of the various flavors of this opening appeals to my style of play."
3,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,"Today I try for the first time a Bishop Opening after reading a little about the Boden-Kieseritsky Bishop Opening, which of the various flavors of this opening appeals to my style of play."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 3,"Offering the e4 pawn is part of this gambit opening. Interestingly, Hiarcs9 calls this a Petroff, which admittedly it does resemble, but I know it from books as a Boden-Kieseritsky Bishop Opening, and that is my strategical concept."
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,"Offering the e4 pawn is part of this gambit opening. Interestingly, Hiarcs9 calls this a Petroff, which admittedly it does resemble, but I know it from books as a Boden-Kieseritsky Bishop Opening, and that is my strategical concept."
6,Nxe4,f6e4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B1n3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,Continuing the opening by offering an exchange of knights.
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B1n3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,Continuing the opening by offering an exchange of knights.
8,Nxc3,e4c3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B5/2n2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"Last move of this opening AFAIK, where the d pawn captures so to enable lines for the queen and bishop."
9,dxc3,d2c3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B5/2P2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"Last move of this opening AFAIK, where the d pawn captures so to enable lines for the queen and bishop."
10,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B5/2P2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 6,"In a game I reviewed recently the best move suggested was ...f6, but the text move seems reasonable to me because I could not envision a good conclusion to an immediate bishop sacrifice at f7, or any other immediate problems as a result of this move."
11,Qd5,d1d5,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/3Qp3/2B5/2P2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 2 6,!? Playing the gambit with maximum adventure!
12,Qe7,d8e7,r1b1kb1r/ppppqppp/2n5/3Qp3/2B5/2P2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 3 7,"Prevents mate, and is the best move, not (6...Qf6 ?? Bg5 !) losing the queen."
13,O-O,e1g1,r1b1kb1r/ppppqppp/2n5/3Qp3/2B5/2P2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 4 7,"Activates the rook, safeties the king."
14,d6,d7d6,r1b1kb1r/ppp1qppp/2np4/3Qp3/2B5/2P2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 0 8,A good move which activates a bishop which will be used against the queen.
15,a4,a2a4,r1b1kb1r/ppp1qppp/2np4/3Qp3/P1B5/2P2N2/1PP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 0 8,"I presume ...0-0-0, and so push for an attack here. Not so worried about a bishop exchange, and there is a small threat to b7 which can be plied."
16,Be6,c8e6,r3kb1r/ppp1qppp/2npb3/3Qp3/P1B5/2P2N2/1PP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 1 9,"Hiarcs9 considers this postion a little better for black, and maybe so, but the game is not static and fluctuations will change the landscape. So ultimately it will be a matter of the best applied strategy."
17,Qb5,d5b5,r3kb1r/ppp1qppp/2npb3/1Q2p3/P1B5/2P2N2/1PP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 2 9,"?! At best a threat of an attack, but the queen is still tied to the bishop and so no tactics will prevail."
18,O-O-O,e8c8,2kr1b1r/ppp1qppp/2npb3/1Q2p3/P1B5/2P2N2/1PP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 3 10,"?! Seems like BxB is better to remove some building threats. Hiarcs9 offers some alternate suggestions, but none improve the position dramatically."
19,Be2,c4e2,2kr1b1r/ppp1qppp/2npb3/1Q2p3/P7/2P2N2/1PP1BPPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 4 10,Keeping the bishop in play.
20,d5,d6d5,2kr1b1r/ppp1qppp/2n1b3/1Q1pp3/P7/2P2N2/1PP1BPPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 0 11,Taking control of the center and opens a queen line. Enables ...Qc5.
21,a5,a4a5,2kr1b1r/ppp1qppp/2n1b3/PQ1pp3/8/2P2N2/1PP1BPPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 0 11,"!? Continuing with the attacking plan. Not so worried about ...Qc5, can play Qa4 if necessary."
22,Kb8,c8b8,1k1r1b1r/ppp1qppp/2n1b3/PQ1pp3/8/2P2N2/1PP1BPPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 1 12,"?? Giving up tempo, probably due to (12.a6) with threat of mate at b7, but better is (11...a6) which stops the pawn and the immediate mate threat. Hiarcs9 supports my analysis, we both give the same evaluation."
23,a6,a5a6,1k1r1b1r/ppp1qppp/P1n1b3/1Q1pp3/8/2P2N2/1PP1BPPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 0 12,"! Creating a cascade of threats, not all of which will be countered well. I give this move a strong rating because of the potential that is developed by it. Here Hiarcs9 considers the position to shift slightly in favor of white."
24,Bc8,e6c8,1kbr1b1r/ppp1qppp/P1n5/1Q1pp3/8/2P2N2/1PP1BPPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 1 13,"Forced becuase of mate threat, or loss of knight."
25,axb7,a6b7,1kbr1b1r/pPp1qppp/2n5/1Q1pp3/8/2P2N2/1PP1BPPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 0 13,"This seems the best option because it cracks the castle, forces a pin on a piece, keeps black from obtaining a developing move."
