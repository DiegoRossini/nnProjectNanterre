1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,He starts with the usual.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,and I do my usual defence
3,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p1P3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,This is rather unusual. Better to get more pieces out rather than move peice again.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p1P3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,I develop and attack the pawn.
5,f4,f2f4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p1P3/5P2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"He defends, but again another pawn move rather than get his pieces out."
6,d6,d7d6,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/2p1P3/5P2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,I undermine his pawns and prepare to develop my bishop
7,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/2p1P3/5P2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,He protects e5 again.
8,Bg4,c8g4,r2qkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/2p1P3/5Pb1/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,"by pinning his knight, I increase the pressure on e5 and I develop a piece."
9,exd6,e5d6,r2qkbnr/pp2pppp/2nP4/2p5/5Pb1/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,The pressure becomes too much for him. He takes.
10,Qxd6,d8d6,r3kbnr/pp2pppp/2nq4/2p5/5Pb1/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"I take with the queen, as in catalinmf (1587) vs. wotan_spears (1759) (black won in 47)"
11,d3,d2d3,r3kbnr/pp2pppp/2nq4/2p5/5Pb1/3P1N2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,He protects the pawn on f4 which was attacked by my queen.
12,e5,e7e5,r3kbnr/pp3ppp/2nq4/2p1p3/5Pb1/3P1N2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"I open up the centre, as I am ahead in development. I am also following catalinmf (1587) vs. wotan_spears (1759)"
13,Qd2,d1d2,r3kbnr/pp3ppp/2nq4/2p1p3/5Pb1/3P1N2/PPPQ2PP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 1 7,He would be better off following catalinmf (1587) vs. wotan_spears (1759) with 7. fxe5 Nxe5
14,Bxf3,g4f3,r3kbnr/pp3ppp/2nq4/2p1p3/5P2/3P1b2/PPPQ2PP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 8,I take
15,gxf3,g2f3,r3kbnr/pp3ppp/2nq4/2p1p3/5P2/3P1P2/PPPQ3P/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 8,He takes back
16,Nd4,c6d4,r3kbnr/pp3ppp/3q4/2p1p3/3n1P2/3P1P2/PPPQ3P/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 1 9,"This is hard to meet. I am threatening the pawn on f3, but also to take on f4 and he can't take back as I play Nxc2. I think this wins a pawn."
17,Bg2,f1g2,r3kbnr/pp3ppp/3q4/2p1p3/3n1P2/3P1P2/PPPQ2BP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 2 9,So he protects f3

19,Qxf4,d2f4,r3kbnr/pp3ppp/3q4/2p5/3n1Q2/3P1P2/PPP3BP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 10,"and he takes back. Now the question is, should I exchange queens or take on c2 first? I decided it would be best to take on c2 first, as if I exchange queen first, his king can come to d2, and after I take his rook, he moves his knight and he is threatening to take my knight on a1 already. If I take on c2 first I prevent that."
20,Nxc2+,d4c2,r3kbnr/pp3ppp/3q4/2p5/5Q2/3P1P2/PPn3BP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 11,So I take the pawn.
