1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,(*Back one for intro*)Only a GM playing at this level considers this move normal. Most of us patzers try to stake pawns in the center right away......
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 2,"Repaid in kind. It is noted that with the black pieces, RJF tried to castle kingside early, and this move aids that idea, as well as exerting influence in the middle."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,Going for a quick queenside expansion right away. I guess the d and e pawns haven't quite learned to walk yet....
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,And the plan of RJF is obvious. Bishop to g7 and castling are next....no surprise there.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2P5/2N2N2/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,Simple development.
6,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2P5/2N2N2/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,Finally!
7,d4,d2d4,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,Finally!
8,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 1 5,"More developing, getting the dark squared bishop outside a potential pawn chain."
9,Bf4,c1f4,rnbq1rk1/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP1B2/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 2 5,"More developing, getting the dark squared bishop outside a potential pawn chain."
10,d5,d7d5,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3p4/2PP1B2/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 6,RJF finally stakes a claim in the center.
11,Qb3,d1b3,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3p4/2PP1B2/1QN2N2/PP2PPPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 1 6,"I see moves like this when I play stronger players myself. I can only assume the intent is to tie down black's light squared bishop in a protective role, while protecting the c pawn and getting an early line aimed towards black's king."
12,dxc4,d5c4,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/5np1/8/2pP1B2/1QN2N2/PP2PPPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 0 7,I guess this is why I will never break 1600. This move makes little sense to me. Black's Nb8 has just lost a potential home.
13,Qxc4,b3c4,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/5np1/8/2QP1B2/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 0 7,I guess this is why I will never break 1600. This move makes little sense to me. Black's Nb8 has just lost a potential home.
14,c6,c7c6,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2p2np1/8/2QP1B2/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 0 8,I guess this is why I will never break 1600. This move makes little sense to me. Black's Nb8 has just lost a potential home.
15,e4,e2e4,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2p2np1/8/2QPPB2/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 0 8,And it appears that Byrne owns the center.
16,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bq1rk1/pp1nppbp/2p2np1/8/2QPPB2/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 1 9,And now RJF blocks in his light squared bishop. I wonder if he really knows how to play this game;)
17,Rd1,a1d1,r1bq1rk1/pp1nppbp/2p2np1/8/2QPPB2/2N2N2/PP3PPP/3RKB1R b K - 2 9,"Strong....rook to half open file, and protecting the d pawn."
18,Nb6,d7b6,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/1np2np1/8/2QPPB2/2N2N2/PP3PPP/3RKB1R w K - 3 10,And here come the pain....I guess Fischer DOES know a little something about this game!
19,Qc5,c4c5,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/1np2np1/2Q5/3PPB2/2N2N2/PP3PPP/3RKB1R b K - 4 10,I like Qd3 better........
20,Bg4,c8g4,r2q1rk1/pp2ppbp/1np2np1/2Q5/3PPBb1/2N2N2/PP3PPP/3RKB1R w K - 5 11,"Last piece developed, with a nice little pin to boot........."
21,Bg5,f4g5,r2q1rk1/pp2ppbp/1np2np1/2Q3B1/3PP1b1/2N2N2/PP3PPP/3RKB1R b K - 6 11,? Mistake....Be2 was far better as it would break the pin.
22,Na4,b6a4,r2q1rk1/pp2ppbp/2p2np1/2Q3B1/n2PP1b1/2N2N2/PP3PPP/3RKB1R w K - 7 12,!! The white queen now has some serious issues.
23,Qa3,c5a3,r2q1rk1/pp2ppbp/2p2np1/6B1/n2PP1b1/Q1N2N2/PP3PPP/3RKB1R b K - 8 12,! This turns out to be a key move in the game. That knight is righteous and will soon cause serious upheaval in white's defenses.....
24,Nxc3,a4c3,r2q1rk1/pp2ppbp/2p2np1/6B1/3PP1b1/Q1n2N2/PP3PPP/3RKB1R w K - 0 13,! This turns out to be a key move in the game. That knight is righteous and will soon cause serious upheaval in white's defenses.....
25,bxc3,b2c3,r2q1rk1/pp2ppbp/2p2np1/6B1/3PP1b1/Q1P2N2/P4PPP/3RKB1R b K - 0 13,! This turns out to be a key move in the game. That knight is righteous and will soon cause serious upheaval in white's defenses.....
26,Nxe4,f6e4,r2q1rk1/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/6B1/3Pn1b1/Q1P2N2/P4PPP/3RKB1R w K - 0 14,! This turns out to be a key move in the game. That knight is righteous and will soon cause serious upheaval in white's defenses.....
27,Bxe7,g5e7,r2q1rk1/pp2Bpbp/2p3p1/8/3Pn1b1/Q1P2N2/P4PPP/3RKB1R b K - 0 14,Practically forced......
