7,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/p2ppppp/5n2/1ppP2B1/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,"4. Bg5 is a rare line.  Usually the bishop comes out later.  The main line is 4. cxb, a6 when white can choose to take a second pawn or push to b6.  The push is best in my opinion with white gaining the center and finding dynamic play with kingside attacks offsetting black's queenside hold.  In fact, there are many games where black doesn't find an active plan and resorts to defense."
