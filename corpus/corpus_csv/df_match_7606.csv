1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This move is so obscure it doesn't even have a name, at least not one that I could find. The games I could find my database peak at around 2200, so that would explain the lack of popularity. But why is this seemingly natural move ""bad""? White is gaining space on the Q-side and puts the c-pawn out of harm's way. Well here are a few basic reasons why this move is worse than almost anything else, except for putting something en prise. White moves the same pawn a second time, so he loses the first move advantage. He also releases the center tension to his disfavor, since now Black has the straightforward plan of playing e5 and create a weak pawn on c5. There is also the other possibility of play with b6, like I did in the game and that is also just as good, if not better."

If I have the time, I'll annotate another game of mine in which White did exchange and quickly found his position to be lacking in a natural plan of action."

A possible continuation is 8.e3 Ne4 (b3+ doesn't work on account of Bd2) 9.Bd2 Bd7 and the Nb5 is a goner."

I have 2 central Knights, 2 Bishops ready to strike, a Rook on an open file, a large lead in development and a chunk of material to boot. How could White go so wrong so early?"
