1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Black - their team captain, and distracted with a player turning up late - misplays the opening, drop the exchange (rook for bishop), sacs more material for an attack, but careful defence wins the day!"
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,The Indian Defence
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Main line
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,I thought he was heading for a Nimzo-Indian
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,but he heads for a Benoni
6,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,but he heads for a Benoni
7,d5,d4d5,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2pP4/2P5/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,Which I go into.
8,d6,d7d6,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3ppn2/2pP4/2P5/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,A usual move in all Benoni systems.
9,e4,e2e4,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3ppn2/2pP4/2P1P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,I grab the centre.
10,e5,e6e5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3p1n2/2pPp3/2P1P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"And he closes the position up and heads for a Czech Benoni. I don't like this move, as it loses a tempo, but as the position is closed, it doesn't matter too much. It has been played before."
11,g3,g2g3,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3p1n2/2pPp3/2P1P3/2N3P1/PP3P1P/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,"But this is unusual too. I hope to play f2-f4 and to be able to take back with a pawn, should he exchange on f4."
12,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/3p1n2/2pPp3/2P1P3/2N3P1/PP3P1P/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 7,Usual development.
13,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/3p1n2/2pPp3/2P1P3/2N3P1/PP3PBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 2 7,I develop my bishop too.
14,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bqk2r/pp1nbppp/3p1n2/2pPp3/2P1P3/2N3P1/PP3PBP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 3 8,"This is not in my opening databases, although such a natural developing move can hardly be wrong. 0-0 has been played before, as has Bg4, although I think this just loses time to f2-f3."
15,f4,f2f4,r1bqk2r/pp1nbppp/3p1n2/2pPp3/2P1PP2/2N3P1/PP4BP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 8,As according to plan.
16,Qa5,d8a5,r1b1k2r/pp1nbppp/3p1n2/q1pPp3/2P1PP2/2N3P1/PP4BP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 1 9,"This doesn't achieve anything, so 0-0 looks better to me."
17,Bd2,c1d2,r1b1k2r/pp1nbppp/3p1n2/q1pPp3/2P1PP2/2N3P1/PP1B2BP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 2 9,Simply breaking the pin.
18,O-O,e8g8,r1b2rk1/pp1nbppp/3p1n2/q1pPp3/2P1PP2/2N3P1/PP1B2BP/R2QK1NR w KQ - 3 10,Now he castles.
19,f5,f4f5,r1b2rk1/pp1nbppp/3p1n2/q1pPpP2/2P1P3/2N3P1/PP1B2BP/R2QK1NR b KQ - 0 10,"I thought this was great for me, clamping down on the king side. I tend to think he should have exchanged on f4 first, and I was keen to prevent this exchange. Fritz prefers Nf3 though."
20,Qd8,a5d8,r1bq1rk1/pp1nbppp/3p1n2/2pPpP2/2P1P3/2N3P1/PP1B2BP/R2QK1NR w KQ - 1 11,The queen scurries back.
21,g4,g3g4,r1bq1rk1/pp1nbppp/3p1n2/2pPpP2/2P1P1P1/2N5/PP1B2BP/R2QK1NR b KQ - 0 11,I continue with this King side advance. Fritz is still not impressed!
