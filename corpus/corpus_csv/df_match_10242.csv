1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This was the initial position of the tournament - NCO gives 3...Bg4 as the best move here. My opponent has something different in his mind.

6,Nc6,b8c6,r1b1kbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3q4/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,!? A start of a cheapo attack - in which I unforgivingly fall.

9,c4,c2c4,r1b1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/1nPP4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"? This is really a bad move. I have no excuses here - I have to get rid of this kind of ""forcing"" play."
10,Qe4+,d5e4,r1b1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/1nPPq3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,"And black picks up the rook, take white's option to castle and so on. I have noticed that I have lost many games against some weirdo openings - and that tells me I lack understanding in the openings and/or am too confident to claim an advantage. This is something I need to take care of."

13,Kf1,e1f1,r1b1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2PPq3/5N2/PPn1BPPP/RNBQ1K1R b kq - 4 7,And here we are - don't play too (half) fast in the opening!

15,Nc3,b1c3,r1b1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2PPq3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/n1BQ1K1R b kq - 1 8,I might as well play on at least for a couple of moves - If I can develop harassing the queen and pick the cornered knight I just may achieve an almost playable position - an exchange down for some tempi or something.
16,Qc2,e4c2,r1b1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2PP4/2N2N2/PPq1BPPP/n1BQ1K1R w kq - 2 9,Obviously not Qxc2 Nxc2. And keeping the queens on board is essential if I want to succeed in muddying the waters.

18,Bg4,c8g4,r3kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2PP2b1/2N2N2/PPq1BPPP/n1B1QK1R w kq - 4 10,"This knight is heading for b4 - re-gaining the control of the c2-square with tempo, since black has to take care of the threath of Nxc7 . I'm not interested in pawn formations any more, since I figured out that piece activity is the best hope I have here."

20,Bxf3,g4f3,r3kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3N4/2PP4/5b2/PPq1BPPP/n1B1QK1R w kq - 0 11,This maybe isn't too bad but I think it would've been better to continue development. Doubled f-pawns is least of Whites worries here
21,gxf3,g2f3,r3kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3N4/2PP4/5P2/PPq1BP1P/n1B1QK1R b kq - 0 11,Bxf3 Qxc4 defends the c7-pawn.

26,Qh3+,f5h3,2r1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/1NPP4/3B1P1q/PP3P1P/n1B1QK1R w k - 5 14,This seems to be somewhat slow as the knight is not needed here any more - the d3-bishop controls c2. But it is no big mistake since black can now play e6-with tempo.

It seems certain that black should've played Nf6 when he had the time. Maybe at next move would still make the job but here black decides to open the c-file for his rook. This turns out to be not so clever choice."
