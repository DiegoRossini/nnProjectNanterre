1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"With 2.c4, White challenges Black for the center."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"With 2.c4, White challenges Black for the center."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"With 2.c4, White challenges Black for the center."
4,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"With this second move, Black looks to defend the pawn on d5 with c6, so that the pawn on the e-file does not block the way for the light-squared bishop to develop. In the main lines, White looks to dominate through the center, where Black looks to control b4 and make a later push to the e5/c5 squares. The threat of taking on c4 now carries more weight since it can be covered by b5 (which is in turn protected by c6) creating a strong, dynamic queenside pawn mass."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"One of the normal, developing ways to meet the Slav (the other being Nf3 which often transposes with accurate play). The third option is the exchange variation (3.cxd5 cxd5) which often results in a dry game (for pre-arranged draws)."
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,Note: The immediate 4...Bf5 is a mistake due to 5.cxd5 cxd5 6.Qb3 where Black will have great difficulty defending b7. Black can only (reasonably) play Bf5 if he can keep the Queen from b3.
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 4,Note: The immediate 4...Bf5 is a mistake due to 5.cxd5 cxd5 6.Qb3 where Black will have great difficulty defending b7. Black can only (reasonably) play Bf5 if he can keep the Queen from b3.
8,dxc4,d5c4,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/8/2pP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Black has won the pawn, threatening b5 to make the gain permanent and taking the b3-square from the White Queen (making Bf5 possible). While White looks to recapture, Black will complete development. On the downside, White will gain a stronger pawn center. Other common moves include 4...e6 to play the Semi-Slav (an entirely different beast) or the increasingly popular 4...a6 (a solid and flexible subvariation)."
9,a4,a2a4,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/8/P1pP4/2N2N2/1P2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"Not a strong developing move, but by far one of the most common replies (compared to e4/e3) looking to prevent b5. However, b4 becomes a critical weakness that Black will try to leverage."
10,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/5b2/P1pP4/2N2N2/1P2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,Developing the light-squared bishop (Bg4 is also possible) and looking to prevent White from achieving e4. Black can continue with an ...e6 to create a solid pawn chain without trapping the light-squared bishop in.
11,e3,e2e3,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/5b2/P1pP4/2N1PN2/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"White connects the pawns and frees the bishop to recapture the pawn, without commiting to a middlegame strategy, but blocking the dark-squared bishop."
12,e6,e7e6,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/5b2/P1pP4/2N1PN2/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,Creating a modest yet solid pawn center to free the dark-squared bishop to get to b4 if desired. The knight will go to d7 (and the bishop can stay within the triangle) to create a very strong grip over the center.
13,Bxc4,f1c4,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/5b2/P1BP4/2N1PN2/1P3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,A great square for the bishop - pinning the knight and free from threats of the a/c pawns.
14,Bb4,f8b4,rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/5b2/PbBP4/2N1PN2/1P3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 8,A great square for the bishop - pinning the knight and free from threats of the a/c pawns.
15,O-O,e1g1,rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/5b2/PbBP4/2N1PN2/1P3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 2 8,or (O-O). This is pretty much the traditional setup - White has recaptured the pawn and brought his King to safety to begin his plan of e4. White will try to achieve this through either Qe2 of Nh4.
16,Nbd7,b8d7,r2qk2r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/5b2/PbBP4/2N1PN2/1P3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 3 9,or (O-O). This is pretty much the traditional setup - White has recaptured the pawn and brought his King to safety to begin his plan of e4. White will try to achieve this through either Qe2 of Nh4.
17,Qe2,d1e2,r2qk2r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/5b2/PbBP4/2N1PN2/1P2QPPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 4 9,"Black allows the advance, hoping that the central pawns will be targets for counterplay as the center isn't entirely dynamic (d5 is prevented, e5 leaves a hole on d5."
