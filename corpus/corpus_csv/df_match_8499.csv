1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I apologize to my opponent. On 1/17/09 when this game began, my rating was 1274 and our ratings were only 50-60 points apart, which didn't seem too significant. But now our ratings are nearly 700 points apart which is quite significant indeed. It led to a bit of a one-sided match. We played this open challenge game for nearly three months, averaging about 10 moves per month. In the future, I plan to avoid games with time limits of 14-days. I'm playing black and my opponent starts with the Open game so I respond with the Sicilian."
