1,d3,d2d3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/3P4/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!  Another game with Master Freddy with a result which is becoming only too familiar to me.  I must remember the 5 virtues, Patience, Perseverence, Endurance, Humility and Tolerance.   Here is certainly another taste of humility for jstevens1!

I am determined to last as long as possible against Freddy but I am looking out for opportunities to do more than that - even with my limited knowledge, but here I decide to concentrate on building a fortress for Henry and christen it Fort Joblock.  It seems to hold and I think I have everything covered but alas, Freddy made me think again!  He starts of with d3 which is the Mieses Opening.  I get taken out of the db on the 3rd move so everything for me was trial and error - oh well, enough verbage -here we go!"

I now follow up my plan and decide that the queenside is the safest place for Henry to be, after all, although my queenside castling position looks a little draughty Henry is flanked by Glenda, Fou Leblanc and a horsie.  Henry will be as safe as houses over there, especially as it seems that Freddy also intends to castle queenside.  I could take the pawn on g4 but then Freddy will only skewer my knight against the g7 pawn.  So I first play h6 then Bb7 and then castle as planned."
