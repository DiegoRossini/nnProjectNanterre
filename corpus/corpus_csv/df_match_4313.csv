His opponent has an excellent grip on the light squares and has left Black very little room to manoeuvre. There will be a bit more space if a piece is traded. After that; Black has a set-up which indicates that he should aim to play f7-f5.

On the other hand; there appears no particular danger at this point and - when the knight retreats - he will have  made Black's idea of f7-f5 even more problematic.
24,Qh4,d8h4,r1b2rk1/1pp2pbp/p2p2p1/7n/B1PpP1Pq/3P3P/PP2NP2/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 13,"[!] But now there is a problem: Black relies on the weakened king's position and is determined to create counter-play - even at the cost of a piece. I felt that, at worst, I could probably escape with a perpetual check if things did not 'work out'."

Anything else will allow White to play either f2-f4 or f2-f3 and organize a defence involving moves such as Rf2 and Qf1 for example.
28,fxe4,f5e4,r1b2rk1/1pp3bp/p2p2pP/8/B1Ppp2q/3P3P/PP2NP2/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 15,[!] Taking my life in my hands here to some extent - but in fact this is stronger than moving the bishop.

After that, Black now has three attackers [counting his c8 bishop], the white h-pawn is still en prise and there are  potential mating threats against both g2 and h1."
30,Bxh3,c8h3,r4rk1/1pp3bp/p2p2pP/8/B1PpP2q/7b/PP2NP2/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 16,I couldn't think of anything better than to start the threats.
