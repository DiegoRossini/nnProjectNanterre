5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"The French Defence happens to be the only opening I have a book on, and there is a rather nice story behind it. I am a supply teacher - what our American cousins would call a substitute teacher. I go round all sorts of schools and colleges. I was in a staff room, browsing at this book, and someone said that the owner of the book had left, so if I wanted I could have it. At that time my girlfriend lived in London, and  phoned her and mentioned that I had been given a book on The French Defence. The football world cup finals had just started and she said ""Isn't there anything about the French midfield or the French attack?"" She shared by love of football, but not of chess!"
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"The book in question is ""The French Defence"" by Gligoric, Uhlmann, Botvinnik & Karpov, 1975. They comment on black's third move ""The oldest method of play in the French defence has been somewhat neglected of late. Perhaps the reason for this is that black cannot avoid concrete variations which tend to favour White, as practical results have shown. I agree, Bb4 or dxe are probably stronger."

My book devotes a chapter to this. The move I preferred exchanges White's bad bishop which has limited mobility due to the pawns on d4 and e5 in return for Black's good Bishop. White has a slight edge."
