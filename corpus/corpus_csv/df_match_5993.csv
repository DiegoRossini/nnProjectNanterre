1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is the Queen's Fianchetto opening. Such an early fianchetto displays that Black is ready to defend against a big pawn structure in the centre, trying to flank the pawns with his own pieces. Black must be vigilant, so as not to fall victim to any direct attacks on the king, as this game very much illustrates."

Indeed, this checkmate is certainly more aesthetically pleasing than Fool's Mate, even though it's the same idea.
