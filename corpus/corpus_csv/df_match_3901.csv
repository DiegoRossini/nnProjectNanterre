11,Be3,c1e3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p1np1/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"Signals the Yugoslav Attack variation. In this variation of the Dragon, white often aims to play f3 first to prevent any ...Ng4 ideas to trade off the DSB. Then white will play Qd2, O-O-O, and Bh6, removing the vital kingside defender. After all this, he will launch a devastating pawn storm with g4, h4, etc., opening up files to the Black king. However black shall not simply sit back and let this happen, and he wants to play moves such as Nc6 and Bd7 to develop, and then Rc8 (utilizing the half open c-file), move the queen to the queenside and then play b5, looking for counter-play on the opposite flank. This almost certainly leads to very dynamic and fun games, where it can end up being who gets to the king first!"

14,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 1 8,"!? This is a less played move here, as white usually plays either Bc4 or O-O-O. However this is a very playable line, as it often turns out to be very positional and dare I say, drawish. Now I didn't play the Sicilian Dragon variation to look for a draw, and seeing as this was a fun game I decided to try out a newish and controversial move in this line"

Now might I say this line is probably not sound at all, as with good defense White will come out winning once Black's attack fizzles. But this line requires a decent knowledge of the theory that follows, and very natural moves often end up getting rolled over by Black's fast attack."

I have 2 pawns for the piece, as well as a great pawn chain, and I am now ready to exchange off White's dear e3 bishop. Plus development is extremely easy, and soon enough, my attack will hopefully run as a smooth engine."

Surely he didn't think I was going to sacrifice my piece for merely 2 pawns! Here White should have tried 11. Nb3!, which gets out of the powerful a1-h8 diagonal my ""dragon bishop"" is radiating over, and regrouped from there. However, now I get to play a nice tactic which all but seals up the game. See if you can spot it!"

How will I achieve any counterplay now?! Well you see, at this very moment the a1-h8 diagonal isn't quite the most important one, and diverting White to that diagonal allows me to take the one he previously occupied."

One of the great points of this piece sacrifice is the knight on g4 now supports the bishop possibly coming to this diagonal, and in this case it does so in a convincing fashion. With the queen pinned, my win is virtually inevitable."
