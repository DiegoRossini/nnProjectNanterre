1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,The game opens as a Classical Queens Pawn.
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,The game opens as a Classical Queens Pawn.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"I choose an alternative to the standard 2.c4, and this move leans towards a possible QGA position where Nf3 is played, or even a Semi-Slav or Slav is possible."
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"This move steps away from the QG flavored alternatives into a French like position for black, except Nc3 is a full French, and Nf3 differs in that it moves the fight for d5 to a fight for e5, and it provides for rapid short castling."
5,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"It seemed a logical step to achieve castling rapidly, and this move also makes d4 very secure."
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,"I envisioned short castling for black as well, and I considered ...Ne4 which targets d2 and f2, which gave me thoughts for countering this later."
7,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3P4/3BPN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 4,"Besides the obvious clearance for castling, this move begins the fight for ownership of e4, in which I expect a knight to drop. A followup move of either Nc3 or Nd2 is planned."
8,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/3P4/3BPN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 3 5,"Black signals intent to castle, and this move while not aggressive as ...Bb4 does allow black to attain the goal quickly."
9,Nbd2,b1d2,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/3P4/3BPN2/PPPN1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 4 5,"I decided on Nd2 so that the c pawn is free, and this move now provides against ...Ne4."
10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/3P4/3BPN2/PPPN1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 5 6,"Black has done well, now castled the opportunity to develop a strategy is enabled."
11,e4,e3e4,rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/3PP3/3B1N2/PPPN1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 6,"!? I decide to engage black a little early because I have good control of e4 and will be able to gain some reasonable play by pawn exchange, or positionally if the pawn is pushed to e5 where it will knock the knight off of f6. I expect a sequence of exchanges to follow which will open up the position some, and I hope to my favor due to the locked c8 bishop. I intend to use the white squares in an attack kingside, where my active bishop will be able to play a strong part."
12,dxe4,d5e4,rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/8/3Pp3/3B1N2/PPPN1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 7,"The bishop stands reasonably well and targets h7, which can be useful if coordinated with the queen."
13,Nxe4,d2e4,rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/8/3PN3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 7,"The bishop stands reasonably well and targets h7, which can be useful if coordinated with the queen."
14,Nxe4,f6e4,rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4p3/8/3Pn3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 8,"The bishop stands reasonably well and targets h7, which can be useful if coordinated with the queen."
15,Bxe4,d3e4,rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4p3/8/3PB3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 8,"The bishop stands reasonably well and targets h7, which can be useful if coordinated with the queen."
16,Nd7,b8d7,r1bq1rk1/pppnbppp/4p3/8/3PB3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 1 9,"An interesting move where it is possible that black seeks to replace the knight at f6. The move is good because it does not block the c7 pawn, and can present an attack on the bishop, and develops a piece into the arena. A bishop check was also possible, but would seem to yield no encouraging results for black."
17,O-O,e1g1,r1bq1rk1/pppnbppp/4p3/8/3PB3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 2 9,A necessary step before developing a strategy.
18,Nf6,d7f6,r1bq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/8/3PB3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 3 10,I maintain the bishop which has such a nice view of h7.
19,Bd3,e4d3,r1bq1rk1/ppp1bppp/4pn2/8/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 4 10,I maintain the bishop which has such a nice view of h7.
20,Bd7,c8d7,r2q1rk1/pppbbppp/4pn2/8/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 5 11,"Black continues with back rank clearance so the rooks can be tied, and the bishop can be repositioned outside the pawn chain. An alternative could have been to push ...b6 followed by ...Bb7 to put pressure on the castle by way of the knight, and to provide for a future possibility of developing a kingside attack."
21,Ne5,f3e5,r2q1rk1/pppbbppp/4pn2/4N3/3P4/3B4/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 6 11,"I decide to poke a stick in the nest of hornets to see what I can shake loose. The knight is not particularly invulnerable here, but it does apply some good positional control while menacing a bishop."
22,c5,c7c5,r2q1rk1/pp1bbppp/4pn2/2p1N3/3P4/3B4/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 12,"Attacking the defender, typically a good strategy, but the offending knight is not under attack and this allows white to play a positionally developing move."
23,Ng4,e5g4,r2q1rk1/pp1bbppp/4pn2/2p5/3P2N1/3B4/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 12,"!? An attempt to rid myself of the knight that holds h7, a pawn is sacrificed in the attempt."
24,cxd4,c5d4,r2q1rk1/pp1bbppp/4pn2/8/3p2N1/3B4/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 13,"I could have exchanged knights, but decide that I prefer ...Nxg4 as opposed to Nxf6, because it enables the queen access to the b1 diagonal at e4 next move. I move the knight back to e5 to give myself some time to consider some options for positional improvement."
25,Ne5,g4e5,r2q1rk1/pp1bbppp/4pn2/4N3/3p4/3B4/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 13,"I could have exchanged knights, but decide that I prefer ...Nxg4 as opposed to Nxf6, because it enables the queen access to the b1 diagonal at e4 next move. I move the knight back to e5 to give myself some time to consider some options for positional improvement."
26,Bd6,e7d6,r2q1rk1/pp1b1ppp/3bpn2/4N3/3p4/3B4/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 2 14,Black seeks to provoke an exchange of the bad bishop for a good knight.
