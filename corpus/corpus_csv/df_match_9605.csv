37,Kc3,d2c3,1r3rk1/p1p2ppp/4n3/4p1q1/4Q3/1PKP3P/P1P1NPP1/R6R b - - 2 19,At this point Black needs to make a plan. Should he try to win back the pawn? Should he try to exploit White's king position? Should he try to exploit White's queen position? How can he make use of the two semi-open files? Can he make constructive use of the two weak pawns?
38,Rb5,b8b5,5rk1/p1p2ppp/4n3/1r2p1q1/4Q3/1PKP3P/P1P1NPP1/R6R w - - 3 20,The first priority is to develop the rook on f8. 19...Rb5 is okay if Black's plan is to double rooks.

In fact, the pawn doesn't need defending straight away - 22.Qc4 improves the position of the queen whilst also attacking the rook. An alternative was to play Rhf1, not to defend the pawn but to support its advance."

51,Nxd4,e2d4,5rk1/p1p2ppp/8/1r6/3N4/1P1n3P/P4PP1/1K3R1R b - - 0 26,The rook should occupy one of the open files. 26...Rd5 can be followed up by ...Rfd8. The rooks must work in tandem.
