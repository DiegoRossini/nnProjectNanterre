20,b6,b7b6,rnb1k1nr/p1pp1pp1/1pq5/2N5/2BQP1pN/8/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 11,"You know what I really like here?  Bd5.  The black queen and rook are lined up.  What is probably even better is Qe5+.  Nah, Bd5.  PxN, then Qe5+.  If the queen intercedes trade her for the bishop, and you still have QxPc5 as a little bonus.  Though instead of QxPc5, Pg3 to protect that poor knight might be better yet.  I cannot believe that thing is still hanging out there undefended.

The problem with Bd5 is PxN threatens the white queen.  BxQ, PxQ, BxR.  White comes out ahead.  If black moves the queen white still takes the rook."

Here white wants BxPf7+.  Black has Kd8, which is mortal because QxN+ is followed by Qf8 and then QxQ#.  But Ke7 is also horrible, because Nf5+ gives white the black queen.  Actually, Nf8+ drives the king back to d8, where the previous mate plays out.  Game over.  Force mate."

A little patience would have worked wonders--take the pawn first--it is free.  QxPf7+ and the knight could be picked off at white's leisure.  Two pieces and black wouldn't even be able to propose a queen exchange."
