than I realized that there is no place to put the bishop and the Knight in order to move the second rook to that file.
since that plan seems to take quite a while I'll agree that 11. d5 is the best move in that position."

1) 13. Nd2 Rb8 (13.... Nf6 14. Nc4! +-) 14. Nf1 Nf6 15. Bg5 0-0 with an equal position.
2) 13. axb5!! Qxa1 14. Bh6! Nxh6 15. Na3 Qxe1+ 16. Nxe1 0-0 17. b6 and despite the lack of material there is an advantage to white."
