1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

I am playing in a King's Pawn mini-tournament.  The moves e4 and e5 were played out for me.  I ended up facing a King's Gambit and I accepted it.  I managed to retain my pawn plus all the way through.  I tried to attack my opponent but got to a dead end.  In the end I decided to play into a repetition and claim a High Draw."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"2. f4 - this move characterises the King's Gambit.  It is done to lure my pawn away from the centre and build up an attack on the black king.   Yup, Henry must certainly watch for activity on the kingside columns."
