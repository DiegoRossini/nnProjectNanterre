1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I was black in this league game and I am pleased with this game.  Black built a great defence on the queenside and a5 was a move which was integral to black's defence.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,After e4 black went with king's pawn to e5 and is stating his aims immediately!
3,c3,c2c3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,White pushed his pawn to c3.  I believe this is a move in the ponziani opening but white would go with Nf3 and then c3.  An expected move might have been d4 to attack e5 and take the centre for white.
4,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Black decides to go with pawn to f5 attacking the centre pawn himself and not worrying if taken as will block the pawn's route on the f file with Nf6.
5,exf5,e4f5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pP2/8/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,White captures the f5 pawn and the fight is already on for ownership of the centre.
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp2pp/5n2/4pP2/8/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,Black develops his knight with Nf6 and is attacking squares in the centre of the board.
7,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/pppp2pp/5n2/4pP2/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,White pushes his pawn to d4 attacking black's centre pawn on e5 and making a pawn chain.
8,e4,e5e4,rnbqkb1r/pppp2pp/5n2/5P2/3Pp3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,Black pushes his e5 pawn to e4 protected by the knight on f3.
9,Be3,c1e3,rnbqkb1r/pppp2pp/5n2/5P2/3Pp3/2P1B3/PP3PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 5,White decides to prevent the pawn continuing down the e file with Be6.
10,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp3pp/5n2/3p1P2/3Pp3/2P1B3/PP3PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,Black gives his e4 pawn further protection with pawn to d5.
11,Bb5+,f1b5,rnbqkb1r/ppp3pp/5n2/1B1p1P2/3Pp3/2P1B3/PP3PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 1 6,Now white checks black's king with Bb5.
12,c6,c7c6,rnbqkb1r/pp4pp/2p2n2/1B1p1P2/3Pp3/2P1B3/PP3PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 0 7,Blacks pushes a pawn out to c6 to block the attack and has a pawn chain to e4 but has not developed many pieces.
13,Be2,b5e2,rnbqkb1r/pp4pp/2p2n2/3p1P2/3Pp3/2P1B3/PP2BPPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 1 7,White retreats his LB to e7.  At present it looks quite equal on the control of the centre as white has 3 pawns and a piece and black also has 3 pawns and a piece in the centre.
14,a5,a7a5,rnbqkb1r/1p4pp/2p2n2/p2p1P2/3Pp3/2P1B3/PP2BPPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 0 8,"Black pushes a pawn to e5 to give white a problem with accessing the queenside as this pawn is protected by 2 pieces, the queen and the rook."
15,a3,a2a3,rnbqkb1r/1p4pp/2p2n2/p2p1P2/3Pp3/P1P1B3/1P2BPPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 0 8,White obviously doesn't want black to have too much control over the a file and pushes his pawn to a3.
16,Bxf5,c8f5,rn1qkb1r/1p4pp/2p2n2/p2p1b2/3Pp3/P1P1B3/1P2BPPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 0 9,Black decides to capture the pawn at f5 which did not seem to be important to white as he had not protected it.
17,Bh5+,e2h5,rn1qkb1r/1p4pp/2p2n2/p2p1b1B/3Pp3/P1P1B3/1P3PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 1 9,Now white checks black's king again on h5.
18,g6,g7g6,rn1qkb1r/1p5p/2p2np1/p2p1b1B/3Pp3/P1P1B3/1P3PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 0 10,Again black pushes a pawn to g6 to block the check which opens up black's pawns and leaves the king more susceptible to an attack.
19,Be2,h5e2,rn1qkb1r/1p5p/2p2np1/p2p1b2/3Pp3/P1P1B3/1P2BPPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 1 10,White again retreats his LB after it has done its job and it is safe to attack again.
20,Qd7,d8d7,rn2kb1r/1p1q3p/2p2np1/p2p1b2/3Pp3/P1P1B3/1P2BPPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 2 11,Black now pushes his queen to d7.  This joins the LB on the diagonal but perhaps another piece could have been developed before the queen.  This does now leave the a5 pawn to be protected only by the rook.
