1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

So, no doubt you have all been wondering just where Henry and Glenda have got to and had no doubt thought you had seen the back of Old Matey.  Well, it's just that I have been soooo busy lately with my huge games workload which is gradually diminishing and other things.  However, here I am again.  This time, after 3 losses against Davide, I managed to open my account against him with a Low Draw.  I think it is a pretty rare endgame though.  Even though at the end I was a pawn down, I managed to draw it because it was a side pawn and my opponent had the wrong colour bishop.  So how did this happen?  Well, read on ........"
