1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I chose to annotate this game because it shows the strengths of the Botvinnik system of the English (and a weakness of it also).
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"Botvinnik's variation of the English - I like it because Black often tries to play a 'standard Queens Pawn defence strategy. However, obviously there is no target pawn on d4 and e&c4 are supported. The d4 square is a 'hole' admittedly but this is usually adequately covered by pieces (potentially both Knights and the queens bishop) and Black can become quite fixated with it. White also has the option to play flexibly advancing on the queenside, kingside or the centre."
