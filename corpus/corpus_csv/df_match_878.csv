1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The move d5 surprised me a little. It's usually done after e6 or something so that there is a pawn on d5, blocking my g2 bishop. So I took on d5 with pleasure and then my opponent desided to sacrifice a pawn for development."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The move d5 surprised me a little. It's usually done after e6 or something so that there is a pawn on d5, blocking my g2 bishop. So I took on d5 with pleasure and then my opponent desided to sacrifice a pawn for development."

5,dxc6,d5c6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2P5/8/8/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"After the sacrifice is accepted, I couldn't play d4. What we expect now is that my opponent will play e5 at some time. I would play e4 and afterwards I'll have stalled pawn on d3. That's some kind of compensation for his sacrifice."
6,Nxc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/8/8/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"After the sacrifice is accepted, I couldn't play d4. What we expect now is that my opponent will play e5 at some time.

7,f4,f2f4,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/8/5P2/8/PP1PP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,By playing f4 I aim to stop his plan for playing e5 and having a strong center. At the same time I convert into Bird variation. It's idea is to play b3 and Bb2 attacking the square e5. What's even better is that that way I won't have to play with d3-e4 pawn structure.
8,e5,e7e5,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n5/4p3/5P2/8/PP1PP1PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,I thought of that and liked it for the simple reason that I would have 2 center pawn and he none.
9,fxe5,f4e5,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n5/4P3/8/8/PP1PP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,Here its clear that he has one more developed piece. Also his bishops are ready to move.
10,Nxe5,c6e5,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/8/4n3/8/8/PP1PP1PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,Here its clear that he has one more developed piece. Also his bishops are ready to move.
11,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/8/4n3/3P4/8/PP2P1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,I played that instead of e3 cause I hoped that my c1 bishop would be well placed later.
12,Nc6,e5c6,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n5/8/3P4/8/PP2P1PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 7,I played that instead of e3 cause I hoped that my c1 bishop would be well placed later.
13,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n5/8/3P4/5N2/PP2P1PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 7,I played that instead of e3 cause I hoped that my c1 bishop would be well placed later.
14,Bg4,c8g4,r2qkbnr/pp3ppp/2n5/8/3P2b1/5N2/PP2P1PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 3 8,Aiming to take on d4 afterwards.
15,Bg5,c1g5,r2qkbnr/pp3ppp/2n5/6B1/3P2b1/5N2/PP2P1PP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 4 8,The other possible moves were e3 and Be3. 8.e3 was blocking my c1 bishop. Be3 was kinda good but it slows my development and also Bg5 aims at exchanging pieces. I should do that when I have a pawn more.
16,Qa5+,d8a5,r3kbnr/pp3ppp/2n5/q5B1/3P2b1/5N2/PP2P1PP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 5 9,At the same time attacks my g5 bishop. For example if 9. Nc3 Bxf3 10. exf Qxg5.
17,Bd2,g5d2,r3kbnr/pp3ppp/2n5/q7/3P2b1/5N2/PP1BP1PP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 6 9,The other possibility was Qd2. Looks good but I did let it after I saw the following 9. Qd2 Bb4 10. Nc3 Nf6 . Then Ne4 would be inevitable and would do a lot of problems.
18,Bb4,f8b4,r3k1nr/pp3ppp/2n5/q7/1b1P2b1/5N2/PP1BP1PP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 7 10,"Either that or moving his queen again while I was developing. Here, I was almost sure that we will exchange bishops at some point, so I was happy."
19,e3,e2e3,r3k1nr/pp3ppp/2n5/q7/1b1P2b1/4PN2/PP1B2PP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 10,Still needs to be defended.
20,Nf6,g8f6,r3k2r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/q7/1b1P2b1/4PN2/PP1B2PP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 1 11,Guarding the e4 square.
21,Bd3,f1d3,r3k2r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/q7/1b1P2b1/3BPN2/PP1B2PP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 2 11,Guarding the e4 square.
22,O-O,e8g8,r4rk1/pp3ppp/2n2n2/q7/1b1P2b1/3BPN2/PP1B2PP/RN1QK2R w KQ - 3 12,He is fully developed so it's time for hime to come up with a plan to attack.
23,O-O,e1g1,r4rk1/pp3ppp/2n2n2/q7/1b1P2b1/3BPN2/PP1B2PP/RN1Q1RK1 b - - 4 12,He is fully developed so it's time for hime to come up with a plan to attack.
24,Qh5,a5h5,r4rk1/pp3ppp/2n2n2/7q/1b1P2b1/3BPN2/PP1B2PP/RN1Q1RK1 w - - 5 13,I didn't see what is doing that. At first I thought of Bxb4 or Nc3. Both were leading to a good position. Than I saw that I might try to take more material.
25,Qb3,d1b3,r4rk1/pp3ppp/2n2n2/7q/1b1P2b1/1Q1BPN2/PP1B2PP/RN3RK1 b - - 6 13,"It looks a strong move, but I had to calculate like ten moves forward to be sure of that."
26,Bd6,b4d6,r4rk1/pp3ppp/2nb1n2/7q/3P2b1/1Q1BPN2/PP1B2PP/RN3RK1 w - - 7 14,"Qb3 leads to sharp position cause black keep that black square bishop and can even join it in the kingside attack. Other way, such attack was completely pointless. Now the treat is Bxf3 followed by taking on h2. 
Note that I have no way to defend that h2 pawn. If g3, I lose my knight."
27,Qxb7,b3b7,r4rk1/pQ3ppp/2nb1n2/7q/3P2b1/3BPN2/PP1B2PP/RN3RK1 b - - 0 14,So I decide to give up the h2 pawn and take other for it.
28,Bxf3,g4f3,r4rk1/pQ3ppp/2nb1n2/7q/3P4/3BPb2/PP1B2PP/RN3RK1 w - - 0 15,Only move. If 15. gxf Qh2 mate
29,Rxf3,f1f3,r4rk1/pQ3ppp/2nb1n2/7q/3P4/3BPR2/PP1B2PP/RN4K1 b - - 0 15,Only move. If 15. gxf Qh2 mate
30,Qxh2+,h5h2,r4rk1/pQ3ppp/2nb1n2/8/3P4/3BPR2/PP1B2Pq/RN4K1 w - - 0 16,I want you to note that if 16. Kf1 there is 16... Qh1+ 17. Kf2 (17. Ke2 Qxg2+ 18. Rf2 Nxd4+ losing my queen) Ng4+ 18. Ke2 Qxg2 losing my pawn wit a check and my rook afterwards.
31,Kf2,g1f2,r4rk1/pQ3ppp/2nb1n2/8/3P4/3BPR2/PP1B1KPq/RN6 b - - 1 16,I want you to note that if 16. Kf1 there is 16... Qh1+ 17. Kf2 (17. Ke2 Qxg2+ 18. Rf2 Nxd4+ losing my queen) Ng4+ 18. Ke2 Qxg2 losing my pawn wit a check and my rook afterwards.
