2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I read up up another opening called the Anti Borg where white rams the h side pawn up black's throat to obstruct him from castling king side. I thought it might be fun to see if black could do the same.

The knight can't do anything, even though black's position is too clumped, the knight can only take the bishop which as we'll see doesn't do much good."

Even if white castles king side, that pawn would be overextended because black cannot afford to do anything other than get the bishop and the queen out of the bank rank. Black has to castle queen side because a decent pawn push king side will tear his line apart and expose the king."
