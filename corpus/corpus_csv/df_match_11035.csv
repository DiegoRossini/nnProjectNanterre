11,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qkbnr/ppp2pp1/4p2p/8/2BP2b1/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"This is a free development move, not forced by Bb4, though that is the obvious reply to keep the knight pinned."

White has maintained control over the centre of the board, and can dictate the pace of the game from here, provided he executes the correct moves."
