But at that level of the game, I said to myself: come first, I want to draw here and win with white. (actually I lost with white...)"
16,Bd7,c8d7,rn1qk2r/1p1bppbp/p2p1np1/8/3NP3/2NBB2P/PPP2PP1/R2QK2R w KQkq - 1 9,I feel solid here...

22,Nc6,b8c6,r2q1rk1/3bppbp/p1np1npB/1p6/3NP3/2NB3P/PPPQ1PP1/R4RK1 w - - 4 12,So i continue to develop
