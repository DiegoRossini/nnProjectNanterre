1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"1.d4, my favorite first move when playing White."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"So, we have what is called the closed game. Closed games consist of 1.d4 d5, along with lines that transpose into this type of position."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"The most popular move here is 2.c4. It is very aggressive and strong and contends for control of the center. On the other hand, it can lead to the Nimzo Indian Defense, a very solid defense for Black. Thus, I usually avoid 2.c4 in this position. Instead I prefer the Reti Opening, 1.d4 d5 2.Nf3 Nf6 (or whatever Black chooses)."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"Good. You develop towards the center.

In the opening, it is best to move the minor pieces to control the four central squares, d4, d5, e4 & e5. It is not always the case, but usually, he who controls the center, controls the opening!"
5,g3,g2g3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/5NP1/PPP1PP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"In preparation to ""fianchetto"" my LSB. (See comment below). A bishop in this position is frequently very strong, since it is on the long diagonal. In the Reti, (although not in this game) White frequently fianchettoes both bishops."
6,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p1b2/3P4/5NP1/PPP1PP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,Again you make moves to control the center. Good!
7,Bg2,f1g2,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p1b2/3P4/5NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 4,The fianchetto...
8,Nc6,b8c6,r2qkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3p1b2/3P4/5NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 3 5,Knight to the center.
9,O-O,e1g1,r2qkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3p1b2/3P4/5NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 4 5,It is usually good to castle early. The king is less susceptible to attack.
10,e6,e7e6,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/3p1b2/3P4/5NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 6,"Preparing to fianchetto the other bishop, although I never did. Also, this move supports c4."
11,b3,b2b3,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/3p1b2/3P4/1P3NP1/P1P1PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 6,"Preparing to fianchetto the other bishop, although I never did. Also, this move supports c4."
12,Bd6,f8d6,r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2nbpn2/3p1b2/3P4/1P3NP1/P1P1PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 7,"(?!) So, unless it will gain an overwhelming attack, it is not usually good to move the same pieces repeatedly. You would have been better to castle, continuing your development."
13,c4,c2c4,r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2nbpn2/3p1b2/2PP4/1P3NP1/P3PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,"(?!) So, unless it will gain an overwhelming attack, it is not usually good to move the same pieces repeatedly. You would have been better to castle, continuing your development."
14,Nb4,c6b4,r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/3bpn2/3p1b2/1nPP4/1P3NP1/P3PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 8,"(?!) So, unless it will gain an overwhelming attack, it is not usually good to move the same pieces repeatedly. You would have been better to castle, continuing your development."
15,Na3,b1a3,r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/3bpn2/3p1b2/1nPP4/NP3NP1/P3PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 2 8,"Defending c2. The knights are not best on the side of the board, but I plan to bring the knight to c2 after warding off your attack. My knight would have moved twice in the opening, (Na3, then Nc2) also not good, but you have also done the same, (Nc6, then Nb4) so it is not a real loss of development. At this point, we are tied in development. I have 9 development moves, while you only have 7. It is your move. If you choose to castle now, castling counts as 2 development moves giving you 9. This means I am temporarily ahead in development. Nathan, do you know how to count development moves? If not, send me a private message. I will go into more details then."
16,c6,c7c6,r2qk2r/pp3ppp/2pbpn2/3p1b2/1nPP4/NP3NP1/P3PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 9,"(?) I wanted to attack the b4-knight, with the threat of c5(!) forcing the bishop to undefend the knight. But this move allows you to attack my queen, gaining development for you. I could have played Qe1 with the same benefit, without you being able to attack the queen."
17,Qd2,d1d2,r2qk2r/pp3ppp/2pbpn2/3p1b2/1nPP4/NP3NP1/P2QPPBP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 1 9,"(?) I wanted to attack the b4-knight, with the threat of c5(!) forcing the bishop to undefend the knight.

I stated earlier ""So, unless it will gain an overwhelming attack, it is not usually good to move the same pieces repeatedly..."" This is an exception, because in moving this knight twice, you force me to move my queen twice. You advance while I retreat."
19,Qe1,d2e1,r2qk2r/pp3ppp/2pbp3/3p1b2/1nPPn3/NP3NP1/P3PPBP/R1B1QRK1 b kq - 3 10,Where I should have went the last move!
20,Be7,d6e7,r2qk2r/pp2bppp/2p1p3/3p1b2/1nPPn3/NP3NP1/P3PPBP/R1B1QRK1 w kq - 4 11,"Trying to tempt you here. If 11...Bxh4 12.Qxb4 threatening Qxb7 and g3xh4. I also have the threat of Nxf5, messing up your pawn structure."
21,Nh4,f3h4,r2qk2r/pp2bppp/2p1p3/3p1b2/1nPPn2N/NP4P1/P3PPBP/R1B1QRK1 b kq - 5 11,"Trying to tempt you here. If 11...Bxh4 12.Qxb4 threatening Qxb7 and g3xh4. I also have the threat of Nxf5, messing up your pawn structure."

So you did not fall for my intended trap (see note on my last move), but here you open a different can of worms for yourself. I think you would have been better to retreat your bishop to g6. If I play Nxg6 you play h7xg6, opening your h file to attack my king. Then you move your queen and castle queen side. The moves you played allowed me to win a knight for 2 pawns. I later won the pawns back leading to a whole piece lead."
23,c5,c4c5,r3k2r/pp2bppp/1qp1p3/2Pp1b2/1n1Pn2N/NP4P1/P3PPBP/R1B1QRK1 b kq - 0 12,"Now you have the option of playing 12...Qa5 or sacking you knight as you did. With Qa5, I would play 13.Nc2 winning the pinned knight. Playing Nxc5 loses a piece for 2 pawns. On the rare occasion this is okay, if your pawns are well backed up by pieces and are hard to stop. In this case, I had adequate defense to halt the pawns, and as mentioned previously, I won the pawns back anyway."
