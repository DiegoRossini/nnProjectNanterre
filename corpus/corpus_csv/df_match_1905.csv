My opponent played the Sokolsky opening, where white takes space advantage in queenside and allows than the black stays in the center (white can, late, attack that center)."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/1P6/8/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The classical move. Also, black can move 1... Nf6 and 1... d5."

It's time to evaluate the position, white has spacial advantage in the queenside and can fixed the c6 pawn for attack with the pawn's chain. Black had more space in the center and the posibility to attack the kingside in case of short castle (and, more, can take kingside advantage with e4 if white plays d4)."
