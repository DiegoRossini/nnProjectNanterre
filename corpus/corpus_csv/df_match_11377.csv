1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I've decided to annotate this game because it shows a very common mistake made by people in the Italian Opening. It also shows why you should not play the two knights variation(shown in this game) of the Italian Opening, unless you know how to properly play it."

11,d4,d2d4,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/3np1N1/2BP4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,the idea of this move is to open up the Queen for a double attack on the d5 knight.
