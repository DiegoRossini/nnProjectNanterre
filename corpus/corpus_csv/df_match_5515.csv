More promising options would be c3, aiming for either b4 or d4, castling to leave options open, or h3, preventing White's next move."

Often symmetry works out poorly for Black, who is behind by a half-move, but in a position as locked up as this one, it will be hard for White to make any play without taking some risks."

White has inflicted a weakness on the Kingside and has gained space there as well. On the other hand, the Kingside will no longer be a safe space for the White King, so White needs to put some serious thought into the King's future. In the actual game, White delayed figuring out the King's situation so long that it became a real problem."

On the other hand, it leaves behind some problems for White: 1) the Knight was the only White piece who could really take advantage of all those nice squares on the Kingside (f5, h5) and in the center (e3, d5), and 2) White will probably want to castle Queenside, so this weakens the King's future home. 
A different plan would be to play Bg3, so that either Black plays Nxf3+ of his own volition, or you get to play Nh4, threatening both Nxg6 and Nf5."

The Queen needs to develop, the King needs to castle, and there needs to be adequate support for both center pawns. As it is, this move just loses a pawn and hands Black the initiative."

Defending the e-pawn with, say, d5 and Bd3 (Bd3 right away loses the d-pawn) should have been the priority."

At this point, during the next few moves we see a familiar pattern: One player makes a mistake, then the other player, after taking a big advantage, doesn't know what to do with it and drifts aimlessly.
