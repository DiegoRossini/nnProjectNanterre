1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"And I'm playing Tom again.  He's had alot of really solid OTB results recently -- much better than mine, in fact.  I'm not feeling confident enough to experiment with d4 vs him today.  I play *my* game.  e4!"
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Excellent.  We don't get alot of Sicilians, the two of us.  I'm eager to play these because I'm experimenting alot with NM Dana MacKensie's ""Nuke The Sicilian"" variation of the Grand Prix attack.  (1 e4 c5, 2 f4 d5, 3 Nf3 dxe, 4 Ng5 Nf6, 5 Bc4 Bg4, 6 Qxg4!? Nxg4, 7 Bxf7 Kd7, 8 Be6 K to somewhere and Bxg4).  I don't attempt the Kopec system, which he's previously seen out of me because I'm pretty sure that since we've already had an OTB game or two in that system, he'll have sufficient familiarity to bust me."
3,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,The move advocated by none other that the mighty Tal.

5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/4PP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,Per NM Dana Mackensie.
6,dxe4,d5e4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2p5/4pP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,And I might get to play the Nuke line.  Come on... Bg4.
7,Ng5,f3g5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2p3N1/4pP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,And I might get to play the Nuke line.  Come on... Bg4.
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2p3N1/4pP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,And I might get to play the Nuke line.  Come on... Bg4.
