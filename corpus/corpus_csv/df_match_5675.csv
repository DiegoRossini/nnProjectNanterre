Also, I would like to add that this is one of the first tournament games I played after a few months of a chess-break, and already in the one before I had blundered in a winning position. So maybe it has something to do with not enough practise or routine? The time control were 90min+30sec/move."

White is going to start an attack on the kingside, so maybe an immediate 15.g4 with the idea of 16.Ng3, 17.Nf5, and if Bxf5 then gxf would have been stronger? Also I am not quite sure whether Ne3 might have been better, for I could have still played g4. What made me refrain from Ne3 was the Bc1, which to mee looked rather dull, but I know that Ne3 is quite common in Spanish games, and what made me not play g4 was simply that I did not think of it. Does anyone know which one of the mentioned moves would have been the strongest?"

Again I am not sure. I was thinking for quite a long time here, wondering what White wanted to achieve, and it all amounted in either a g-pawn-push, which would have meant I needed to put my knight somewhere else, or a knight on f5. I could, however, not think of any possibility to achieve the latter; 16.Nh4? Nxe4!, and Nf3-h2-f1-e3 takes too long. I could not find anything better and yet to me this move seems somewhat dubious - the white pawn structure gets really messed up. So, are there any suggestions of what White's best options would have been?"
