But don't twist it into something it's not. Black's main goal is getting to the weak square d4, but that is a very long plan that takes time. In the meantime he'll settle for attacking on the kingside."

Also, this showed me, if he played this opening enough to know the d4 spot is my main intention even though I took my only piece on it, off it."
