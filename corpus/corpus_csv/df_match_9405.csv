1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,I'm back after a chess break.  Here is a game I played on the ICC at a 1 minute time control.
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,"The main line Reti, however, this can transpose into the Catalan or after 3. d4 any number of 1. d4 lines."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,"Khalifman and Kramnik both recommend 2. d4 here, as 2...d4 (a reverse Benoni) can be a little uncomfortable if you are not used to it, however, the extra tempo only benefits white."
4,dxc4,d5c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2p5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,Black chooses to abandon the center and maybe try to hold the pawn.
5,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2p1P3/5N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"A little played continuation, which Nigel Davies advocates in his book on the Reti and a continuation that I employ frequently for its shock value.

3. e3 would lead to lines similar to the QGA."
6,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/2p1P3/5N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Trying to hold the pawn with 3...b5 is to weakening after 4. a4 c6; 5. ab cb; 6. b3!

3...Nf6; 4. Bxc4 Nxe4? and white can recover the pawn with a cute little tactic.  Can you figure it out?

The correct move is 3...c5, taking advantage of the dark-squared weakness."
7,Bxc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/2B1P3/5N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,White's position is being readied for a direct assault on the black king.
8,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/8/2B1P3/5N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,Black falls further behind in development.  4...Nf6 was probably better.

12,Ne7,g8e7,rnbqk2r/pp2nppp/2pbp3/8/2BPP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 7,Black's development is a little cramped.

14,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp2nppp/2pbp3/8/2BPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 3 8,"Not a bad move, but in this quick time control, the attack will be very quick."
