5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2pP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"As White, I would have played e4, but this works too (and of course, one move later...)"

14,Nb4,c6b4,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/4p3/1npPP1b1/2N1BN2/PP2BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 6 8,"This ought to be a bad move (you shouldn't move the same piece twice during the opening) but that knight is going to help a bit later. But first, some exchanges!"

Qxd4 loses to 11...Nc2+, then 12...Nxd4, then next move Black castles queenside. This puts White (who has to deal with not being able to castle and a rook on the open d-file) in a bad position"

24,Bc5,f8c5,2kr3r/ppp2ppp/5n2/2b5/1nBqP3/1QN2P2/PP3P1P/R4RK1 w - - 4 13,my original idea here was just to put pressure on the f2 pawn...
