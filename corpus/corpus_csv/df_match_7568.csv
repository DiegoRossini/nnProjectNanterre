** In hindsight and after talking to Freddy this was too early 12. a3 with a couple of moves thrown in and castling around about move 14 after black had gotten his king safe would have led to a very different game (but lets be honest the outcome would have been the same!!)"

I think this comes from playing a player so far above in the ratings is that one (me) doesn't think clearly. 

Anyway just before I was about to click submit I realized I could just..."

Anyway I have 2 options here what I can see:
1. Trade knights; this would leave black with his dark squared bishop but not aid his development & I would gain a pawn. The pawn and knight look as if though they would really cause me a problem going forward.
2. Take the bishop, from what I've read the exchange of knight for the dark squared bishop would be favourable, (although I don't fully understand the deeper reason as to why) but I would lose an active piece and black would left an awkwardly placed knight and passed pawn.

I'm leaning towards the taking the knight... don't know if its correct but I'm sure I'll find out sooner or later."
