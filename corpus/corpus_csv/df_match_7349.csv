1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"If you read this annotation, please give it a mark.  

This is one of those tournament games where I felt that I had to win as Black.  I'd won the equivalent game as White in a Sicilian with 3.Bb5 and was looking for a double but thought that grisha might play the same line back against me.  Alekhine time."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"Always a frustration.  What to play?  2. ... e5?  If you want to play 1. ... e5, play it.  2. ... d6?  Play it at move 1."
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 2,"Always a frustration.  What to play?  2. ... e5?  If you want to play 1. ... e5, play it.  2. ... d6?  Play it at move 1."
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"The only move to give something original, particularly if White plays 3. e5."
5,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"If White's going to play like this, what can you do?"
6,Nxd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3n4/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,And again.  As tense as a Mr Whippy ice cream.

8,Qxd5,d8d5,rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"Oh come on!  What next?  A draw offer?  I think that OTB I'd probably punt for 5. ... c6 because if White exchanges the pawn structure is like an exchange Caro-Kann and I can develop the Bc8 before playing ... e6.  Instead, however, I made the fatal error of looking at the database and went for"

10,Qc5,d5c5,rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/8/2q5/8/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 2 6,Apparently White often plays 6. Qc3 here in a desperate pursuit of a draw.
11,c3,c2c3,rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/8/2q5/8/2P2Q2/PP1P1PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 0 6,White plays the other obvious continuation.
12,e5,e7e5,rnb1kb1r/ppp2ppp/8/2q1p3/8/2P2Q2/PP1P1PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 0 7,I'm never quite sure about playing ... e5 as Black.  I've never played it at move 1 and a lot of my systems are based on either a fianchetto or ... e6.  It always looks a bit loose somehow.
13,d3,d2d3,rnb1kb1r/ppp2ppp/8/2q1p3/8/2PP1Q2/PP3PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 0 7,"I must confess that I didn't see White's 11th, and 0-0-0 would be my choice second time around."
14,Nc6,b8c6,r1b1kb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/2q1p3/8/2PP1Q2/PP3PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 1 8,"I must confess that I didn't see White's 11th, and 0-0-0 would be my choice second time around."
15,Ne2,g1e2,r1b1kb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/2q1p3/8/2PP1Q2/PP2NPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 2 8,"I must confess that I didn't see White's 11th, and 0-0-0 would be my choice second time around."
16,Be6,c8e6,r3kb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1b3/2q1p3/8/2PP1Q2/PP2NPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 3 9,"I must confess that I didn't see White's 11th, and 0-0-0 would be my choice second time around."
17,Ng3,e2g3,r3kb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1b3/2q1p3/8/2PP1QN1/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 4 9,"I must confess that I didn't see White's 11th, and 0-0-0 would be my choice second time around."
18,f6,f7f6,r3kb1r/ppp3pp/2n1bp2/2q1p3/8/2PP1QN1/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 0 10,"?  I think that this was me playing for a win, expecting 10. Be2 0-0-0 11. 0-0 and opposite wing attacks.  I simply didn't see the plan."
19,Ne4,g3e4,r3kb1r/ppp3pp/2n1bp2/2q1p3/4N3/2PP1Q2/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 1 10,With a nominal threat of 11. ... Nd4 or 0-0-0
20,Qa5,c5a5,r3kb1r/ppp3pp/2n1bp2/q3p3/4N3/2PP1Q2/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 2 11,With a nominal threat of 11. ... Nd4 or 0-0-0
21,Nxf6+,e4f6,r3kb1r/ppp3pp/2n1bN2/q3p3/8/2PP1Q2/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 11,I'll give this an ! because it came out of the blue and wins a pawn for nothing.  So much for my plan of 0-0-0.
22,Kd8,e8d8,r2k1b1r/ppp3pp/2n1bN2/q3p3/8/2PP1Q2/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ - 1 12,Forced - 11. ... gxf6 12. Qxf6 wins instantly and this way I can at least get my bishop out.
23,Ne4,f6e4,r2k1b1r/ppp3pp/2n1b3/q3p3/4N3/2PP1Q2/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQ - 2 12,White is a pawn up with a big knight out on e4 and my development's messed up.  Obviously White's opening was a cunning plan.
24,Nd4,c6d4,r2k1b1r/ppp3pp/4b3/q3p3/3nN3/2PP1Q2/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ - 3 13,This at least was my plan at move 10.
25,Qd1,f3d1,r2k1b1r/ppp3pp/4b3/q3p3/3nN3/2PP4/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQ - 4 13,White is forced to undevelop his pieces.  Is there some compensation here for Black?
26,Nf5,d4f5,r2k1b1r/ppp3pp/4b3/q3pn2/4N3/2PP4/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 5 14,"The knight can't really stay where it is because 14. Bd2 will force the issue anyway.  Black's plan has to be to play c6, Kc7, perhaps Be7 and attack on the g- and h-files.  Can't dislodge that knight though, so maybe Nd6 will do the trick."
27,Bd2,c1d2,r2k1b1r/ppp3pp/4b3/q3pn2/4N3/2PP4/PP1B1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 6 14,White continues his development.  Even a pawn up he seems to be adopting the most passive possible piece positioning.
28,c6,c7c6,r2k1b1r/pp4pp/2p1b3/q3pn2/4N3/2PP4/PP1B1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 15,White continues his development.  Even a pawn up he seems to be adopting the most passive possible piece positioning.
29,Be2,f1e2,r2k1b1r/pp4pp/2p1b3/q3pn2/4N3/2PP4/PP1BBPPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 1 15,White continues his development.  Even a pawn up he seems to be adopting the most passive possible piece positioning.
30,h6,h7h6,r2k1b1r/pp4p1/2p1b2p/q3pn2/4N3/2PP4/PP1BBPPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 16,"Designed partly to stop Ng5 or Bg5 and partly to threaten g5 and thus to dissuade him from 0-0, the natural continuation from his previous play."
