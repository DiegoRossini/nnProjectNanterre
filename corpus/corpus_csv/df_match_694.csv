6,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3pP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Surprised! Here I could just take on e5 and then exchange the queens. That would give me some positional advantage due to black not having a castle. 
However, I wanted a deeper game with bigger dominance after a while."

9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/3p4/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,The idea of this move is that after 5... exd4 6. Nxd4 black has an isolated and bacward pawn on d6.
10,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/3p4/4p3/3PP1b1/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,"Now I take, cause the exchange of queens would lead to a pawn mire for me."
11,dxe5,d4e5,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/3p4/4P3/4P1b1/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"Now I take, cause the exchange of queens would lead to a pawn mire for me."
12,Bxf3,g4f3,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/3p4/4P3/4P3/5b2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"This is the only way for black to save their pawn. However, It leads to an open position where I have two bishops."
13,gxf3,g2f3,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/3p4/4P3/4P3/5P2/PP3P1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,I don't decide where my queen would be and also have the idea to play on the g-file.
14,Qa5+,d8a5,rn2kbnr/pp3ppp/3p4/q3P3/4P3/5P2/PP3P1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,"Black wants to save his opportunity for castle, but that just leads to development for me."
15,Bd2,c1d2,rn2kbnr/pp3ppp/3p4/q3P3/4P3/5P2/PP1B1P1P/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 2 8,"A key move. Places my bishop on a big diagonal, while saving my b2 pawn."

18,Qc5,e5c5,rn2kbnr/pp3ppp/3p4/2q5/4P3/2B2P2/PP3P1P/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 2 10,"By attacking on g7, I aim to fix black's pieces and interfere their development. F6 just leads to even slower development, so there is only one move left."

20,Nf6,g8f6,rn2kb1r/pp3ppp/3p1n2/2q5/4P3/2B2P2/PP3P1P/RN1QKBR1 w Qkq - 4 11,"Notice how black couldn't develop his bishop on e7 or after g6 on g7, cause I would take either on g7 or f6."
21,Nd2,b1d2,rn2kb1r/pp3ppp/3p1n2/2q5/4P3/2B2P2/PP1N1P1P/R2QKBR1 b Qkq - 5 11,I treat Bxf6 with tempo.

24,Qb6,c5b6,r3kb1r/pp3ppp/1qnp1n2/8/4P3/2B2P2/PP1N1P1P/2RQKBR1 w kq - 8 13,"Black is underdeveloped, while my pieces are quite positioned. I hadn't decided where to place my f1 bishop. Then it came to my mind that my rook stands good against my opponents queen. I decided to try to open the c file and see what happens."

28,O-O-O,e8c8,2kr1b1r/ppq2ppp/2np1n2/8/1PN1P3/2B2P2/P4P1P/2RQKBR1 w - - 1 15,"Well, it wasn't clear how castle king-side would happen, so that seems to be the thing. However, I think that 14.. a6 needed more attention. Maybe 15. a4 b5 16. Na5"

30,Kb8,c8b8,1k1r1b1r/ppq2ppp/2np1n2/8/1PN1P3/2B2P1B/P4P1P/2RQK1R1 w - - 3 16,Continuing my plan.

So the move seems to be 18... Qxc6 with unclear game."

37,Qb5,a4b5,1k1r1b1r/pp3ppp/2P2n2/1Q6/2p1P3/2B2P1B/P4P1q/2R1K1R1 b - - 1 19,"If 19... b6 20. Be5+ and black loses his queen. 
If 19... Qxg1+ 20. Ke2 and the mate is hardly evadable. Even if so, the blacks queen is dead."
