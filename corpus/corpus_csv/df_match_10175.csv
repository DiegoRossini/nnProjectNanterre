1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game I hope to significantly batter Rob,  who I have managed but one draw in 6 games against.   I start with the standard opening"
2,g5,g7g5,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/8/6p1/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,a response I haven't seen before
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/8/6p1/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,I press for center board control
4,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/8/6p1/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,he apparently wants to give me the pawn ~
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/8/6p1/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 3,since he is by far the better player  i sense a trap and decline and continue to develop
6,h6,h7h6,rnbqk1nr/ppppppb1/7p/6p1/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,guess he changed his mind...
7,f4,f2f4,rnbqk1nr/ppppppb1/7p/6p1/3PPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"i press to get him furhter off balance, figuring I am going to O-O-O at somepoint anyway."
8,c5,c7c5,rnbqk1nr/pp1pppb1/7p/2p3p1/3PPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"he apparently smells that and wants to Break that up.  I really don't like this..At this point we are trading silly banter.
(rt4sm) I have a confession to make... i often hype up my opponent's play, i think it can get them overconfident whilst ensuring they like me, so i still make friends. I'm supposed to be the star of SC, but i still stoop low enough to enter the psychological battleground. 
Comment: (yodean) Your confession only validates you to be the scum you are. wait till i tell the others. Your tactic may work on YoDean, the simp, but not the great nfgatchess !  

I finally respond with Ne2  not sure why...  i just don't like my other options~ they seem to put other pieces out in places I don't want them yet."

10,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqk1nr/pp1pppb1/7p/6p1/3pPP2/2N5/PPP1N1PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,so he (surprisingly) plays as predicted...
11,Nxd4,e2d4,rnbqk1nr/pp1pppb1/7p/6p1/3NPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,and so do I.
12,Qa5,d8a5,rnb1k1nr/pp1pppb1/7p/q5p1/3NPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,Now I am thinking since his castle is messed up on both sides if i can just swap material for a while i can work into a winning position since he won't be able to castle effectively  (I think) - Qd3
13,Qd3,d1d3,rnb1k1nr/pp1pppb1/7p/q5p1/3NPP2/2NQ4/PPP3PP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 2 7,I don't see a respnse he has that can really gain him anything

17,Be2,f1e2,r1b1k1nr/pp2ppb1/2p4p/q5p1/4PP2/2NQ4/PPP1B1PP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 1 9,"I move,  I figure I might end up with stacked pawns  but now it looks like I am going to O-O (instead of O-O-O) and develop the rook at the same time on the f-file"
