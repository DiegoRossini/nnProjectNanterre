In this case, it was black's pawn on e7 that I was imagining was gone. Some of my best moves ever have come from exploring a fantasy position - once I know I have a checkmate, or winning combo, all I then have to do is find a way to remove the piece that enables the combo. So I worked out a line that wins black's a8 rook - but for it to work, that pawn on e7 can't be there, in which case, check with 11. exd6+ keeps white's queen safe. Then I got distracted and returned and carelessly played 11. exd6?? anyway, forgetting that it was a fantasy combo. Moved too fast, too casually. And my queen pays the price."
