1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was one of the most enjoyable games I've ever played.  I _try_ to play strategically (as best as I know how).  One reason for this is the axiom: the tactics come out of the strategy.  Another reason however is that strategy is relatively unknown to many players (who often play tactically) and can't tell the difference between the two.  This unfamiliarity gives the strategic view a double advantage.  As an aid to the counting of strategic ideas, I employ the Point Count Method.  This is not so much a ""scoring system"" so much as just what the name implies: a method of counting strategic advantages and disadvantages."
