12,d5,d7d5,rnb1kbnr/ppp3pp/8/3pN3/2BPp3/8/PPP2PqP/RNBQKR2 w Qkq - 0 7,6. ..................d5 - this pawn sac opens up a line for black's lsb to come to h3 which it does 3 moves later.
13,Bxd5,c4d5,rnb1kbnr/ppp3pp/8/3BN3/3Pp3/8/PPP2PqP/RNBQKR2 b Qkq - 0 7,"8. Bf7 ?! - I think white would have been better served by playing Nc3 or Be3 here and getting on with his development.  What do you, the jury think?"

Agreed - although Ion cannot castle it may not be a problem due to white's retarded development which Ion takes full advantage of over the next few moves."
