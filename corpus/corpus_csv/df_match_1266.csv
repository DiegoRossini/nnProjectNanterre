1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,My usual opening.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,Clearly done to get out of the main line quickly and throw me off.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Clearly done to get out of the main line quickly and throw me off.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pppppppp/2n2n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,Clearly done to get out of the main line quickly and throw me off.
5,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkb1r/pppppppp/2n2n2/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 3,"While I didn't know it at the time, this is all part of the main line."
6,e6,e7e6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n1pn2/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"While I didn't know it at the time, this is all part of the main line."
7,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n1pn2/8/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"While I didn't know it at the time, this is all part of the main line."
8,Bb4,f8b4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n1pn2/8/1bPP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,"While I didn't know it at the time, this is all part of the main line."
9,Qc2,d1c2,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n1pn2/8/1bPP4/2N2N2/PPQ1PPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 3 5,"While I didn't know it at the time, this is all part of the main line."
10,d6,d7d6,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2nppn2/8/1bPP4/2N2N2/PPQ1PPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 0 6,Played with the idea of eventually pushing the pawn to e5 and challenging the center.
11,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2nppn2/6B1/1bPP4/2N2N2/PPQ1PPPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 1 6,This is the first deviation from the main line. 6. Bd2 or a3 were more popular moves to break the pin right away. I played this just to try out something a little different from what he expected.
12,h6,h7h6,r1bqk2r/ppp2pp1/2nppn1p/6B1/1bPP4/2N2N2/PPQ1PPPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"A logical move which immediately forces me to make a decision about my bishop. I could go back to d2, but that would be a waste of tempo. Going back to h4 did not look  appealing to me after 7. Bh4 g5 8. Bg3 g4! and the pawn on d4 is lost. So taking on f6 seemed to be the only logical option."
13,Bxf6,g5f6,r1bqk2r/ppp2pp1/2nppB1p/8/1bPP4/2N2N2/PPQ1PPPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 7,No need to defend the d4 pawn right away. I figured that this was better to exchange the bishop and still protect d4.
14,Qxf6,d8f6,r1b1k2r/ppp2pp1/2nppq1p/8/1bPP4/2N2N2/PPQ1PPPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 8,No need to defend the d4 pawn right away. I figured that this was better to exchange the bishop and still protect d4.
15,a3,a2a3,r1b1k2r/ppp2pp1/2nppq1p/8/1bPP4/P1N2N2/1PQ1PPPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 8,No need to defend the d4 pawn right away. I figured that this was better to exchange the bishop and still protect d4.
16,Bxc3+,b4c3,r1b1k2r/ppp2pp1/2nppq1p/8/2PP4/P1b2N2/1PQ1PPPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 9,Perhaps e3 may have been slightly better. I chose to fianchetto my bishop so that my king would be a bit more protected after castling.
17,Qxc3,c2c3,r1b1k2r/ppp2pp1/2nppq1p/8/2PP4/P1Q2N2/1P2PPPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 9,Perhaps e3 may have been slightly better. I chose to fianchetto my bishop so that my king would be a bit more protected after castling.
18,O-O,e8g8,r1b2rk1/ppp2pp1/2nppq1p/8/2PP4/P1Q2N2/1P2PPPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 1 10,Perhaps e3 may have been slightly better. I chose to fianchetto my bishop so that my king would be a bit more protected after castling.
19,g3,g2g3,r1b2rk1/ppp2pp1/2nppq1p/8/2PP4/P1Q2NP1/1P2PP1P/R3KB1R b KQ - 0 10,Perhaps e3 may have been slightly better. I chose to fianchetto my bishop so that my king would be a bit more protected after castling.
20,e5,e6e5,r1b2rk1/ppp2pp1/2np1q1p/4p3/2PP4/P1Q2NP1/1P2PP1P/R3KB1R w KQ - 0 11,The most logical move in the position to strike at the center and look to activate the light square bishop.
21,d5,d4d5,r1b2rk1/ppp2pp1/2np1q1p/3Pp3/2P5/P1Q2NP1/1P2PP1P/R3KB1R b KQ - 0 11,This is a key point in the game. I felt that taking on e5 would give black an advantage since he would have an open e file and make his development easier. So I took a stab at d5 which basically forces the knight to d4 in order to prevent me from playing e4.
22,Nd4,c6d4,r1b2rk1/ppp2pp1/3p1q1p/3Pp3/2Pn4/P1Q2NP1/1P2PP1P/R3KB1R w KQ - 1 12,In retrospect Nxd4 may have been better. I didn't like it because I noticed that after the exchange the pawn on d4 would have been a tough one to get rid of.
23,Rd1,a1d1,r1b2rk1/ppp2pp1/3p1q1p/3Pp3/2Pn4/P1Q2NP1/1P2PP1P/3RKB1R b K - 2 12,In retrospect Nxd4 may have been better. I didn't like it because I noticed that after the exchange the pawn on d4 would have been a tough one to get rid of.
24,Nxf3+,d4f3,r1b2rk1/ppp2pp1/3p1q1p/3Pp3/2P5/P1Q2nP1/1P2PP1P/3RKB1R w K - 0 13,"This move came as a surprise. After 13...Qxf3 14. exf3 f5, it seems like black is doing just fine. My opponent probably believed that I would have good drawing chances so he keeps the queens on the board for now while also threatening an f5 push."
25,Qxf3,c3f3,r1b2rk1/ppp2pp1/3p1q1p/3Pp3/2P5/P4QP1/1P2PP1P/3RKB1R b K - 0 13,"This move came as a surprise. After 13...Qxf3 14. exf3 f5, it seems like black is doing just fine. My opponent probably believed that I would have good drawing chances so he keeps the queens on the board for now while also threatening an f5 push."
26,Qg6,f6g6,r1b2rk1/ppp2pp1/3p2qp/3Pp3/2P5/P4QP1/1P2PP1P/3RKB1R w K - 1 14,"This move came as a surprise. After 13...Qxf3 14. exf3 f5, it seems like black is doing just fine. My opponent probably believed that I would have good drawing chances so he keeps the queens on the board for now while also threatening an f5 push."
27,Bg2,f1g2,r1b2rk1/ppp2pp1/3p2qp/3Pp3/2P5/P4QP1/1P2PPBP/3RK2R b K - 2 14,"After deep consideration, I figured that this was the only good move. I have to castle quickly in order to survive the attack on the king-side."
28,f5,f7f5,r1b2rk1/ppp3p1/3p2qp/3Ppp2/2P5/P4QP1/1P2PPBP/3RK2R w K - 0 15,"The most logical move which carries a lot of power. Black's idea is to push f4 and rip open a file towards the king, not something which I want to have happen."
29,Qd3,f3d3,r1b2rk1/ppp3p1/3p2qp/3Ppp2/2P5/P2Q2P1/1P2PPBP/3RK2R b K - 1 15,"I was quite pleased with myself for finding this defensive resource. If I play 15. O-O right away, then black can strike hard with f4, after which the opening of the f-file becomes serious. With 15. Qd3, I delay a pawn push to f4 because of the pin on the queen and buys me time to castle and lessens the power behind pawn to f4."
30,Qf6,g6f6,r1b2rk1/ppp3p1/3p1q1p/3Ppp2/2P5/P2Q2P1/1P2PPBP/3RK2R w K - 2 16,Breaking the pin right away and finalizing the push for f4.
31,O-O,e1g1,r1b2rk1/ppp3p1/3p1q1p/3Ppp2/2P5/P2Q2P1/1P2PPBP/3R1RK1 b - - 3 16,"Truth be told I simply overreacted to to the possibility of Bf5, but this was nothing to worry about. Best was probably just to push b4 in order to get some counter-play on the queen-side which we will see later on."
32,f4,f5f4,r1b2rk1/ppp3p1/3p1q1p/3Pp3/2P2p2/P2Q2P1/1P2PPBP/3R1RK1 w - - 0 17,"Truth be told I simply overreacted to to the possibility of Bf5, but this was nothing to worry about. Best was probably just to push b4 in order to get some counter-play on the queen-side which we will see later on."
33,Be4,g2e4,r1b2rk1/ppp3p1/3p1q1p/3Pp3/2P1Bp2/P2Q2P1/1P2PP1P/3R1RK1 b - - 1 17,"Truth be told I simply overreacted to to the possibility of Bf5, but this was nothing to worry about. Best was probably just to push b4 in order to get some counter-play on the queen-side which we will see later on."
34,Bh3,c8h3,r4rk1/ppp3p1/3p1q1p/3Pp3/2P1Bp2/P2Q2Pb/1P2PP1P/3R1RK1 w - - 2 18,Taking advantage of the whole that was created with Be4.
35,Bg2,e4g2,r4rk1/ppp3p1/3p1q1p/3Pp3/2P2p2/P2Q2Pb/1P2PPBP/3R1RK1 b - - 3 18,After I looked at 18. Rfe1 I saw fxg3 and did not like that fact that there was an open file towards my king at all. So I simply retreated back to fill in the hole.
36,Bd7,h3d7,r4rk1/pppb2p1/3p1q1p/3Pp3/2P2p2/P2Q2P1/1P2PPBP/3R1RK1 w - - 4 19,A curious decision. I believe that my opponent's idea was to undermine any queen-side pawn storms that I had in mind.
