1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,The most aggressive opening move.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Black, it would appear, wishes to avoid the Sicilian."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,This is the most common and probably best move here.
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"The Philidor Defense, though rather a defensive option, is sound."
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,This is seen most often and signifies a battle for the center coming.
6,f6,f7f6,rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/3p1p2/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"This move is altogether too defensive.  This position is designed for a fight and White retains all initiative here (as through most of the game).  The Philidor Counter Defense, which involves 3...f5, would have been better had Black been determined to move the f-pawn."
7,Be3,c1e3,rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/3p1p2/4p3/3PP3/4BN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"dxe4 might be good here, but White wants to bolster his center control."
8,a6,a7a6,rnbqkbnr/1pp3pp/p2p1p2/4p3/3PP3/4BN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Confusing.  Builds to a ...b5 move sometime, but otherwise useless."
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/1pp3pp/p2p1p2/4p3/3PP3/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"White now has a strong center position, absolutely controlling the d5 square."
10,Ne7,g8e7,rnbqkb1r/1pp1n1pp/p2p1p2/4p3/3PP3/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,"Black now wishes to counteract that, although the move to f6 now hurts him."
11,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkb1r/1pp1n1pp/p2p1p2/4p3/2BPP3/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 3 6,"More aggressive, and allows for a castle."
12,b5,b7b5,rnbqkb1r/2p1n1pp/p2p1p2/1p2p3/2BPP3/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 7,Black wants to push the bishop off that square.
13,Be2,c4e2,rnbqkb1r/2p1n1pp/p2p1p2/1p2p3/3PP3/2N1BN2/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 7,"Very defensive, as Bb2 might have been better here."
14,Nec6,e7c6,rnbqkb1r/2p3pp/p1np1p2/1p2p3/3PP3/2N1BN2/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 8,Not altogether recommended; Black moves the wrong knight for the attack on the center.
15,d5,d4d5,rnbqkb1r/2p3pp/p1np1p2/1p1Pp3/4P3/2N1BN2/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 8,"More pawn advancement, and an attack on the knight."
16,Nb4,c6b4,rnbqkb1r/2p3pp/p2p1p2/1p1Pp3/1n2P3/2N1BN2/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 1 9,"Gets the knight out of the way and attacking White's position, although it is absolutely trapped here.  The knight has no safe move and if attacked will be forced to give itself up for a pawn at most.  A retreat to e7 would have been in order, and even a move to a5 would have been better than this. This is where Black's game really goes to crap."
17,a3,a2a3,rnbqkb1r/2p3pp/p2p1p2/1p1Pp3/1n2P3/P1N1BN2/1PP1BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 9,The inevitable attack.

19,Qxc2,d1c2,rnbqkb1r/2p3pp/p2p1p2/1p1Pp3/4P3/P1N1BN2/1PQ1BPPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 0 10,Any other move would have been stupid beyond belief.
20,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/6pp/p2p1p2/1ppPp3/4P3/P1N1BN2/1PQ1BPPP/R3K2R w KQkq c6 0 11,Black must now free up operating space.
