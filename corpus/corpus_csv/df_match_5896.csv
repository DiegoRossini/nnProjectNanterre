1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,The Queen's Gambit typical position. This is one of the oldest openings in chess where white have a good chance of taking control in the center. It's very important for white to capture the d5 pawn which give white control over the centre
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,The Queen's Gambit typical position. This is one of the oldest openings in chess where white have a good chance of taking control in the center.

4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"I'm not so experienced whit the Marshall Defense, but black lets me take the d5 pawn. The Queen's Gambit Declined usually features 2... e6 defending the d4 pawn."
5,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/3P4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,I decide to take the pawn on d5. Other lines feature Nc3.
6,Nxd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3n4/3P4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,As said white gains control of the center and forces black to move his knight for a third time.
7,e4,e2e4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3n4/3PP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,As said white gains control of the center and forces black to move his knight for a third time.
8,Nb6,d5b6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/1n6/8/3PP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,Other lines feature Nf6 which I find better.
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/1n6/8/3PP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 5,getting his bishop out in order to castle. I think Be7 would be a little bit better because it is more defensive and gives the king side security since the kings knight is far away from the king side. Bb4 on the other hand is more aggressive but doesn't really endanger white.
10,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/1n2p3/8/3PP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,getting his bishop out in order to castle. I think Be7 would be a little bit better because it is more defensive and gives the king side security since the kings knight is far away from the king side. Bb4 on the other hand is more aggressive but doesn't really endanger white.
11,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/1n2p3/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,getting his bishop out in order to castle. I think Be7 would be a little bit better because it is more defensive and gives the king side security since the kings knight is far away from the king side. Bb4 on the other hand is more aggressive but doesn't really endanger white.
12,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/1n2p3/8/1b1PP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 7,getting his bishop out in order to castle.

Bb4 on the other hand is more aggressive but doesn't really endanger white.
13,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/1n2p3/8/1b1PP3/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 7,I don't really need to play a3 here because if he takes the knight I would have a pawn on the c file and the center pawns would be safer. Bb3 prepares the castling and puts some pressure on the king side.
14,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/1n2p3/8/1b1PP3/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 4 8,I'm not sure what the purpose of this move was. Maybe to secure the d5 square ? But I think it would be better for him to get the knight out or play with the queen side pieces.
15,O-O,e1g1,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/1n2p3/8/1b1PP3/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 5 8,I'm not sure what the purpose of this move was. Maybe to secure the d5 square ? But I think it would be better for him to get the knight out or play with the queen side pieces.
16,c6,c7c6,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/1np1p3/8/1b1PP3/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 9,I'm not sure what the purpose of this move was. Maybe to secure the d5 square ? But I think it would be better for him to get the knight out or play with the queen side pieces.
17,e5,e4e5,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/1np1p3/4P3/1b1P4/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 9,"I made this move, because I saw an attacking opportunity and therefor wonted to open my light squared bishop the diagonal. I knew that he could eventually play Nd5 but thought the risk is worthy."
18,Nd5,b6d5,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3nP3/1b1P4/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 10,necessary
19,Bd2,c1d2,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3nP3/1b1P4/2NB1N2/PP1B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 2 10,necessary
20,Bxc3,b4c3,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3nP3/3P4/2bB1N2/PP1B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 11,He decided to make an exchange and I'm OK with it. I decided to take the bishop with the pawn because the dark squared bishop holds a nice diagonal and could help in an eventual attack on the black king side.
21,bxc3,b2c3,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3nP3/3P4/2PB1N2/P2B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 11,"Black continues to develop his pawns, leaving the knight, the bishop and the rook undeveloped."

23,Bxh7+,d3h7,rnbq1rk1/p4ppB/2p1p3/1p1nP3/3P4/2P2N2/P2B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 12,I decided that it was time to attack the king side and make a sacrifice since black hasn't developed his queen side pieces and has left the king side ill defended.
24,Kxh7,g8h7,rnbq1r2/p4ppk/2p1p3/1p1nP3/3P4/2P2N2/P2B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 13,black accepts the sacrifice
25,Ng5+,f3g5,rnbq1r2/p4ppk/2p1p3/1p1nP1N1/3P4/2P5/P2B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 13,only possible check

Nxe6+ and he loses the queen, if Kh8 then 14.Qh5+Kg8  15.Qh7# and his best move which result isn't that sure Kg6. If he played Kg6 I thought I could play Qg4 and then either check him and take his queen or in order he moves the queen to use a series of checks and eventually win material advantage or mate him."
27,Qh5,d1h5,rnbq1rk1/p4pp1/2p1p3/1p1nP1NQ/3P4/2P5/P2B1PPP/R4RK1 b - - 3 14,Pressuring for mate.
28,Re8,f8e8,rnbqr1k1/p4pp1/2p1p3/1p1nP1NQ/3P4/2P5/P2B1PPP/R4RK1 w - - 4 15,forced move since every other move would have resulted in mate.
29,Qxf7+,h5f7,rnbqr1k1/p4Qp1/2p1p3/1p1nP1N1/3P4/2P5/P2B1PPP/R4RK1 b - - 0 15,Very important move since if Qh7+ he would have escaped.
30,Kh8,g8h8,rnbqr2k/p4Qp1/2p1p3/1p1nP1N1/3P4/2P5/P2B1PPP/R4RK1 w - - 1 16,Getting him in position. The rest of the moves are all forced.
