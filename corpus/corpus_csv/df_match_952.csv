1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,and today i hosted a game 3 day / move as black 1450-2000 rating and he joined for a 4th rematch. the pressure was on. one of my big rivals i have to even the score here!
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"and so i go with what i find to be my strongest black start against d4 openers, e6.  this Game will demonstrate the importance of time in chess on a few occasions. and the importance of always looking at all moves possible."
3,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"hmm last 5 times i played e6 vs d4 i was immediately faced with e4, this more passive approach really delights me"
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,and so i follow through with d5
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,i decide to play this to throw him off. im pretty sure he expected c5 but i have plans for my c pawn and this prevents his knight from going to rest on the e5 square.
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/3p4/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,i decide to play this to throw him off. im pretty sure he expected c5 but i have plans for my c pawn and this prevents his knight from going to rest on the e5 square.
7,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/3p4/3P4/2N1PN2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 4,i expected his other knight over his LSB development. im pretty sure he wont be careless with his lsb.
8,Bd6,f8d6,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2nbp3/3p4/3P4/2N1PN2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 4 5,and so i place my DSB on my favorite diagonal instead of developing my other knight.
9,Bd3,f1d3,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2nbp3/3p4/3P4/2NBPN2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 5 5,i personally thought that his e3 move and his bishop move to d3 allowed me to play this following sequence
10,Nce7,c6e7,r1bqk1nr/ppp1nppp/3bp3/3p4/3P4/2NBPN2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 6 6,i personally thought that his e3 move and his bishop move to d3 allowed me to play this following sequence
11,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk1nr/ppp1nppp/3bp3/3p4/3P4/2NBPN2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 7 6,strengthen my d pawn in anticipation of his e4 and create an opening for my bishop if he decides to push by instead of exchanging on the d file.
12,c6,c7c6,r1bqk1nr/pp2nppp/2pbp3/3p4/3P4/2NBPN2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,strengthen my d pawn in anticipation of his e4 and create an opening for my bishop if he decides to push by instead of exchanging on the d file.
13,e4,e3e4,r1bqk1nr/pp2nppp/2pbp3/3p4/3PP3/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,anticipated. i now have another time gain. i decide to use it to reinforce my defensive position. to solidify a future mid and prevent the e5 push
14,f6,f7f6,r1bqk1nr/pp2n1pp/2pbpp2/3p4/3PP3/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,and so i play this. i thought it also greatly restrains his knights movement
15,exd5,e4d5,r1bqk1nr/pp2n1pp/2pbpp2/3P4/3P4/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,decides to exchange instead of passing by. this delighted me it opens up the resting spot for my e knight again and strengthens mid.
16,cxd5,c6d5,r1bqk1nr/pp2n1pp/3bpp2/3p4/3P4/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 9,i thought he would eventually play this. im probably not the only player accustomed to facing this rook slide over.
17,Re1,f1e1,r1bqk1nr/pp2n1pp/3bpp2/3p4/3P4/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq - 1 9,i thought he would eventually play this. im probably not the only player accustomed to facing this rook slide over.
18,a6,a7a6,r1bqk1nr/1p2n1pp/p2bpp2/3p4/3P4/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w kq - 0 10,decide to further setup a defensive structure. i still havent decided if im king side castling. time seems not to afford it at the moment.
19,a3,a2a3,r1bqk1nr/1p2n1pp/p2bpp2/3p4/3P4/P1NB1N2/1PP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq - 0 10,starts his pawn push
20,Bd7,c8d7,r2qk1nr/1p1bn1pp/p2bpp2/3p4/3P4/P1NB1N2/1PP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w kq - 1 11,cover the b5 square
21,Ne2,c3e2,r2qk1nr/1p1bn1pp/p2bpp2/3p4/3P4/P2B1N2/1PP1NPPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq - 2 11,hmm unanticipated retreat
22,Nc6,e7c6,r2qk1nr/1p1b2pp/p1nbpp2/3p4/3P4/P2B1N2/1PP1NPPP/R1BQR1K1 w kq - 3 12,this finally allows knight to go back to c6
23,b3,b2b3,r2qk1nr/1p1b2pp/p1nbpp2/3p4/3P4/PP1B1N2/2P1NPPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq - 0 12,alright hes changing back and forth which pawn he wants to push
24,e5,e6e5,r2qk1nr/1p1b2pp/p1nb1p2/3pp3/3P4/PP1B1N2/2P1NPPP/R1BQR1K1 w kq - 0 13,i can finally start attacking mid
