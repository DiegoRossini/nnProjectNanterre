BUT white has Qc8#, black must defend, and is to be said whether white has compensation for the exchange."

Now there is no mate on c8, so I have to think what to do against Bf5. The line e3 - Be3 doesn't work because after the exchange, Qxb2 has no compensation for me (I?ve played it successfully, though)."
