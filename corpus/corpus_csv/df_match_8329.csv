1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Now I've played many games, but few of them are really worth annotating. Conditions on games to be of interest are that there should not exist big mistakes. The game should be of a strategical value and the outcome should be seen as the result of the confrontation of two plans not as the result of single moves.
The theme of this game is attack. Pure attack. As you will see, both players are trying to push pawn into the opponent king side. Two factors determined the winner : density of attacking pieces and quality of deployment. I will explain later. Fortunately I was the winner in this match."

Re8, from my point of view does not achieve something concret. If blacks are hoping for pushing e5, then this remains weak : If 9...e5 10. dxe5 dxe5 11.Qxd8 Rxd8 12.Bxe5 wins a pawn !"

After 9.h4 blacks should forget about Nh5. thus Bg7 does not get the chance to make e5 possible.
If 9...Nh5 10.Bh2! e5 11.g4! followed by dxe, QxQ and Bxe wins a pawn."

Here is the decision to close the center.
Of course I had to make some calculation of how far the blacks pawns can reach and how successfully blacks can make it to engage the other major pieces into an attack.
Bg7 is static : it is blocked by Nf6 which is itself somehow blocked. Re8 is passive. Q and Ra8 active, while Bc8 and Nb8 really suffer from c6.
For this reaosn I played d5. Whites pieces have the chanc to be deployed in a perfect formation so to succeed an attack against the blacks king. The attack should also be rapid in order to benefit from the fact that I can engage all my pieces which are concentrated in the king-side while some of my enemy pieces would make it slowly to enter defense."
