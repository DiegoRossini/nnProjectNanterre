1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Yet again it has been a long time since my last annotation.  Thankfully my dad has now settled in to his care home and his house is now being let so I can give my attention to some chessic issues.  This game was played between myself and a long-standing on the board nemesis dmaestro (Mike).  Do not be fooled by that Class B rating he has got.  At the top of his game he is an expert!  In quite a large percentage of my games against him, he, like the Dentist, had managed to inflict severe passivitis on me in the middlegame.  Sometimes I have managed to turn the tables on these two opponents, but more often than not, particularly with Mike - he has gone on to win.  In this game it certainly looked as though I was set to lose, not just the game, but my Class A rating.  I thought of hitting that resign button quite a few times in the endgame, but something kept me from doing this and I ended up teetering on the brink.  So, what was the final twist here?  Well, you will just have to read on.  Below is the gameknot analysis version:  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=22168815&fb=1&rnd=0.5423497644644992"
