1,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"i.e. how NOT to play the Bird opening. REally nothing too much to say about this game, just a trap I fell into just 7 moves in..."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I'd never seen this response to the Bird opening before...
3,fxe5,f4e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/8/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,...nor this one but I never like to go pawn-hunting too early on - if you can't deal with the developmental advantage that your opponent gains you'll be in a lot of trouble!
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4P3/8/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,...nor this one but I never like to go pawn-hunting too early on - if you can't deal with the developmental advantage that your opponent gains you'll be in a lot of trouble!
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4P3/8/5N2/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,!? Change of plan from me - it's not a bad move really but perhaps I ought to have stuck with my plan?
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4P3/8/5N2/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,!? Change of plan from me - it's not a bad move really but perhaps I ought to have stuck with my plan?

8,Bxd6,f8d6,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2nb4/8/8/5N2/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Very strange move, I thought at the time. Checking the database on this one only a small handful of GK games reached this position. 6.g3 was played by all but one person..."
9,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2nb4/8/8/2N2N2/PPPPP1PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"Very strange move, I thought at the time. Checking the database on this one only a small handful of GK games reached this position. 6.g3 was played by all but one person..."

11,d3,d2d3,r1bqk1nr/ppp2p1p/2nb4/6p1/8/2NP1N2/PPP1P1PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,...who played this move. My logic was to retreat and play Nd2 should the pawn advance happen. Good plan?
12,g4,g5g4,r1bqk1nr/ppp2p1p/2nb4/8/6p1/2NP1N2/PPP1P1PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,?? Definitely not! The problem was that I never like pushing my knight forward in most openings - it just seems too vulnerable! In a way it still is in this opening (7.Ng5 f5! wins the knight eventually though equality may still be reached - three pawns for the knight) and 7.Ng1 doesn't make White's position that pretty but as it turns out this one is suicidal!

15,g3,g2g3,r1b1k1nr/ppp2p1p/2nb4/8/6pq/2NP2P1/PPPNP2P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,Bxg3+ also works but this is prettier!
16,Qxg3+,h4g3,r1b1k1nr/ppp2p1p/2nb4/8/6p1/2NP2q1/PPPNP2P/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 9,Bxg3+ also works but this is prettier!
17,hxg3,h2g3,r1b1k1nr/ppp2p1p/2nb4/8/6p1/2NP2P1/PPPNP3/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 9,"Quick game, horrid mistake and mated in 9 moves. That's all folks!"
18,Bxg3#,d6g3,r1b1k1nr/ppp2p1p/2n5/8/6p1/2NP2b1/PPPNP3/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 10,"Quick game, horrid mistake and mated in 9 moves. That's all folks!"
