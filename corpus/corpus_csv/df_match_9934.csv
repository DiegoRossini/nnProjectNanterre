1,g3,g2g3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/6P1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,A less common opening.
2,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/8/6P1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I tend to mirror the less common openings at first just to keep things balanced as I am still learning.
3,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/8/6P1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,A somewhat early queen move.
4,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/8/8/6P1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 3,A somewhat early queen move.
5,c3,c2c3,rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/8/8/2P3P1/PP1PPPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 3,A somewhat early queen move.
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/8/2P3P1/PP1PPPBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 4,A somewhat early queen move.
7,Qb3,d1b3,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/8/1QP3P1/PP1PPPBP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 2 4,A somewhat early queen move.
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk2r/ppppppbp/2n2np1/8/8/1QP3P1/PP1PPPBP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 3 5,Continuing to develop as well as thinking about a way to trap the emerged queen. Knight is one move from putting queen in jeopardy.
9,Nh3,g1h3,r1bqk2r/ppppppbp/2n2np1/8/8/1QP3PN/PP1PPPBP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 4 5,Knights on the edge are typically weak. This one ends up re-moving too much.
10,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/ppppppbp/2n2np1/8/8/1QP3PN/PP1PPPBP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 5 6,I was thinking about 7 ... Be6 as another way to get at the queen.

13,d4,d2d4,r1bq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/2np1np1/8/3P4/1QP3PN/PP2PPBP/RNB2RK1 b - - 0 7,"This move prevents my 7 ... Be6 because 8 d5 would fork the bishop and knight while the pawn is protected by the bishop at g2 and the queen. I would end up losing a minor piece, even if I tried to counter attack the queen with Na5. Qb5 would make sure of that."
14,d5,d6d5,r1bq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/2n2np1/3p4/3P4/1QP3PN/PP2PPBP/RNB2RK1 w - - 0 8,If I hadn't done this 8 d5 would probably have been the next move.
15,Nd2,b1d2,r1bq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/2n2np1/3p4/3P4/1QP3PN/PP1NPPBP/R1B2RK1 b - - 1 8,Trying to get his knight off the wall.
16,e6,e7e6,r1bq1rk1/ppp2pbp/2n1pnp1/3p4/3P4/1QP3PN/PP1NPPBP/R1B2RK1 w - - 0 9,Trying to get his knight off the wall.

21,Nxe4,d2e4,r1bq1rk1/p1p2pbp/1pn1pnp1/8/3PNN2/1QP3P1/PP3PBP/R1B2RK1 b - - 0 11,Bb7 was probably a better move but I felt like being adventurous and like I said before I wanted to play with the white queen.

36,Qd5,d8d5,2r2rk1/pbp2pbp/1p6/n2qp2N/1Q1P2p1/2PBB1P1/PP3P1P/R4RK1 w - - 2 19,Threatening checkmate.
