1,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/2N5/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 1,"Hi everyone!  Another duel with Freddy and yet another loss, but this game lasted one move longer than all my white games against him.  With the black pieces my form against him has previously been shot - i.e. 4 out of 5 of those checkmates he has put on me has been when I have been playing black against him.  Anyhow - let's see how the drama unfolds.  Freddy kicks off with his favourite Dunst Opening, Nc3."
