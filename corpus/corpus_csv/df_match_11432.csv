1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This game deals with the exchange sacrifice - one of the most difficult and challenging aspects of modern chess. Most commonly it involves an exchange of a Rook for a Bishop or a Knight - either for a direct attack or for positional reasons.

First of all, it takes away a lot of squares from Black�s c8-Bishop. In case of a White Bishop-move to e3, it can�t be attacked by a Black Knight-move to g4 - and if White should decide to castle long, he has the move g4 in hand with an attack on the Black King."
