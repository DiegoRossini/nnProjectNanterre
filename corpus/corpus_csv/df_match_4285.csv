1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"i am not very sure about what openings are called but i do know how to play, so here is my annotate...... As always i start out with d4 or c4 to play the English opening, but in this case i did d4"
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"Black responds with Nf6, standard move played by black"
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,regardless of blacks first move i usually follow up d4 with c4 unless black plays c5 which people have done in some occasions
4,e5,e7e5,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,A gambit by black so he can be able to develop his pieces faster if i decide to take e5
5,dxe5,d4e5,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4P3/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,The reason i decide to do Dxe5 is because i know in the long run he will be able to get e5 back if he is indeed a good player but because i dont really like pushing d4 to d5 or play e3 to exchange pawns
6,Ne4,f6e4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/2P1n3/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"Usually some people would play Ng4 to attack e pawn which if i defend with Nf3, the opponent then usually plays Nc6, but in this case my opponent plays Ne4"
7,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/2P1n3/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,I decide to push my e pawn in this game to protect my c pawn from attacks further along in the game
8,Bb4+,f8b4,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/1bP1n3/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,Bd2 seem the best option in this case

13,Ngf3,g1f3,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n5/4P3/1bP5/4PN2/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 2 7,I defend as usual with Nf3 but i know in the long run that its pointless to defend that pawn much further
14,Qe7,d8e7,r1b1k2r/ppppqppp/2n5/4P3/1bP5/4PN2/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 3 8,Attacking the e pawn as suspected
15,a3,a2a3,r1b1k2r/ppppqppp/2n5/4P3/1bP5/P3PN2/1P1N1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,"Making him force to take the knight.... Ba5 or Bc5 leads to him losing the Bishop... although i had thought about this beforehand if my opponent had decide to play Bc5 i would push my pawn from b2 to b4 attacking bishop, but i was afraid if he took e3 weakening my king side i would be up plus 2 but both my king side and queen side are both heavily damaged.... After Bxe3, fxe3, Nxe5 i feel i am under a lot of pressure although my opponent doesn't have any other develop pieces"
16,Bxd2+,b4d2,r1b1k2r/ppppqppp/2n5/4P3/2P5/P3PN2/1P1b1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 9,As i hoped

27,b4,b2b4,r4rk1/pppb1ppp/3p4/4q3/1PP5/P3PB2/3Q1PPP/R4RK1 b - - 0 14,so i play b4 if my opponent misses the move of Bxb7 i win a pawn
28,Bc6,d7c6,r4rk1/ppp2ppp/2bp4/4q3/1PP5/P3PB2/3Q1PPP/R4RK1 w - - 1 15,"here i was wondering why have double pawns in the c file of course Rab8 was something i may have played maybe not, but i took the Bishop thinking i had a better set-up...."
