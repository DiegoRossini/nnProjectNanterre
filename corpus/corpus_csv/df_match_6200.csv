2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Arlamowski intends to play a Caro-Kann in response.
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"Instead of playing P-Q4 at once, Keres decides to develop his QN."
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Arlamowski ignores the unusual move order and plays his intended second move.
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"Keres decides against 3 P-Q4, which would transpose into the 3 N-QB3 variation of the Caro-Kann, and develops his other Knight."

7,Nxe4,c3e4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/4N3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,...which Keres completes.

10,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bqkb1r/pp1npppp/2p2n2/8/4N3/5N2/PPPPQPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 3 6,...which Arlamowski unaccountably falls directly into. He failed to ask the question: why would Keres block his own KB with a seemingly useless Queen move?
11,Nd6#,e4d6,r1bqkb1r/pp1npppp/2pN1n2/8/8/5N2/PPPPQPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 4 6,"That's why! Nicely done by Keres, with help from his oblivious opponent."
