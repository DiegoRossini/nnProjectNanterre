1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is my first game I have ever annotated, hopefully I have not made too many mistakes. For most of the game the position was pretty much drawn, so this game will not be interesting to those who want to see some wild action. However the pawn endgame had a pretty nifty little ending that I wanted to show."
