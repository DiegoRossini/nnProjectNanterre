1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was a non rated Grunfeld Defense game for tutoring purposes, between myself, Scott Miller (faithfulltrav) and my friend Ananya (ananyapathak). Ananya, here is a quote from our previous game: ""According to MCO, the vast majority of lines in this defense give White at least a slight advantage. Some lines give Black equality, and a rare few give Black a slight advantage. ..."" So since I won with the White side, I intentionally played the Grunfeld as Black to see how I can handle the other side. This is the first time playing the Black side of this defense."

So here you have the pawn center we spoke of in the last game. Your game plan should be to maintain your strong pawn center. My game plan is to undermine your pawn center."
