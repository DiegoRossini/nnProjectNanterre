So far I have a 100% win record in games with this line; partly because the move considered White's best response, 6. Bf1, is simply never found at the board by players who haven't seen it before. The point of this bizarre retreat is to guard g2 and to preserve the bishop from exchange (either 6. Be2 or 6. Bb3 is met by Nd4); and Black still has to deal with the threat to his knight. Since both 6... Nxd5 7. Bxb5 and 6... Qxd5 7. Nc3 are fine for White, Black normally plays 6... Nd4, transposing into the labyrinthine Fritz variation."
