1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Ok straight from the off I know I'm going to lose. Fact. That is never a good way to enter into a game, but you can hardly blame me. So I've set myself a target of lasting 50 moves. This, unfortunately puts me immediately into a defensive mode, again not ideal, but there you are. I open safely with e4."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"...c5. I haven't a clue as to his intentions here. The problem is twofold: firstly, my own inexperience, and secondly, his vast experience. He knows a huge range of long combinations, which appear to me as almost clairvoyant! He can already read this game like a dime novel, and he also knows the ending! But I'm going to go down fighting!"
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Nf3. Again safe, textbook stuff."
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"...d6. There is a name for this defence I'm sure, but I don't know it - I'd have to look it up. Now, if I had played this defence I would be worried about that a4 diagonal, but it is, of course, easily defended if threatened, with ...Bd7 or even Nd7. At this stage however, I'm only concentrating on developing my pieces; attack hasn't even entered my head as yet."
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"d4. Again, textbook, based on the very simple theory that I would win in an exchange. That's not the whole reason why I played it though. I want to maintain my tempo and stop him from taking it from me."
6,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,cxd4 I'm going to win that exchange - so why is he going for it??!!
7,Nxd4,f3d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,Nxd4. Bring it on!
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,...Nf6. I see this purely as a piece-developing move. I still control the tempo.
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,Nc3. Textbook stuff again. It develops my other knight.
10,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p1np1/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"...g6. Now I'm familiar with this - it's the Dragon. Fair enough, I don't feel remotely threatened. I'm just keen to get my king castled so that I can move into the middle-game and, instead of textbook moves, use my own instinct. That's when I enjoy chess most of all!"
11,Be3,c1e3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p1np1/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"Be3. However, before I castle, I want to continue to develop my pieces. I'm scared stiff of losing the momentum. If he gains the initiative, then all is lost and I can kiss my 50 moves goodbye!"
12,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 7,...Bg7. The Sicilian. (At least I THINK it is!)
13,a4,a2a4,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/P2NP3/2N1B3/1PP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"7/ a4. I saw Chris do this once, and I wondered why. He explained and it made a lot of sense, so that's why I've done it. It stops his queen or white bishop from sniping from the right at long distance."
14,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/P2NP3/2N1B3/1PP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 1 8,"...0-0. Darn it! He's castled before me! All of a sudden I feel vulnerable. I don't like my pawn on e4 - it's just hanging. On the plus side, I've postponed early castling in favour of developing my pieces, and I can still castle safely, so I figure things arn't too bad at the moment."
15,h3,h2h3,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/P2NP3/2N1B2P/1PP2PP1/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 8,"8/ h3. A purely defensive move, defending the g4 square."
16,Nc6,b8c6,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/P2NP3/2N1B2P/1PP2PP1/R2QKB1R w KQ - 1 9,"...Nc6. A development move, from my point of view. I'm not bothered about it taking my knight on d4, that is well-defended. ...Nb4 could pose a future problem. however, and one to which I must remain alert. On its own it is no problem; but with the support of that black bishop on g7"
