2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Tawba's response is e5, which always make me attack that piece, so..."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,...Nf3.
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"I think a lot of people would play Nc6, but I didn't meet it now."
5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 3,I brought my bishop to c4 attacking the weak f7 square
6,h6,h7h6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/3p3p/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,"This move prevents me from playing Ng5, that would also attack f7."
7,O-O,e1g1,rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/3p3p/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 4,Moving my king into safety!
8,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp3pp1/2pp3p/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 5,"I met this move, and my first thought was that d5 will follow, so:"
9,d3,d2d3,rnbqkbnr/pp3pp1/2pp3p/4p3/2B1P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 5,"in case of d5, I move my bishop to b3 still attacking Black's kingside, and also protecting my pawn on e4."
10,Qf6,d8f6,rnb1kbnr/pp3pp1/2pp1q1p/4p3/2B1P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 6,I didn't expect this. I expected that tawba will develop his minor pieces first.
11,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1kbnr/pp3pp1/2pp1q1p/4p3/2B1P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 2 6,"I continued with developing my knight to c3, attacking the d5 square."

14,Ng6,e7g6,rnb1kb1r/pp3pp1/2pp1qnp/4p3/2B1P3/2NPBN2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 5 8,"I didn't also expect this. A piece is moved 2 times-and look at my pieces and at Black ones. I have developed my minor pieces, but look at the Black bishops and the Black knight on b8 standing on their standard squares, and not even Black rooks play..."
15,d4,d3d4,rnb1kb1r/pp3pp1/2pp1qnp/4p3/2BPP3/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 8,"As I am ready with developing my pieces, I can open up some files."

20,dxe5,d6e5,rnb1k2r/pp2bpp1/2p2q1p/4p3/2B1P3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 11,Black completes the exchange.
