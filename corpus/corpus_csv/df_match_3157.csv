1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,A usual move.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,Alekhine's defense.
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 2,Not too bad. I like e5.
4,h6,h7h6,rnbqkb1r/ppppppp1/5n1p/8/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,? A poor move in the Opening. I think best is e5 or d6.
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/ppppppp1/5n1p/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,Smooth.
6,d6,d7d6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1ppp1/3p1n1p/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Probably best. To stop 3.e5.
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1ppp1/3p1n1p/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,I believe that this is a waste of time; all black can do is c6 (which kinda improves his game) and white must retreat.
