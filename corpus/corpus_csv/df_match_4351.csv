1,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/2N5/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 1,"I like this move because it's not very well known and it has almost the exact same motives as 1. e4. This move develops a piece and attacks two central squares, albeit it does not open lines for pieces. I play this move when I want to play aggressively because I can't hope to play this move after 1. e4 when I am allured into playing 2. Nf3."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/2N5/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"This is the move I wanted. It is perfectly playable as it does the same things as White's e4, but it's on Black's side. I wanted to play the Vienna Gambit this game, so my next move was played accordingly."
3,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"This move prevents any further advances of the e5 pawn, blocks access to 2. ...d5, and opens lines for my bishop and queen if it should be necessary. I also have the standard Vienna Gambit position. My next move will be f4 regardless of most reasonable enemy moves."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,This move attacks the white e4 pawn and develops a piece. I personally prefer 2. ...Nc6 as it frees up the f7 pawn that might make a difference in the game.
5,f4,f2f4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"This move tears open the center with a side pawn in exchange for a weakened king-side. This is an aggressive move, but it's not as aggressive as the King's Gambit. The goal of this is to make a long-term queen-side attack or a short-term king-side attack. There are so many lines to this opening and the King's Gambit that there are thousands of books made for the opening in question, but nobody I know has analyzed both of these openings."
6,exf4,e5f4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/8/4Pp2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"This is accepting the gambit. Black hopes to remain up a pawn the entire game but sacrifices his center-pawn. Other decline variations are possible including 2. ...d6 (not very good) 2. ...d5 (may be good), and 2. ...Nc6."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/8/4Pp2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"I play this move because it is like the King's Gambit. In that opening Black cannot play Qh4+, but this move right now prevents moving the pawn to g5 in order to protect the pawn. Alternative variations include d3, d4 or Bc4."
8,Qe7,d8e7,rnb1kb1r/ppppqppp/5n2/8/4Pp2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,This move was likely played to undermine the e4 pawn. I do not recommend it as it blocks the bishop from moving and does not make any attempt to develop pieces.
9,e5,e4e5,rnb1kb1r/ppppqppp/5n2/4P3/5p2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"I didn't want to move my queen to e2 because it would block the bishop. I also didn't want to play d3 as it would block the bishop as well,and I also wanted to play d4 later in the game. I played e5 to attack the knight. Black still has the pin on my king."
10,d6,d7d6,rnb1kb1r/ppp1qppp/3p1n2/4P3/5p2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Black wants to further undermine the e-pawn. Nc6 would have also worked, but this gives a line for the bishop to pin the knight and queen."
11,Qe2,d1e2,rnb1kb1r/ppp1qppp/3p1n2/4P3/5p2/2N2N2/PPPPQ1PP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"If I had played d4, a pawn exchange would have left me in an uncertain position. By that I mean I wouldn't have been confident in my play at that point. This move alleviates the pin, and will also offer a queen exchange should I capture on d6."
12,Nc6,b8c6,r1b1kb1r/ppp1qppp/2np1n2/4P3/5p2/2N2N2/PPPPQ1PP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 2 7,"This was a mistake. Black forgot about his knight on f6 because he became too entranced with my e-pawn. At least he got it out of the way! A better move would have been possibly Nd7, Ng5, or dxe5, but certainly not this."
13,exf6,e5f6,r1b1kb1r/ppp1qppp/2np1P2/8/5p2/2N2N2/PPPPQ1PP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"I capture the Trojan Horse and the Greeks are left without hope. I am up the exchange, and it will be difficult for Black to retaliate at this point."
14,gxf6,g7f6,r1b1kb1r/ppp1qp1p/2np1p2/8/5p2/2N2N2/PPPPQ1PP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 0 8,"I would have traded queens first and then recaptured. This would have reduced some tension on the board and would have created a more open position where my knights would not have done as well. Either way, the pawns would be detrimental."
15,Nd5,c3d5,r1b1kb1r/ppp1qp1p/2np1p2/3N4/5p2/5N2/PPPPQ1PP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 1 8,I attack with my knight to produce a quadruple fork. The best move at this point is to trade queens.
16,Qe6,e7e6,r1b1kb1r/ppp2p1p/2npqp2/3N4/5p2/5N2/PPPPQ1PP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 2 9,"After this move, Black resigned because of 9. Nxc7+ forcing Black to lose the queen. Personally, I thought that this was a good game to become reacquainted to the opening. Beginners may learn from this game a stable offensive opening and to not make simple mistakes. Advanced players may have had some exposure to the opening after this game. Thanks for your time and I hope you enjoyed this annotation!"
