I enjoyed this game a lot. I did many mistakes, but somehow I feel happy because I tried to counterattack and not just do passive defence. Maybe I could have lost very easy if my opponent was a bit more cool, but in any case I managed a draw. This is a game to show that sometimes, it worths to take risks, especially when losing."
