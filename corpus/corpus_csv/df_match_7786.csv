1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,English opening to start off.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"a proper response taking control of f4 and d4. An effective move in response to the English opening.  If the opponent does not do anything to stop the pawn from moving forward, a good offense will be more difficult."
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,bringing out the knight stops the pawn from moving and also adds extra support to d5. notice the pawns at c4 may be used as an assist for the knight later on in the game.
4,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Kings gambit in response.  Black really wants that e pawn to reach e4.
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/2P5/2N2N2/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"A basic rule in chess is that you develope pieces before moving into an attack.  You'll find out that if you don't and your opponent knows what he is doing, you'll run out of pieces before you can checkmate.  Typically you want to develope your knights before bishops.  Here the knight at f3 can attack the pawn at e5 but respectfully the pawn can attack the knight.  But the knight can move to d4 and attack f pawn.  Black would have to scramble another pawn out there and by turn 4 have no power pieces developed. Black only has two pawns out and we dont want to lose tempo to empty threats.  So we develope pieces."
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/2n5/4pp2/2P5/2N2N2/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,Knight to c6 to protect e pawn.
7,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/2n5/4pp2/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"d4 looks risky by losing a center pawn, but in truth it will end well for white.  There will be an even trade but white's queen will be developed."
8,exd4,e5d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/2n5/5p2/2Pp4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,The trade begins
9,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/2n5/5p2/2PN4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,Now white has two power pieces developed and a pawn while black only has one unprotected pawn.
10,Nxd4,c6d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/5p2/2Pn4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,Now white has two power pieces developed and a pawn while black only has one unprotected pawn.
11,Qxd4,d1d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/5p2/2PQ4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 6,Now white has two power pieces developed and a pawn while black only has one unprotected pawn.
12,d6,d7d6,r1bqkbnr/ppp3pp/3p4/5p2/2PQ4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 0 7,letting the bishop out while keeping white from getting a central pawn.
13,Bf4,c1f4,r1bqkbnr/ppp3pp/3p4/5p2/2PQ1B2/2N5/PP2PPPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 1 7,Dark bishop developed.  Black pawn is stuck and also limiting black's light bishop movement.
14,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/ppp3pp/3p1n2/5p2/2PQ1B2/2N5/PP2PPPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 2 8,black finaly begins to develope but white is already ahead in tempo.
15,e3,e2e3,r1bqkb1r/ppp3pp/3p1n2/5p2/2PQ1B2/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 8,"freeing up the bishop.
One thing I have recently learned is that you don't want to waist your pawns in movement.  Only move forward two spaces if you have to or if it is an obvious move."
16,Be6,c8e6,r2qkb1r/ppp3pp/3pbn2/5p2/2PQ1B2/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 1 9,bishop comes out as far as he can to play.
17,Be2,f1e2,r2qkb1r/ppp3pp/3pbn2/5p2/2PQ1B2/2N1P3/PP2BPPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 2 9,Notice no mirror move this time.  Mirror moves dont work when your not the last one to move.
18,Be7,f8e7,r2qk2r/ppp1b1pp/3pbn2/5p2/2PQ1B2/2N1P3/PP2BPPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 3 10,Bishop stack and out into play as best it can.
19,O-O,e1g1,r2qk2r/ppp1b1pp/3pbn2/5p2/2PQ1B2/2N1P3/PP2BPPP/R4RK1 b kq - 4 10,Well we're done developing. It's time to king-side castle and enter into mid-game.
20,c5,c7c5,r2qk2r/pp2b1pp/3pbn2/2p2p2/2PQ1B2/2N1P3/PP2BPPP/R4RK1 w kq - 0 11,He apparently doesn't want my Queen there.  Where's the best place to move it?
21,Qd2,d4d2,r2qk2r/pp2b1pp/3pbn2/2p2p2/2P2B2/2N1P3/PP1QBPPP/R4RK1 b kq - 1 11,d2 is the best option.  The queen takes influence over the e1-a5 file.  The rooks control the back row and the move is mindful not to block the bishops.
22,Qd7,d8d7,r3k2r/pp1qb1pp/3pbn2/2p2p2/2P2B2/2N1P3/PP1QBPPP/R4RK1 w kq - 2 12,"The queen was the last power piece for black to develope. He does not want to give up the queen's influence on the d file because White's queen has great counter influence. Black hasn't castled yet either which is not good for black.  But it is still uncertain whether he should castle king or queen side.  Both options looks risky because black has moved both c and f pawn into play.  See now why it's a better idea to use your pawns wisely and not to try to devoure the board?  It is better to trade power piece for power piece instead of have an opponent take a pawn and then trade power pieces.  In chess, every little pawn counts (even if it's used as a diversion)"
