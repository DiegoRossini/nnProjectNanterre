White begins with d3, known as the Mieses opening (I had to look that up as I've never seen that opening)."

Qd4  This move initially concerned me as all I saw was White's Q and DSB bearing down on h6 and White's N ready to jump in and fork Black's K and R.  After a bit I was able to develop a plan.  (as an aside, in my post game review with Fritz, it recommended 19. Ng5+  hxg5 20. Bxd5  This would have changed the game quite a bit as Black would have had to move Rf7 to c7 to avoid being taken and to protect Nc6.)"

My thought was to chase White's Q away or exchange Q's and try to get to an endgame with the pawn advantage.  However, I believe that 20...Nd4 would have been a better move.  When discussing this with my opponent (after move 20), he indicated had I gone 20...Nd4, he would have moved 21. Kf2, likely to avoid the potential fork.  From Nd4, Black could have exchanged the N for White's LSB, thereby eliminating White's B-pair.  As will be seen, Black had to give back his pawn advantage to break up that pair."
