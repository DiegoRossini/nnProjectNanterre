This 4.d3? move was first played by Blackburne back in 1896 and he actually went on to win the game - a rare feat for white in this opening. 
4.d3? was popular in a tournament in Dubai in 1986, with black winning nearly every game. 
As far as I can find it has NEVER been played by a GM.
Mark Hebden played as black against 4.d3? in 1987 and went on to win."

A poor move, allowing development of my Queen's bishop 'for free'. 
Much better for white was 9.c3! fxe4 10.Ng5"

It is a well-known fact in chess: bad moves always come in pairs.
15.Bh4 e4 16.Bxc6 Rxc6 is much better for white.

It sacrifices the e-pawn and the potentially powerful push 17. ... e4.
If 17. ... e4 18.Nxg5? Bxf2  19.Kh1 e3 and it's game over.
However after 17. ... e4 18.Nd4! Bxd4 19.cxd4 Rxd4 20.Bc2 Rfd8 21.Bxd3 exd3 Black goes into the rook & pawn endgame clearly better but hardly a clear win. These endgames are notoriously 'drawish'."
