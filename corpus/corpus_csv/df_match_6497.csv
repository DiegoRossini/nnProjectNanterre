1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,simple enough...
2,b6,b7b6,rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/1p6/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Owen's Defence - Black plans a hypermodern approach with a fianchetto
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/1p6/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"fianchetto, and targets the e-pawn"
4,Bb7,c8b7,rn1qkbnr/pbpppppp/1p6/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"fianchetto, and targets the e-pawn"
5,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qkbnr/pbpppppp/1p6/8/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 3,"The pawn is defended easily enough. White follows through with the 'knights before bishops' idea, though I have to say, I never knew why. There is also this other saying, about how, when you've worked out the best rook to place on the open file, you should move the other one. Weird... though this might be beginner chess ignorance talking... okay, enough with that rambling, back to the game..."
6,g6,g7g6,rn1qkbnr/pbpppp1p/1p4p1/8/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"White goes with 'knights before bishops' - Black goes with 'bishops before knights!' Again, playing hypermodernly - though perhaps too much so? we'll see... ['hindsight moves' stop here]"
7,Bc4,f1c4,rn1qkbnr/pbpppp1p/1p4p1/8/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"White applies a bit of pressure to the f7 square - a traditional target point for White, it seems"
8,Bg7,f8g7,rn1qk1nr/pbppppbp/1p4p1/8/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,now both my bishops are on strong diagonals :)
9,d3,d2d3,rn1qk1nr/pbppppbp/1p4p1/8/2B1P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"interesting.... White would be perfectly safe going for the traditional centre here, and why he didn't do so is a bit of a mystery..."
10,e6,e7e6,rn1qk1nr/pbpp1pbp/1p2p1p1/8/2B1P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"...not that I'm one to talk! :P I am going for a defence idea mentioned by id=nuntar in my very first annotation [These are most likely not the best lines for Black - but I had planned this from the very beginning, so this is more of an 'experiment game' if you will...]"
11,O-O,e1g1,rn1qk1nr/pbpp1pbp/1p2p1p1/8/2B1P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 6,natural....
12,Ne7,g8e7,rn1qk2r/pbppnpbp/1p2p1p1/8/2B1P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 7,and logical (Nf3 right now is met by the very annoying e5)
13,Bb3,c4b3,rn1qk2r/pbppnpbp/1p2p1p1/8/4P3/1BNP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 3 7,"I really can't understand this move... maybe White is cautious of a future attack on the bishop, but surely he would be better off with a normal developing move?"
14,Nbc6,b8c6,r2qk2r/pbppnpbp/1pn1p1p1/8/4P3/1BNP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 4 8,"I considered d6/Nd7 for awhile, but found that way too passive, so I played this move instead... but I'm already starting to notice a few problem areas for Black - namely, the limited scope of the e7 knight and queen... that could pose a problem for me later on"
15,Bd2,c1d2,r2qk2r/pbppnpbp/1pn1p1p1/8/4P3/1BNP1N2/PPPB1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 5 8,"luckily for me, White doesn't seem to be playing the most aggressive lines, which means that Black's hypermodern approach is doing ok... now Black delivers the first punch..."
16,d5,d7d5,r2qk2r/pbp1npbp/1pn1p1p1/3p4/4P3/1BNP1N2/PPPB1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 9,"hoping to create some space for my pieces (namely, the knight and queen) Black has more control of d5 than White in this position"
17,exd5,e4d5,r2qk2r/pbp1npbp/1pn1p1p1/3P4/8/1BNP1N2/PPPB1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 9,more space - I got what I wished for :)
18,exd5,e6d5,r2qk2r/pbp1npbp/1pn3p1/3p4/8/1BNP1N2/PPPB1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 10,more space - I got what I wished for :)
19,Re1,f1e1,r2qk2r/pbp1npbp/1pn3p1/3p4/8/1BNP1N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QR1K1 b kq - 1 10,rook to open file - that knight could prove to be a problem for Black
20,Qd6,d8d6,r3k2r/pbp1npbp/1pnq2p1/3p4/8/1BNP1N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QR1K1 w kq - 2 11,"Black brings out his queen, and reserves castling options... he also starts to formulate a plan of his own involving - what else? - the two bishops"
21,a3,a2a3,r3k2r/pbp1npbp/1pnq2p1/3p4/8/PBNP1N2/1PPB1PPP/R2QR1K1 b kq - 0 11,"I have no idea what White intends with this move (to stop Nb4, maybe, but why would Black want to do that?)"
22,Nd4,c6d4,r3k2r/pbp1npbp/1p1q2p1/3p4/3n4/PBNP1N2/1PPB1PPP/R2QR1K1 w kq - 1 12,Phase #1 of my plan - get rid of the knight on f3!
