1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,This is taken from a recent team match. I haven't done too well in team matches for some reason. Also my rating has recently plummeted. I am hoping this marks a change in direction for my rating. I hope you enjoy the game feel free to comment
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 2,This is the Reti - not an opening I know very well at all so I was looking forward to the challenge
3,d3,d2d3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/8/3P1N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,"I like this move as it stakes a claim on the centre and should white play e4 he will lose a pawn and the right to castle with something like e4, dxe4, Qxd1+, Kxd1,Nxe4"
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/8/3P1N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"I like this move as it stakes a claim on the centre and should white play e4 he will lose a pawn and the right to castle with something like e4, dxe4, Qxd1+, Kxd1,Nxe4"
5,h3,h2h3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/8/3P1N1P/PPP1PPP1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,To be frank this move seems a bit of a waste in this position as I am not clear there is a lot of point in playing something like Bg4. Perhaps someone better versed in this opening can offer some thoughts.
6,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2pp4/8/3P1N1P/PPP1PPP1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,In the Gameknot database this move is not successful for black however I wanted to play this before I moved Nc6
7,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2pp2B1/8/3P1N1P/PPP1PPP1/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,Possibly better in this position would be e6 however I wasn't too worried about the possbility of doubled pawns just yet and I certainly would be happy to exchange a bishop for my knight at this time.
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/2pp2B1/8/3P1N1P/PPP1PPP1/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,Possibly better in this position would be e6 however I wasn't too worried about the possbility of doubled pawns just yet and I certainly would be happy to exchange a bishop for my knight at this time.

12,e5,e7e5,r1bqkb1r/pp3p1p/2n2p2/2ppp3/8/3P1NPP/PPP1PP2/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,I can't help but feel this isn't the best move for white as now he is going to take a while to get his queen active
13,Nbd2,b1d2,r1bqkb1r/pp3p1p/2n2p2/2ppp3/8/3P1NPP/PPPNPP2/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 7,I can't help but feel this isn't the best move for white as now he is going to take a while to get his queen active
14,Bg7,f8g7,r1bqk2r/pp3pbp/2n2p2/2ppp3/8/3P1NPP/PPPNPP2/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 8,"I once played a much higher ranked player who put his bishop in front of his king to take the place of a missing pawn, I figured that this would be a good game for me to try that out. With hindsight I think my logic is a little flawed as white has lost his dsb and so I should be looking to take advantage of that fact by using my dsb"
