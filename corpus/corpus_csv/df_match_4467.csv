1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"It was a nice sharp game by white, I've sacrificed a pawn to activate my a rook, then white managed to exchange a knight for three pawns and exposed my king in consequence of this, for some more moves I tried to explore the more active pieces I had and attack black's castle but my opponent found all the appropriate defenses so when draw was proposed I accepted immediately..."

17,c3,c2c3,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2pn2p1/3p4/3P4/2P1BNP1/PP1NPPBP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 9,the pawn structure is again symmetrical...
18,Qb6,d8b6,rnb2rk1/pp2ppbp/1qpn2p1/3p4/3P4/2P1BNP1/PP1NPPBP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 1 10,now white needs a4 to prevent black's a4
19,Nb3,d2b3,rnb2rk1/pp2ppbp/1qpn2p1/3p4/3P4/1NP1BNP1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 2 10,now white needs a4 to prevent black's a4

I think he will chose Nc5 as his previous move might indicate he wants to exchange dark squared bishops and Nd2 prevents that...
