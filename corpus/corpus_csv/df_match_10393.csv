Since most people here seem fascinated with miniatures or spectacular and/or unusually mates, I figured this is a good one to feature.  It is so simple it is often overlooked.  It is both quick and spectacular.  Hopefully you won't see this or any variant of it while playing an experienced player.  I certainly hope you are never on the receiving end of one of these!  It is usually referred to as the ""Fool's Mate"".

Has this simple mate ever really been played?  Yes, plenty of times.  I've even delivered a number of variants before...because I enjoy teaching people how to play chess.

If you haven't come across a variant of this game in real life before, then you have not played enough chess.  When playing beginners, it is not an everyday occurrence but nonetheless it is quite common.

The problem arises from white voluntarily opening his e1-h4 diagonal to attack by Black's Queen.  1. f4 is not so bad, but the follow up of 2. g4 is disastrous."

He could have played 1. ... e5 too, but that would likely prompt fxe5 and the game would have lasted longer than it did.  Longer versions of this mate are played quite often, but the weakness that creates the opportunity is always the same."

Carelessly playing the king-side pawns can get many players into trouble quickly.  This can happen at most anytime during the opening...so be careful."

If it ever happens to you, let it be a lesson so that it never happens again. 

The King cannot move out of check, the attacking piece cannot be captured, nor can another of White's pieces move to block the attack.  It's checkmate.   It's usually not a good idea to move the f and g pawns out together like this. 

Either side can perform this mate (likely with additional moves) when those two pawns are move out together.   An open e1-h4 or e8-h5 diagonal when the King is block in by its own pieces provides the opportunity."
