1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Here's a loss in a Training Tournament I was invited into.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Sicilian - my favourite, though, according to my Personal Database here in Gameknot, I'm not too successful with it..."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,The Najdorf Variation - still my favourite.
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,The Najdorf Variation - still my favourite.
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,The Najdorf Variation - still my favourite.
6,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,The Najdorf Variation - still my favourite.
7,Nxd4,f3d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,The Najdorf Variation - still my favourite.
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,The Najdorf Variation - still my favourite.
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,The Najdorf Variation - still my favourite.
10,a6,a7a6,rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,The Najdorf Variation - still my favourite.
11,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"White's strongest continuation, I believe."
12,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"Although the Najdorf is supposed to enable ...e5, it's not a move I've ever played in this position, preferring the more flexible ...e6.  Perhaps I should try ...e5?"
13,f4,f2f4,rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/6B1/3NPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,This is a well-worn trail.  I think White's chances are better but Black has good counter-attacking options if White slips up.
14,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/1p2bppp/p2ppn2/6B1/3NPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,This is a well-worn trail.  I think White's chances are better but Black has good counter-attacking options if White slips up.

17,O-O-O,e1c1,rnb1k2r/1pq1bppp/p2ppn2/6B1/3NPP2/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/2KR1B1R b kq - 4 9,"The recommended move.  White is preparing an all out attack on Black's position, wherever the King goes."
18,Nbd7,b8d7,r1b1k2r/1pqnbppp/p2ppn2/6B1/3NPP2/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/2KR1B1R w kq - 5 10,"The recommended move.  White is preparing an all out attack on Black's position, wherever the King goes."

21,a3,a2a3,r1b1k2r/2qnbppp/p2ppn2/1p4B1/3NPPP1/P1N2Q2/1PP4P/2KR1B1R b kq - 0 11,"A critical decision point for Black.  The B is needed to support the pawn on d6 but has counter-attacking potential on the long black diagonal.  Both the N and B, if they recapture, are vulnerable to pawn thrusts.  Recapturing with the pawn doubles the pawns on the f-file but opens the g-file for Black's rook.  If the B stays on e7 it is virtually paralysed and in many variations difficult to protect from attack by White's knights."
22,Bb7,c8b7,r3k2r/1bqnbppp/p2ppn2/1p4B1/3NPPP1/P1N2Q2/1PP4P/2KR1B1R w kq - 1 12,"A critical decision point for Black.

25,f5,f4f5,r3k2r/1bqnbp1p/p2ppp2/1p3P2/3NP1P1/P1N2Q2/1PP4P/2KR1B1R b kq - 0 13,White immediately seeks to disturb the wall.
26,e5,e6e5,r3k2r/1bqnbp1p/p2p1p2/1p2pP2/3NP1P1/P1N2Q2/1PP4P/2KR1B1R w kq - 0 14,"While the King was still in the centre, this seemed the safest option but it gave White control of the White squares and left the Bishop very vulnerable."

In another game, happening more or less simultaneously, White played 14. Nd5, which seemed to cause me more immediate problems and also won, but I probably made mistakes in that game too ..."
28,O-O-O,e8c8,2kr3r/1bqnbp1p/p2p1p2/1p2pP2/4P1P1/PNN2Q2/1PP4P/2KR1B1R w - - 2 15,"Now we're moving into the middle game where tactics are used by both sides either to force a quick mate, material superiority or a conclusive strategic advantage.  Failing that, a draw through repetition is often an option.  White still has the initiative here but if he's too slow to prosecute the attack, Black can quickly counter-attack."
29,Kb1,c1b1,2kr3r/1bqnbp1p/p2p1p2/1p2pP2/4P1P1/PNN2Q2/1PP4P/1K1R1B1R b - - 3 15,White first moves off the vulnerable c-file and prepares to occupy that file with his Rook.  Black would do well to follow suit but I don't want to use that tempo with a quiet King move.  I choose to attack...
30,Nc5,d7c5,2kr3r/1bq1bp1p/p2p1p2/1pn1pP2/4P1P1/PNN2Q2/1PP4P/1K1R1B1R w - - 4 16,"This move frees up Black's position at the rear somewhat, giving the KB some protection from the Queen and also puts pressure on White's e-pawn and threatens to swap off one of White's King's defenders... either that or to go to a4 and attack the King's position directly, but to be truly dangerous, Black needs to get his Rook on the c-file."
31,Nc1,b3c1,2kr3r/1bq1bp1p/p2p1p2/1pn1pP2/4P1P1/P1N2Q2/1PP4P/1KNR1B1R b - - 5 16,"He who runs away lives to fight another day, as a chess club colleague is wont to say...Now White can push Black's N back with b4."
32,Qb6,c7b6,2kr3r/1b2bp1p/pq1p1p2/1pn1pP2/4P1P1/P1N2Q2/1PP4P/1KNR1B1R w - - 6 17,Black supports a potential push with his own b-pawn but more urgent was moving the King off the c-file.
33,Nc1a2,c1a2,2kr3r/1b2bp1p/pq1p1p2/1pn1pP2/4P1P1/P1N2Q2/NPP4P/1K1R1B1R b - - 7 17,White patiently manoeuvres his knight to a strong square and supports the other knight.
34,Bc6,b7c6,2kr3r/4bp1p/pqbp1p2/1pn1pP2/4P1P1/P1N2Q2/NPP4P/1K1R1B1R w - - 8 18,This move prepares ...a5 by over-defending b5 but again the King move is preferable.
