6,exd4,e5d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"I wanted to try counterplay against 4...Nf6, but the computer hits me with this aggressive move. It looks like a good move because of the double attack on the knight, and also the next target is f2, which can be attacked via ...Qf6."
7,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"I wanted to try counterplay against 4...Nf6, but the computer hits me with this aggressive move. It looks like a good move because of the double attack on the knight, and also the next target is f2, which can be attacked via ...Qf6."
8,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b5/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"I wanted to try counterplay against 4...Nf6, but the computer hits me with this aggressive move.

9,Nf5,d4f5,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b2N2/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,"!? I had considered 3 possible candidates for this move, where (5.c3 Nxd4 6.cxd4) strong pawn center, (5.Be3 Nxd4 6.Bxd4 Bxd4 7.Qxd4) is okay but not special, and then the text move in this game where I expected (5.Nf5 Qf6 6.Ne3) blocks the attack at f2 while making for an interesting game, or even (6.Be3) can be played for some fun."
10,Bf8,c5f8,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/5N2/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 3 6,"? Weak, better is ...Qf6 ^ ...g6."
11,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B3N2/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 4 6,"Playing aggressively, this is a psuedo pin, meaning it is not a pin yet, but it can be, and the bishop line to the king is nice."
12,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1B3N2/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 5 7,"?! Seems a little dubious because ...a6 is better, and Nc3 holds e4."
13,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1B3N2/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 6 7,"?! This weakens the kingside. Perhaps ...Bg7 is the plan afterwards, but Nh6 can be uncomfortable for black."
14,g6,g7g6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1p1p/2n2np1/1B3N2/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"?! This weakens the kingside. Perhaps ...Bg7 is the plan afterwards, but Nh6 can be uncomfortable for black."
15,Nh6,f5h6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1p1p/2n2npN/1B6/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 8,"!? +/= Played to disrupt operations kingside, prevents castling."
16,Bb4,f8b4,r1bqk2r/pppp1p1p/2n2npN/1B6/1b2P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 9,"?! Normally this move would be good, but in this case ..d6 looks better because black will want to castle queenside and should be making moves that fit that plan."
17,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqk2r/pppp1p1p/2n2npN/1B4B1/1b2P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 3 9,!? Applying a strong pin. White has castling options to either side so Bxc3 creates no problems.
18,d6,d7d6,r1bqk2r/ppp2p1p/2np1npN/1B4B1/1b2P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 10,"?? Better is ...Be7 to break the pin, now the knight and the rook will be lost."
19,Qf3,d1f3,r1bqk2r/ppp2p1p/2np1npN/1B4B1/1b2P3/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 1 10,++/- Losing material is unavoidable for black.

21,Qxc3,f3c3,r1bqk2r/ppp2p1p/2np1npN/1B4B1/4P3/2Q5/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 0 11,"? Hoping to achieve 0-0-0 before a serious attack unfolds, but this move although needed is not the best now, ...Rf8 is better."

23,Bxf6,g5f6,r2qk2r/ppp2p1p/2npbBpN/1B6/4P3/2Q5/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 0 12,"?! The text move seemed reasonable at the time it was played, but I feel that 14.Qf6 ! is better due to positional pressure it achieves."
24,Qd7,d8d7,r3k2r/pppq1p1p/2npbBpN/1B6/4P3/2Q5/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 1 13,"?! The text move seemed reasonable at the time it was played, but I feel that 14.Qf6 ! is better due to positional pressure it achieves."

30,Re8,d8e8,1k2r3/pppq1p1p/2npb1pN/1B6/3BP3/2Q4P/PPP2PP1/R3K2R w KQ - 1 16,"A veiled threat against the king, but there is not enough time to achieve it. Its hard to recommend better. Black should want to attack the knight, but how can this be accomplished? Probably some pawn moves could have been played to this strategy, but even that seems very difficult to implement."
31,a4,a2a4,1k2r3/pppq1p1p/2npb1pN/1B6/P2BP3/2Q4P/1PP2PP1/R3K2R b KQ - 0 16,"Attempting to draw attention to the bishop and elicit the move ...a6 to weaken the kingside, and provides a cover for the motive of attaining 17.Be2 to assist the mobility of the knight."
