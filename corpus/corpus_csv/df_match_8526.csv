1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everybody.

Over the past few days I have been playing a game with a very strong near-Master called Lighttotheright (Ken).  He decided to kick off with e4 and play the Vienna Gambit.  I accepted it but was it the right thing to do?  The jury is out as the action unfolds."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,2. Nc3 - this move characterises the Vienna Game.  Instead of attacking the pawn on e5 the knight defends the pawn on e4.
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,2. Nc3 - this move characterises the Vienna Game.  Instead of attacking the pawn on e5 the knight defends the pawn on e4.
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,3. f4 - the Vienna Gambit.
5,f4,f2f4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,3. f4 - the Vienna Gambit.
6,exf4,e5f4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/8/4Pp2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"3. ....... exf4?! - The Vienna Gambit Accepted.  This is not a good acceptance though because the knight on f6 can be driven back by the pawn thrust e5 as I found out to my chagrin on move 4.  Black therefore loses tempo grabbing the f pawn - not very good against a player 400 points north of my rating.  

Ken had this to say about that move:- Instead of 3. ... exf4, d5 was more appropriate. It is sharper, but it tends to give White more problems. ***** This variation is somewhat more similar to the King's Gambit. I already much prefer White's position. But we are still well within established theory. You still have plenty of chances to defend adequately.My punishment, however, was not overly severe as you will find when you read on."
7,e5,e4e5,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4P3/5p2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,5. Nf3 - development - and black has no pieces out.  Over the next couple of moves I find I need to move pawns in order to facilitate piece development.
8,Ng8,f6g8,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/5p2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,5. Nf3 - development - and black has no pieces out.  Over the next couple of moves I find I need to move pawns in order to facilitate piece development.
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/5p2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,5. Nf3 - development - and black has no pieces out.  Over the next couple of moves I find I need to move pawns in order to facilitate piece development.
10,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4P3/5p2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,7. Qe2 - the Wicked Witch of the West comes to e2 - although she blocks in the white lsb she causes major problems in pinning my e pawn.  I look at the db options and I realise that if I choose Be6 which seems the best of the bunch I see a very nasty queen fork on b5 where the b7 pawn will fall leaving a gaping hole in my queenside pawns.  No thank you!  So I rack my brains and come up with c6 - another pawn move.  Now Ken picks off the gambited pawns.
