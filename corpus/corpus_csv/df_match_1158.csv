1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The white's second choice, normally made by opponents who want to avoid the tactics of the other responses (like Icelandic gambit) and tends to an interesting but somewhat predictable game. In which black is who has the advantage, if white's game is suboptimal."

4,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3pPb2/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,IMO this move has to be done. I don't now (now I want to learn :-P) how to play this with e3 blocking my own lsb.
5,Nf3,g1f3,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3pPb2/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 3,"Here, I am accepting that my lsb can be exchanged with some manouvering by white. This would be ok to me, because as a payment for it, in the meantime black starts his own plans on the queenside."
6,e6,e7e6,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3pPb2/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Here, I am accepting that my lsb can be exchanged with some manouvering by white. This would be ok to me, because as a payment for it, in the meantime black starts his own plans on the queenside."
7,d4,d2d4,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3pPb2/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"This seems natural: white doesn't want to block his own lsb with d3, and he wants to disclose his dsb's action, a nomal and sound developement plan. c3 can still be played, but also c4 (for some reason I don't see this move played very often)."
8,a6,a7a6,rn1qkbnr/1pp2ppp/p3p3/3pPb2/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"If I play c5 at once (obviously both side's taget is to play the c pawn as strongly as possible), White has Bb5+. I can play it (both with Nc6 or c6, or Nd7), but it's a game I don't like, so I sacrifice an important tempo so to stop that check."
9,Bg5,c1g5,rn1qkbnr/1pp2ppp/p3p3/3pPbB1/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"Natural aggressive move by white. The e5 outpost must be used. If I want to play f6, the game becomes wilde at once, and I won't bet for Black, then. The Q is not better placed on d7 (if I moved c6 or c4 instead of a6, the Q happily escapes on the black squares, with threats on White). So I have to use a minor piece on e7, or I have to be prepared to face exf6, Nxf6, and the subsequent weaknes of e6, defended only by the lsb, stucked in a vulnerable position (Nh4 and B has to choose whether to allow or not NxB, e6xN...)"
10,Be7,f8e7,rn1qk1nr/1pp1bppp/p3p3/3pPbB1/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,"I decided to go for a not-so-complicated game, and played this. If I use the Nd7, I have to be prepared to kick the dsb or to lose the chance for an inmediate c5. The problem is that if the dsb is exchanged, I'll lose the proper support for c5 altogether..."
11,Bxe7,g5e7,rn1qk1nr/1pp1Bppp/p3p3/3pPb2/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,(White could have supported the B on g5 with Qd2)
12,Qxe7,d8e7,rn2k1nr/1pp1qppp/p3p3/3pPb2/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"I'll follow this ""surprise"" plan. I feel I kind of ""must"" be able to play c5 ASAP, based on many previous games. I chess, often you are forced to play your most aggressive plan just to avoid to be attacked too strongly."
13,c3,c2c3,rn2k1nr/1pp1qppp/p3p3/3pPb2/3P4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"White wants to keep it quiet, so he opts for this passive, profilactic move. He spots that Qb4+ is threatened, and the Q seems to be able to cause some troubles (the subsequent Qxb2 is double-edge, since after Ng1 moves, Rg1 attacks b7, but white was right to defend. White's move would be sound but for the fact that this way white deprives himself from c4. And this attacking move is to be on white's agenda as strongly as black put c5 as his target."
14,c5,c7c5,rn2k1nr/1p2qppp/p3p3/2ppPb2/3P4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,"It's true that the BQ delays black's Ng8 developement, but hey, it's so useful due to its action on both c6 and b4..."
15,Bd3,f1d3,rn2k1nr/1p2qppp/p3p3/2ppPb2/3P4/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 1 8,"Right. If black goes c4, white will exchange and he will open a hole on e6. I can play Nh6 (no lsb to threat it anymore), but I considered that the best use for this B was, strangely, to eliminate the Nf3. This will make d4 much more vulnerable, and this is my target in this line. Nc6 will be a safe (due to a6) attacking developement. If I remove the Nf3, white will be forced to retake d4 with c3, and it will allow Qb4..."
16,Bg4,f5g4,rn2k1nr/1p2qppp/p3p3/2ppP3/3P2b1/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 2 9,"Let's see white's reaction. It's normal to be glad of a BxN exchange, and the BQ is not in position to land on b6 or h5 soon. But white wants to play his own Q on b3 or a5, and doesn't want black to leave the N at g2's defence, so not to scramble his castling if BxN is played by Black."
17,Be2,d3e2,rn2k1nr/1p2qppp/p3p3/2ppP3/3P2b1/2P2N2/PP2BPPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 3 9,"This way, the Q is free to go to b3, and anyway black could well have kicked it out with c4 on the next move."
18,Bxf3,g4f3,rn2k1nr/1p2qppp/p3p3/2ppP3/3P4/2P2b2/PP2BPPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 10,...but white probably doesn't expect this!
19,Bxf3,e2f3,rn2k1nr/1p2qppp/p3p3/2ppP3/3P4/2P2B2/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 0 10,"The threat here is to force white to retake on d4 with c3 - not the Q. This will allow Qb4+. White has not too much to be scared about, thoug: Qd2 defends b2. Black will go on with Qb6, pressing on d4..."
20,Nc6,b8c6,r3k1nr/1p2qppp/p1n1p3/2ppP3/3P4/2P2B2/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 1 11,"The threat here is to force white to retake on d4 with c3 - not the Q. This will allow Qb4+. White has not too much to be scared about, thoug: Qd2 defends b2. Black will go on with Qb6, pressing on d4..."

22,cxd4,c5d4,r3k1nr/1p2qppp/p1n1p3/3pP3/3p4/2P2B2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 0 12,"A sad necessity. You'd say that those pawns are strong, but in fact..."

24,Qb4,e7b4,r3k1nr/1p3ppp/p1n1p3/3pP3/1q1P4/5B2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 1 13,"Normally, black's plan is Rc8 and Nb4, so to threat c2. But my dislodged Q is threatening d4 as well, so this is a hard to meet fork on white's pawns. White may well think in ""emergency plans"" like Bxd5!?, and if black takes with e6xd5, e6! will be very strong, even if Black plays Nxd4 (Re1 is a good resource for white. And no matter if Qxb2, since after Ng-d2, Rg1 will revenge on b7."
25,a3,a2a3,r3k1nr/1p3ppp/p1n1p3/3pP3/1q1P4/P4B2/1P3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 0 13,"White can't avoid Qxd4, and prefers to force it by kicking my Q into it so to exchange it, returning to a quiet position. But in doing so, omits..."
