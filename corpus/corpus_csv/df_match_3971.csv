1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Here is another game in the themed Sicilian Pelikan, Bird variation MT started by Matthew (Concordborn).  This time the result goes in my favour.  Although I win a pawn in the middlegame, Matthew works it so that we end up with opposite colour bishops and he sets up a Joblock style defensive formation.  However, I keep both pairs of rooks on and my extra pawn, a passed pawn, ties his rooks down to stopping it from getting to Glendadom on a8.  However, it was very difficult for me to make headway because Fou Leblanc was also tied to the defense of my a and c pawns.  It looked to be heading for a Low Draw until Matthew walked into a pin and one little pawn push proved decisive.  Here is the gameknot analysis version.http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17446461&rnd=0.9831448610802258."
