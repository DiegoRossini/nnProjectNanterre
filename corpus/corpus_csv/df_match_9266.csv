This is different to a discovered check because the piece which is in line with the discovery is not the king.  The king is in check though and black must deal with that.

So black now drops the exchange.

Black's best move, which avoids immediate material loss is Nf3 and after Rb3, Rf2, but then I will play a4 and how can black preserve her knight and stop Glenda from making an appearance on a8?

Here is the answer.  Black timed out!  I gained 9.2 points out of this and this brought up my current rating, 1721 - my highest rating so far on gameknot and in my entire life.  At least it will take more than one bad loss to put me under the 1700 watermark.  I just hope I can carry on the good work and have more won games up in this gallery!

Cheers everyone!
