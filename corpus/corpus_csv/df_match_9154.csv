With quick apology to the landlady of our host club, I hastened to my car and up the A34 to Oxford.  I had 25 minutes to beat the time-out and made it with 4 minutes to spare.  My opponent had also arrived late, so I was only about 7 minutes behind on the clock..."

A few years ago I got so fed up with facing this boring riposte to my favourite opening that I bought Murray Chandler's book on it.  I wish I'd studied it more effectively and done my revision more recently!  In our post-match analysis, Matt admitted that he'd taken up this opening  because ""if you can't beat them, join them"".  He too had used the Chandler book to learn it."
