Nc3, so I'm inadvertently playing into one of his specialties.  I think I'll try to get c5 in so that I can dispute the center.  Since I don't feel daring enough to play a gambit, I'll set up with d6 first.  But I'll try to keep him guessing by playing Nf6 ahead of d6.  Then I'll move the c-pawn."

I could stop it with 3. ...a6 but that's too reactive of a move.  I could even play 3. ...Na6, which is really cowardly, and runs into trouble after 4. e3 (or even 4. e4?).  Perhaps I could indirectly answer the threat with 3. ...e6.  Then there is 4. Nb5 Bb4+  5. c3 Ba5.

I'm worried about e3, because it supports the d-pawn and guards the b5 square (now Nb5 can be played without worrying about Qa5+, and Bb5 can pin the knight if I play Nc6).  I was seriously thinking about playing cxd4 first to lessen the impact of an impending e3: 6. ...cxd4  7. Qxd4 Nc6; which isn't bad, but helps to bring more of his forces out [6. ...cxd4  7.

Now Qa5+, a6 and cxd4 are possible.  9. ...Qa5+  10. Qd2 Qxd2+  11. Kxd2 Ne4+ 12. Ke1 prevents castling, but the e4-knight gets shoved back after f3.  It's not a bad sequence, but I don't know if it leads to anything tangible.  After 9. ...a6 he could try either 10. Nxc6 or 10. Nc3, and then I'm totally in the dark.  I'm also fumbling around after 9. ...cxd4 because he has many options (exd4, Nxc6, even cxd5).

Then 9. ...dxc4 started to look good.  It half-opens the d-file so that my queen now looks at the d4-pawn.  So if I play dxc4 I think there are 3 replies:
1.) 10. Nxc4 Bxf4  11. exf4 and I get rid of his strong bishop, double his pawns, and perhaps pick up the d4-pawn.
2.) 10. Nxc6 bxc6 (momentary tripled c-pawns) and if 11. Bxb8 then either Rxb8 to win a pawn or cxb5, which gives me a large Queenside pawn presence, forces him to retreat the bishop (though he would get to keep it, and thus hold the dark diagonal) and I also win a pawn; or if instead of 11. Bxb8 he tries Nc3 then I might either do 11. ...Bxf4 or 11. ...cxd4 and pocket another pawn.
3.) And the variation that worried me most of all, 10. Bxc4 (endorsed by the computer).  I might have thought about 10. ...a6 because then 11. Nc3 cxd4  12. exd4 Qxd4 looks like it might work.  On the other hand, if instead he first tried 11. Nxc6 then 11. ...bxc6  12. Nc3 (12. Bxb8? cxb5 ouch!) Bxf4 13. exf4 and I still win a pawn on d4.

Got all that? Right, neither do I!"
