8,d6,d7d6,rn1qkbnr/pbp2ppp/1p1pp3/8/3P1B2/5N2/PPPNPPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"This remembers me a lot a previous game. I was taught: ""it's dangerous to play b6 with d6 because of the weakened white squares."
9,e4,e2e4,rn1qkbnr/pbp2ppp/1p1pp3/8/3PPB2/5N2/PPPN1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"I better play d4 now, while I still can."
10,Nd7,b8d7,r2qkbnr/pbpn1ppp/1p1pp3/8/3PPB2/5N2/PPPN1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,? Too impulsive. Black can easily play c6 and kick it.
