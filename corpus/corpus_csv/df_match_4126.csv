(It's unfortunate that sometimes chess players are tested and 'fail' because the chess player is unable to respond with the correct chess tradition of the questioner).

I know strong players who don't use this Variation as they believe White ends up with a backwards Pawn for the rest of the game.  They'd be right, until White loses the pawn of course.

After getting my head around Opening i hope to concentrate more on the Tarrasch variation 3.Nd2"
