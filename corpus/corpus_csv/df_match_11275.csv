Not snatch pawns like my opponent did, or just trading pieces. Chess is about tactics, and strategy. Just because a trade is in front of you does not mean you have to take it, think first.....Always look for mate.

My strategy and always is to constrict my opponents by its own pieces."

One of my approach in chess is to admit DEFEAT from the get-go. I like to play losing positions. ""There is more to learn from a losing position than one you are winning"" by father always say."
