10,Bf5,c8f5,r2qkbnr/ppp3pp/2n2p2/3ppb2/3P3B/2N1P3/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,"presumably with the plan of Nb4, -i figured this wasn't much of a problem as Bd3?! would give me a chance to exchange a fairly useless piece for one of blacks developed pieces - as well as giving me a fairly solid centre witha pawn on d3. The open c file that would result i thought would be better for me as i clearly plan to castle kingside - whereas blacks kingside is less strong, therefore i thought i could take advantage of the weak f6 pawn with a little central pressure."

13,Nxd5,c3d5,r2qkbnr/ppp3pp/5p2/3Nnb2/7B/4P3/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 7,that knight on e7 seems to be a real problem for black - i expected it to have been moved by now to somewhere out the way - i like white's position here - but if black defends correctly i dont think he should have too many problems. White's extra pawn and more forward development is i think equalled by blacks potentially huge firepower down the centre. the queen's lack of flight squares could be a problem.
