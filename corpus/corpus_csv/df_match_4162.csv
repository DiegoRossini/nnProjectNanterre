22 h4 Qg2!? 23 Rf1! and there is simply nothing black is threatening or can do against Nxc7. 

Then I found Qf5! and the mate threat stops and immediate Nxc7, giving black enough time and a decent position. So I went for this variation after all happily"

I had a good long think here and played e3 because I think white has only one really good reply and possibly the others aren't that good, getting black back in the game. So its at least giving white a tough choice in this complicated position"

23 Nxe3! is I think the strongest move for white.
It should continue 23 Nxe3 Qxe7 24 bxa6 Rxa6 or something, with pawns and open king for the piece and the exchange"
