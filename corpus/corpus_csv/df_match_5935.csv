1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The biggest mistake beginners make in chess to develope the queen to early. Normally when the queen comes out, the other player may develope for free by attacking it which results in a early offensive buried by a flood of enemy pieces. But in this case, it works and I´m going to try here to explain why."
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Up till this point this has been a standard queen´s pawn opening, I think this variation is called the Keres Defense. Black however makes an early mistake here. White will not take this pawn, as it will obstruct black´s developement to no end."

5,d5,d4d5,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2pP4/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"This move is also bad. Black is utterly clogged. No knights are out. His f8 bishop is bottled up. Worse, his c8 bishop is in no position to do anything. In this situation, white can exploit the clog by Qa4 since black has no means to threaten it."

7,Qa4,d1a4,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/8/2pPp3/Q1P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 1 4,Black is now in deep trouble. His white bishop is trapped. He has to get a piece out on the board other than a pawn. Perhaps Qf6 is the best option for black here since it forces white to play defense on the right side and at least slows down the pressure.
8,h6,h7h6,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1pp1/7p/2pPp3/Q1P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"I have no idea why black did this. Bg5 would immediately be taken the queen. The threat is to black´s left side, not the right."
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1pp1/7p/2pPp3/Q1P5/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 1 5,Black latches unto a stratedgm here. Since he can´t get at the queen he´s going to get the king to opposite side of the board. Then he can finally move his d pawn and roll the queen back.
10,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk1nr/pp1pbpp1/7p/2pPp3/Q1P5/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 2 6,Black latches unto a stratedgm here. Since he can´t get at the queen he´s going to get the king to opposite side of the board. Then he can finally move his d pawn and roll the queen back.

14,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqk2r/pp1pbpp1/5n1p/2pP4/Q1P2B2/2N5/PP2P1PP/R3KBNR w KQkq - 1 8,"Black is still committed to castling. Unfortunately BxF4 prevents that. Notice here that in 4 moves since the queen is out and black still hasn´t been able to threaten it. As an asside, in chess it pays to jettison fixed plans. Qb6 needed to happen. Castling looks tempting, but black needs to put pressure on white´s line."

But there isn´t much by way of alternatives. Any move other than Qb6 and the bishop is toast. pull the bishop back and his castling plan is derailed."

However this basically gives white an opportunity to pick up more material by realizing check. Black should have taken the pawn, which still gives him the power to bring the rook into play. And he can easily pull the king back to 8 file in case of check, which white could not have attempted anyway."
