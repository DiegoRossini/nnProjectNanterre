1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"It's a very common and very easy to be developed through so many variations. Play as white, I usually start with 1. e2 e4 and hope black doesn't perform Sicilian Defense, I hate that ..."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,A common and a quite good response to 1. e2 e4 ...

5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"Actually an usual response to break Philidor's Defence is moving white pawn to d4, but I want to try something new: moving queen's knight to c3."
6,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P1b1/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,"3. ....... Bg4?
I don't know why black move the bishop to g4, it's very weak... Actually Nc6 is better..
But as long it doesn't threat my king, I let it stand here."

ANALYSIS=
How if black refuse my queen and take my knight at e5? There's no problem. I'll take the g4 bishop and performing a well developed position."
