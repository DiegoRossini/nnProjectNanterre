1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,A quick little blitz game i had on my lunch break awhile ago.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,At this point i was thinking KID.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 2,Developing my Knight and adding a defender to d4.
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,He prepares to fianchetto his dark squared bishop.
5,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,Using the wings to help control the center of the board. I also like putting my queen on the c2 square along with the light squared bishop on d3. I like having control of that b1-h7 diagonal as well as having my pieces aimed at the King side.
6,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,He fianchetto's his dark squared Bishop.
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,Develops another minor piece as well as prepares for e4.
8,d6,d7d6,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Preparing for an e5 pawn push. At this current juncture i really wasn't sure where i wanted the direction of this game to go. I tend to like having the b1-h7 diagonal open for my queen and bishop, which helps when going for a King side attack."
9,e4,e2e4,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,Taking firm control of the center of the board. Common in the KID.
10,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bqk2r/pppnppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,"Further preparation e5. If the pawn is pushed prematurely, then dxe5. If dxe5, an exchange of queens would leave black without the ability to castle."
11,Bd3,f1d3,r1bqk2r/pppnppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 6,Bolstering up the center pawn as well as getting my bishop on that diagonal.
12,e5,e7e5,r1bqk2r/pppn1pbp/3p1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"the e5 pawn push. I really didn't want a closed game, so i was very hesitant about d5."
13,Qc2,d1c2,r1bqk2r/pppn1pbp/3p1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2NB1N2/PPQ2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 1 7,Keeping the tension in the center as well as aiming my pieces at the King side.
14,exd4,e5d4,r1bqk2r/pppn1pbp/3p1np1/8/2PpP3/2NB1N2/PPQ2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 0 8,I'm not sure about this move? It breaks the tension but other than that i can't really find a purpose for taking.
15,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqk2r/pppn1pbp/3p1np1/8/2PNP3/2NB4/PPQ2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 0 8,"Taking back with the knight. Here i like my position. I wouldn't say white has a huge advantage, however white does have a lead in development as well as more space and control in the center. Black's light squared bishop is also temporarily blocked in."
16,Ne5,d7e5,r1bqk2r/ppp2pbp/3p1np1/4n3/2PNP3/2NB4/PPQ2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 1 9,I really don't want to exchange right now. I would much rather keep the complexity of the board.
17,Be2,d3e2,r1bqk2r/ppp2pbp/3p1np1/4n3/2PNP3/2N5/PPQ1BPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 2 9,Reinforcing c4. From here i wanted to get my king to a safe place and remove his knight from the center of the board. Other than that i really don't have a solid plan of action.
18,Be6,c8e6,r2qk2r/ppp2pbp/3pbnp1/4n3/2PNP3/2N5/PPQ1BPPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 3 10,Reinforcing c4. From here i wanted to get my king to a safe place and remove his knight from the center of the board. Other than that i really don't have a solid plan of action.

20,a6,a7a6,r2qk2r/1pp2pbp/p2pbnp1/4n3/2PNP3/1PN5/P1Q1BPPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 0 11,"I'm assuming this is to reinforce a b5 pawn push, however i am not entirely sure why this was played."
21,f4,f2f4,r2qk2r/1pp2pbp/p2pbnp1/4n3/2PNPP2/1PN5/P1Q1B1PP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 0 11,"I decide to exchange, doubling up his pawns."
