6,Qe7,d8e7,rnb1kbnr/ppppqppp/8/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,"3... Qe7 is a lesser accepted variation. The queen move to e7 is also seen in the Keene variation. According to my book, ""As in the Keene variation, here too Black's concept appears non-trivial."""
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1kbnr/ppppqppp/8/8/4Pp2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 4,"Black intends immediate pressure on e4. From the options of 4. e5 d6; 4. Qe2 b6 (with the idea of Ba6); 4. d3 d5; 4. d4 Qe4; 4. Nc3, 4. Nc3 is the clear favorite."
8,f6,f7f6,rnb1kbnr/ppppq1pp/5p2/8/4Pp2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"? 
Examined in my book are 4... Nf6 5. e5 d6 6. d4 de5 7. de5 Ng4 8. Bf4 Ndb7 9. Qe2 (with the idea of Qe2) and White has far superior development. 
4... d5 5. e5 c6 leads towards a line that is reminiscent of the Fisher Variation. 

Here f6 could look to a possible g5 push, but presents Black's knight with only the weak h6 square and g5 gains little."
9,d3,d2d3,rnb1kbnr/ppppq1pp/5p2/8/4Pp2/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,instead of d4 because now the e4 pawn is defended and the knight can move to d5.
