1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"For a couple of years now I feel(no statistic/scientific observation or calculation regarding chose of openings) I have been kind of lacking aggressive play and have been too worried and concerned about doing the theoretically basic right moves. With 1300 games played here at GK I should have more than enough experience by now... but are still in lack of theoretical knowledge due to low interest in theory(books etc), which I believe certainly will improve my play. 

I have recently decided to start playing more aggressive and intuitive and try to mix it with my experience and so hopefully that will help me improve my rating. Anyway I think it will be funnier to play(started to be a bit bored with my play) :-)"
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"French defense opening, which has a reputation for solidity and resilience, though it can result in a somewhat cramped game for Black in the early stages. Black often gains counterattacking possibilities on the queen-side while White tends to concentrate on the kingside(wikipedia.com)."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,White expands his claim on the centre.
4,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk1nr/ppppbppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,I have never met this 2nd move by black. To me it appears as a drawback considering fighting for control in the centre.
5,f4,f2f4,rnbqk1nr/ppppbppp/4p3/8/3PPP2/8/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"I had my doubts about this one, but on the other hand I have a liking for a half-open f-file because I feel I possibly quickly get my rook into play after castling."
6,b6,b7b6,rnbqk1nr/p1ppbppp/1p2p3/8/3PPP2/8/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"fianchetto, pointing to my king-side and than maybe I have weakened my it too much for king-side castle..."
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk1nr/p1ppbppp/1p2p3/8/3PPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,I don't like the idea of having the black squared bishop entering my queen-side now that I have doubts about castle king-side
8,Bb7,c8b7,rn1qk1nr/pbppbppp/1p2p3/8/3PPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 5,I don't like the idea of having the black squared bishop entering my queen-side now that I have doubts about castle king-side

14,d6,d7d6,r2qk2r/pbp1bppp/1pnppn2/8/3PPP2/P1NBB3/1PP3PP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 0 8,Why? Now I'm getting the feeling I'm too cautious again and not part of my idea of starting to play chess more aggressively and I'm quite sure I lost a tempo by doing that move. I think Nf3 would have been better...

Funny to notice that at least the predictions of a French opening is coming true - White attacking king-side and black the queen-side"

25,g4,g2g4,r2qk2r/nbpn1pp1/pp1ppb1p/8/3PPPPP/P1NBBN2/1PPQ4/2KR3R b kq - 0 13,Black's line up appear much stronger to me. Black has a lot of possibilities now. c4 will directly attack my white sq. bishop and block from effective defence of my king. Qb6 will put heavy pressure on d4 and help in controlling b-line for a possible attack on the king. I chose not to care and continue my attack
