1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Talk about a game that is totally aggressive on my part.  My king ends the game on e3 of all places :).  With a power all out attack as if one swing could put me away.  No guts no glory right.

Guess this would be a good example of why we develop pieces.  I'm fairly certain there are no good moves for black now.
