1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I feel like Nc3 or d4 would have a been more effective move here.

6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,"Too early to be moving the Q, especially with all the minor pieces still awaiting development. This move will likely cause some pain for white later on as it will require moving the Q again before the light square bishop can get going. The castle is going to require giving up tempo to black."
7,Qe2,d1e2,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/2P2N2/PP1PQPPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 2 4,"Too early to be moving the Q, especially with all the minor pieces still awaiting development.

10,d6,d7d6,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/2b1p3/2Q1P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Good thought, but I think most opponents will see this coming and the fix is too simple. Development would have been the better option since black achieves two goals with one move now."
