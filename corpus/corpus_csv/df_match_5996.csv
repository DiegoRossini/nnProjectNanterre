1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,So I'm playing black here. I recently adopted the Slav defense to play against the popular queens gambit.
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The Slav defense goes like this. There are a lot of variations but its usually pretty fun to play, and you don't need piles of theory for things like the Kings Indian defense."

5,h3,h2h3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2PP4/7P/PP2PPP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"This wastes time basically. It stops Bg4, which black could play after white plays Nf3, but its not a big issue to waste a turn on here."
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/2PP4/7P/PP2PPP1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,I've won a pawn but he has decent compensation (since I have to waste time and overextend my pawns to hold on to it). If he hadn't played h3 he'd be doing fine.
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/2PP4/5N1P/PP2PPP1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,I've won a pawn but he has decent compensation (since I have to waste time and overextend my pawns to hold on to it). If he hadn't played h3 he'd be doing fine.
