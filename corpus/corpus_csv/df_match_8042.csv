1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

It was time for a return challenge against Yoshark (Zebulun).  In my game against black I was extremely lucky to get away with a Low Draw.  Here I somehow manage to avoid getting into serious trouble.  In fact the game turns into a right old scrap.  Zebulun attacks down the h column and I attack down the c column.  For a while it seemed touch 'n go as to who would get in first.  Luckily I did.  The action starts on move 10 as nearly all the moves in this tourney up to here are standard, although black normally plays either Kc6 or Kc7 on the 8th turn.  9. ...... e6 and Qe8 have been the best moves here as the annotations so far have shown."
