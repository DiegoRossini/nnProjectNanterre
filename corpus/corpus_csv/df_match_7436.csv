1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This annotation is going to be a little different from my other ones... Instead of waiting until the game is finished, I'll annotate as the game is going on, so you can all get a better idea of my thoughts throughout the game :) ((alternate moves considered by me will be placed in double brackets, like what this sentence is in))"

9,Bxf7+,c4f7,r1bqk2r/pppp1Bpp/2n2n2/2b1p1N1/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"nothing special so far...I've been told that Nxf7 is playable, but I don't feel comfortable with trying it"
10,Ke7,e8e7,r1bq3r/ppppkBpp/2n2n2/2b1p1N1/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 1 6,"the usual move here is Bd5, but I can't seen any glaring changes with making this move"
11,Bb3,f7b3,r1bq3r/ppppk1pp/2n2n2/2b1p1N1/4P3/1B6/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQ - 2 6,"the usual move here is Bd5, but I can't seen any glaring changes with making this move"
12,Qe8,d8e8,r1b1q2r/ppppk1pp/2n2n2/2b1p1N1/4P3/1B6/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 3 7,"again, this isn't main line, but I'm not complaining - this could lead to an interesting game. Maybe nuntar's seen the Ion vs Freddy game... I'm assuming that the next move by Black would be Qh5..."
13,O-O,e1g1,r1b1q2r/ppppk1pp/2n2n2/2b1p1N1/4P3/1B6/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 4 7,"I'll defend my king for now... if Black plays Qh5 now, I'd be forced to trade because of the threat on the g5 knight - maybe Black wants to take advantage of my lack of development? ((here, I considered Nc3, with the idea of Nd5 - it will either break up Black's kingside structure of get my pawn on a good square))"
14,d6,d7d6,r1b1q2r/ppp1k1pp/2np1n2/2b1p1N1/4P3/1B6/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 0 8,Black's looking at getting his bishop out... I'm seeing Bg4 here.
15,h3,h2h3,r1b1q2r/ppp1k1pp/2np1n2/2b1p1N1/4P3/1B5P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 0 8,"I don't really want the hassle, so I'll just stop the bishop getting there in the first place. This also has the benefit of stopping Ng4 - I like this move ((Nc3 was still in consideration))"
16,Rf8,h8f8,r1b1qr2/ppp1k1pp/2np1n2/2b1p1N1/4P3/1B5P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 1 9,slowly building up pressure on White. I'm thinking nuntar's next move will be Nxe4
17,Nc3,b1c3,r1b1qr2/ppp1k1pp/2np1n2/2b1p1N1/4P3/1BN4P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 2 9,"Why not? I've been planning to move my knight for a couple of turns now, and now it will also defend e4"
18,Nd4,c6d4,r1b1qr2/ppp1k1pp/3p1n2/2b1p1N1/3nP3/1BN4P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 3 10,"I can only assume nuntar's considering Nxb3 on the next turn ((it also gets me thinking about Nd5+ again - I realise I can retake with the bishop instead of the pawn. I see a disadvantage for both moves - the pawn recapture blocks in my bishop, but the bishop capture allows for c6, driving back my bishop))"
19,Nd5+,c3d5,r1b1qr2/ppp1k1pp/3p1n2/2bNp1N1/3nP3/1B5P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 4 10,I'll go ahead with my plan.

22,Qg6,e8g6,r1b2r2/ppp1k1pp/3p2q1/2bBp1N1/3nP3/7P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 12,"putting a threat to the knight. I don't really want to move it though. ((I don't realise it until a bit later, but nuntar actually threatens to capture the knight - it's open season when it retreats to f3 because of the queen's pin on the g2 pawn)) ((I expected c6 here)) ((as I annotate this, the game is already done - me and nuntar happened to be online at the same time to play it through...I'll try to remember my thoughts as best as I can))"
23,d3,d2d3,r1b2r2/ppp1k1pp/3p2q1/2bBp1N1/3nP3/3P3P/PPP2PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 12,"defending the knight. I'm also going to get a chance to develop pieces, which doesn't usually seem to happen for White. ((after this move, I was considering a knight sac with Nxh7, which, after Qxh7, could lead to a powerful attack; 13.Nxh7 Qxh7 14.Bg5+ Ke8, and now it's Black who's under pressure...but what would be White's best move after that?))"
24,h6,h7h6,r1b2r2/ppp1k1p1/3p2qp/2bBp1N1/3nP3/3P3P/PPP2PP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 13,"Black really wants that knight to go.. I've now noticed the danger of retreating the knight to f3. It took me a little while to find the next move... ((knight to h7 is now out of the question, because the bishop can't move to the g5 square))"
25,c3,c2c3,r1b2r2/ppp1k1p1/3p2qp/2bBp1N1/3nP3/2PP3P/PP3PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 13,"as far as I can see, this is my only option. I can get out of this with just one pawn down instead of a whole piece down"
