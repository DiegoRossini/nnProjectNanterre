1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I had a bad start just missing the best replies in the opening and giving white the initiative and an attack against y weak d6 pawn, he eventually won that pawn, but not without allowing some structure weakness... I was able to exchange in to a drawish rooks endgame setting up a defense with the rooks on the 5th and 8th and keeping the king able to get in front of white's passed pawn... finally without possibility of progress, a draw was agreed"
