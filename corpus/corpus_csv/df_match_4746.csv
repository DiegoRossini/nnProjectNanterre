This indirectly impacts the d4 square and is not as vulnerable as I had thought.  I wanted to attack the queen with Nc3 Nd5 but saw that Nge7 refuted it quickly. After researching this position, I found that on chess.com all the given games of this time give the win to black.  This is a sideline in the Cordel/Classical Ruy Lopez that I wasn't familiar with as I normally see the Berlin or the Steinitz Defenses.  This is a solid defense for black indeed when played correctly."
