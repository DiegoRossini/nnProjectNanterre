1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game was played on a bitterly cold night, in a big hall where the heating had failed.  We all started off in normal dress but by the end had donned extra jumpers and overcoats.  My opponent played at a normal slow rate but, after my first few deliberate moves, I sped up, using his thinking time to plan my own moves.  This worked well until move 25, when I blundered, and again thereafter, so that, by the time I'd equalised, my opponent had only 15 minutes left, compared with my 68 minutes.  However, I wasn't in a mood to try to exploit my time advantage as I was in a hurry to find warmth ..."

It could also have helped an advance to d4, leaving the B protecting e4 but that didn't come either, so I'm not sure what the purpose of this, rather than 6. Nf3, was."
