1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"Reminder of the time limit - 40 moves in 90 minutes, plus 30 minutes if your time runs out before then, plus 30 second increment. Again I was late for the start, due to heavy traffic on the A55, I was about 10 minutes late. I hope to rattle out moves of a Sicilian Defence or a Gr√ºnfeld Defence, but it was not to be. I paused before playing..."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,Probably leading to a King's Indian Defence reversed I thought.
3,b3,b2b3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/1P3N2/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,OK maybe a Queen's Indian Reversed I thought.
4,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/8/1P3N2/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,So I played this.
5,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/4P3/1P3N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"And then he comes up with this. I sank deep into thought. A reversed Budapest Defence! Never met it before! I considered dxe4. Now in the Budapest Defence, after 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e5 3.dxe5 Black can try the Fajarowicz variation 3...Ne4 which concentrates on the rapid development of pieces, but that line has rather been put out of fashion by 4. a3! which stops any tricks based in ....Bf8-b4+. So I didn't really look at 3...dxe4 4. Ne5, thinking that 4.....a6 would refute it, and spent most of my time looking at 3....dxe4 4. Ng4, and all the complications of the Budapest Defence but with white having the extra move, which I decided to avoid. After the game my opponent showed me a trap, 3.... dxe4 4. Ne5 Qd4 5. Bb2 Qxb2 6. Nc3 and the black queen is trapped, for instance 6.....Qa3 7. Bb5+ and 8. Nc4. So after 3....dxe4 4. Ne5 is the most common move, and 4....a6 is the best next move. However I led the game down a different route."
6,d4,d5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2p5/3pP3/1P3N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"By playing this, I hoped to keep the position closed."

8,Nd7,b8d7,r1bqkbnr/pp1npppp/8/1Bp5/3pP3/1P3N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,I felt I wanted to conserve my good light squared bishop and I didn't want him doubling my pawns after 4...Nc6 and him taking on c6 at some stage.
