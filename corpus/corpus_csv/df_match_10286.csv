1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"As round three of the Space City Open begins, I find myself with 1 point out of 2, and in the middle of the early pack. My opponent this round is a 12 year old kid who I am totally unfamiliar with. He is rated 1237, but has already taken down the #3 guy in the section (a 1512) so I can't take him for granted like I almost did with my last opponent. I vow not to lose this game. I want to end this first day of the tourney with at least an even score. He opens with the popular 1. e4."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"After several tournaments of experimenting with the Caro Kann, I decide to return to my old favorite the Scandanavian."
3,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3pP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"The advance variation, which I feel is the most aggressive way to deal with the Scandi."
4,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2ppP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Also playable is 3...Bg4, but I feel that this way better deals with the threat of white playing Bb5."
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2ppP3/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"Also playable is 3...Bg4, but I feel that this way better deals with the threat of white playing Bb5."

7,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/1BppP3/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 4,Which he does.
8,Bd7,c8d7,r2qkbnr/pp1bpppp/2n5/1BppP3/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 5,"There are several ways to deal with this pin, including a6 and Qc7, but I like this one best as it may yield my LSB play on the long diagonal."
9,Bxc6,b5c6,r2qkbnr/pp1bpppp/2B5/2ppP3/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"?! White starts swinging first, and trades bishop for knight. I was expecting something a little more developmental, such as d4."
10,Bxc6,d7c6,r2qkbnr/pp2pppp/2b5/2ppP3/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,White castles to safety immediately.

12,d4,d5d4,r2qkbnr/pp2pppp/2b5/2p1P3/3p4/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,"As I have the bishop pair, I want to open up as many lines as I can to accentuate it. This move also prevents Nc3."
13,d3,d2d3,r2qkbnr/pp2pppp/2b5/2p1P3/3p4/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,"White develops nicely, and answers the question of where this knight will be most effective. I see him going to b3 or even e4 once Re1 is played."

18,b5,b7b5,r2qkb1r/p3nppp/2b1p3/1pp1P3/3p4/1P1P1N2/P1PN1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 10,I opt to shut down c4 for his knight while claiming some nice space on the queenside.

I'm considering ways to assault his king immediately as most of his pieces are over on the queenside. The problem is, I just don't have enough ammo. I'm thinking Nf4 with possibly some help from h5. However, I didn't correctly analyze my position after he played......"
