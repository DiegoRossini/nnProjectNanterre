1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"So I got in the habit of playing this, ONLY because it was said to be Bobby Fischer's favorite 1st move."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,And the Sicilian...
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Now there are better moves than what I do as white next. Yeah, yeah, I know I could move Nc3..."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"Now there are better moves than what I do as white next. Yeah, yeah, I know I could move Nc3..."
5,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"Now there are better moves than what I do as white next. Yeah, yeah, I know I could move Nc3..."

7,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"Now there are better moves than what I do as white next. Yeah, yeah, I know I could move Nc3..."
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"Now there are better moves than what I do as white next. Yeah, yeah, I know I could move Nc3..."
9,Nxc6,d4c6,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2N2n2/8/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"At this point, black has what he wants; a superior center, with excellent counter-attacking chances. So black ought to just pursue playing that way, or so I would think."
10,bxc6,b7c6,r1bqkb1r/p2ppppp/2p2n2/8/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"At this point, black has what he wants; a superior center, with excellent counter-attacking chances. So black ought to just pursue playing that way, or so I would think."
11,Bd3,f1d3,r1bqkb1r/p2ppppp/2p2n2/8/4P3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"Because I don't know all the continuations now as many of you know them, I make this quiet move, causing black to think, as this surely isn't the best white response."
12,e5,e7e5,r1bqkb1r/p2p1ppp/2p2n2/4p3/4P3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"Black makes a decent reply, and threatens to crash down in the center. I for one am glad his bishop isn't going down that diagonal. Not yet, anyways!"
13,c4,c2c4,r1bqkb1r/p2p1ppp/2p2n2/4p3/2P1P3/3B4/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,"I play c4, indicating that I hope to play in the fashion of the Maroczy bind, trying to tie up the center, but black is positioned so that this should not occur. I've found that in these kinds of positions, black often underestimates the strength of kingside attacks, which will be my goal here. This much I do know: black can thwart this in one of two ways; a break involving ...f5 or ...d5. Which will he choose?"
14,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk2r/p2p1ppp/2p2n2/2b1p3/2P1P3/3B4/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 8,"He chooses to develop, preparing to first castle before committing."
15,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk2r/p2p1ppp/2p2n2/2b1p3/2P1P3/3B4/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 2 8,"This position is slightly favorable to black, but at least white has the initiative for the moment."
16,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/p2p1ppp/2p2n2/2b1p3/2P1P3/3B4/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 3 9,"This position is slightly favorable to black, but at least white has the initiative for the moment."
17,Kh1,g1h1,r1bq1rk1/p2p1ppp/2p2n2/2b1p3/2P1P3/3B4/PP3PPP/RNBQ1R1K b - - 4 9,"Prophylactic move; black will not have time for Ng4; the best thing for black now may be that central push, which will immediately cause white problems since ...d5 is very good here."
18,d6,d7d6,r1bq1rk1/p4ppp/2pp1n2/2b1p3/2P1P3/3B4/PP3PPP/RNBQ1R1K w - - 0 10,"However, black chooses ...d6, when d5 was much better. Still playable, along with Rb8 or even Re8, however. But not as strong as ...d5."
19,Bg5,c1g5,r1bq1rk1/p4ppp/2pp1n2/2b1p1B1/2P1P3/3B4/PP3PPP/RN1Q1R1K b - - 1 10,I choose the best response; Bg5.
20,h6,h7h6,r1bq1rk1/p4pp1/2pp1n1p/2b1p1B1/2P1P3/3B4/PP3PPP/RN1Q1R1K w - - 0 11,"Will he or won't he? Yes, he will. Black asks the question. Rb8 was slightly better here, however."
21,Bh4,g5h4,r1bq1rk1/p4pp1/2pp1n1p/2b1p3/2P1P2B/3B4/PP3PPP/RN1Q1R1K b - - 1 11,Far and away the best move for white now.
22,Rb8,a8b8,1rbq1rk1/p4pp1/2pp1n1p/2b1p3/2P1P2B/3B4/PP3PPP/RN1Q1R1K w - - 2 12,"Here white chooses Rb8, after moving the white bishop off of the c1-h6 diagonal. ...Bd4 was also playable."
23,Qe2,d1e2,1rbq1rk1/p4pp1/2pp1n1p/2b1p3/2P1P2B/3B4/PP2QPPP/RN3R1K b - - 3 12,"And here I make an inaccuracy. Better was Qc2. This eventually costs me a tempo, and could (should?) have cost the game. Perhaps Nc3 was the best move in this position but perhaps not."
24,Bd4,c5d4,1rbq1rk1/p4pp1/2pp1n1p/4p3/2PbP2B/3B4/PP2QPPP/RN3R1K w - - 4 13,"What else? ...g5 was a good choice too, depending on black's long-term strategies."
25,Nc3,b1c3,1rbq1rk1/p4pp1/2pp1n1p/4p3/2PbP2B/2NB4/PP2QPPP/R4R1K b - - 5 13,"Only one move now for white, Nc3. All other moves and black will be much better than white. As things are now, black is definitely better."
26,a5,a7a5,1rbq1rk1/5pp1/2pp1n1p/p3p3/2PbP2B/2NB4/PP2QPPP/R4R1K w - - 0 14,"Inexplicably, however, black now chooses a5, which is not a bad move, but where is the fit with the position here? ...g5 or ...Bg4 or even ...Be6 were both good choices. Bd7 is playable, but a bit passive. a5 will be useful, but... I think it's a bit early here, allowing white some time. Which I need. Lucky me..."
27,Rab1,a1b1,1rbq1rk1/5pp1/2pp1n1p/p3p3/2PbP2B/2NB4/PP2QPPP/1R3R1K b - - 1 14,"Other than moving one of the rooks, f3 was possible. Fritz considered Na4 too, but I did not; it's generally not good to position knights out of the action of course, because with careful play, an opponent can capitalize on the tempos it would take to bring that knight back into the board. And I did not feel like calculating a zillion or so moves to see if Na4 would be okay or not."
