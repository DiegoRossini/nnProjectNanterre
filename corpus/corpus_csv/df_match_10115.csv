1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"in this game. Legal's mate is used - this could be a useful tactic to you in the future.

e4 - a classic chess opening"
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,An appropriate reply
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,f3. the best place (out of the 3 moves it can make) to place your g1 knight.
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,a common but not all tht great move. opens up this queenside for an attack
5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 3,a move I made because i thought he might fall for the trap.
6,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/2B1P1b1/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 4,a move which is practically forced if black wants a sensible opening
7,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/2B1P1b1/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 4,a common move.  and again the best place where you can put your b1 knight
8,Nc6,b8c6,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/2B1P1b1/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 4 5,Nc6 - a  move which is common in this position and is crucial to Legal's mate. If Black had moved his other knight to f6 th eplan wouldn't have worked. you'll see why.
9,Nxe5,f3e5,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4N3/2B1P1b1/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,Ne5? A stupid move... or not?
10,Bxd1,g4d1,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4N3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BbK2R w KQkq - 0 6,perfectly reasonable but now it is forced checkmate
11,Bxf7+,c4f7,r2qkbnr/ppp2Bpp/2np4/4N3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BbK2R b KQkq - 0 6,Got him!
12,Ke7,e8e7,r2q1bnr/ppp1kBpp/2np4/4N3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BbK2R w KQ - 1 7,forced
13,Nd5#,c3d5,r2q1bnr/ppp1kBpp/2np4/3NN3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/R1BbK2R b KQ - 2 7,"good game, useful tactic"
