Black's idea is a simple and thematic one - play against the e5 pawn.  In the first instance, he will do this by exchanging on f3 and then e5.  White will have to find a plan, whilst Black's back up is a good old fashioned Kingside attack.  In the game, White suddenly finds himself lost without making any particularly bad moves, and it is for that reason I thought to annotate it."

Bc5, 11. ... a5 or 11. ... Rd8!?  Ultimately, after Na3, Black is probably going to exchange and hope that after Rxa3 the rook is a little out of play.
White obviously feels that by 9. c4 he can exchange queens, prevent Black from castling and gain some space in the centre.  Black on the other hand is happy to exchange queens, keep his king in the centre and attack those lovely pawns."
