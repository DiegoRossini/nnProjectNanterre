All others are modified around these two opens unless it is the Bird's Eye Open.  The English Open is the White Sicilian to me and I know the Sicilian as Black and when White goes on a Defense I take advantage.  I like the Caro against e4 and usually go this route."

The bottom line is grand masters use the Caro to date with acceptable success.  It is a defense for Black for Black to know what to do without the long and numerous moves in a Sicilian or the weak Ruy Lopez.  I rest the case to say my favorite defense as Black against e4 is the Caro Kann.  I have left the Sicilian and I had left the weak Ruy Lopez back in the 1980s.  To date the best defense against e4 open is Caro Kann.  Or, maybe, Alekhine's Defense! I've not lost faith with Alekhine to date! My records show it!"

However, a tight formation is crucial in either Sicilian or Caro to e4 as an off set to the dull Ruy Lopez many choose against e4.

When a rook can move forward it is the same as a Battery Battalion advancing canons to the forefront to cut deep behind enemy lines.  If a Battery Position can move ahead of Infantry (pawns or soldiers) to support Infantry then it is a better decision than sending the pawns forward to be bullet catchers.
