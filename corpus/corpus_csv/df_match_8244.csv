1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This is the first time I defeated a player rated about 200 points above me. A very short game which shows how one mistake can lead to quick defeat.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,The first mini-mistake if at all -- leaving the pawn at e5 unprotected. This might qualify more as an overlook unless my opponent had something more sinister planned !

6,Qe7,d8e7,rnb1k1nr/ppppqppp/8/2b1N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,Surely this move is more reactionary than something that is well planned  ?  Or is it not ?
7,d4,d2d4,rnb1k1nr/ppppqppp/8/2b1N3/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,Simple counter to protect my Knight as well as threaten the black bishop.

9,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1k1nr/ppppqppp/1b6/4N3/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,Some more standard development. Both sides are developing their pieces. Both have developed the pieces although white might be slightly better co-ordinated.
10,Nf6,g8f6,rnb1k2r/ppppqppp/1b3n2/4N3/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 3 6,Some more standard development. Both sides are developing their pieces. Both have developed the pieces although white might be slightly better co-ordinated.

14,Qe6,e7e6,r1b1k2r/pppp1ppp/1bn1qn2/3NN1B1/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 7 8,White has many attacking pieces now - though the position might be balanced.
15,Bc4,f1c4,r1b1k2r/pppp1ppp/1bn1qn2/3NN1B1/2BPP3/8/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 8 8,White has many attacking pieces now - though the position might be balanced.
16,O-O,e8g8,r1b2rk1/pppp1ppp/1bn1qn2/3NN1B1/2BPP3/8/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 9 9,"And here is the big mistake --- Castling at the wrong time !

Black might be feeling pressure from the multiple white pieces and thought it would be a 'safe' option to castle. This however turned out to be the biggest mistake in this game."
17,Nxf6+,d5f6,r1b2rk1/pppp1ppp/1bn1qN2/4N1B1/2BPP3/8/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 9,Checking the Black King and gaining a guaranteed advantage by taking the black queen.

19,Bxe6,c4e6,r1b2rk1/pppp1p1p/1bn1Bp2/4N1B1/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 10,Here we get her.
20,dxe6,d7e6,r1b2rk1/ppp2p1p/1bn1pp2/4N1B1/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 11,And now the next big mistake -- I was hoping black would take either the bishop at e6 or the knight at e5. I knew I need the bishop dangerously positioned on the open g file for a quick checkmate. Taking the bishop g5 would have been a much better move.
21,Bxf6,g5f6,r1b2rk1/ppp2p1p/1bn1pB2/4N3/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 11,My bishop survives and takes a very dangerous position. This is where I realize that the game is won.
22,Ne7,c6e7,r1b2rk1/ppp1np1p/1b2pB2/4N3/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 1 12,Black tries to draw my bishop away from this dangerous square f6.

24,Ng6,e7g6,r1b2rk1/ppp2p1p/1b2pBn1/4N2Q/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 3 13,One step closer.
25,Qh6,h5h6,r1b2rk1/ppp2p1p/1b2pBnQ/4N3/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQ - 4 13,One step closer.
26,Nf4,g6f4,r1b2rk1/ppp2p1p/1b2pB1Q/4N3/3PPn2/8/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 5 14,And there. A good short game which shows how something as simple as castling at the wrong time can prove to be deadly.
27,Qg7#,h6g7,r1b2rk1/ppp2pQp/1b2pB2/4N3/3PPn2/8/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQ - 6 14,And there. A good short game which shows how something as simple as castling at the wrong time can prove to be deadly.
