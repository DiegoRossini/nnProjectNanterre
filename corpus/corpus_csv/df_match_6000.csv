1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Actually I was hoping for the Sicilian, I've recently been attempting to work the Smith Morra (attempting being the operative word)."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Met with e5, I begin the lines for the King's Gambit; a line I've been experimenting with, primarily in Blitz games. The King's Gambit involves the initial sacrifice of the white f pawn. The concept behind it being that off centering black's e pawn will give white an advantage in the game through center control and initiative. Black's best hope is to slow the pace of the game down and lock up the board as much as possible, so as to stave off the early offensive and retain the advantage in material."

4,exf4,e5f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"I develop my knight, the most common third move for white in the King's Gambit lines. Trying to take immediate control of the center so that strong opening offensive can give me a positional advantage greater than or equal to my sacrificed pawn."
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"I develop my knight, the most common third move for white in the King's Gambit lines. Trying to take immediate control of the center so that strong opening offensive can give me a positional advantage greater than or equal to my sacrificed pawn."
6,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"My opponent continues with development, my immediate guess is that his intention is Bg3, thus pinning my knight to my queen."
7,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/3PPp2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"I respond with d4, a nice move that I tend to favor given the opportunity. It takes a fairly dominating control of the center while forcing the opponent to attend to his erstwhile soldier being threatened by the now discovered dark squared bishop."
8,g5,g7g5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2p1p/3p4/6p1/3PPp2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"My opponent responds with the common and quite effective g5. Here I make an interesting attempt to peal off that defense. Admittedly I do not know the theory behind this move at all, it was simply a move I thought of and utilized. At this point I am rather intent on securing my the pawn on f4, I have a significant advantage in development and control of the center, if I could equalize the material I should have the game fairly securely in my favor. My only concern is g4, in which case I would have sacrificed my knight as opposed to moving it to either h2 or d2. I would have attempted to take advantage of the additional tempi and launch a whirlwind tactical assault upon the opponents center. For example Zimmer vs. Hans Mueller in 1918. In that particular case white sacrifices two pawns and a knight, similar to this game, in order to gain the initiative to win the game."

10,f6,f7f6,rnbqkbnr/ppp4p/3p1p2/6p1/3PPp1P/5N2/PPP3P1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"My opponent chooses to defend his defense, but in doing so exposes a fairly huge weakness on his kingside. He follows up with a weak Bd7, a move I cannot even hope to explain. The only other square he could have moved his light squared bishop to was g4, pinning my knight to my queen (finally). Retrospectively the better of the two moves for the bishop."

Nf7. Even with the best move, the material has been evened, and the position is strongly in my favor."
14,fxg5,f6g5,rn1qkbnr/pppb3p/3p4/6p1/2BPPp1P/8/PPP3P1/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"Unfortunately for black, he does not see the looming checkmate. He accepts the ""poison knight"" and allows for Qh5+. My opponent then resigns, seeing 8... Ke7 9.Qf7#. This is my first annotation, I chose (obviously) a short and tactical game for simplicities sake. This game is an excellent example of the strength in the King's Gambit, especially against opponents not entirely familiar with the lines. Forcing your opponent into a sharp, tactical game creates a very small margin for error, and that can be capitalized on by a clever tactician, particularly in Blitz games. Please comment and let me know what you think."
