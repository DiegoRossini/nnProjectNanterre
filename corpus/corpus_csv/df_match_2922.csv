However, this is not as bad as it seems. A rook on f6 wouldn't do much. A queen there would be dangerous, but mine is watching that square, resulting in an even trade (which is good for me). The most terrifying piece that could land on f6 is the bishop, but it is not even close to that square, so no worries."
