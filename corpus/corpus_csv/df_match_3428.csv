13,Bg5,c1g5,rn2kbnr/ppq1pppp/2p5/5bB1/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 2 7,"First original move, out of my personal database. It is interesting. f6 cames to mind inmediately, but black has to do ready for safe castling before he can play this."
14,Nd7,b8d7,r3kbnr/ppqnpppp/2p5/5bB1/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 3 8,"As always, the correct move here is d5 by white, preventing my castling. But..."
15,Bh4,g5h4,r3kbnr/ppqnpppp/2p5/5b2/3P3B/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 4 8,Threatening to press against the g3 diag.

17,Bg3,h4g3,r3kbnr/ppqnp1pp/2p2p2/5b2/3P4/2N2NB1/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 9,"The pawn holds for now, and my developement moves seem to support it easily."

23,Qc1,d1c1,2kr1bnr/ppqn2pp/2p5/4pb2/8/2N2NB1/PPP1BPPP/R1Q2RK1 b - - 3 12,"Probably thinking in Qg5, or just to take away the queen from the discovered. It gives me a tempo but a potential threat on the d column."
24,h6,h7h6,2kr1bnr/ppqn2p1/2p4p/4pb2/8/2N2NB1/PPP1BPPP/R1Q2RK1 w - - 0 13,"I know people tend to criticize such moves, but Be7 seemed to me too passive (my dsb belongs to d6 or c5), and a knight move would have allowed Qg5, with annoying pressure on e5 ans g7. So IMO this phrophylactic move is dued."
25,Bc4,e2c4,2kr1bnr/ppqn2p1/2p4p/4pb2/2B5/2N2NB1/PPP2PPP/R1Q2RK1 b - - 1 13,A tempo white has to lose if he wants to pressure with the rooks on the center.

I could have tried to free the queen from the pin sooner, but I ""used"" the defence of the e pawn as a way to fully develop. Now the position seems roughly equal to me. Once released the pin on the queen, d4 becomes a sort o threat, but it is useless."

31,Ne4,c3e4,2kr3r/ppqn4/2pb1npp/4pb2/4N3/3B1NB1/PPP2PPP/R1Q1R1K1 b - - 1 16,"The dsb seems such a good piece for black that one's instinct is to protect it, but chess is not made of sentimentalism."
32,Nxe4,f6e4,2kr3r/ppqn4/2pb2pp/4pb2/4n3/3B1NB1/PPP2PPP/R1Q1R1K1 w - - 0 17,"I would have left this knight for h5, but I calculate the other knight would go there."
33,Bxe4,d3e4,2kr3r/ppqn4/2pb2pp/4pb2/4B3/5NB1/PPP2PPP/R1Q1R1K1 b - - 0 17,"Again, BxB is good for me, so why lose this chance?"

37,h3,h2h3,2kr3r/ppq5/2pb1n1p/4pp2/8/5NBP/PPP2PP1/R1Q1R1K1 b - - 0 19,I missed the obvious Ne4 because the bishop is somewhat safe on h4.
38,Rdg8,d8g8,2k3rr/ppq5/2pb1n1p/4pp2/8/5NBP/PPP2PP1/R1Q1R1K1 w - - 1 20,"Not Rh because of Qxh3, and I am not still ready to cope with this, even if it frees my columns against the white king."
39,c4,c2c4,2k3rr/ppq5/2pb1n1p/4pp2/2P5/5NBP/PP3PP1/R1Q1R1K1 b - - 0 20,"Very nice. Now my dominion on the black diagonal is compromised, unless I go c5. Probably the wise choice, but for b4!, and white gets open columns over my king, that could be annoying."
40,Nh5,f6h5,2k3rr/ppq5/2pb3p/4pp1n/2P5/5NBP/PP3PP1/R1Q1R1K1 w - - 1 21,"Not Ne4 because of Rxe4, fxR, c5, exN?, cxBd6, Qd7! (if Qxd6, Bxe4, forking Q and Rook), Bxe4 could have compensate white for the exchange."
41,Bh2,g3h2,2k3rr/ppq5/2pb3p/4pp1n/2P5/5N1P/PP3PPB/R1Q1R1K1 b - - 2 21,"Bad move, since it allows c5. True is that e is no longer a problem, while 21... e4 would have exchanged pieces (22. BxB, QxB, Nh4) with c5 to come - nothing terrible, but..."
