my notes say that if your pawn takes on b5 - white win
if the knight takes bishop - its a draw"

winning rook and pawn for knight! I'll settle for that being already a point ahead"

as soon as you stop checking I have queen takes kinght threatening some serious action on d8 .... though I could avoid perpetual check and a draw here - looking at it now I'm not too sure"

didn't see that coming atall seems I had a mental block with e1 - didn't considerit atall - monumental blunder and now you protect your knight too.
