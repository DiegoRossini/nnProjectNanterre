I don't know if the pawn double-step (that obviously is primarily done to keep the won pawn) here is sound, as it kind of contradicts elementary opening rules, namely that you shouldn't make too many pawn moves but instead develop your pieces quickly in the first stage of the game! This is especially essential when you accepted a gambit and therefore sacrificed development and initiative for material. Note that White already has two minor pieces developed, one of them being a bishop sitting on a mighty long diagonal, while Blacks fellows are all lazy in the back-camp so far. So my guess is that 4... Nf6 is better, but I have to check out what the literature (Thomas Johansson - The Fascinating Reti Gambit) says about this line sometimes in future, I don't own this book yet."

But well, since the opponent moved his horse twice (breaking another opening rule), it also doesn't hurt for me to move my lady another time, regarding development."

Nf3 because if Black decided to take, 10... Nxf3 gxf3 would have corrupted my pawn structure. But now I realise, that the open g-file could have been very useful then, considering Black probably castled king-side so maybe it would have been worth it! Anyway, this way it was also not bad, as we will see soon."

For example, 10... 0-0, 11. Bxf5 exf5 (... Nxf5? Qxd8, Rxd8 Rxd8+, winning the Exchange), 12. Qxd4 (or the more dangerous Nxd4), with an about equal position."

Note that the idea of attacking the knight on c3 another time, thinking that it can't move because the rook on e1 is exposed then and one could win the Exchange, fails and leads to the loss of a piece: 12... Nd4 13. Nxd5 exd5 (the queen was attacked!) 14. Qxe7+ Bxe7 (now the bishop is back again, and pinned) 15. Ba3! and the bishop is history."
