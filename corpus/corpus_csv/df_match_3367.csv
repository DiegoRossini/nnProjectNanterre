1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi Everyone!

I hope you all enjoyed that Part 1 Cameo, now it is time for Part 2.  This time my opponent is currently a Class C player who also had the misfortune to get on the wrong side of Glenda.  How did this happen?  Here is the gameknot analysis version of this game: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=18378837&fb=1&rnd=0.9658788367717621"
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,2. d4 - this is the Centre Game.  White makes an immediate d4 thrust following e4.  Both bishop's diagonals are now clear.  I decided to capture and the Wicked Witch of the West recaptures.  This centralisation of the enemy queen is a double edged sword.  Can I give her the runaround?  We shall see.
