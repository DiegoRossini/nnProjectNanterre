1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I played this game at the Norwalk Championships. It shows the dangers of castling on the wrong side of the board.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"The Alekhine Defense.
Black wants to lure my pawns to attack his knight, causing me to overextend my position."
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 2,"Most people play 2. e5 here, but I didn't study the Alekhine back then, so I preferred the safer Nc3 over the sharper e5. A lot of times playing Nc3 will transpose into other openings less familiar to an Alekhine player."
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p1n2/8/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,2...d5 is a more common move. Black can also play 2...e5 transposing into a double king-pawn position.
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p1n2/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,But Black's d6 move has simply transposed into the Pirc Defense.
6,c6,c7c6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2pp1n2/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"This variation of the Pirc is somewhat passive. Black's sharpest plan is to play Nbd7 and e5, then fianchetto the king's bishop, transposing into a King's Indian Defense-type formation, but where I don't have a pawn on c4."
7,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2pp1n2/6B1/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,"I usually develop my bishop to e3 in this opening, but I would have to play f3 first to avoid Ng4."
8,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bqkb1r/pp1npppp/2pp1n2/6B1/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 2 5,I am equalizing the control of e5.
9,f4,f2f4,r1bqkb1r/pp1npppp/2pp1n2/6B1/3PPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,I am equalizing the control of e5.
10,h6,h7h6,r1bqkb1r/pp1nppp1/2pp1n1p/6B1/3PPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"I thought it was okay for Black to play e5 here, because after 6. fxe5 dxe5 7. dxe5 Nxe5 8. Qxd8 Kxd8 9. O-O-O  Kc7, Black's position is fine, and my isolated e-pawn may be a problem in the resulting endgame."
11,Bxf6,g5f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1nppp1/2pp1B1p/8/3PPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,"Bh4 still allows e5, and I did not want that. I want to play e5 before Black does."
12,Nxf6,d7f6,r1bqkb1r/pp2ppp1/2pp1n1p/8/3PPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,"Black lets me play e5, because gxf6 gives my queen the good h5 square where I can control the 5th rank along with my pawns. And exf6 brings the e-pawn to the f-file, where Black can no longer play e5, also f7 becomes vulnerable after Bc4."
13,e5,e4e5,r1bqkb1r/pp2ppp1/2pp1n1p/4P3/3P1P2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 7,"Although Black is no longer threatening e5, I must take dynamic action, because in the Pirc Defense, White needs to crush Black's passive position before Black finishes development and gets equality."
14,dxe5,d6e5,r1bqkb1r/pp2ppp1/2p2n1p/4p3/3P1P2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 8,Nd7 cramps Black's position.
15,fxe5,f4e5,r1bqkb1r/pp2ppp1/2p2n1p/4P3/3P4/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 8,Nd7 cramps Black's position.
16,Nd5,f6d5,r1bqkb1r/pp2ppp1/2p4p/3nP3/3P4/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 1 9,Nd7 cramps Black's position.
17,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkb1r/pp2ppp1/2p4p/3nP3/2BP4/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 2 9,"Not the best move, because usually you should only develop your bishop to c4 if Black's e-pawn is gone or has passed e6, because then you are pressuring f7."
18,Be6,c8e6,r2qkb1r/pp2ppp1/2p1b2p/3nP3/2BP4/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 3 10,"I thought e6 was more solid, but Be6 is more agressive."
19,Bxd5,c4d5,r2qkb1r/pp2ppp1/2p1b2p/3BP3/3P4/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 0 10,I don't like my misplaced bishop.
20,Bxd5,e6d5,r2qkb1r/pp2ppp1/2p4p/3bP3/3P4/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 0 11,"After Bxf3 gxf3, both sides should castle queenside, resulting in an equal game where Black focuses on undermining my advanced central pawns, and I focus on attacking the newly opened g-file."
21,Nf3,g1f3,r2qkb1r/pp2ppp1/2p4p/3bP3/3P4/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 11,"After Bxf3 gxf3, both sides should castle queenside, resulting in an equal game where Black focuses on undermining my advanced central pawns, and I focus on attacking the newly opened g-file."
22,e6,e7e6,r2qkb1r/pp3pp1/2p1p2p/3bP3/3P4/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 12,"Black missed his chance for equality, and gives me more chances to get an advantage."
23,O-O,e1g1,r2qkb1r/pp3pp1/2p1p2p/3bP3/3P4/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 1 12,I place my rook on the open f-file.
24,Be7,f8e7,r2qk2r/pp2bpp1/2p1p2p/3bP3/3P4/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 2 13,"Black clears the way to castle kingside, which I believe is a mistake. I think Black's king is much safer on the queenside, because I don't have any open files there, and most of my pieces are active on the kingside."
