1,c3,c2c3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/2P5/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Preparing 2.d4, and bolstering the d4-square prior to moving there. This is a solid opening, but a poor one development-wise as it stops the b1-knight from reaching its best square, c3, and will waste a tempo if White decides to play c4, which is common in queen pawn openings."

I see nothing wrong with 4.c4, a belated version of the Queen's Gambit. 4.b3 also prepares to fianchetto White's dark-squared bishop...into what? It is then blocked by White's own pawn chain."
