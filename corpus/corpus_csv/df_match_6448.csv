There is no longer any hope of clearing the way for the Bd3 or the Rf1. White should embrace the tension in the center, since he is trying to open lines for his developed pieces. 12. f5 not only closes lines, it also hands the center over to Black, since without the f-pawn exerting pressure on Black's e-pawn, there is nothing to hold back the freeing advance …d5. 
Instead, Nd5! Nxd5 13. exd5 Bxd2 14. Qxd2 (Bxh7+?!? Kxh7 15. Ng5+ is tempting, but after …Kg6! White has nothing better than Qxd2.) gives White a strong initiative."

32,Re8,d8e8,r1b1r1k1/1pq2ppp/p1n5/3npP2/8/3B1N2/PPPB2PP/R3QR1K w - - 4 17,"?! This is one way to prevent …e4, but the Knight would be a better blockader after Ng5-e4. (Ng5 e4 18. Nxe4 just loses a pawn, since White has enough time to play Qh4 and safely break the pin.)"

Even if the f3 Knight moved and Black did manage to get a Knight on d5, White could then play c3 with tempo and drive it away."

(I would usually have no problem with doubled pawns in return for a Bishop-for-Knight trade, but here it would leave my King far too exposed.) Notice that neither White nor Black have been terribly concerned about the possibility of Nxe4 so far, since as long as there's a pawn on f5, that Bishop is a non-factor. With the pawn's blockader about to go, however, the Bishop must be eliminated."
37,Bg5,d2g5,r1b1r1k1/2q2ppp/p1n2n2/1p2pPB1/4B3/2P2N2/PP4PP/R3QR1K b - - 1 19,"! Putting the question to the Knight while Black has still not completed development.

A natural move that gets Black into big trouble. …f6! was necessary and good, after which Black would have a very comfortable game. I actually considered playing it, but underestimated White's threats and felt more comfortable breaking the pin on the h1-a8 diagonal. This oversight very well could have lost me the game!"

42,Kh8,g8h8,r3r2k/1bq2ppp/p1n5/1p2pPB1/6Q1/2P2N2/PP4PP/R4R1K w - - 3 22,"The opportunity for ...f6 is over, thanks to the pin on the g-file. Darn! 
White threatens Bf6, Bh6 and f6, and I could find nothing better than to play this move, breaking the pin and allowing ...Rg8 if necessary."

44,g6,g7g6,r3r2k/1bq2p1p/p1n2Pp1/1p2p1B1/6Q1/2P2N2/PP4PP/R4R1K w - - 0 23,"What else? ...Rg8 23 fxg7+ Rxg7 24 Bf6 is no good, and so I am obliged to create holes around my King."
45,Bh6,g5h6,r3r2k/1bq2p1p/p1n2PpB/1p2p3/6Q1/2P2N2/PP4PP/R4R1K b - - 1 23,"! Again, White mixes attack with prophylaxis. This phase of the attack is very instructive because of how Black simultaneously snuffs out Black's defensive resources while increasing his own threats. Here, I had hoped to get in the liberating move ...h5, which would greatly slow down the White attack and give me time for counterplay. Instead, White blockades the h-pawn and hones in on g7. The one downside is that the Queen's route to h7, h6 and/or g7 is temporarily blocked."
46,e4,e5e4,r3r2k/1bq2p1p/p1n2PpB/1p6/4p1Q1/2P2N2/PP4PP/R4R1K w - - 0 24,"!? What to do? White not only has a big attack, but has also prevented any immediately useful defensive move that Black might want to play. It might seem odd for me to ""force"" the White Knight to g5, where it already wanted to go anyways, but this move is motivated by sound practical logic: Black is not going to be able to defend against White's attack -- my pieces on the Queenside are just not going to get there in time. My only hope for survival, then, depends on getting some kind of counterattack going. Pushing the pawn does three things to help that: 1) It clears the h2-b8 diagonal for the Queen while giving the e-Rook more scope on the e-file; 2) It controls the f3-square while opening e5 for the Knight; and 3) It disrupts the timing of White's attack. White would prefer to play Qh4 first and Ng5 second, which retains control of e5 for a turn longer, but now he doesn't have that choice."
47,Ng5,f3g5,r3r2k/1bq2p1p/p1n2PpB/1p4N1/4p1Q1/2P5/PP4PP/R4R1K b - - 1 24,"!? Again, forcing a move that White planned to play anyways. Now, however, Black's formerly pent-up pieces are starting to take up active posts in the center. White needs to be careful not to underestimate this activity. (As they say: ""The best way to meet an attack on the flank is with an attack in the center."")"
48,Ne5,c6e5,r3r2k/1bq2p1p/p4PpB/1p2n1N1/4p1Q1/2P5/PP4PP/R4R1K w - - 2 25,"!? Again, forcing a move that White planned to play anyways.
