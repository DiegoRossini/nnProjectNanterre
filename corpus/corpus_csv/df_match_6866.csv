1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Evans Gambit. This is a tricky opening to play  - I've had mixed success. It's an aggressive opening  - white needs to establish a mating attack or win pieces before the endgame. Black's challenge is to try to get to the endgame with a pawn advantage.
