1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

This is my third game in Master Freddy's mini-tournament about the Sicilian Grand Prix Attack.  For me it was third time lucky in respect of clocking up my first win (although the Low Draw with Yoshark - which he annotated, I was extremely lucky!).  In response to 9. Bxg4 I try a different response, g6 to see what happened there and it certainly worked out well.  Anyhow, on with the match.  We pick up the action on move 9."
