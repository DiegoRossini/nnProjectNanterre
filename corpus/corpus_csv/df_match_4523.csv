1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"A nice game I've exchanged two minor pieces for a rook and a pawn, and achieved some advantage at some points, even captured another pawn, but then black could get a fortress and so do I, I've kept pushing my passed pawn and the game went on naturally until a forced draw by repetition, black's only chance to stop the pawn...So I offered a draw which was accepted.
Also remarkable was the novelty 7...Be7! presented by black which consisted in an improvement over the previous game played until then Bogoevski Jani (MKD) - Mitkov Nikola (MKD), Struga (Macedonia), 2007!"
