1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"so rarely happens in chess. a real underdog result. the last thing i expected when i was playing a 2200 rating was a victory.

anyhoo.. a kings pawn opening.."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,gauntlet laid down.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,huzzah! the knight.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,getting worried here...
5,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 3,nice. have some of that.
6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 4 4,hmmm.... ok then.
7,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1B2p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 5 4,i like this as it's all about the lines.
8,Bb4,f8b4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1B2p3/1b2P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 6 5,i've seen this move somewhere before... in fact i was wondering if he was just toying with me here setting me up for a humiliating defeat.
9,Bxc6,b5c6,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2B2n2/4p3/1b2P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"so i thought i'd better draw first blood and get some points on the board. 


and it also gives him the problem of doubled up pawns.."
10,dxc6,d7c6,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2p2n2/4p3/1b2P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,which is of course what happened.
11,Nxe5,f3e5,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2p2n2/4N3/1b2P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,and a lack of concentration left me his pawn. i wonder if he is giving this game his full concentration yet?
12,Qe7,d8e7,r1b1k2r/ppp1qppp/2p2n2/4N3/1b2P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 7,queen out.
13,f4,f2f4,r1b1k2r/ppp1qppp/2p2n2/4N3/1b2PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,i think this is bold and leaves my knight in an attacking space and none of this running away lark he might have been hoping for.
14,Bxc3,b4c3,r1b1k2r/ppp1qppp/2p2n2/4N3/4PP2/2b5/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,now i think he is getting desperate..
15,dxc3,d2c3,r1b1k2r/ppp1qppp/2p2n2/4N3/4PP2/2P5/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,i think i'm in a much better position after this exchange.
16,Nxe4,f6e4,r1b1k2r/ppp1qppp/2p5/4N3/4nP2/2P5/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,bham!
17,O-O,e1g1,r1b1k2r/ppp1qppp/2p5/4N3/4nP2/2P5/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 9,time to castle. i still like the way it's turning out.
18,O-O,e8g8,r1b2rk1/ppp1qppp/2p5/4N3/4nP2/2P5/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 2 10,got him scared. he wastes a move to defend himself.
19,Re1,f1e1,r1b2rk1/ppp1qppp/2p5/4N3/4nP2/2P5/PPP3PP/R1BQR1K1 b - - 3 10,this is looking nice for me. a long way to go yet though...
20,f5,f7f5,r1b2rk1/ppp1q1pp/2p5/4Np2/4nP2/2P5/PPP3PP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 0 11,i still don't think he is giving this game proper attention...
