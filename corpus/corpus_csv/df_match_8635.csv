Wikipedia says it occasionally leads to positions that resemble the English Opening (for obvious reasons) but doesn't offer the move any name or analysis. So, I'm dubiously dubbing it the English-Alapin Variation for lack of a better name (no, even though it's the title of the game, this name is just me clowning around, I don't think this is or should be the real name of this opening), at least until some commenter offers me a real name. Black responds with a natural developing move. Also, the knight on c6 covers e5 so it allows black to play Nf6 without worrying about white responding with e5."
