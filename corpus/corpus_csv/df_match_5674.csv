1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"After a long slump, my rating has finally crossed the 1700 line again, with the final push coming from this game in the 77th GK Tournament -- a brevity ending with an unusual domination of the queen. My opponent, sokolskyb4, does *not* begin with the opening named after him (which was a comfort, as I find it difficult to play against....)"
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"Instead, we play the first moves of a Nimzo-Indian. White must now choose whether to enter the Nimzo with 3. Nc3 or to avoid it."

5,a3,a2a3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/P7/1P2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"White chooses the Australian Attack. (Not to be confused with the Austrian Attack in the Pirc Defence....) If the move is intended solely to prevent the Nimzo, it seems a waste of time, since 3. Nf3 would achieve this while also developing; but probably (given the word ""Attack"" in the opening's name) it is normally played with the intention of queenside expansion. Nevertheless, a much rarer choice than Nf3; BCO2 does not consider it at all."
6,b6,b7b6,rnbqkb1r/p1pp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2PP4/P7/1P2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"I'm not sure what Black normally plays in this opening, so I try to take the game into lines I'm more familiar with -- a Queen's Indian, Petrosian Variation."
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/p1pp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2PP4/P1N5/1P2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,"White normally develops the other knight first, though I can't say I know why."
8,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/p1p2ppp/1p2pn2/3p4/2PP4/P1N5/1P2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"And this is definitely not in book; 5. Nf3 is usual, after which 5... Bb7 returns us to known lines. The move played prepares to establish a pawn on e4, but it has a downside: the queen is no longer defending d4."

I'm still not sure about this move, since it blocks the (back) c-pawn; my original plan was to slip in this move before playing Ba6 to hold the c4 pawn, but then I saw that this is refuted by Qa4 forking the pieces."
