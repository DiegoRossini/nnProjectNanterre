1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Having played John before, I know he likes to open with c4."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Although there are many good moves for black here, this isn't one of them. After 2. cxd5 Qxd5 3. Nc3, white has exchanged a side pawn for a black central pawn (good for white) and is ahead in development by gaining tempo against the black queen (also good for white)."
3,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3P4/8/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,But now it is white who misplays the opening by failing to develop with tempo against the black queen. 3. e3 also blocks in white's dark bishop along the c1-h6 diagonal.
4,Qxd5,d8d5,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,But now it is white who misplays the opening by failing to develop with tempo against the black queen. 3. e3 also blocks in white's dark bishop along the c1-h6 diagonal.
5,e3,e2e3,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/4P3/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,But now it is white who misplays the opening by failing to develop with tempo against the black queen. 3. e3 also blocks in white's dark bishop along the c1-h6 diagonal.
6,e5,e7e5,rnb1kbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3qp3/8/4P3/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,A good move: gaining space and keeping both diagonals open for the bishops to develop.
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1kbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3qp3/8/2N1P3/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,Better late than never. White develops with tempo against the black queen.
8,Qe6,d5e6,rnb1kbnr/ppp2ppp/4q3/4p3/8/2N1P3/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 5,"An interesting choice. I think I would prefer to put the queen on d8 or a5, as in the Scandinavian Defense. The text blocks in the light bishop, and the queen just seems out of place on e6."
9,Nge2,g1e2,rnb1kbnr/ppp2ppp/4q3/4p3/8/2N1P3/PP1PNPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 5,"I don't see the reason to play this instead of the normal Nf3. White must be planning to fianchetto the light bishop, as this blocks the f1-a6 diagonal."
10,Bd6,f8d6,rnb1k1nr/ppp2ppp/3bq3/4p3/8/2N1P3/PP1PNPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 4 6,"Developing a piece is better than wasting time with a pawn push, but the general rule is knights before bishops. This move puts black's ""bad"" bishop behind the e5 pawn where it lacks scope."
11,Ng3,e2g3,rnb1k1nr/ppp2ppp/3bq3/4p3/8/2N1P1N1/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 5 6,"This knight has taken two moves to get to the third rank when one move would have been sufficient. In my opinion this maneuver not only wastes a tempo, but the knight is not as well placed here as it would have been on f3."
12,Nf6,g8f6,rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/3bqn2/4p3/8/2N1P1N1/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 6 7,A fine developing move that fights for central squares and prepares castling.
13,Nb5,c3b5,rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/3bqn2/1N2p3/8/4P1N1/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 7 7,"A violation of opening principles, in that a developed piece is moved a second time when there are still other undeveloped pieces to be moved. And for what reason? To ""threaten"" the bishop on d6? For white to trade a knight he has invested three tempos in for black's bad bishop which has only moved once seems foolish. And black would get to recapture with the c pawn and atone for his mistake on move 1, by getting his second central pawn back."
14,Qd7,e6d7,rnb1k2r/pppq1ppp/3b1n2/1N2p3/8/4P1N1/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 8 8,"This one has me totally stumped. It is clear to me that black's development is going to be ...Nc6, ...Bd7, and ...O-O. To waste time repositioning the queen to the square the bishop needs to go to seems incredibly wrong. Can black be thinking of a fianchetto with the light bishop? But if so, why move the queen at all? Very curious this is."
15,b3,b2b3,rnb1k2r/pppq1ppp/3b1n2/1N2p3/8/1P2P1N1/P2P1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,Looking to take control of the long diagonal with Bb2.
16,O-O,e8g8,rnb2rk1/pppq1ppp/3b1n2/1N2p3/8/1P2P1N1/P2P1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 1 9,"Can't argue with an early castle. Neglecting his king's safety is one of Shawn's weaknesses, and he is refusing to let it be his downfall in this game. Good decision!"
17,Qc2,d1c2,rnb2rk1/pppq1ppp/3b1n2/1N2p3/8/1P2P1N1/P1QP1PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQ - 2 9,"White continues his odd development, but perhaps he is planning to take a shot at the h pawn with Bd3."
18,Nc6,b8c6,r1b2rk1/pppq1ppp/2nb1n2/1N2p3/8/1P2P1N1/P1QP1PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ - 3 10,"And black is clearly superior. He is ahead in development, has more space, and has a safer king. White must play carefully the next few moves or he will be positionally lost."
19,a3,a2a3,r1b2rk1/pppq1ppp/2nb1n2/1N2p3/8/PP2P1N1/2QP1PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQ - 0 10,"And instead of developing a piece, he wastes time with a meaningless pawn push. Danger, Will Robinson, Danger!"
20,a6,a7a6,r1b2rk1/1ppq1ppp/p1nb1n2/1N2p3/8/PP2P1N1/2QP1PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ - 0 11,"I feel conflicted about this move. On the one hand it doesn't help the light bishop get developed, and completing development should be black's highest priority. On the other hand, it may induce white to trade the knight for the Bd6, which I have pointed out would be good for black. Besides the reasons I gave on move 7, there is, now, another reason 11. Nxd6 cxd6 would be good for black. With white's queen on c2, black can play ...Rac8 and take control of the newly opened c-file with tempo against white's queen. If white refuses to trade, and plays the knight back to c3 (the only safe square), he is admitting his knight sortie was ill-advised."
21,Nxd6,b5d6,r1b2rk1/1ppq1ppp/p1nN1n2/4p3/8/PP2P1N1/2QP1PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQ - 0 11,"White does win the two bishops, but black is still ahead in development, and now has a chance to repair the damage to his pawn structure caused by his first move."
22,Qxd6,d7d6,r1b2rk1/1pp2ppp/p1nq1n2/4p3/8/PP2P1N1/2QP1PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ - 0 12,"But black commits what I think is a positional blunder. Not only does he allow white to keep a central pawn majority, but he forgoes a chance to open, and then control, the c-file. In black's defense, this move does get his queen out of the way of the bishop, in case he doesn't want to fianchetto."
