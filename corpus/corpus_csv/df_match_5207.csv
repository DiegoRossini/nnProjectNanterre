1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"oldgus (warren) and I began playing each other months ago during a Queen's Gambit tourney.  We struck up a friendship and began playing each other regularly.  Eventually, we decided to play a 100 game match.  At the time of this annotation, my record against oldgus is 6 wins, 18 losses, and two draws (although our record against each other is roughly equal over the last 10 games).  This annotation was done without assistance from computer although the gameknot computer analysis is available."

White's center is relatively stable and he is in position to begin King-side attack.  A typical plan for White might include Qd2, Bh6, g2-g4, and h2-h4.  However, 6.f3 does inhibit his N on g1."
