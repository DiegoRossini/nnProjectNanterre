Oh, wait, it's still blocked by a couple of pawns, isn't it? But from here, at least it supports the f-pawn, and I also have the option of Bf7 and bringing it out on the kingside if there's anything interesting over there."

Initiative - no one seems to have an advantage
Material - even
Pawn structure - I'm ahead. He has three pawn islands and doubled pawns
Lines & squares - I feel he's ahead because of his rook on f1 (temporarily) and his queen controlling the g-file is stronger than mine controlling e7-h4.
Officers - I'm ahead; my bishops are in better position (though only until he plays a3).
Development - even
King safety - even

Looks to me like we're running out of pieces, and I'm not feeling excited about breaking through in the pawn endgame."
