I prefer to bring out pieces first. Minimise pawn moves unless they are necessary, tried and tested, supported, and part of a clear plan. Just give this thought."

Do not move pawns unless - it is part of a proven tried opening system, or absolutely necessary, or the pawn is fully supported and it makes sense, or you have a clear plan and possibility to achieve promotion. Move 3, and 8 broke those ideas. Cut out blunders. Write down your moves, check the position on a real board, check the possible repies to your move. Watch out all the time for pins, forks, discovered checks, etc. and especially combinations which threaten your back rank.
You may be playing too many games and/or playing too fast. Use the allowed time. Take a minimum of 5 minutes concentration on every move. Write down ideas, positions, sequences, thoughts about what you are trying to achieve. Always have a plan !"
