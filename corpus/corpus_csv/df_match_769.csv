1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was a fun game that I recently played. I decided to annotate it because I had a pretty good attack and also because I had lost me previous game against this opponent and it was nice to get some revenge.

This is my first annotated game, so if you have any comments on my annotation style I'd appreciate hearing them."

6,dxc4,d5c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/2pP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Oddly enough he changes his mind and accepts the gambit. I don't think I've ever seen this before, but maybe it's more common than I think?"
7,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/2pPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,So I stick another pawn in the center and attack his pawn at the same time.
8,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/1bpPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"I'm not sure why he did this. Not only does he lose his bishop for a knight which is not usually a good trade, but he also allows me to bring a pawn into the middle and it opens the b file for my rook. It does leave my a pawn isolated, but I don't think I would have played this move."
