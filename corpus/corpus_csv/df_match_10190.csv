1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game shows how I crushed a master who didn't take me very seriously, he overextended his position and totally neglected his king safety. He was probably  having a bad tournament, because I have never seen a master lose like this before."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I usually don't like playing symmetrically against an opening move that I don't play as White, but at the time I couldn't find a better response. Now I am starting to like the sharp 1...c5."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Normally White gets an edge in Queen's Gambit Accepted lines, but for those who don't want to study the complicated lines of Slav, QGA gives black an easier time finding good moves, but White can get a slight advantage if he knows what he is doing"

5,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2pPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"I think this is too overextensive right now, most players play Nf3 or e3."
6,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4p3/2pPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Immediately striking at the overextended centre
7,dxe5,d4e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/2p1P3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"White neglects his king safety here, and wants to go into an endgame where he  thinks he should be able to hold the e5-pawn, and that I shouldn't be able to hold the c4-pawn"
8,Qxd1+,d8d1,rnb1kbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/2p1P3/8/PP3PPP/RNBqKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"Bxc4 Nxe5 seems pretty equal to me, but White further overextended his position trying to hold the e5-pawn, which is a big mistake, especially since he has a misplaced king and I will get a huge lead in development"

12,f6,f7f6,r1b1kbnr/ppp3pp/2n2p2/4P3/2p1PP2/8/PP4PP/RNBK1BNR w kq - 0 7,"Still, taking c4 and letting me get the e5-pawn should be White's best play, but White took f6 giving me a lead in development, still thinking that he would get an advantage if he wins the c4-pawn"

Where is the king going to run? the e2 and e1 squares can be attacked by Bb4  or Nd4  so Kc2 is safest here, but my superiorly developed pieces just annihilated him here, the rest of the moves of the game were all checks."
