1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Had another sparring match with The Dentist who is a former Class C Player (Optimum Rating 1407).  In this game I did not win copious amounts of material but I mounted a steady, stealthy attack.  Funnily enough, my precious queen, Glenda, known as The Defender played an almost pedestrian role until the very end of the game, when she delivered the Coup De Grace.  So, how did this happen?
