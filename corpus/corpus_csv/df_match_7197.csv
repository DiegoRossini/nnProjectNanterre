Black's plan is primitive: ..a5, then ..c4 later (restricting white's space on the queenside), followed by doubling or tripling major pieces on the b-file.

White wants to restrict black's movements on the queenside and press ahead with his play in the center. Threatening the black queen and a5 pawn forces black to play accurately. Nc4 also compliments a later f4, and either e5 or f5 pawn push"

Black will choose the best square for his queen later once minor pieces are deployed and white's intentions are clear. For example, ..Qc7 looks ok, but is anti-thematic as it allows white moves like Nb5 and a4. This is ok for black, but takes the game into different territory"

I would say in over 50% of games black could expect to arrive at this piece setup (irrespective of white's plans). This makes the opening easy for black to play for the first 12 or so moves

He exchanges, intending to push ..c4 in a few moves, move his knight to c5, and build a 2-pronged attack against e4 and b2.
