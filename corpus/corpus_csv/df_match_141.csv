1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is an interesting game. My opponent plays the opening fine. I am just getting to the end of my opening database line, when he makes a mistake. The first move of the combination is not original. Although he has an equal position after 12 moves, mistakes on move 13, 14, 16 and 17 lead to a hopeless position. My opponent resigns rather than prolonging the agony."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"So he keeps the position symmetrical, at least for now."
