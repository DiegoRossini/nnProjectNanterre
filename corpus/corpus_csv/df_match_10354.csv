Most players know that you can't checkmate a lone king with 2 knights, but not so many players know that you can often mate with 2 knights when the losing side still has a few pawns left.
I do not know how to start an annotation with an endgame position, so please ignore the first part of the game, which is just clearing off the material."

2 knights vs. a pawn is usually a winning endgame if the pawn is blockaded and sufficiently far from promotion. In my experience, this type of endgame occcurs when there are few pawns left compared to the number of pieces, the losing side might sacrifice for the few pawns you have, and hope for a draw in a position like this. 2 knights usually win against more than 1 pawn if the winning side can pick off the pawns and convert to a winning 2 knights vs. pawn endgame. Rook-pawn tends to be the most common version of this endgame, since most endgames with very few pawns take place on a flank, and rook-pawn is also the easiest since the blockading knight is already close to where the king will be cornered."
