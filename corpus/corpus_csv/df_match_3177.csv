1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

This game took place in GM Cyrano's Italian Coffee MT in which I played an Expert who had an optimum rating in the 2100s before succumbing to timeoutitis.  I won this game on timeout but Gameknot Analysis gave me a score of -0.50 so I decided to record this game as an Expert Draw rather than an Expert Victory.  As Gameknot Analysis shows below, there were no errors or inaccuracies in this game:-"
