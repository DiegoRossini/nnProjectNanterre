1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Popular as always. I've always been fond of e4 games, regardless if I'm White or Black."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,So I throw out my Sicilian.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"This is the Open Variation. (Closed is 2. Nc3). The irony is, while this is the Open lines, the position gets fairly locked up after about another 15 sets of moves..."
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,I prefer the Dragon/Najdorf lines over the Orthodox line (2 ...Nc6).
5,Bb5+,f1b5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 3,"And here, White throws out Bb5+! This line is known as the Canal-Sokolsky (Moscow) Attack. [Coincidentally, I found out that my opponent was Russian, to my humour] This is a line I've wanted to explore myself as White, and to deal with it as Black was actually pretty darn exciting on my end. When dealing with players who use the Najdorf, I like my English Attack, but I've been meaning to try this against players who either fend off that attack well, or avoid it with a different Sicilian line entirely."
6,Bd7,c8d7,rn1qkbnr/pp1bpppp/3p4/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 4,"Anyway, I block with the bishop. No sense blocking it in with the knight already."
7,Bxd7+,b5d7,rn1qkbnr/pp1Bpppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,"And he captures, as expected."
8,Nxd7,b8d7,r2qkbnr/pp1npppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"This is what Black normally plays in the main line, but frankly, given the way this game turned out, in hindsight, perhaps it'd have been better to capture with the Queen- you'll see why soon."
9,b3,b2b3,r2qkbnr/pp1npppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/1P3N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"This is not common. Normally when White plays Bb5+ after Nf3, the goal is to castle as soon as possible in order to capitalize on early development. This is a tactic commonly played in the Ruy Lopez. Instead, my opponent starts a fianchetto on the dark bishop. This isn't necessarily a bad move, and has performed well on the databases, but I certainly wouldn't try this line myself."
10,Ngf6,g8f6,r2qkb1r/pp1npppp/3p1n2/2p5/4P3/1P3N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 6,"I had to explore the variants of the databases myself, but in the end I decided this was the better move. This deters d4, and if Nc3, then it will surely hinder the eventual Bb2."
11,d3,d2d3,r2qkb1r/pp1npppp/3p1n2/2p5/4P3/1P1P1N2/P1P2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"Likewise, White plays this. I can't counterthreat with Bb4+ at all, either."
12,g6,g7g6,r2qkb1r/pp1npp1p/3p1np1/2p5/4P3/1P1P1N2/P1P2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"I want my bishop out, but Bg5 is playable after e6, so I counter with a fianchetto of my own."
13,Bb2,c1b2,r2qkb1r/pp1npp1p/3p1np1/2p5/4P3/1P1P1N2/PBP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 1 7,As expected.
14,Bg7,f8g7,r2qk2r/pp1nppbp/3p1np1/2p5/4P3/1P1P1N2/PBP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 2 8,And I continue my development.
15,O-O,e1g1,r2qk2r/pp1nppbp/3p1np1/2p5/4P3/1P1P1N2/PBP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 3 8,White opts to hide the kings away.
16,O-O,e8g8,r2q1rk1/pp1nppbp/3p1np1/2p5/4P3/1P1P1N2/PBP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - - 4 9,I oblige; I want to see what he wants to do next.
17,Nbd2,b1d2,r2q1rk1/pp1nppbp/3p1np1/2p5/4P3/1P1P1N2/PBPN1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 5 9,"An OK move, I think. Not sure if I'd have done this. White wants to bring the knight out, but if Nc3, then you block the c-pawn and hinder the dark bishop. He is clearly planning c4 at some point."
18,e5,e7e5,r2q1rk1/pp1n1pbp/3p1np1/2p1p3/4P3/1P1P1N2/PBPN1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 10,"I wasn't too sure what to do here, honestly. White had a lot of good pawn moves- c3/c4, d4, and e5. This at least prevents e5 and d4, and gives me more control over the long dark diagonal."
19,h3,h2h3,r2q1rk1/pp1n1pbp/3p1np1/2p1p3/4P3/1P1P1N1P/PBPN1PP1/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 10,"This probably wasn't the best of moves. Concerned about an attack on g4, but that clearly isn't going to help me after both light bishops got traded."
20,Nb8,d7b8,rn1q1rk1/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2p1p3/4P3/1P1P1N1P/PBPN1PP1/R2Q1RK1 w - - 1 11,"And here is the gist of why I'm wondering if 4 ...Qxd7 would have been better for Black. I'm realizing now that my knight pair doesn't have a lot of good squares worth controlling, where they were. Plus, should White open the center now, d6 was totally defenseless if the knight kept blocking the queen's access to it. One look at the board will clearly tell you that there is going to be a lot of queenside action soon, so c6 would have been a better square for this knight all along."
