6,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/3P1B2/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,"The solid move I like. Of course c4 is playable, but I think it gives some undeserved balance for black, weakening the black diagonal."

14,b6,b7b6,r1bq1rk1/p1pnppbp/1p3np1/3p4/3P1B2/2P2N1P/PPQNPPP1/R3KB1R w KQ - 0 8,"Ok, black just provided me of a ""hole"". It is not very useful, but the alternative plan is Be2, in sight of Ne5, g4, g5, and the black knight in f6 has to retreat. But this is very unilkely to happen, since black has many tempoes to ""do something"" in the meanwhile.
With the move I played, I intended to give the lsb some activity before black can play c4, trapping it."

Of course, I am prepared to exchange it with the knight, since it is not likely to have a great game against the fiachetto."

As long as the white diagonal is closed (and it will stay like that, no doubt), I can do moves like this without fear."

21,Ne5,f3e5,r2q1rk1/pb1nppbp/1p3np1/1B1pN3/2pP1BP1/2P1P2P/PPQN1P2/R3K2R b KQ - 1 11,Hmmm... yummy. I can start to clear the kingside landscape.
22,Nxe5,d7e5,r2q1rk1/pb2ppbp/1p3np1/1B1pn3/2pP1BP1/2P1P2P/PPQN1P2/R3K2R w KQ - 0 12,Hmmm... yummy. I can start to clear the kingside landscape.

I thought that 12. ..., d4, 13. exN, d3!, 14. Qa4, BxRh1, 15. fxg7, Kxg7 (or Re8), 16. ...xc4 (B or Q), would have been nice to play. Too deep and rich to calculate, but funny.  
Probably my opponent was a little worried to take this path."

I think this move is intended to compell me to exchange my lsb with the knight, since if I defend it with Nf3, after e6 it would have been an easy target."

I am sure black could have had some advantage playing it before, but it is hard to review."

Fortunately, f2 is well covered by the rook (this is the reason that Rh2 was preferred to Rg1. Now, I can have the other rook on g1, and keep all my fire power against the black king)."

Now, the logical answer would be f4. Black has to play g5 if he wants to break in... ok. But..."
