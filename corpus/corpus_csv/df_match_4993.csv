1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Queen's pawn opening, one of my favorites however, i was playing black so he had to make the move."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,My most usual reply to a queen's pawn opening
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Here, i took his Pawn, any top rated player would not recommend that, you will see the reason in the next move of white."
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Here, i took his Pawn, any top rated player would not recommend that, you will see the reason in the next move of white."

6,Qxd5,d8d5,rnb1kbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3q4/3P4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Here, i took his Pawn, any top rated player would not recommend that, you will see the reason in the next move of white."
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1kbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3q4/3P4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,"Nc3. This move of white forces the black queen to move to a different square. As a result black wastes a move. White gets an advantage to develop his pieces faster than the black. I knew this thing before i played the game, still i made it. Well the blunder is yet to come."
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1b1kbnr/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/3q4/3P4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 5,"Nc6??
This was the blunder i made. I didnt move my queen. This was a complete human error. I didnt notice that untill the next move."
9,Nxd5,c3d5,r1b1kbnr/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/3N4/3P4/8/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,As expected..
10,exd5,e6d5,r1b1kbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/3p4/3P4/8/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,At this point my queen was gone. I felt weak..
11,e3,e2e3,r1b1kbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/3p4/3P4/4P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,White already had an upper hand at this stage. He was developing his pieces to finish up an already won game..
12,Nf6,g8f6,r1b1kb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3p4/3P4/4P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 7,I knew he would definitely castle at a later stage in the game. At this point i was just expecting him to castle king side. Also i myself wanted to castle as soon as possible.
13,Bb5,f1b5,r1b1kb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/1B1p4/3P4/4P3/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 2 7,I knew he would definitely castle at a later stage in the game. At this point i was just expecting him to castle king side. Also i myself wanted to castle as soon as possible.

15,Bxc6+,b5c6,r1b1k2r/ppp2ppp/2Bb1n2/3p4/3P4/4P3/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 8,"Another jolt for me. Anybody would do that. Its a simple phenomenon that if you are at an advantage in a game, trade off equal pieces, this makes the opponent weaker and yourself stronger."
16,bxc6,b7c6,r1b1k2r/p1p2ppp/2pb1n2/3p4/3P4/4P3/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 9,"I was lagging on pieces, and my pawn structure had also shattered. Anybody looking at the board would definitely say that i have lost the game."

18,O-O,e8g8,r1b2rk1/p1p2ppp/2pb1n2/3p4/3P4/4P3/PP2NPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 2 10,"Although, i had planned an attack towards his king side, but i knew i cant make a direct attack. Plus i also had in mind not to let him move his queen. I was safe as long as his queen was at d1."
19,O-O,e1g1,r1b2rk1/p1p2ppp/2pb1n2/3p4/3P4/4P3/PP2NPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 3 10,"Although, i had planned an attack towards his king side, but i knew i cant make a direct attack. Plus i also had in mind not to let him move his queen. I was safe as long as his queen was at d1."

21,Re1,f1e1,r4rk1/p1p2ppp/b1pb1n2/3p4/3P4/4P3/PP2NPPP/R1BQR1K1 b - - 5 11,He freed his rook which was pinned in the earlier move.. i expected this.
22,Rab8,a8b8,1r3rk1/p1p2ppp/b1pb1n2/3p4/3P4/4P3/PP2NPPP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 6 12,"As i didnt have my queen, so i was bound to take the help of my rooks.."

However, he had other alternatives to defend his rook if i would have made that move. But this a3 move gave me an opportunity to launch a bishop-rook attack."
24,Bc4,a6c4,1r3rk1/p1p2ppp/2pb1n2/3p4/2bP4/P3P3/1P2NPPP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 1 13,"He made this move to free his pieces to launch an attack on me, however he made a mistake. His e4 pawn was supported by his knight at g3 and Rook at e1. I could easily take this e4 pawn by my Knight at f6, if i traded his g3 knight by my bishop at d6. But at this stage he would not have been expecting this, as he thought i would not afford to lose one more piece and that too a bishop (which are better in endgames than knights)."
