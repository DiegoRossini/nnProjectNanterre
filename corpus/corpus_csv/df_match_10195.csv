Which made me feel bad for a moment, since unexpected moves are a sign of a bad form or poor thinking process. But then I thought, wait a moment, it shouldn't be so good. He just gave extra space to my bishop on f4, allowed e4-e5 with subsequent d3-d4. Doesn't smell right. Ah, e5 will be met by Nh5, but I'll play Bg5, so I am Ok. If f6, I'll just exchange the pawns."

Now I can capture, the knight will go back to f6 and black's position is Ok. The pawn looks bad on f6, I should be able to exploit it somehow. What if e5-e6? Strange, but here for some reason I thought that black knight is trapped. I did not even see it could go to b8!!!"
