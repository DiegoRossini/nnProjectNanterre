3,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,"Again with the Philidor Variation? I'm going to give 2. Bc4? a question mark. The world DB hates it. The GK DB hates it. Both DBs give it a huge favor to black. I've personally faced it 6 times now on GameKnot (a disproportionate number for such an unsuccessful move) and I'm 6-0 against it. My reference on the Sicilian lists it as ""significantly inferior to all other standard replies and recommends the main line, Closed line, Morra Gambit, and Wing Gambit as far better options for white."" Yet, somehow, this move is popular here on GameKnot. It probably doesn't deserve a ?, but I'm giving it one anyway for the sheer folly of picking a move that barely rates better than 2. Ke2. Black immediately makes the white bishop look silly with 2. ... e6, a move black probably would have played at some point in the Sicilian anyway."
