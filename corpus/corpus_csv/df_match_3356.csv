1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I've been playing a lot of 1.c4 recently, but it's always good to stay in shape with the classics."
2,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The modern defense! I am wholly unfamiliar with this opening, but the basic idea is that White occupies the center while Black develops to the wings and will eventually attempt a break, usually with ...c5."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"A little reserved, with the thought of preventing Black from playing ...c5 anytime too soon."

8,a6,a7a6,rnbqk1nr/1pp1ppbp/p2p2p1/8/3PP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"Given the situation, this is a safe push for White. He'll seek to initiate a big attack on the Black kingside once he castles."

10,Nd7,b8d7,r1bqk1nr/1ppnppbp/p2p2p1/8/3PPP2/2N1B3/PPP3PP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,Preventing Bc4 and giving the Black LSB developmental options.
11,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqk1nr/1ppnppbp/p2p2p1/8/3PPP2/2N1BN2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 2 6,Preventing Bc4 and giving the Black LSB developmental options.

13,Bd3,f1d3,r1bqk1nr/2pnppbp/p2p2p1/1p6/3PPP2/2NBBN2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 7,The thematic break.
14,c5,c7c5,r1bqk1nr/3nppbp/p2p2p1/1pp5/3PPP2/2NBBN2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 8,The thematic break.

Up until this moment, we've stayed pretty firmly within the established theory (not that I'm that familiar with the theory, as I mentioned), but this move from Black takes us off-book. The standard line is 8...Nxc5 9.Bxc5 dxc5."

17,e5,e4e5,r1bqk1nr/3nppbp/p5p1/1pp1P3/5P2/2NBBN2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 9,"With no pawn on d6, White chooses to stuff Black's DSB, at the price of weakening the h1-a8 diagonal. A rather unassuming move--that will shape the rest of the game around it."
18,Bb7,c8b7,r2qk1nr/1b1nppbp/p5p1/1pp1P3/5P2/2NBBN2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 1 10,"This seems precarious at a glance because Black literally *just* placed a Bishop where it can see almost all the way down to the WK, but White is intending to make play before the BK can escape into his own castle (thanks to the thorny e5 pawn), and castling queenside is too slow. Besides, that Bishop is the only Black piece able to do anything at all."
19,O-O,e1g1,r2qk1nr/1b1nppbp/p5p1/1pp1P3/5P2/2NBBN2/PPP3PP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 2 10,"This seems precarious at a glance because Black literally *just* placed a Bishop where it can see almost all the way down to the WK, but White is intending to make play before the BK can escape into his own castle (thanks to the thorny e5 pawn), and castling queenside is too slow.

21,Qd2,d1d2,r2qk1nr/1b1n1pbp/p3p1p1/1pp1P3/5P2/2NBBN2/PPPQ2PP/R4RK1 b kq - 1 11,Preparing to double on the open file.

23,Be4,d3e4,r2qk1nr/1b1n1pbp/p3p1p1/1p2P3/2p1BP2/2N1BN2/PPPQ2PP/R4RK1 b kq - 1 12,White effectively shuts down Black's only decent piece.

28,Nd5,e7d5,r2qk2r/3n1pbp/p3p1p1/1p1nP3/2p1NP2/4BN2/PPPQ2PP/3R1RK1 w kq - 3 15,"? This is a pretty good place for this Knight, but it's still unclear where the other one might end up, and the DSB remains useless. Black really needed to play 14...Nf5 instead, shoring up d6..."
29,Nd6+,e4d6,r2qk2r/3n1pbp/p2Np1p1/1p1nP3/2p2P2/4BN2/PPPQ2PP/3R1RK1 b kq - 4 15,"What a glorious outpost for a Knight, on a friendly-controlled open file and supported by a strong pawn. And now Black can't castle, and his Bishop is even worse off than it already was. This move, I think, would have been even stronger a move ago, when Black would have had no choice but to play 15...Kf8 and shut the door on his Bishop for the forseeable future."

31,Ng5,f3g5,r2q1k1r/3n1pbp/p2Np1p1/1p1nP1N1/2p2P2/4B3/PPPQ2PP/3R1RK1 b - - 6 16,"Both of White's Knights are all up in Black's business, and together they threaten a nasty fork on f7."
