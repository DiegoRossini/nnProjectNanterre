1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"1.......... b6 - this is Owen's Defense, the purpose of this move is for the black lsb to be fianchettoed on b7 hitting out at e4 and ultimately g2 and a1.  So there is a counter in the centre that way.  I am warning you guys and dolls that I will be on the wrong end of a rout here, but as Owen's Defense is not well known then I hope this game will enlighten you!"

I would appreciate some feedback from the floor here as to:- a. Is the question mark too harsh, i.e. could white have played better further on in the game and saved it, or b. if that is not the case then any suggestions?  They will be much appreciated.  Cheers.
