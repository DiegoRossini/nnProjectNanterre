So here's my first attempt to tear down the najdorf.  I recommend skipping to move 15 when we leave 'book.'  Enjoy!"

Black will usually play ...e5 if given the chance and white may choose to allow that with common moves such as Be3, Be2 or f3 (which typically transposes into 6.Be3) or white can prevent black with 6.Bc4 forcing black to block the dangerous a2-g8 diagonal with 6... e6 and white can prevent ...e5 with 6.Bg5 which is the move featured in this game."

11,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,Now if 6... e5 black will have a horribly weak d5 square due to the pin on the f6 knight.
12,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,So black sensibly controls the d5 square.  6... Nbd7 is a reasonable alternative that also avoids the weak doubled pawns that would happen after a move like 6...h6?! 7.Bxf6!

At the same time though black can activate and has far better pawn structure in an endgame (as is the case in most sicilians, the sveshnikov being a notable exception)."

Other moves include (but are not limited to) Gelfand's favorite 7... Nbd7, the infamous poisoned pawn that usually follows 7... Qb6 (the poisoned pawn is when black grabs b2), Polugaevsky's line with a risky 7... b5, 7... Nc6 and the tricky 7... Qc7 where if white follows with a standard plan of Qf3 and 0-0-0 black starts a very quick attack by marching the b pawn.  But these are all main lines outside of this game."

The plans are clear, black will conclude development if he gets the chance with ...Bb7 and then use the c file with moves like ...Rc8 and ...b4 to pry it open.  White goes kingside, black has not castled yet but white can also blast open the center if necessary with one of his three levers (e5, f5 and g5).  The main plan here is to get the bishop out of the way of the g pawn, so white plays:"

White has huge pressure on the weak e6 square.  Black has two choices, defend e6 with 13... Nc5 or grab the pawn and survive the ensuing complications."

Black's move threatens to exchange white's knight but it draws the bishop away from defensive duties.  I've seen 15... Bf6 recommended and Q to e7 or d8 seem to be the most popular moves.  But why is 15... Be3 worse?  That was the question posed to me, and I think it's because the bishop becomes a target for white's pieces, my queen will not be on h5 forever, and when it returns to e2 it will do so with gain of tempo.  Also a knight on d5 will fork queen and bishop (again winning tempo), how can I make that happen?"
