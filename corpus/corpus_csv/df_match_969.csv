6,Qxd5,d8d5,rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3q4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"And I think we switched to the Qxd5 variation here, with Qxd5 and Nf6 swapped. Still ok, but I like to push a queen around while developing."
7,c4,c2c4,rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3q4/2PP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,And so I start pushing. I prefer c4 over Nc3 as it gives me more space and even prepares a move like d5 dominating the center. I don't really mind a move like Qe4+ as I can put my DSB in between (I'd rather not move my knight to e2 as it belongs on f3 and Be2 gets struck down by Qxg2 and the loss of a rook)
8,Qe4+,d5e4,rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/8/2PPq3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"An attack on my center, well it had to come sooner or later. e5 also allows Bb4+ which could get annoying since my DSB is pinned. Most people say that after Bb4+ you can play Nc3 since Bxc3 bxc3 is ok for white, with a solid center and the bisschop pair, but I still ain't convinced."

11,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1kb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/4p3/2PPq3/2N1B3/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 1 6,Lets just continue kicking the queen. However this bumps into the pin of Bb4 and thus isn't much better than blocking of Bb4+ with Nc3.
12,Bb4,f8b4,rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/4p3/1bPPq3/2N1B3/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 2 7,"?? A blunder on my part. It allows Qxg2 and wins material. But I saw some interesting attacking possibilities in this position, black's king is still centralised, and yes indeed only one move away from castling, but if I can prevent that the open center might prove to give black troubles."

But Be4 is not an option anymore after Bxc3. It however grants me the option to lose a minor piece rather than a rook with Ne2."

I took with the knight on d4 because after castling my bischop would prove far stronger than the knight on d4 eying on the long diagonal and attacking the knight which would become undefended after Rg1 pinning the g7-pawn with tempo on the queen. and if he didn't castle then I would've got two rooks that would jump to the open d- and e-files harassing his king.
