19,Ne6,g5e6,r2q1b1r/pppnp2p/2k1N1p1/8/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 2 10,White continues with the usual knight move that restrains the Black e-pawn and attacks the Black Q.
20,Nf6,d7f6,r2q1b1r/ppp1p2p/2k1Nnp1/8/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 3 11,"?!  Now Black really surprised me by returning the Q immediately.  Perhaps he thought he'd get 2 pieces for the Q but he only gets 1, so White is then a comfortable piece ahead.  Perhaps he just didn't see that the Q was under attack (believe me, it's possible, especially if you're playing a hundred games simultaneously and not looking at the board properly). Whatever, it was an interesting approach."

One always has to be careful in calculating the relative benefits and risks associated with such decisions.  I'm not sure this was the most relevant move right now.
39,d4,d2d4,1k3r2/2p1p1bp/1p1r2p1/p7/3PRP2/1BP5/PP4PP/R1B3K1 b - - 0 20,But this was.

As noted before, pawns of the same colour get in the way, so it didn't have a lot of choice about where to go.
