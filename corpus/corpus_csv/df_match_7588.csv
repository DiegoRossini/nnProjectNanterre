13,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/3NPP2/2N5/PPP1B1PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 7,Now I was tempted to swap knights immediately to weaken Black's queenside pawns but eventually decided to castle first.

15,Be3,c1e3,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/3NPP2/2N1B3/PPP1B1PP/R2QK2R b KQ - 4 8,Now I was tempted to swap knights immediately to weaken Black's queenside pawns but eventually decided to castle first.
16,Nc6,b8c6,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/3NPP2/2N1B3/PPP1B1PP/R2QK2R w KQ - 5 9,Now I was tempted to swap knights immediately to weaken Black's queenside pawns but eventually decided to castle first.
17,O-O,e1g1,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/3NPP2/2N1B3/PPP1B1PP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 6 9,At this stage I had used more time than my opponent and was settling nicely into the rhythm of the game.
18,a6,a7a6,r1bq1rk1/1p2ppbp/p1np1np1/8/3NPP2/2N1B3/PPP1B1PP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 10,Now the temptation to swap knights before Black was defending it with Q or B was too strong.
19,Nxc6,d4c6,r1bq1rk1/1p2ppbp/p1Np1np1/8/4PP2/2N1B3/PPP1B1PP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 10,"With this move, I chose my strategy of harassing Black's queenside, exploiting the hole at b6.  I think last time we played I attacked in the centre."
20,bxc6,b7c6,r1bq1rk1/4ppbp/p1pp1np1/8/4PP2/2N1B3/PPP1B1PP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 11,I was keen to play Na4 and either Nb6 or Bb6 but first I needed to move the rook off the long diagonal and defend the b-pawn.
21,Bf3,e2f3,r1bq1rk1/4ppbp/p1pp1np1/8/4PP2/2N1BB2/PPP3PP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 11,I was keen to play Na4 and either Nb6 or Bb6 but first I needed to move the rook off the long diagonal and defend the b-pawn.
22,Qc7,d8c7,r1b2rk1/2q1ppbp/p1pp1np1/8/4PP2/2N1BB2/PPP3PP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 2 12,I was keen to play Na4 and either Nb6 or Bb6 but first I needed to move the rook off the long diagonal and defend the b-pawn.
23,Rb1,a1b1,r1b2rk1/2q1ppbp/p1pp1np1/8/4PP2/2N1BB2/PPP3PP/1R1Q1RK1 b - - 3 12,I was keen to play Na4 and either Nb6 or Bb6 but first I needed to move the rook off the long diagonal and defend the b-pawn.
24,Rb8,a8b8,1rb2rk1/2q1ppbp/p1pp1np1/8/4PP2/2N1BB2/PPP3PP/1R1Q1RK1 w - - 4 13,Threatening the a-pawn forces Black's QB to stay on the short diagonal or one of the major pieces to defend it.  On the e-file the Q may also have a future attacking down the middle.
25,Qe2,d1e2,1rb2rk1/2q1ppbp/p1pp1np1/8/4PP2/2N1BB2/PPP1Q1PP/1R3RK1 b - - 5 13,Threatening the a-pawn forces Black's QB to stay on the short diagonal or one of the major pieces to defend it.  On the e-file the Q may also have a future attacking down the middle.
26,Bb7,c8b7,1r3rk1/1bq1ppbp/p1pp1np1/8/4PP2/2N1BB2/PPP1Q1PP/1R3RK1 w - - 6 14,I was already disappointed with the prospects for this attack but still felt it had value in tying Black down on the queenside.
27,Na4,c3a4,1r3rk1/1bq1ppbp/p1pp1np1/8/N3PP2/4BB2/PPP1Q1PP/1R3RK1 b - - 7 14,I was already disappointed with the prospects for this attack but still felt it had value in tying Black down on the queenside.
28,Nd7,f6d7,1r3rk1/1bqnppbp/p1pp2p1/8/N3PP2/4BB2/PPP1Q1PP/1R3RK1 w - - 8 15,Black covers the hole and opens up the long diagonal.
29,Qf2,e2f2,1r3rk1/1bqnppbp/p1pp2p1/8/N3PP2/4BB2/PPP2QPP/1R3RK1 b - - 9 15,reinforcing the attack on b6 but now Black has a simple and strong reply.
30,c5,c6c5,1r3rk1/1bqnppbp/p2p2p1/2p5/N3PP2/4BB2/PPP2QPP/1R3RK1 w - - 0 16,This blocks the attack on the black diagonal and opens up scope for Black's QB.
31,Nc3,a4c3,1r3rk1/1bqnppbp/p2p2p1/2p5/4PP2/2N1BB2/PPP2QPP/1R3RK1 b - - 1 16,So now I recentralise my knight.  I was not concerned by the prospect of Black doubling my c-pawn as that would cost him his fianchettoed KB.
32,Nb6,d7b6,1r3rk1/1bq1ppbp/pn1p2p1/2p5/4PP2/2N1BB2/PPP2QPP/1R3RK1 w - - 2 17,"Black now prepares a counter-attack with ...d5 and, as I saw quite late, threatens ...Nc4, followed by ....Nxe3 and ...Bd4 or by ...Nxb2 and ...Bxc3"
33,Qe2,f2e2,1r3rk1/1bq1ppbp/pn1p2p1/2p5/4PP2/2N1BB2/PPP1Q1PP/1R3RK1 b - - 3 17,So the Q returned to e2.
34,e6,e7e6,1r3rk1/1bq2pbp/pn1pp1p1/2p5/4PP2/2N1BB2/PPP1Q1PP/1R3RK1 w - - 0 18,Black builds his counter-attack slowly.
35,Rfd1,f1d1,1r3rk1/1bq2pbp/pn1pp1p1/2p5/4PP2/2N1BB2/PPP1Q1PP/1R1R2K1 b - - 1 18,"Now I couldn't see a way of preventing ...d5 with the threat of ...d4, forking N and B, so I looked for a way of counter-attacking or under-mining the pawn's support."
36,Rfd8,f8d8,1r1r2k1/1bq2pbp/pn1pp1p1/2p5/4PP2/2N1BB2/PPP1Q1PP/1R1R2K1 w - - 2 19,"Now I couldn't see a way of preventing ...d5 with the threat of ...d4, forking N and B, so I looked for a way of counter-attacking or under-mining the pawn's support."
37,a4,a2a4,1r1r2k1/1bq2pbp/pn1pp1p1/2p5/P3PP2/2N1BB2/1PP1Q1PP/1R1R2K1 b - - 0 19,"?!  I didn't really believe in this as I played it and it didn't really help but I couldn't find anything else.  Curiously, I noticed that this was my first pawn move since my opening three pawn moves.  In contrast, Black had already made 8 pawn moves."
