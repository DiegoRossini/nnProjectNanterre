22,Bd7,c8d7,r2q1rk1/pp1bbppp/nnp1p3/4P3/2PPN3/3B1N2/PP4PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 8 12,This capture just feels wrong. Black needs defensive resources to try to hold off my attack. A better defensive plan for black was 12. g6 13. Re8 14. Bf8 to hold the dark squares around his king. Note that g6 also prevents sacrificial ideas on h7
23,Neg5,e4g5,r2q1rk1/pp1bbppp/nnp1p3/4P1N1/2PP4/3B1N2/PP4PP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 9 12,This capture just feels wrong. Black needs defensive resources to try to hold off my attack.

29,Bb1,d3b1,r2q1rk1/pp1b1pp1/1np1p2p/4P3/1nPP4/7N/PP4PP/RBBQ1RK1 b - - 3 15,The best place for this bishop. The b1-h7 diagonal is just too juicy to leave
30,Nxc4,b6c4,r2q1rk1/pp1b1pp1/2p1p2p/4P3/1nnP4/7N/PP4PP/RBBQ1RK1 w - - 0 16,Black munches a pawn but he really needs to watch his kingside
31,Bxh6,c1h6,r2q1rk1/pp1b1pp1/2p1p2B/4P3/1nnP4/7N/PP4PP/RB1Q1RK1 b - - 0 16,"The first bishop sacrifice. Accepting it leads to 16.gxh6 17. Qg4+ kh8 18. Rf6! Where black must give up his queen to prevent an immediate mate, even then the black king still gets in trouble after 18. Qxf6 19.exf6 Rg8 20. Qh5"

36,Qe7,d8e7,r4rk1/pp1bqp2/2p1p1BB/4P3/1n1P2Q1/7N/Pn4PP/R4RK1 w - - 1 19,??? This loses very quickly. Black sees the danger of accepting and tries to bring in the queen for defence so as to capture my LSB next move but...
37,Bh7+,g6h7,r4rk1/pp1bqp1B/2p1p2B/4P3/1n1P2Q1/7N/Pn4PP/R4RK1 b - - 2 19,"..... his queen won't have a chance to defend. A wonderful game on my path which I enjoyed playing.
