1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This is a pretty standard opener for me; I sometimes play 1.d5 too.
2,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Black plays the Robatsch (Modern) defence. He aims to put his bishop on g7, pressurizing White's central pawns, and to castle kingside where his king would be quite safe from attacks."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,I place another pawn toward the middle of the board.
4,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"I put a third pawn toward the centre of the board. If Black plays too passively here, his pieces may lack manoeuvring room later on..."
5,c4,c2c4,rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/8/2PPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"I put a third pawn toward the centre of the board. If Black plays too passively here, his pieces may lack manoeuvring room later on..."
6,c5,c7c5,rnbqk1nr/pp1pppbp/6p1/2p5/2PPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"However, this is a good way to start breaking White's center."
7,d5,d4d5,rnbqk1nr/pp1pppbp/6p1/2pP4/2P1P3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"Taking the pawn would be bad, as it would completely disrupt my pawn formation. Besides, Black could immediately regain the pawn via 4...Qa5+. A downside to 4.d5 is that it leaves d4 and e5 to Black."
8,d6,d7d6,rnbqk1nr/pp2ppbp/3p2p1/2pP4/2P1P3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,Natural developing moves.
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk1nr/pp2ppbp/3p2p1/2pP4/2P1P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 5,Natural developing moves.
10,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2pP4/2P1P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 6,Natural developing moves.
11,f3,f2f3,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2pP4/2P1P3/2N2P2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,Natural developing moves.
12,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2pP4/2P1P3/2N2P2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR w KQ - 1 7,Natural developing moves.
13,Be3,c1e3,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2pP4/2P1P3/2N1BP2/PP4PP/R2QKBNR b KQ - 2 7,Natural developing moves.
14,e6,e7e6,rnbq1rk1/pp3pbp/3ppnp1/2pP4/2P1P3/2N1BP2/PP4PP/R2QKBNR w KQ - 0 8,Black starts to contest White's imposing center.
15,Qd2,d1d2,rnbq1rk1/pp3pbp/3ppnp1/2pP4/2P1P3/2N1BP2/PP1Q2PP/R3KBNR b KQ - 1 8,"Taking on e6 would leave Black with a somewhat backward e pawn, but it would have released some pressure on Black. I'd rather slow down the game and complete my development first, as Black do not have any significant lines of attack right now and my slight spatial advantage might be enough to win in the long term."
16,exd5,e6d5,rnbq1rk1/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pp4/2P1P3/2N1BP2/PP1Q2PP/R3KBNR w KQ - 0 9,"Black tries to open up the game, as my king is still in the middle of the board."
17,cxd5,c4d5,rnbq1rk1/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N1BP2/PP1Q2PP/R3KBNR b KQ - 0 9,"This is better than taking with the e pawn, as the latter option would open up the e file (my king is there! Thought I could castle queenside) and it would leave f5 for his bishop. However, taking with the c pawn allows Black to break through the queenside more easily later."
18,Na6,b8a6,r1bq1rk1/pp3pbp/n2p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N1BP2/PP1Q2PP/R3KBNR w KQ - 1 10,Black plans to place his knight to c7 next turn in order to support a b7-b5 breakthrough and storm my queenside.
19,Bxa6,f1a6,r1bq1rk1/pp3pbp/B2p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N1BP2/PP1Q2PP/R3K1NR b KQ - 0 10,"!? However, I decided to give away by bishop pair to take out his knight while I can. Since the position is relatively closed for now, knights might be more useful than bishops! As a small bonus, this move frees up space for castling kingside."
20,bxa6,b7a6,r1bq1rk1/p4pbp/p2p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N1BP2/PP1Q2PP/R3K1NR w KQ - 0 11,The good news are that Black's queenside pawns are busted. The bad news are that the b file is quite open to his pieces...
21,Nge2,g1e2,r1bq1rk1/p4pbp/p2p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N1BP2/PP1QN1PP/R3K2R b KQ - 1 11,Normal development.
22,Nd7,f6d7,r1bq1rk1/p2n1pbp/p2p2p1/2pP4/4P3/2N1BP2/PP1QN1PP/R3K2R w KQ - 2 12,Normal development.
23,O-O,e1g1,r1bq1rk1/p2n1pbp/p2p2p1/2pP4/4P3/2N1BP2/PP1QN1PP/R4RK1 b - - 3 12,Normal development.
24,Ne5,d7e5,r1bq1rk1/p4pbp/p2p2p1/2pPn3/4P3/2N1BP2/PP1QN1PP/R4RK1 w - - 4 13,! This is quite annoying... I can't play 13.Bh6 here due to 13...Nc4.
25,Bf4,e3f4,r1bq1rk1/p4pbp/p2p2p1/2pPn3/4PB2/2N2P2/PP1QN1PP/R4RK1 b - - 5 13,I played this so that 13...Nc4 does not force a trade of pieces. 13.b3 would be dangerous due to the bishop on g7 looking at my rook on a1.
26,Rb8,a8b8,1rbq1rk1/p4pbp/p2p2p1/2pPn3/4PB2/2N2P2/PP1QN1PP/R4RK1 w - - 6 14,Black pressurizes my b pawn and threatens to play Nc4 once again.
27,Rab1,a1b1,1rbq1rk1/p4pbp/p2p2p1/2pPn3/4PB2/2N2P2/PP1QN1PP/1R3RK1 b - - 7 14,I move my rook out of the a1-h8 diagonal in order to support my endangered b pawn.
28,Bd7,c8d7,1r1q1rk1/p2b1pbp/p2p2p1/2pPn3/4PB2/2N2P2/PP1QN1PP/1R3RK1 w - - 8 15,"!? This is a bit risky, as Black may push his pawn to c4 and blow open my position if I misplay later on."
29,b3,b2b3,1r1q1rk1/p2b1pbp/p2p2p1/2pPn3/4PB2/1PN2P2/P2QN1PP/1R3RK1 b - - 0 15,"!? This is a bit risky, as Black may push his pawn to c4 and blow open my position if I misplay later on."
