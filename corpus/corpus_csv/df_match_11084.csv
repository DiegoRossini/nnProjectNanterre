1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,a fun sacrificial game
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"The Budapest Defence. Black cracks open the positon with an early e5, although he'll have to move his knight again black will be compensated by whites weak central pawns. also people who play 1.d4 tend to prefer closed positions so this provocative opening is good for getting players into unfamiliar positions with lots of tactical traps for white to fall into. note that in the long run white can't hope to hold on to the pawn on e5, except with an early f4 but black will get good compensation for the pawn"

5,dxe5,d4e5,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4P3/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,the main alternative here in Ne4 but due to the responce 4.a3! black ends up with very little play.

7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/2P3n1/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,Bf4 is a better way to defend the pawn
8,d6,d7d6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p4/4P3/2P3n1/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,offering a pawn for development. after exd6 Bxd6 there are some nasty traps that can often catch some of the unprepared.
9,exd6,e5d6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3P4/8/2P3n1/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"sensibly avoiding the trap, if white doesn't prtect his queen or free up the e2 square black can here play Nxf2 when he bags at least the exchange as Kxf2 loses the queen to Bg3 !"
10,Bxd6,f8d6,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/3b4/8/2P3n1/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"sensibly avoiding the trap, if white doesn't prtect his queen or free up the e2 square black can here play Nxf2 when he bags at least the exchange as Kxf2 loses the queen to Bg3 !"

12,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/3b4/8/2P3n1/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQ - 1 7,getting the king out of the way so black can start trying to exploit his development advantage as white can't try to develop with check
13,h3,h2h3,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/3b4/8/2P3n1/4PN1P/PP3PP1/RNBQKB1R b KQ - 0 7,now it is safe to kick the knight
14,Nf6,g4f6,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/3b1n2/8/2P5/4PN1P/PP3PP1/RNBQKB1R w KQ - 1 8,black is also tring to castle early. as the centre is so open it makes sence to try and get the king to safety
15,Be2,f1e2,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/3b1n2/8/2P5/4PN1P/PP2BPP1/RNBQK2R b KQ - 2 8,black is also tring to castle early. as the centre is so open it makes sence to try and get the king to safety
16,Be6,c8e6,rn1q1rk1/ppp2ppp/3bbn2/8/2P5/4PN1P/PP2BPP1/RNBQK2R w KQ - 3 9,pressuring the exposed c pawn
17,a3,a2a3,rn1q1rk1/ppp2ppp/3bbn2/8/2P5/P3PN1P/1P2BPP1/RNBQK2R b KQ - 0 9,? only allowing blacks development advantage to grow. castling or developing a piece would be better here
18,Nc6,b8c6,r2q1rk1/ppp2ppp/2nbbn2/8/2P5/P3PN1P/1P2BPP1/RNBQK2R w KQ - 1 10,"white is trying to claim space on the queenside but this is a bit premature, his pieces cannont control the queenside from there starting squares"
19,b4,b2b4,r2q1rk1/ppp2ppp/2nbbn2/8/1PP5/P3PN1P/4BPP1/RNBQK2R b KQ - 0 10,"white is trying to claim space on the queenside but this is a bit premature, his pieces cannont control the queenside from there starting squares"
20,b6,b7b6,r2q1rk1/p1p2ppp/1pnbbn2/8/1PP5/P3PN1P/4BPP1/RNBQK2R w KQ - 0 11,?! preventing the annoying c5 push but prehaps immediately striking at the white pawns with a5 was better here
21,Bb2,c1b2,r2q1rk1/p1p2ppp/1pnbbn2/8/1PP5/P3PN1P/1B2BPP1/RN1QK2R b KQ - 1 11,finally developing another piece
22,Qd7,d8d7,r4rk1/p1pq1ppp/1pnbbn2/8/1PP5/P3PN1P/1B2BPP1/RN1QK2R w KQ - 2 12,black aims to bring his rooks to the open files as quickly as possible
23,O-O,e1g1,r4rk1/p1pq1ppp/1pnbbn2/8/1PP5/P3PN1P/1B2BPP1/RN1Q1RK1 b - - 3 12,black can even play the sacrifice Bxh3 here as white is so poorly developed
24,Rad8,a8d8,3r1rk1/p1pq1ppp/1pnbbn2/8/1PP5/P3PN1P/1B2BPP1/RN1Q1RK1 w - - 4 13,black can even play the sacrifice Bxh3 here as white is so poorly developed
25,Qa4,d1a4,3r1rk1/p1pq1ppp/1pnbbn2/8/QPP5/P3PN1P/1B2BPP1/RN3RK1 b - - 5 13,? why does the queen need to go to a4? it does absolutely nothing there
26,Rfe8,f8e8,3rr1k1/p1pq1ppp/1pnbbn2/8/QPP5/P3PN1P/1B2BPP1/RN3RK1 w - - 6 14,"doubling my f pawns, but white has just traded his best piece and opened my g file towards his scantly protected kingside"
27,Bxf6,b2f6,3rr1k1/p1pq1ppp/1pnbbB2/8/QPP5/P3PN1P/4BPP1/RN3RK1 b - - 0 14,"doubling my f pawns, but white has just traded his best piece and opened my g file towards his scantly protected kingside"
28,gxf6,g7f6,3rr1k1/p1pq1p1p/1pnbbp2/8/QPP5/P3PN1P/4BPP1/RN3RK1 w - - 0 15,"here i decide i need to make something happen, after such poor play from white he needs to be punished..."
29,Nc3,b1c3,3rr1k1/p1pq1p1p/1pnbbp2/8/QPP5/P1N1PN1P/4BPP1/R4RK1 b - - 1 15,"here i decide i need to make something happen, after such poor play from white he needs to be punished..."
30,Bxh3,e6h3,3rr1k1/p1pq1p1p/1pnb1p2/8/QPP5/P1N1PN1b/4BPP1/R4RK1 w - - 0 16,black cannot possibly take the bishop here as after Qxh3 white has a hard time finding any cover for his king and white can simply play Kh8 followed by Rg8 and white is already losing
