1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Hello everybody!!! I'm annotating this game bacause i liked it very much...It was from a tournament i'm still playing! So it started with e4.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I used to play e5 but now i'm playing my favourite Sicilian defence...
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,He choosed that variation playing d4. Not bad but i think Nf3 would be better...
4,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3pP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,I took the pawn...
5,Qxd4,d1d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 0 3,And he took it with his queen...
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"That seems logical...I actually never played this variation before, expept playing it in blitz games..."
7,Qe3,d4e3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/4P3/4Q3/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 2 4,He played that move but i think Qd1 would be more safe for his queen...
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/4P3/4Q3/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 3 5,I opened the other knight...
9,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/4P3/2N1Q3/PPP2PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 4 5,That move seems good..
10,e6,e7e6,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/8/4P3/2N1Q3/PPP2PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 0 6,I think this is the greatest move to play...What do  you think?
11,Bd2,c1d2,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/8/4P3/2N1Q3/PPPB1PPP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 1 6,Better would be Nf3 i guess...
12,d5,d7d5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/3p4/4P3/2N1Q3/PPPB1PPP/R3KBNR w KQkq - 0 7,And now i was between that move and Be7....My thought was to attack and play more aggresive than playing Be7 which seems more pathetic (i know it is a good move too)...
13,e5,e4e5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/3pP3/8/2N1Q3/PPPB1PPP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 0 7,And now he made the first mistake....e5 showed me i took the right decision before...he might ignored the threat that was coming from d4....
14,d4,d5d4,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/4P3/3p4/2N1Q3/PPPB1PPP/R3KBNR w KQkq - 0 8,d4! That was a good move that will give an advantage early in the game being with a knight up for the rest...
15,Qg5,e3g5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/4P1Q1/3p4/2N5/PPPB1PPP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 1 8,He's protecting his queen for sure!
