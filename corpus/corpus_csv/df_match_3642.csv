The more important rule that it is almost always better to acquire understanding of chess than to get the theoretical knowledge. With theory, you are getting one position memorized. With understanding, you get a better thought process that will get you hundreds of better moves in your chess play. So *Thought process is more important than theoretical knowledge by a huge amount, at least for the club players trying to improve."

Using the first tip, you can know that when studying openings, most players do not need a very deep opening knowledge. Instead, they should get a general understanding of the plan for both sides. Of course it depends on the opening, and heres the next tip. 2-Improving club players should NOT use highly complicated openings that require heavy theoretical knowledge. If an opening requires you to study book for many hours, it is the wrong choice. You should be able to find right moves after a general understanding."

One of the most important things I learned from an experienced chess master from a tournament was that chess improvement happens suddenly and not steadily. Fischer once said ""One day, I just got good"". Basically, if you study chess correctly by improving thinking, you won't get immediate improvement, but you will get a sudden bursts after long periods of time. So don't expect to improve by a few points each week or something. You will get a sudden noticable improvement."
