While it blocks the discovered check, black can still take on c4, because the bishop that was defending it is now pinned. A balancing factor to all this is that taking on c4 merely equalizes material and that white will regain his slight advantage in the development because black needs to make so many moves with his bishop. However, the c-pawn is also rather important, because once it is gone, the d-pawn can no longer count on support from fellow pawns and will therefore likely become a prey for black in the future."
