Bg4. his pawn structure is very dificult to defend (three groups and doble pawns on the c file). the only benefit from this variation is the open d file and the semi-open b file.

for Black's behalf I can say that there is a plan of f5 somehow and it will give a better resistance."

31,Bd2,c1d2,1r2k2r/4qpp1/2pb1n1p/p1p1p3/4P3/1P3Q2/P1PBNPPP/1R1R2K1 b k - 3 16,black sacrifices two pawns in order to ruin White's pawn structure and to gain more maneuvering space. very interesting.

43,Ra1,b1a1,6k1/4qp2/2pb1npp/4p3/2P1P3/2BQ4/r1P1NPPP/R5K1 b - - 1 22,the theory says that one should exchange pieces when he has more material. I think that the position is rather equal or maybe even in Black's favour so the rook exchange is not that great.
