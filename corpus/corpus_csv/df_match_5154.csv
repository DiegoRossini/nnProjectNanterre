1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"A normal, somewhat aggressive first move."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I generally have bad luck with the Sicilian so I like Open Game.
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"An interestingly defensive choice of knight movement.  This is more of a waiting move than anything, leading to the dangerous Vienna Game."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,"Black decides to take the Falkbeer Defense, challenging the d5 square."
5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 3 3,White has nailed down the d-pawn by absolutely controlling the d5 square.
6,c6,c7c6,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2p2n2/4p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 4,Alekhine recommends Nxe4 here - this move is rather timid and not terribly good.
7,b4,b2b4,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2p2n2/4p3/1PB1P3/2N5/P1PP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 4,"More aggression, White is trying to assert control over the fifth rank."
8,Bxb4,f8b4,rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/2p2n2/4p3/1bB1P3/2N5/P1PP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,"But White makes a bad blunder there and gets Black's bishop out of the back rank, in a strong and annoying position to boot."
9,d4,d2d4,rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/2p2n2/4p3/1bBPP3/2N5/P1P2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,"Another, even worse move.  White is apparently trying to attack Black's center."
10,Bxc3+,b4c3,rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/2p2n2/4p3/2BPP3/2b5/P1P2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,Black sees the undefended knight and the opportunity to check the king and fork the rook as well.
11,Bd2,c1d2,rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/2p2n2/4p3/2BPP3/2b5/P1PB1PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 1 6,"The most sensible move, White wants that bishop off the board."
12,Bxa1,c3a1,rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/2p2n2/4p3/2BPP3/8/P1PB1PPP/b2QK1NR w Kkq - 0 7,"Bxd2 or Bxd4 might be good here, but getting a rook off the board on the sixth move is always nice."
13,c3,c2c3,rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/2p2n2/4p3/2BPP3/2P5/P2B1PPP/b2QK1NR b Kkq - 0 7,"White moves to trap the bishop in his corner; not the best move in the world since Qxa1 is available, though it does defend the d-pawn."
14,Nxe4,f6e4,rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/2p5/4p3/2BPn3/2P5/P2B1PPP/b2QK1NR w Kkq - 0 8,"More and more captures, leading to a weak White formation."
15,Qb3,d1b3,rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/2p5/4p3/2BPn3/1QP5/P2B1PPP/b3K1NR b Kkq - 1 8,"Prepping for a Bxf7, a really bad move as White should have other priorities."
16,exd4,e5d4,rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/2p5/8/2Bpn3/1QP5/P2B1PPP/b3K1NR w Kkq - 0 9,Castling might work here but Black has nothing to fear from the weak check and will keep harassing White.
17,Bxf7+,c4f7,rnbqk2r/pp1p1Bpp/2p5/8/3pn3/1QP5/P2B1PPP/b3K1NR b Kkq - 0 9,"White follows through. An attack, finally, although a weak one."
18,Kf8,e8f8,rnbq1k1r/pp1p1Bpp/2p5/8/3pn3/1QP5/P2B1PPP/b3K1NR w K - 1 10,"Forced, basically, as Ke7 pins in the queen and is asking for something bad to happen."
19,Nf3,g1f3,rnbq1k1r/pp1p1Bpp/2p5/8/3pn3/1QP2N2/P2B1PPP/b3K2R b K - 2 10,"An attack on the center, White wants to bolster up his burgeoning attack."
20,dxc3,d4c3,rnbq1k1r/pp1p1Bpp/2p5/8/4n3/1Qp2N2/P2B1PPP/b3K2R w K - 0 11,There is more havoc to be wreaked; White's attack is still pretty toothless and Black is having fun here.
