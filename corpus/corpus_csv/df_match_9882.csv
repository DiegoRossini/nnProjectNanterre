7,f4,f2f4,r1bqkbnr/ppp1p1pp/2n2p2/3pP3/3P1P2/8/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"4. Other possible moves - Nf3, Qh5 , Bb5, Bd3, exf6, c3 and Bf4 (from a search of 2 million games)"
8,Bf5,c8f5,r2qkbnr/ppp1p1pp/2n2p2/3pPb2/3P1P2/8/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"4. ... Bf5 main line, other possible moves g6, Nh6, e6 (a bit pointless IMO as it locks in the white squared bishop), fxe5 (which I didn't like as it opened up the board leaving white with an early space advantage)

What I liked about the games viewed down this line is that black gets his white squared bishop outside of the pawns and black can exchange the pawns at any time he/she chooses."

10,Be4,f5e4,r2qkbnr/ppp1p1pp/2n2p2/3pP3/3PbP2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 3 6,5.  ... Be4 now the game is interesting. Black has taken two moves with the bishop in the opening. Generally it can lead to trouble moving a piece twice in opening - the advantage here is that any change by white gives black a passed pawn. (of course with timely f5).
11,Bb5,f1b5,r2qkbnr/ppp1p1pp/2n2p2/1B1pP3/3PbP2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 4 6,"The only two moves I could find from a 3.5 million game search were Nbd2 and Be2. I back tracked a few moves and found a ton of games with 5. Bb5 Qd7 and played through those to see what plans worked for black. So I combined two strategies - get a pawn on e4 and ""threaten"" queen side pawn advance. It is interesting to put the queen on a pin like this, but I could not see any way white could take advantage of it."
12,Qd7,d8d7,r3kbnr/pppqp1pp/2n2p2/1B1pP3/3PbP2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 5 7,7. or develop the queen side - one possible advantage of Nbd2 is an early c4 OR trade off the bishop then N(f3)d2 and then c4 - which would probably force black to castle queen side (as developing king side minor pieces would take a couple of moves)  - white could then plan around a queen side attack using the space advantage in the centre.

As white I would play Be3, Nbd2, c4, swap the bishop and play down the queen side."

This may have given a tempo or two for white to advance one or two of the queen side pawns, giving black some potential problems with q-side castling. The best seems to be Nh6, 0-0-0, Rf8 then think about driving away the knight on g5.
The point of this game plan is white gets tied down to stopping a timely advance of the e pawn.
A big disadvantage here for white is the centre pawns are on same coloured square as the bishop."

Nd5 (at any time) forces white to move or defend.

IMO I think this was white's last chance to take advantage of the space in the centre. Bd3 leaves white responding to blacks threats from this point on."

17. Rf2 is passive, its only function is now to protect the b pawn. This move lets me ""off the hook"" for being greedy.

I thought for while about this as I knew the c pawn was a potentially poisonous one. I trusted in c6, Rd7 to protect the king long enough to get the queen back via a3 (after Qxb2 to a Rfc1)."
