1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"For those that know me, I play 1. d4 almost exclusively."
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"It is responses like this that drive me crazy. I'm pretty solid in most variations of the QGD and QGA, and black's response just took away my comfort zone."

7,Bxf6,g5f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1pp1/4pB1p/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,I don't know if that is best.  4. Bh4 seems safe because 4...g5 5. Bg3 seriously weakens black's kingside. I can always be counted on to take the greater of two evils.....
8,Qxf6,d8f6,rnb1kb1r/pppp1pp1/4pq1p/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,Of course...

11,Nf3,g1f3,r1b1kb1r/pppp1pp1/2n1pq1p/8/3PP3/P4N2/1PP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 2 6,"Developing, and equalizing on d4."
12,e5,e6e5,r1b1kb1r/pppp1pp1/2n2q1p/4p3/3PP3/P4N2/1PP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,Solid.....to take gives black a much more spacious position after 7. dxe Nxe 8. NxN QxN. So I push....

14,Nd8,c6d8,r1bnkb1r/pppp1pp1/5q1p/3Pp3/4P3/P4N2/1PP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,"This kind of surprised me, as I thought black would accept doubled pawns after 8...Nd4 9. NxN exN."
15,c4,c2c4,r1bnkb1r/pppp1pp1/5q1p/3Pp3/2P1P3/P4N2/1P3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,The queenside pawn chain advances nicely.
16,Bc5,f8c5,r1bnk2r/pppp1pp1/5q1p/2bPp3/2P1P3/P4N2/1P3PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 1 9,Black kind of had to do this to catch up in development. I wondered if he saw that I could now exchange a knight for a bishop and double his pawns after what follows......
17,b4,b2b4,r1bnk2r/pppp1pp1/5q1p/2bPp3/1PP1P3/P4N2/5PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 9,Mission accomplished. There is absolutely no hurry to retake that pawn. It's not going anywhere.
18,Bd4,c5d4,r1bnk2r/pppp1pp1/5q1p/3Pp3/1PPbP3/P4N2/5PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 1 10,Mission accomplished. There is absolutely no hurry to retake that pawn. It's not going anywhere.

22,Qg5,f6g5,r1bnk2r/pppp1pp1/7p/3P2q1/1PPpP3/P2B4/5PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 2 12,? A mistake I feel. Black is woefully behind in development and space. 11...d6 or 11...0-0 was probably better.
