Be7 became fashionable in the 1980's onwards, with notable 'super' Grandmasters Tukmakov, Balashov, Timman, Ivanchuk  and Shirov using it for Black.

Now that the 'tabiya' is reached,  the question is: do I exchange my bishop for his edged Knight and double-up his pawns as per current praxis? Resultant games I discovered show Black has enough counter play with an open g-file + the doubled h-pawns (after 15.Bxh5) might even be useful to march down the h-file to entice an attack there. I stumbled on an interesting move, the idea which *promises* to be quite diabolical, with a White Queen possibly raking the board all the way to b7 with latent threats.
