1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Fischer and Tal played eleven games against each other. Tal won four, Fischer two, and five games were drawn."
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Tal plays the French Defence. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Defence
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,In this game Fischer plays the main line.
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,As does Tal.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"This is the most common move although the Tarrasch Variation: 3.Nd2, Exchange Variation: 3.exd5 exd5 and Advance Variation: 3.e5 are all quite playable."
6,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/1b1PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"And this is the Winawer Variation. As White Nc3 is now pinned, black is threatening to take on e4."
7,e5,e4e5,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3pP3/1b1P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,So Fischer deals with that threat.
8,c5,c7c5,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/1b1P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,Further attacking the white centre.
9,a3,a2a3,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/1b1P4/P1N5/1PP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,White hits the bishop.
10,Ba5,b4a5,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/b1ppP3/3P4/P1N5/1PP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,"This is slightly unusual. Exchanging on c3 is more usually played. This is called the Armenian Variation, as its theory and practice have been much enriched by players from that country, the most notable of whom is Rafael Vaganian. Black maintains the pin on the knight."
11,b4,b2b4,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/b1ppP3/1P1P4/P1N5/2P2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,This is the most commonly played reply. In some variations white sacrifices a pawn in return for the attack.
12,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/b2pP3/1P1p4/P1N5/2P2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,Tal takes this way. Also playable is 6...cxb4 7. Nb5 Nc6 8. Nf3 a6 9. Nd6+ Kf8 10. Bd3 b3+ 11. Kf1 Bc7.
13,Qg4,d1g4,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/b2pP3/1P1p2Q1/P1N5/2P2PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 1 7,Fischer hits g7. If white had an extra move he could take on g7 and then on h8.
14,Ne7,g8e7,rnbqk2r/pp2nppp/4p3/b2pP3/1P1p2Q1/P1N5/2P2PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 2 8,Tal sacrifices a pawn for development and the open g file.
15,bxa5,b4a5,rnbqk2r/pp2nppp/4p3/P2pP3/3p2Q1/P1N5/2P2PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 0 8,"Fischer takes the bishop. In the French Defence, often the position in closed, with long interlocking pawn chains, and knights are better than bishops, but in this case the position is opening and the white bishops are better than the black knights."
16,dxc3,d4c3,rnbqk2r/pp2nppp/4p3/P2pP3/6Q1/P1p5/2P2PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 0 9,Tal takes the offered knight.
