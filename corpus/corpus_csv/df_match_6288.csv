1,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was a non rated game for tutoring purposes, between my new friend Zach (heavyfire13) and myself, Scott Miller (faithfulltrav).

So Zach, this 1st move of yours is not particularly bad, the only drawback is that it's pretty passive. The best moves in my opinion, are those that force your opponents hand. On the other hand, if you choose to be a passive player, it's not necessarily a bad thing. I will quote move one from my tutoring game with Ajay, ""... I've met passive players who I could not beat. I had a friend in college named Pablo. He'd sit back, making very passive moves. He'd set up a very solid position you can't break through and if you slip up, then all of a sudden he'd get aggressive!"". I might add that I was a stronger player then than I am now. Pablo and I had some fierce games, but I never beat him even once! Keep in mind though that in taking advice from me, you are hearing from an aggressive player.

In the opening, it is always important to control the center squares, e4, e5, d4 & d5. One way to do that is to occupy those squares, with your pawns & pieces (playing e4 and / or d4, for example). The other way is what you have chosen, to control them without occupying them (e3 controls d4). This plan you have chosen is not bad, but is usually played by black."

3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/8/2N1P3/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"So, the knight move controls d5 & e4. Though not a bad move, you are not playing an established opening that I know of. Openings and defenses are established lines of play that came about after centuries of master play.
There are plenty of chess books on opening play in any good library or book store. Book stores are better though since chess openings are frequently revised as people play. So you want the most modern you can get. Library books can be pretty old. I suggest Batsford Chess Openings by Kasparov."

Imagine twins, Jack and Jake setting aside funds for retirement. Jack sets aside $10,000 in the year 2010 and invests it at a certain interest rate, say for example 9%. In the year 2050, his total interest earned would be $304,094.20. After inflation, (supposing a 2% inflation rate), it would be $137,721.30, giving him a total value for his investment of $142,250.20.

Jake on the other hand waits until the year 2040, and sets aside $10,000 and invests it at the same interest rate, 9%. In the year 2050, his total interest earned would be only $13,673.60. After inflation, (supposing the same 2% inflation rate), it would be $11,217.10, giving him a total value for his investment of $19,420.60. What is interesting about this scenario, is that if all things are equal with the exception of the investment dates, Jake can never ever catch up to his twin brother Jack!

You may ask, ""Why the lesson on investing? I'm here to play chess!""

One of the most important principles in the opening is to try to get your pieces and pawns developed (moved out of the original square, to a more active location). One way to do this is to force your opponent to move the same pieces over and over again. If you develop a piece, then I develop a pawn to attack your piece, forcing you to move it a 2nd time, I gain a ""tempo"", and you lose a tempo.

One result of gaining tempo is that it gives you the initiative over your opponent. This means that you have a measure of control over how your opponent moves his pieces. You can't safely castle right now, for example. You'd lose your bishop! Both you and your opponent have things you'd each like to accomplish. Every time your opponent forces you to make a move, he hinders you from doing what you may have planned, (unless of course if the move he forces you to make was actually part of your plan). It is also intriguing to know that if you play an opponent who knows how to take advantage of an initiative, similar to Jake and Jack, you're far less likely to be able to catch up! If he forces you to make a move you did not want to make, it can put you in a position you don't want to be in! Be careful not to allow your opponent to gain tempo faster than you do."
