1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Good Evening friends and chess lovers this game has given me a new highest rated opponent defeated. Id appreciate all comments where i could have replied better. although this was a win i played Crunched the entire game it was scary!
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"i hosted this game therefore i couldnt pick a e4 opponent to use my regular nimzowitsch and in the passed i liked going the old benoni with c5 but most whites know to follow with d5 and i grow tired of facing that situation.

is e6 here first a good opener to then go c5? i only tried it once in the passed and won that game too but it can offer a crunched game"
3,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,uncharted territory already in the last game i opened with e6 my opponent did not reply e4.
4,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,i decide to still go for c5. is this a mistake vs 2.e4? but i also realise that because of his e4 its as if i had started with c5 anyway and ill face the d5. i guess theres no way out of it lol i hate d4 starters!
5,d5,d4d5,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2pP4/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"anticipated reply i try to control tempo a bit by replying nf6, id rather he take e6 and i take back with pawn on f7 in the future. and nf6 forces him to play towards that hanging pawn"
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2pP4/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,he gave me the exchange i wanted
7,dxe6,d5e6,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4Pn2/2p5/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,he gave me the exchange i wanted
8,fxe6,f7e6,rnbqkb1r/pp1p2pp/4pn2/2p5/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,he gave me the exchange i wanted
9,e5,e4e5,rnbqkb1r/pp1p2pp/4pn2/2p1P3/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"anticipated reply , here i studied for a while and thought he would start making my knight dance i cant lose too much tempo to such behaviour"
10,Nd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/pp1p2pp/4p3/2pnP3/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,decide to place my knight on d5. i thought if he went c4 i would go nc6 is that a good spot for him on that reply?
11,f4,f2f4,rnbqkb1r/pp1p2pp/4p3/2pnP3/5P2/8/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,unanticipated reply. blocks off his black bishop.
12,a6,a7a6,rnbqkb1r/1p1p2pp/p3p3/2pnP3/5P2/8/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,i decide to restrain his white bishop to also play b5
13,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkb1r/1p1p2pp/p3p3/2pnP3/2B2P2/8/PPP3PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 7,the antics are starting. regularly i love trading knights for bishops. but obviously this is a losing exchange so i have to retreat the knight.  i asked about nc6 earlier. but i decided to keep the knight alive and if he keeps pressuring the knight on the next move i will pressure his bishop in reply
14,Nb4,d5b4,rnbqkb1r/1p1p2pp/p3p3/2p1P3/1nB2P2/8/PPP3PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 8,and so i keep him active with the possible c2 fork in future.
15,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/1p1p2pp/p3p3/2p1P3/1nB2P2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 8,hmm unanticpated reply here. i was expecting pressure on my knight. seeing as im controlling the d4 square and that he blocked his bishop from going left side this knight currently doesnt scare me. i decide to push the bishop away so i can send my knight back to d5 and im going queen side attack. if i can muster one. i felt a regular king side castle was safe and the h and g pawns are still aligned
16,b5,b7b5,rnbqkb1r/3p2pp/p3p3/1pp1P3/1nB2P2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,gaining space
17,Be2,c4e2,rnbqkb1r/3p2pp/p3p3/1pp1P3/1n3P2/5N2/PPP1B1PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 9,here i decide to give his knight only 1 option i was planning on developing my dsb after his castling for a check. i can predict he will castle now and i will reply with c4 to be able to safely place my knight on d5
18,h6,h7h6,rnbqkb1r/3p2p1/p3p2p/1pp1P3/1n3P2/5N2/PPP1B1PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 10,here i decide to give his knight only 1 option i was planning on developing my dsb after his castling for a check. i can predict he will castle now and i will reply with c4 to be able to safely place my knight on d5
19,O-O,e1g1,rnbqkb1r/3p2p1/p3p2p/1pp1P3/1n3P2/5N2/PPP1B1PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 10,here this was unanticipated. and i thought if i let him capture my pawn will become isolated and its 2 pawns for 1. so im forced to take which is ok. i thought this was just putting off my attack for 1 move. i was planning on taking out his black bishop on e3 with a forced fork with my knight on his queen and rook. and i was hoping his reply after my DSB was on e3 would be g3 to reinforce the pawn and i would activate my LSB on b7 pinning the knight.
20,c4,c5c4,rnbqkb1r/3p2p1/p3p2p/1p2P3/1np2P2/5N2/PPP1B1PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 11,here this was unanticipated. and i thought if i let him capture my pawn will become isolated and its 2 pawns for 1. so im forced to take which is ok. i thought this was just putting off my attack for 1 move. i was planning on taking out his black bishop on e3 with a forced fork with my knight on his queen and rook. and i was hoping his reply after my DSB was on e3 would be g3 to reinforce the pawn and i would activate my LSB on b7 pinning the knight.
