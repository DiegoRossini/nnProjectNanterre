Black has two options now. Save the pawn. Don't save the pawn.
There is no any reason/threat to not save the pawn.
But Question is How i save my soldier?
if 3. ... c5 then c3 dxc3 Nxc3 
and Black got backward d pawn
weak Q-side pawn structure
back in development ...
(Nc6 will transpose to Scotch Game)"

Advantages to Black
Black has 'extra pawn' plus 'passed'
White has one isolated pawn.

Advantages to White
White has two bishops in open position.

2 plans
either play h6, pushing bishop to less important square.
but after h6 later if White wants to exchange his white bishop with knight then either black move the knight or he has to capture bishop with f pawn, and making white's isloated pawn ... passed and dangerous.

other idea is moving the knight right now ..."
