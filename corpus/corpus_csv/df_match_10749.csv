1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Here is a recent team game vs. my good friend and rival team captain (and the only guy I know who spends more time on GK than me:), achilles13. With the black pieces, I employ a Najdorf Sicilian vs. his 1. e4, and a pretty clean middle game is reached with both sides fairly equal. Unexpectedly, my opponent decided to sac a piece giving him a 3-1 queenside pawn majority which threatened to wreak havoc. Luckily, I was able to block his advance utilizing my piece advantage and some pretty good coordination of my forces. The thing I liked most about this game is that my king was used in a very offensive role and I was fortunate enough to have my pieces accomplishing multiple tasks with minimal movement. Thanks to achilles13 for the good game! I hope you enjoy:)"
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"And here is the typical Najdorf variation of the Sicilian defence. I have only recently grown the stones to start playing the Sicilian. I am 36 years old, and have been playing chess for about 25 years. Trust me when I tell you that I have played 10's of thousands of games in my life (including the ridiculous 6500 something here on GK). Of all of those games, I would guess that only in a few hundred have I played 1...c5 vs. 1. e4. For those that know me, I'm a Scandanavian player. I have realized (finally!) that I am entirely too predictable, so I have put a few of my fears to rest and have started branching out some. To me, the Sicilian has always represented some of the most scary (yet oddly thrilling) aspects of playing with the black pieces. There are just too many variations that can arise, and I have always tried to steer towards more simple, straight-forward opening lines. In doing some reading (and also going through some great annotations right here on GK), I have decided to tackle the Najdorf. Hopefully with some practice, I can safely add it to my repitoire and not feel suicidal in doing so......."

As my own ""book knowledge"" of the Najdorf is still a book with only one page in it, I can't yet find a lot of fault with this move. 6. Bf4 is the move I probably would have chosen, however, as it exerts more control over the dark squares. I only mention this because when I have the white pieces, no one ever gets the chance to play the Najdorf against me because I play 1. d4 almost exclusively. (***note to self*** A. Only ONE major change at a time. Once you're comfortable with the Sicilian, try playing something else as white, B. Quit telling the world about your tendancies - if you need catharsis then go get a shrink:)"
