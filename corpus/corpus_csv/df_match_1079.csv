11,h3,h2h3,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/8/3P2b1/2N2N1P/PPP3P1/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"I believe I will start trying some alternatives to this h3 move.

Options:
Bd3 is a good developing move and allows the short castle
Bg5 is also an attacking developing move"

17,Bg2,f1g2,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pnb1/4N3/3P2P1/2N4P/PPP3B1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 9,"I contemplated carrying through with one of my earlier thoughts of taking the bishop with Nxg6 but felt that the knight was causing more trouble where it was at present, although the Nc6 or Bd6 would put pressure on it.

Chose to play Bg2 to attack the unprotected pawn at b7"
