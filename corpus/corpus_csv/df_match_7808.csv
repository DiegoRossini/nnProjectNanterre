1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This is an interesting game in the Sicilian Sheveningen that was played in 1976.  I wanted to share it with everyone who hasn't seen it yet.  I found it in Alexander Belyavsky's autobiography and collection of games published by Cadogan Press.  The annotated comments are Belyavsky's alone.
