1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"By 1857, the chess boom reigning after the first international tournament in London had also reached the New World. The First American Congress, which later became the US Championship, took place in the fall of 1857, in New York. It attracted the 16 best players in the country and like the London event, it was held on the KO system: mini-matches of first to win three games, and in the final - five games. This was Morphy's first tournament, and he demonstrated his complete dominance over the field in fine style, as this game against the second-strongest player of the tournament (and likely, the second-strongest player in the US at the time) clearly shows. He easily reached the final (nine wins and one draw!), where he proceeded to crush the as yet little-known German Louis Paulsen, who was then living in the US. Moreover, Morphy played quickly, as usual, whereas his opponent played very slowly, and since the time for thinking was not yet restricted (chess clocks were still a couple of decades away!), the games lasted 10-11 hours, and the drawn second game of the Final as long as 15 hours (out of which Paulsen thought for 12!). This sixth game is probably the most famous game of the match."
