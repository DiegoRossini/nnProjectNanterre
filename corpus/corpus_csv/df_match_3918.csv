1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,So she starts conventionally
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Last time I played black against Jo I tried the French defence and she played the exchange variation, and should have drawn, so I go back to the Sicilian."
3,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,She plays the so-called Grand Prix Attack
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"This is the most common reply, and the best"
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/4PP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,She plays this funny pawn sacrifice. I think there are better moves.
6,dxe4,d5e4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2p5/4pP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,So I take
7,Ng5,f3g5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2p3N1/4pP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,She has to move the attacked knight
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2p3N1/4pP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,I protect the pawn on e5
9,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2p3N1/2B1pP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 5,"She attacks f7. Now I don't want to play e6 immediately, so first I decided to develop with tempo with...."
10,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2p3N1/2B1pPb1/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 6,Hitting her queen
11,Qxg4,d1g4,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2p3N1/2B1pPQ1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 6,And she sacs the queen!
12,Nxg4,f6g4,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/8/2p3N1/2B1pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 7,"I have to take the queen of course. This is not on the World Gameknot Database, but it is on the database of Gameknot games."
13,Bxf7+,c4f7,rn1qkb1r/pp2pBpp/8/2p3N1/4pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 7,So she takes this pawn.
14,Kd7,e8d7,rn1q1b1r/pp1kpBpp/8/2p3N1/4pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 1 8,Forced!
15,Be6+,f7e6,rn1q1b1r/pp1kp1pp/4B3/2p3N1/4pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 2 8,Another check
16,Kc6,d7c6,rn1q1b1r/pp2p1pp/2k1B3/2p3N1/4pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 3 9,This is the best square. We have transposed into a couple of World Database Games. There are no less than 308 games on the Gameknot Database
17,Bxg4,e6g4,rn1q1b1r/pp2p1pp/2k5/2p3N1/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 0 9,"So she gets some material back, and also threatens Nf7 winning more material"
18,g6,g7g6,rn1q1b1r/pp2p2p/2k3p1/2p3N1/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 0 10,"I do this, following the World Database. Now Nf7 can be met with Qd4 and NxR(h8) with Qd4xNh8, so white doesn't normally play that."
19,Nc3,b1c3,rn1q1b1r/pp2p2p/2k3p1/2p3N1/4pPB1/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 1 10,As it Kr�l Wladyslaw (2423) vs. Porkolab Sandor (2000)  2007
20,Na6,b8a6,r2q1b1r/pp2p2p/n1k3p1/2p3N1/4pPB1/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 2 11,"I decide to attack with my knight, but probably the move in Kr�l Wladyslaw (2423) vs. Porkolab Sandor (2000)  2007, Bg7 is better."
