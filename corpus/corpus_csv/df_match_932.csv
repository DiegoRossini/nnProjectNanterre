If so, there would have been played 7... dxe 8. fxe Ng4 and I couldn't defend my pawn. Another reason to play Bd3 is that it's an obvios place for the bishop to stay. I better wait before playing Nf3. That way my opponent wouldn't play Bg4 and maybe exchange his bishop. So there appears to be problem its development. If placed on d7, the Knight from would have a hard time reaching the center. If the Knight goes on d7, the bishop would have nowhere to move. Also, If 7... Bg4 8. Qc2 and now Kbd7 is bad because the bishop dies after h3 and g4."

Then his knight would be placed in way that it couldn't be attacked by pawn and thats great. But I wouldn't take there cause I see that and also want my pawn on e5.

Second, I relieve the presure from a1-h8 diagonal. For example, if b3 or b4 is played, I'll have one pice less to remove from that diagonal before taking something with my e5 pawn."

Also, my opponents c pawn would most surely become a passed one. And last, but not less important, that might lead to exchanging pieces and I don't want that. Just because my opponents pieces aren't placed well enough and I hope he'll have a hard time coordinating them."

By playing Bb3 I prevent exchange and the c7 knight from moving (If Ka6, I would take on b5) and that way also preventing e8 from moving on c7 in just a few moves. Thats a big problem for the black cause it means that his rook on f8 would remain inactive. At the same time, I might move mine from b4 to the center. Also I have a easy plan for playing Nd4 with tempo and then Nc6."
