1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"This game represents one my best games here at gameknot to date.  It seemed that I was able to see the whole board and generally speaking, played well tactically.  As I write this annotation, I have not utilized computer analysis as I wanted only my thoughts in my brain.  After I complete this annotation, I plan to run this through the computer analysis.  All comments and criticisms are welcome and appreciated."
2,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,I tend to play the Reti as white.  I believe Black responds with the Dutch Defense.
3,g3,g2g3,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/8/5NP1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,"I thought about castling here but I didn't want to give up the center.  Now, if 4...e5 5. dxe5 dxe5 6. Qxd8 Kxd8 7. Nxe5"

8,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/ppp3pp/3ppn2/5p2/3P4/5NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,I feel I still have time to castle and this move provides me some nice Q-side space.

10,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/ppp1b1pp/3ppn2/5p2/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 6,It appears that White will be attacking Q-side
11,O-O,e1g1,rnbqk2r/ppp1b1pp/3ppn2/5p2/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 2 6,It appears that White will be attacking Q-side

14,Qe8,d8e8,rnb1qrk1/ppp1b1pp/3ppn2/5p2/1PPP4/5NP1/P3PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 1 8,In preparation of Qh5 and King side activity
15,Bb2,c1b2,rnb1qrk1/ppp1b1pp/3ppn2/5p2/1PPP4/5NP1/PB2PPBP/RN1Q1RK1 b - - 2 8,I'm not exactly sure why I did this (except that I like a nice fianchetto).  8. Be3 doesn't make sense as it blocks e2.  It may have been because I was planning to connect the Knights.
16,Nc6,b8c6,r1b1qrk1/ppp1b1pp/2nppn2/5p2/1PPP4/5NP1/PB2PPBP/RN1Q1RK1 w - - 3 9,"Initially, I thought I was taking space with tempo.  In hindsight, Black likely expected 9. b5 and was heading the N to d8 anyway."
17,b5,b4b5,r1b1qrk1/ppp1b1pp/2nppn2/1P3p2/2PP4/5NP1/PB2PPBP/RN1Q1RK1 b - - 0 9,"Initially, I thought I was taking space with tempo.  In hindsight, Black likely expected 9. b5 and was heading the N to d8 anyway."
18,Nd8,c6d8,r1bnqrk1/ppp1b1pp/3ppn2/1P3p2/2PP4/5NP1/PB2PPBP/RN1Q1RK1 w - - 1 10,"This bolsters d4, although I'm not sure that's necessary.  This also allows my Q to challenged the black Q."
19,Nbd2,b1d2,r1bnqrk1/ppp1b1pp/3ppn2/1P3p2/2PP4/5NP1/PB1NPPBP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 2 10,"This bolsters d4, although I'm not sure that's necessary.  This also allows my Q to challenged the black Q."
20,Qh5,e8h5,r1bn1rk1/ppp1b1pp/3ppn2/1P3p1q/2PP4/5NP1/PB1NPPBP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 3 11,"This bolsters d4, although I'm not sure that's necessary.  This also allows my Q to challenged the black Q."

22,Nf7,d8f7,r1b2rk1/ppp1bnpp/3ppn2/1P3p1q/2PP4/4PNP1/PB1N1PBP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 1 12,I saw nothing better and this provided more Q side space.
23,a4,a2a4,r1b2rk1/ppp1bnpp/3ppn2/1P3p1q/P1PP4/4PNP1/1B1N1PBP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 12,I saw nothing better and this provided more Q side space.
24,g5,g7g5,r1b2rk1/ppp1bn1p/3ppn2/1P3ppq/P1PP4/4PNP1/1B1N1PBP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 13,It's getting a bit cramped over by my King.
25,Ne1,f3e1,r1b2rk1/ppp1bn1p/3ppn2/1P3ppq/P1PP4/4P1P1/1B1N1PBP/R2QNRK1 b - - 1 13,"I was interested to see if Black wanted to exchange Qs.  I thought this might alleviate a bit a pressure and with the Black K-side pawn pushes, Black's King is a bit open."
26,Qh6,h5h6,r1b2rk1/ppp1bn1p/3ppn1q/1P3pp1/P1PP4/4P1P1/1B1N1PBP/R2QNRK1 w - - 2 14,exchange rejected.
27,Nd3,e1d3,r1b2rk1/ppp1bn1p/3ppn1q/1P3pp1/P1PP4/3NP1P1/1B1N1PBP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 3 14,"Well, if I'm going to play Q-side, perhaps I should bring my pieces Q-side.  I didn't see an immediate break-thru on my K."
28,Nh5,f6h5,r1b2rk1/ppp1bn1p/3pp2q/1P3ppn/P1PP4/3NP1P1/1B1N1PBP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 4 15,But it's getting a bit dicey.

30,Bf6,e7f6,r1b2rk1/ppp2n1p/3ppb1q/1P3ppn/P1PP4/3NP1P1/1B1NQPBP/R4RK1 w - - 6 16,"Well, that pins d4"

I did not want Black to continue advancing his pawns and I hoped that if I went 17 dxe5, he would retake with the Bishop and we could exchange Bishops as mine was not doing anything at present."
33,dxe5,d4e5,r1b2rk1/ppp2n1p/3p1b1q/PP2Pppn/2P5/3NP1P1/1B1NQPBP/R4RK1 b - - 0 17,"At this point, I had it figured that I was going to win a pawn.  Obviously, Black cannot move 18...b6  Alternatively, 18...c6  19.	bxc6	b6  20. c7 loses the exchange"
