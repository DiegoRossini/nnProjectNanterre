8,Bxb4,c5b4,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/1bB1P3/5N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"Dufresne accepts the gambit, and takes the pawn with his bishop.  Taking with knight may cause amateur players, like myself, to take black's pawn on e5 with the next move, but this leads to disaster as black can play Qf6.  With that move, black threatens mate, but almost always wins a knight and pawn in the following moves."
9,c3,c2c3,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/1bB1P3/2P2N2/P2P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,Anderssen continues to pressure black's bishop.  Standard Evans gambit moves so far.

11,d4,d2d4,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/b3p3/2BPP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"Naturally, Anderssen begins his assault on the center, otherwise what's the point of sacrificing the pawn."
12,exd4,e5d4,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/b7/2BpP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"exd4, the most common response.  Alternately, black could've played d6 for the Alapin Variation."
13,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/b7/2BpP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 7,"Anderssen castles kingside, again part of the main line of the Evans Gambit."
14,d3,d4d3,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/b7/2B1P3/2Pp1N2/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,"d3!?, this is where Dufresne varied into what is now called The ""Evergreen Game.""  Anderssen had studied extensively pxp and the corresponding lines just one year earlier.  Perhaps Dufresne knew this and decided to throw a ""kink"" into his system.  Other moves popular in the Evans Gambit are d6, pxp, Nge7 or Bb6."
15,Qb3,d1b3,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/b7/2B1P3/1QPp1N2/P4PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 1 8,"Qb3, and White attacks Blacks King's Bishop Pawn."
