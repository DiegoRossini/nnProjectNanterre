1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"There has been much analysis since Bobby Fischer's time regarding a King's pawn (e4) vs. a Queen's pawn (d4) opening.  The numbers seem to give 'd4' a slight edge, but I like Fischer's playing style and he felt the King's pawn opening was 'best by test'."

It appears to protect the e5 pawn, although Nc6 (Four Knight's Game) does a better job of it since it doesn't block the advance of black's Queen pawn.  How to take advantage of Black's misplay?"

15,Nf5,d4f5,r2qk2r/pbpp1ppp/1pnb1n2/5N2/2B1P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 2 8,"This proves to be the critical move of the game.  It keeps the Queen from developing to e7, and black's dark square Bishop has stifled his ability to open space with a Queen's pawn push.  This move also targets the weak g7 square.  But what I like most about this move is it prepares to take away black's ability to castle..."

This move does weaken the King's defense slightly, but I have three powerful pieces currently along the back rank, and the real intention is to bring the Rook on f1 to bear.  If black captures the pawn on f4 with his Bishop, then Rook takes Bishop, gains material and dangerous mating chances."
