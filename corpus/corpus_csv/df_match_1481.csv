1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is a game from my childhood. I play as black and make many instructive mistakes in the game. I also make some good moves which are worth analysing.

The end is like a problem finish - Find the best move.

I have added a few questions at specific points in the game to challenge the reader to think and discuss.

If anyone leaves behind their comments/queries, I will respond.."
