1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Black has the biggest challenge in this new opening. Its been discussed between Freddy and I if it isn't worth taking the perpetual from blacks point of view. Black has one critical line chance though it doesn't look all that appealing either. Lets start the game on move 6 where the conditional moves run out.

13,Bxf7+,c4f7,rn1qkb1r/pp2pBpp/2p5/6N1/4pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 7,Forcing the recapture of the knight. A waste of this complex game would be to repeat Ke8 Bf7 Kd7 Be6 and Ke8 Bf7+ draw though as mentioned before may be blacks best chance.

16,Kc7,d7c7,rn1q1b1r/ppk1p1pp/2p1B3/6N1/4pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 3 9,Getting away from the fork Ne6 and allowing white the chance to make an error.

19,Ne6,g5e6,rn1q1b1r/pp2p1pp/1kp1N3/8/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 2 10,The correct move as far as I'm concerned. Stops the development of the dsb and the h8 rook which will be locked in most of blacks games.
20,Qe8,d8e8,rn2qb1r/pp2p1pp/1kp1N3/8/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 3 11,This is the critical test for black to overcome due to the destructive power of the c1 bishop and the b1 knight as soon will be seen.

22,Qg6,e8g6,rn3b1r/pp2p1pp/1kp1N1q1/8/4pPB1/3P4/PPP3PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 1 12,"?? this is the first error crazy how quickly the game slides into whites favor over a move that doesn't look or seem all that bad. The test to see if black can survive will be 11... c5 where white has some options: Na3, Be3 b4 and a4 all look okay my preference though I haven't looked at it too deeply yet would be Na3 then Be3. 11... c5 being the best chance doesn't give much hope to blacks game."
23,Na3,b1a3,rn3b1r/pp2p1pp/1kp1N1q1/8/4pPB1/N2P4/PPP3PP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 2 12,"!! Qxg4 loses right away with Nc4+ Kb5 (Ka6 Nc7#) Nc7+ option 1 Kc5 Be3+ Kb4 c3(a3)+ Ka4 b3# option 2 Kb4 c3+ Ka4 (Kc5 Be3#) b3# option 3 Ka4 c3(a3) and now there is no way to stop b3# Two lines I looked at where a5 and c5 *Freddy suggests Qxe6*. The fact is they lead to the loss of queen or mate. 12... a5 13. Be3+ c5 (Ka6 Nc7#) 14. Nc4+ black now has four choices 1) 14... Kc6 Ne5+ winning the queen. 2) 14... Ka7 15. Bxc5 b6 (Ka7 Nc7#) 16. Bxb6+ Ka6 [Kb7 17. Nd8+ Ka6 18. Bc8+ Kb5 19. a4+ Kb4 20. c3+ Kb3 21. Ra3+ Kc2 22. O-O couldn't find away to avoid mate here] 17. Nc5+ Kb5 18. Kc6 Ne5+ and the game goes to white. 3) Ka6 15. Nxc5+ Kb5 [Ka7 16. Ne6+ Ka6 17. Nc7#] 16. a4+ Kc6 [Kb4 17. c3#] 17. Ne5+ winning the queen if not more here. 4) Kb5 15. a4+ now Three choices A) Kb4 16. c3+ Kb3 17. Nxc5+ Kc2 18. Rc1+ B) Ka6 16. Nxc5+ Ka7 17. Ne6+ b6 [Ka6 Nc7#] 18. Bb6+ Ka6 (Kb7 19. Nd8+ Ka6 20. Bc8#) 19. Nc5+ C) Kc6 16. Ne5+ wins the queen and mates Kd6 Bxc5+ Kd5 c4# (Kb6 Bc5+ Ka6 Nc7# or Kd5 c4+ Kd6 Bc5#). Probably missed a few ideas here and there, but as mentioned the best outcome for black is loss of queen."
