1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Smothered Mate - another useful tactic

e4 a standard classical opening"
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,e5 - the best move available if you are ging for the classical opening
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Nf3 - the best move you could do with your g1 Knight
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,A good reply
5,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,not uncommon.
6,Nd4,c6d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2BnP3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,Nd4? leaves the e5 pawn open
7,Nxe5,f3e5,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4N3/2BnP3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,what else would you do?
8,Qg5,d8g5,r1b1kbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4N1q1/2BnP3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 5,another seemingly stupid move
9,Nxf7,e5f7,r1b1kbnr/pppp1Npp/8/6q1/2BnP3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"again, what else would you do?"
10,Qxg2,g5g2,r1b1kbnr/pppp1Npp/8/8/2BnP3/8/PPPP1PqP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"obviously, since White has trapped Black's rook, you'd get your rook to safety first"
11,Rf1,h1f1,r1b1kbnr/pppp1Npp/8/8/2BnP3/8/PPPP1PqP/RNBQKR2 b Qkq - 1 6,"obviously, since White has trapped Black's rook, you'd get your rook to safety first"
12,Qxe4+,g2e4,r1b1kbnr/pppp1Npp/8/8/2Bnq3/8/PPPP1P1P/RNBQKR2 w Qkq - 0 7,Check!
13,Be2,c4e2,r1b1kbnr/pppp1Npp/8/8/3nq3/8/PPPPBP1P/RNBQKR2 b Qkq - 1 7,"unless you want your queen to be taken, that's what you'd do"
14,Nf3#,d4f3,r1b1kbnr/pppp1Npp/8/8/4q3/5n2/PPPPBP1P/RNBQKR2 w Qkq - 2 8,Mate! another beautiful tactic
