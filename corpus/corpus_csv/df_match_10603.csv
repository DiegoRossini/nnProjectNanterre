2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,This continuation (Scotch) usally leads to an open game. Other moves like Bb5 or Bc4 can lead to closed positions that are more positional.

8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,"White doesn't take the pawn immediately and instead wants to finish development. Black could play Nxe4, leading to Re1 d5 Bxd5 Qxd5 Nc3 where White regains the material with a slight lead in development. Most people play Bc5 here, which holds the pawn and White's compensation usually isn't worth a pawn."
