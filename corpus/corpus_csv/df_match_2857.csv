6,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/3PP1b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,"Putting a bit of pressure on f7, this might be useful later on. Recently I've taken to putting the LSB on c4 rather than b5 to see how it works out."

17,Qb5+,b7b5,rn2kb1r/p1p2ppp/5n2/1Qq1p3/2B1P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 2 9,"I had a good think about this move, I suspected I could probably get away with taking the rook, but I was a bit concerned about my king being out in the open and black playing Ng4, so decided to swap queens and take the one pawn advantage.

Analysis with houdini says this is a blunder, scoring Qxa8 as +7 and Qb5+ as +1."
