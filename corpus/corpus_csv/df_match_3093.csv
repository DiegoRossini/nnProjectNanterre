1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Myevilluck is certainly bombing towards his next goal, that is to become a Gameknot Master with a rating north of 2200.  If he keeps this up he will certainly get there because he achieved an IM Draw with the mighty Klauno (Klaus).  So how did this happen?"
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"1. ..... c5 - Klaus may have gathered that Myevilluck is an absolute connoisseur of the King's Gambit, so he gives him the Sicilian rather than play e5.  It will be interesting to see just how Myevilluck shapes up against this one!"

Usually in the Sicilian, the WK almost always goes to b8 because black usually plonks a BQ on the c column or a black rook, leaving the possibility of a very strong attack of heavy artilliary on the a, b and c column.  Sometimes, particularly in the Sicilian Dragon, an exchange sac on c3 occurs to bust up white's pawn structure and leave the WK open to hostile castle fire and an attack from a dsb from the a1-h8 diagonal.  In this game the black dsb is on the a3-f8 diagonal but there is still a possibility of that prelate coming in to a3 at a later date, so, Myevilluck - beware!"
