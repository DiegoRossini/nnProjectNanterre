8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 5,The most aggresive continuation. White is playing to maintain the tempo he has by virtue of having the first move of the game. Control of the center is the aim!
9,d4,d2d4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/2BPP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,The most aggresive continuation. White is playing to maintain the tempo he has by virtue of having the first move of the game. Control of the center is the aim!
10,exd4,e5d4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b5/2BpP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"Black strikes first, drawing first blood. This is the sound play."
11,cxd4,c3d4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b5/2BPP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"Regaining the material, and establishing a strong base of operations in the middle of the board."
12,Bb4+,c5b4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/1bBPP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 7,"!? The most aggressive way to deal with the check. White opts to interpose with development. Safer, but far less sexy was [7.Bd2 Bxd2 8.Nbxd2 d5 9.exd5 Nxd5 10.Qb3!? Nce7] with even chances (albeit a little passive for white)."
13,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/1bBPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 7,"!? The most aggressive way to deal with the check. White opts to interpose with development. Safer, but far less sexy was [7.Bd2 Bxd2 8.Nbxd2 d5 9.exd5 Nxd5 10.Qb3!? Nce7] with even chances (albeit a little passive for white)."
14,d5,d7d5,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3p4/1bBPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"?! Dubious, and condemned by many far more experienced than this lowly commentator. Modern theory suggests [7...Nxe4?! 8.0-0 Bxc3 (8...Nxc3!? 9.d5! The Moeller Attack)]."
15,exd5,e4d5,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3P4/1bBP4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,! White keeps up the pressure.
16,Nxd5,f6d5,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n5/3n4/1bBP4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,"! from many including Kasparov. [9.Bxd5!? Qxd5 10.0-0 once again yields even, although passive chances for white]."
17,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n5/3n4/1bBP4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 9,"! from many including Kasparov. [9.Bxd5!? Qxd5 10.0-0 once again yields even, although passive chances for white]."
18,Be6,c8e6,r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2n1b3/3n4/1bBP4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 10,"! The best move. Black saw the danger of playing 9...Nxc3, as 10.bxc3 Bxc3 11.Bxf7 Kxf7 12.Qb3 ! Be6 13.Qxc3 yields a strong initiative for white."
19,Bg5,c1g5,r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2n1b3/3n2B1/1bBP4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 3 10,"Obviously I'm no Steinitz, but 10.Bd2 seems a little safer as the dark squared bishop can now be made to retreat if black plays h6."

24,Qxd5,d8d5,r3k2r/ppp1bppp/2n5/3q2B1/3P4/5N2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 13,! Logical and strong! Black cannot castle now or his knight falls.
25,Bxe7,g5e7,r3k2r/ppp1Bppp/2n5/3q4/3P4/5N2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 13,! Logical and strong! Black cannot castle now or his knight falls.

30,Qd7,d5d7,r3k2r/pppqn1pp/5p2/8/3P4/5N2/PP2QPPP/R3R1K1 w kq - 2 16,Black is now forced to retreat. Time for Steinitz to start turning up the heat.
31,Rac1,a1c1,r3k2r/pppqn1pp/5p2/8/3P4/5N2/PP2QPPP/2R1R1K1 b kq - 3 16,"Solid looking, and it does sort of just feel right. But a subtle chink in the armor is detected by Steinitz."
