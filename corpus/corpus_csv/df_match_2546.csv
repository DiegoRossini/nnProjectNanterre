4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/1P2P3/8/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,? This is just a mistake as it leaves the e pawn open for attack and ruins the kingside's pawn defense.

Black is massively ahead, but white had a devastating attack going on that might make black sac more material to defend. Also, black's rooks aren't really doing anything and his minor pieces are either (in the case of the d knight) tied down defending against something, or (in the case of the bishop and knight) lured over there and incapable of assisting the defense more than a little."
