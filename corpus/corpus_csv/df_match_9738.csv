1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Even if I have lost the game in a deplorable way, I think that this is one of my most interesting games for the rich tactic possibilities in the midgame. 
Black makes very questionable choices in a very tense situation, and finally loses, but... was the sac sound? Could black have survived or even won?
If you can provide an answer, I would appreciate you to do so."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"My favourite, the Scandinavian."
3,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3pP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"The ""second"" best move, perfectly playable."
4,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3pPb2/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"I can't conceive to play this opening with the lsb into the pawn's chain, but I know it is playable and even considered better."
5,Bb5+,f1b5,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/1B1pPb2/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 3,"Not very recommendable, but not disatrous (IMO)."
6,c6,c7c6,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/1B1pPb2/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 4,"Another option is Nc6. This move deprives the knight of a good square, but it can go to d7 anyway, and it is not badly placed."
7,Be2,b5e2,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pPb2/8/8/PPPPBPPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 4,"White didn't lose a tempo, since my best option will be to play c5, sooner or later, so c6 would have been a loss of tempo."
8,e6,e7e6,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3pPb2/8/8/PPPPBPPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,"This is obviously in order to play c5 (avoiding the bishop's check). Black has not a wonderful game, but its objectives are clear: to catch up in developement, and there are only few ways to do it. And it is very difficult for white to avoid it."
9,d4,d2d4,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3pPb2/3P4/8/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,"This is obviously in order to play c5 (avoiding the bishop's check). Black has not a wonderful game, but its objectives are clear: to catch up in developement, and there are only few ways to do it. And it is very difficult for white to avoid it."
10,a6,a7a6,rn1qkbnr/1p3ppp/p1p1p3/3pPb2/3P4/8/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,"This is obviously in order to play c5 (avoiding the bishop's check). Black has not a wonderful game, but its objectives are clear: to catch up in developement, and there are only few ways to do it. And it is very difficult for white to avoid it."
11,Nf3,g1f3,rn1qkbnr/1p3ppp/p1p1p3/3pPb2/3P4/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"A promising procedure for white is g4, f4... a quick expansion on the kingside. I am prepared to cope with it, anyway."
12,h6,h7h6,rn1qkbnr/1p3pp1/p1p1p2p/3pPb2/3P4/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"...and this is in order to keep the lsb in case of Nh5. This will happen if the black queen wants to go to the kingside. Ok, too many pawn's move in the opening, but the position is still solid."
13,O-O,e1g1,rn1qkbnr/1p3pp1/p1p1p2p/3pPb2/3P4/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 7,Now black's queenside developement is assured. Another pawn's move...
14,c5,c6c5,rn1qkbnr/1p3pp1/p3p2p/2ppPb2/3P4/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,Now black's queenside developement is assured. Another pawn's move...
15,b3,b2b3,rn1qkbnr/1p3pp1/p3p2p/2ppPb2/3P4/1P3N2/P1P1BPPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,"White sees no quick attack (c4!?). He is somewhat threatening Ba6, if this can be considered instead of Be3."
16,Nc6,b8c6,r2qkbnr/1p3pp1/p1n1p2p/2ppPb2/3P4/1P3N2/P1P1BPPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 9,"Thank you for the tempo, white."
17,c3,c2c3,r2qkbnr/1p3pp1/p1n1p2p/2ppPb2/3P4/1PP2N2/P3BPPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 9,"Ah, ok, white's plan is to play slowly, building a fortress with pawns. Ok."
18,b5,b7b5,r2qkbnr/5pp1/p1n1p2p/1pppPb2/3P4/1PP2N2/P3BPPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 10,"Let's push them, then. My kingside is blocked, but the game is on the queenside, and my dsb is acting from its very spot, as long as the bg8 knight is patient."
19,Re1,f1e1,r2qkbnr/5pp1/p1n1p2p/1pppPb2/3P4/1PP2N2/P3BPPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq - 1 10,"Piling a futile defence, since e5 is invulnerable in most lines."
20,Qb6,d8b6,r3kbnr/5pp1/pqn1p2p/1pppPb2/3P4/1PP2N2/P3BPPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq - 2 11,"This move adds pressure on the black diagonal, specially d4. Since I cannot develop my other pieces, I do it with my queen."
21,Bd3,e2d3,r3kbnr/5pp1/pqn1p2p/1pppPb2/3P4/1PPB1N2/P4PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq - 3 11,"Thematic. Black cannot afford BxB, since my strenght is the pawn chain."
22,Bg4,f5g4,r3kbnr/5pp1/pqn1p2p/1pppP3/3P2b1/1PPB1N2/P4PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq - 4 12,Depriving d4 of one of its defenders.
23,Be3,c1e3,r3kbnr/5pp1/pqn1p2p/1pppP3/3P2b1/1PPBBN2/P4PPP/RN1QR1K1 b kq - 5 12,"Adding another one. Tension is building, but for white dxc5 is not good."
