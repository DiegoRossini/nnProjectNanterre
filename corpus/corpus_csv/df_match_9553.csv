1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"In fairness a pretty standard game, with one tactic missed by both players. But as any good player will tell you, endgame knowledge can win you matches, or force draws you don't deserve. Not quite the case in this game, but does demonstrate how essential endgame knowledge is"

6,Qxd5,d8d5,rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3q4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"More common is cxd5, since this avoids bringing the queen out too early, and as we see in this match the queen simply moves around before retreating having accomplished nothing."

11,Bc1,d2c1,rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/1qp5/8/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 5 6,"Continuing development, but relatively better is Nf6, since we know the knight belongs there"
