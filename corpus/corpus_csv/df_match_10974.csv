4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 3,"Why not! Wanted to see what white would do and his true nature. Usually this is not a good idea due to 4....Nxe5 and pressure is exerted early on blacks achilles heel, the f7 square."

7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B1n3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,Guess white isn't a Go for the throat type of guy as he didn't play Nxe5.
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1n3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,"I'll leave the knight hanging at e4 due to the fork of d5 after the knight is captured by the c knight. This is a common tactic to know if you play the Bishop's Opening, Guico Piano or the Italian game."
9,Nxe4,c3e4,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1N3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"Probable the best move. Qe2, Nc3, Bxd5 or any other move have shown little promise in other games."

15,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2nb4/4p3/4B3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 2 8,Grabbing the half open file.

18,Ne7,c6e7,r1bq1rk1/ppp1nppp/3b4/4p3/4B3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 5 10,Time for some tactics. The knight here supports the f5 advance.
19,c3,c2c3,r1bq1rk1/ppp1nppp/3b4/4p3/4B3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - - 0 10,"Preparing for d4. Why not, the knight is no longer around and c3 is its best early development square."
20,f5,f7f5,r1bq1rk1/ppp1n1pp/3b4/4pp2/4B3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 0 11,Has to address this move before he can play d4.
21,Bc2,e4c2,r1bq1rk1/ppp1n1pp/3b4/4pp2/8/2P2N2/PPBP1PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - - 1 11,and now this advance puts a different twist on the possible d4 advance. Again he has to move the knight first.

28,Nf4,g6f4,r1bq1r1k/ppp3pp/3b4/5p2/3Npn2/1BP1R3/PP1P1PPP/R1BQ2K1 w - - 6 15,Taking away the h3 square from white and looking at the juicy d3 square for the Knight later maybe.
29,Bc4,b3c4,r1bq1r1k/ppp3pp/3b4/5p2/2BNpn2/2P1R3/PP1P1PPP/R1BQ2K1 b - - 7 15,During our game I mentioned that at move 11 the bishop might have gone here. Its a better x-ray square as the f1 to a6 diagonal is open and better than the d1 to a4 diagonal. Better real estate. So white has wasted tempo or time getting to this square.

32,Bxb4,d6b4,r1bq1r1k/1pp3pp/p7/5p2/1bBNpn2/2P1R3/P2P1PPP/R1BQ2K1 w - - 0 17,"But he did.t see this tactic. Now if pawn takes at b4, the knight is lost at d4. Thus a pawns gain by black either way."
