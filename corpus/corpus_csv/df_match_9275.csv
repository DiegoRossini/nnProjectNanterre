1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone, after playing a game called How Good is the Four Pawns Attack Part 1, my mentor, Ion showed me a game of his where he played against the Four Pawns Attack.  Mistakes were made on both sides but Ion was more fortunate than I was in my Four Pawns Attack - he drew."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"1. ............ Nf6 - the most common response in the database.  This knight move is made to hinder e4 and develops a piece.  As you will see, however, white soon gets round that problem!"
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"5. f4 - and here we have it - the Four Pawns Attack - just like in my game, but it deviates later on.  White has a fine pawn centre and black must find a way to make a dent in it."
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"5. f4 - and here we have it - the Four Pawns Attack - just like in my game, but it deviates later on.  White has a fine pawn centre and black must find a way to make a dent in it."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"5. f4 - and here we have it - the Four Pawns Attack - just like in my game, but it deviates later on.  White has a fine pawn centre and black must find a way to make a dent in it."

In my game against michael I took with the c pawn instead - maybe this move is an improvement.  White can keep his kingside and queenside pawns together this way and the pawn structure may come under less strain than the other capture.  It does leave the e file open for a black rook to come on it so white would strongly be advised to castle on his next move, which he does."

Hmm, Ion, what about Nc7?  Although it seems that the knight may not be able to go anywhere significant after that, on c7 it does prepare an advance of the black a and b pawns and the possibility of undermining the queenside pawn chain by playing an eventual b5."

The intent of this move here was to get out of the pin with check and to reclaim the piece by capturing on e4 with the f pawn, unfortunately white gets his knight out of the road by playing Nf2 - Ion is a piece for a pawn down.  The position is not resignable yet - remember a pawn can crown, a piece cannot.  The defender must find some vigorous counterplay, however or white could increase this material advantage.  Ion now creates complications, and as mentioned in a previous note, they earn him half a point.  I do not know the rating differentials of the two protagonists here - this could also have some bearing on the decision to play on or not."

Here Ion has managed to double rooks on the e file as I mentioned in a previous note.  He has managed to get a rook down on the 7th rank which can be a bone in the throat.  This resulted in Ion netting the b pawn and wrecking white's queenside pawn structure through the back door - black's queenside pawn structure is more intact.  Ion is also threatening a move like R x N (uncovering an attack on the a1 rook) - white sidestepps this threat with Rad1.
