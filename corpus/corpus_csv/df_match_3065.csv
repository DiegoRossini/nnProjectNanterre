1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

I was thinking about the thread in my Club about which piece you would rather have in a B v N endgame.  Many people would say the bishop!  Well, I had the bishop, my opponent had the knight (and the lower chess rating at the time the game was played!) and I lost!  Here is how it happened.  The first three moves are the French Exchange Variation so I start commentary on move 4."
