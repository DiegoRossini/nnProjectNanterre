10,Bd6,f8d6,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/3bpn2/2pp4/3P1B2/2P2N2/PP1NPPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,"Thematic, but off-tempo."
11,Ne5,f3e5,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/3bpn2/2ppN3/3P1B2/2P5/PP1NPPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 2 6,My standard response.
12,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/3bpn2/2ppN3/3P1B2/2P5/PP1NPPPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 3 7,No difference from before.

14,Nc6,b8c6,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2nbpn2/2ppN3/3P1B2/2P1P3/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 1 8,"My last hope, Nd7 (Nxf7!) was not played, so the game is going even. Every scheme has its weak point, any tempo, if well spent, can do the difference. Time to stike."
15,g4,g2g4,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2nbpn2/2ppN3/3P1BP1/2P1P3/PP1N1P1P/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 8,A very thematic one.
16,h6,h7h6,r1bq1rk1/pp3pp1/2nbpn1p/2ppN3/3P1BP1/2P1P3/PP1N1P1P/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 9,"g5 now gives and exchange, the opening of the g coumn... BUT also allows NxNe5, dxN, Bxe5... and I know by experience it can be disastrous for white."

18,Nh7,f6h7,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppn/2nbp2p/2ppN3/3P1BPP/2P1P3/PP1N1P2/R2QKB1R w KQ - 1 10,Well done! But I can still build pressure...

And gxh3?, exB, hxg7, and black can safely play Qxg7 because g1 is not supported. I can threat Rg1, but black can probably defend. I didn't want to be ""too"" fool."

So I am surprisingly switching my target - a creative strategy. I think now it was just a bad move. Bxh6!?, gxB, g6! and the black N is lost all the same, and the g column is opened (for good or for evil!)."
