1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"Hi everyone!

Found this old game to give me and Master Freddy's long-suffering opponents some inspiration.  I take my hat off to Pearl, the Class C player in this game and I am about to play through it to see how she managed to overcome The Master Mater who was an Expert at the time this game was played.  Freddy kicks off with the Reti Opening which is Nf3 - this move develops a piece and hits out at e5."
