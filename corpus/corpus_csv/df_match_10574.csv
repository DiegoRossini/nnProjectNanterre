1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Takes control of the center, c5 and e5, from the center. Opens a bishop line. Signals intent to play a positional game. The pawn is protected."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,Black plays a covert response which can translate into many openings. Controls d5 and e4. The knight is protected.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"A flank aproach to controlling the center, b5 and d5 squares. Unprotected piece that has only e7-e5 to contend with for an attacking move. This move would however provide a trade of flank for center pawn. The opening is taking on an Indian flavor."
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Heading towards what could be a Nimzo Indian opening, but other openings can spring from this position. Contests control of d5, controls f5. Controls some of the center from a defensive position."
5,a3,a2a3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/P7/1P2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"E00 Queens Pawn Anti-Nimzo-Indian Opening to this move. Typically d7-d5 is played next. This move controls b4 which prevents Bf8-b4+. White controls more center, has more space, has some defensive measures in place, but lacks piece development."
6,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/2PP4/P7/1P2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"A flank attack on a center pawn. Contends control of b4. Blockades c4. Threatens c5xd4. Offers d4xc5, Bf8xc5 with an attack on f2 - but with the bishop susceptable to a b2-b4 attack. The pawn is protected by the bishop. Black is fighting for the center. Opens up the Queen check line of Qd8-a5+. White should respond with Nf3 or e3 to capture back with a piece that is resistant to attack by the B8 knight."
7,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/2PP4/P3P3/1P3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"Black takes advantage of quick development and moves towards king safety. The bishop appears awkward here, but does offer an attack later via Qd8-c7 with an attack directed towards h2 where white must presumedly castle. Its is an ambitious move, but I feel Be7 is better. Maybe because of white gaining space by d4xc5, Bd6xc5, b2-b4, Bc5-e7. Rate as ?! and = because white can make positional gains, but black has a lead in piece development. There is the debate of expansion of space for white verses piece development for black. There is an imbalance between the applied strategies."
8,Bd6,f8d6,rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/3bpn2/2p5/2PP4/P3P3/1P3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"Black takes advantage of quick development and moves towards king safety.

9,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/3bpn2/2p5/2PP4/P2BP3/1P3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 5,"White moves for piece development instead of continued pawn expansion by the previously mentioned line that chases the bishop at d6. The imbalance shifts some, but black still maintains a lead in piece development."
10,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/3bpn2/8/2Pp4/P2BP3/1P3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,Black attempts to take away some of the protected control of the center from white. The result is after e3xd4 the pawn at d4 is not protected and contention of f4 is more balanced with B vs B instead of B vs P. It is true that d4 is safe for white for the moment and white still has more space and a 2 point pawn front on the 4th vs the 1 point pawn presence at e6. The move 0-0 looks better. Rate +\= because black drops the momentum of developing for a pawn move.
11,exd4,e3d4,rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/3bpn2/8/2PP4/P2B4/1P3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 6,"Black launches a queen attack, but overlooks a tactic by white. Rate as ?? and +\- because black will lose a piece from this move."
12,Qb6,d8b6,rnb1k2r/pp1p1ppp/1q1bpn2/8/2PP4/P2B4/1P3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 7,"Black launches a queen attack, but overlooks a tactic by white. Rate as ?? and +\- because black will lose a piece from this move."
13,c5,c4c5,rnb1k2r/pp1p1ppp/1q1bpn2/2P5/3P4/P2B4/1P3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 7,White takes advantage of previous move. Rate as +\-
14,Bxc5,d6c5,rnb1k2r/pp1p1ppp/1q2pn2/2b5/3P4/P2B4/1P3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 8,"There is no better move.  Some tries are Qb6-a5+, Bc1-d2 refutes. If Qb6-a5+, b2-b4, Bc5xb4  !, and a3xb4 loses the rook - so is avoided. The knight can block at c3, but it is a passive move."
15,dxc5,d4c5,rnb1k2r/pp1p1ppp/1q2pn2/2P5/8/P2B4/1P3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 8,"Black does end up at only -1 point, but pieces can accomplish more than undeveloped pawns so the trade-off of the bishop for the 2 pawns is not beneficial tactically, positionally, or materially. The center is open which provides white much freedom for the bishops and the black queen is an unprotected target for the bishops."
16,Qxc5,b6c5,rnb1k2r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2q5/8/P2B4/1P3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 9,"Black does end up at only -1 point, but pieces can accomplish more than undeveloped pawns so the trade-off of the bishop for the 2 pawns is not beneficial tactically, positionally, or materially. The center is open which provides white much freedom for the bishops and the black queen is an unprotected target for the bishops."
17,Be3,c1e3,rnb1k2r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2q5/8/P2BB3/1P3PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 1 9,White takes advantage by attacking to gain tempo and developing a piece.
18,Qe5,c5e5,rnb1k2r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/4q3/8/P2BB3/1P3PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 2 10,Black attempts to attack the b2 pawn while pinning the bishop. The move is not successful and only helps white to develop and gain tempo. Rate as ? because the move helps white to develop and because the queen has moved to a vulnerable square because of Ng1-f3.
19,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1k2r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/4q3/8/P1NBB3/1P3PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 3 10,This move blocks the threat of Qe5xb2 while developing a piece. White stands better.
20,d5,d7d5,rnb1k2r/pp3ppp/4pn2/3pq3/8/P1NBB3/1P3PPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 0 11,"Black has forgotten about the king and continues to pursue an attack by hoping to obtain a fork by d5-d4. Rate this move as ?! because it has limited potential as an attack, while it does gain some central control."
21,Nf3,g1f3,rnb1k2r/pp3ppp/4pn2/3pq3/8/P1NBBN2/1P3PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 11,"White continues to develop, this time with tempo gained by attacking the queen. White is 2 moves from a fully developed back rank."
22,Qd6,e5d6,rnb1k2r/pp3ppp/3qpn2/3p4/8/P1NBBN2/1P3PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 12,"Black hopes to push the pawn to obtain a fork, but the threat is stronger than the execution."
23,O-O,e1g1,rnb1k2r/pp3ppp/3qpn2/3p4/8/P1NBBN2/1P3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 3 12,White castles for development and safety. The fork is not a serious threat.
