Bxc4 Bxc4 11. bxc4, I end up with two pawns that control central squares, and his knight facing the possibility of a pin. If 9...dxc4 bxc4, I end up with two central pawns but I wasn't sure of my light squared bishop's activity in this line. If he castles queenside, I don't even remember what I thought of doing if he castled queenside, but right now I think I could have pawn stormed my way to his king."

Now my f pawn is free and can attack the knight, plus I am already threatening to win the knight since 13... Bxc4 Rxe4 loses the queen, 13... Nxd2 loses the queen, and any moves other than 13... f5, 13... Nf6 lose the knight immediately since the d5 bishop should not take whichever piece captures on e4, for it is pinned by the c4 bishop to his queen."
