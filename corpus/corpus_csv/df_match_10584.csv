PS - from Wikepedia:
[edit] Original Grandmasters (1914)
The title ""Grandmaster"" was first formally conferred by Russian Tsar Nicholas II, who in 1914 awarded it to five players (Lasker, Capablanca, Alekhine, Tarrasch and Marshall), who were finalists of a tournament in Saint Petersburg which he had partially funded. The tournament was won by Lasker ahead of Capablanca.


[edit] Non-standard usage (1914–1950)
After 1914, the term ""Grandmaster"" was sometimes informally applied to other world class players.

In the early 1930s, the Soviet Union brought in the title of ""Grandmaster of the USSR"", for their own players, since at that time Soviets were not competing outside their own country.


[edit] Official Status (1950 onwards)
FIDE first awarded the Grandmaster title in 1950 to 27 players. These players were:

The top players of the day: world champion Botvinnik, and those who had qualified for (or been seeded into) the inaugural Candidates Tournament in 1950: Boleslavsky, Bondarevsky, Bronstein, Euwe, Fine, Flohr, Keres, Kotov, Lilienthal, Najdorf, Reshevsky, Smyslov, St�hlberg, and Szab�. 
Players still living who, though past their best in 1950, were recognised as having been world class when at their peak: Bernstein, Duras, Gr�nfeld, Kostić, Levenfish, Maroczy, Mieses, Ragozin, Rubinstein, S�misch, Tartakower, and Vidmar. 
By recognising world class players before 1950, this gave continuity with the original 1914 Grandmasters, except for world class players who had died between 1914 and 1950 (such as Carl Schlechter, Richard Reti and Aron Nimzowitsch).

Since 1950, players have had to qualify for the Grandmaster title according to FIDE rules.

Certainly Nimzo would have received the ""official"" title had he lived."
