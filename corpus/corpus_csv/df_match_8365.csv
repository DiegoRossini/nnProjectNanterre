1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

I hope you enjoyed my previous annotation of The Master Mater at work.  He is at it again in this game against yours truly.  I end up exchanging bishop for knight to bust up his pawn structure.  Yes, and I also get rid of his marauding horsies.  I felt that inflicting a break up of Freddy's pawn structure would stand me in good stead in the endgame where Freddy is pretty strong.  But, although I was out of the opening, there was the middle game to play.  Boy, didn't Freddy make full use of that g file. Funny, Freddy's opponent had the g file to play with and got nowhere, in fact Freddy made use of it.  I can only say that it is because Freddy was so much better developed than NN when the g file was opened that his attack was so successful.  I kick off with d4 for a change as I do play e4 quite frequently."

Black's queenside looks a little draughty so I think he will choose the kingside.  Freddy proves me wrong.  Like the game ""Henry seemed as Safe as Houses"" he keeps his king in the middle!
