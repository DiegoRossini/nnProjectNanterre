1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is a game I played against Shredder a few weeks ago.  Although White didn't play very well and dropped his queen to a fairly obvious tactic, one of the nice things about the game is that it shows the danger of not developing your pieces and of launching unsupported attacks.  White was able to pull off the victory because Black ended up with all his pieces sidelined, either having not moved or having moved away from the scene of the fight."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The Sicilian Defence.  The most popular choice for Black against 1. e4, and something that offers good chances for Black, especially against weaker players who don't know quite what to do.  I didn't used to like playing against it, but I'm improving."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,A general developing move that doesn't commit White to anything in particular yet.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"Shredder (and thus the game title) lists this as the Rossolimo Variation, with White taking an almost Ruy Lopez-inspired approach.  However, we should note that the Rossolimo proper has Bb5 as White's third move and Black replying with 3. ... g6 (neither of which are the case here).  We can probably consider this a transposed move order for White and a deviation from book for Black's next move."
5,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 3,"Shredder (and thus the game title) lists this as the Rossolimo Variation, with White taking an almost Ruy Lopez-inspired approach.

8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/1Bp5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,Combines general development with an attack on the e4 pawn (which will need further support before it can come to anything).
9,d4,d2d4,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/1Bp5/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"As Black has not pursued his attack on e4, White is free to try an attack of his own at d5."

15,Nd5,c3d5,r2qkb1r/pp1bpppp/2np1n2/1B1N4/3NP3/4B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 2 8,"Exchanging the knights would allow exd5 with an attack on the knight.  White could also have castled for stronger defence, or perhaps played Qe2."

21,Nxb5,d4b5,r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/3p4/1N1Pn3/2P5/4B3/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 11,"White is happy with this knight placement, with one eye on a hopeful Nc7 if the queen moves before castling.  Black could play a6 to drive the knight back, but it wouldn't help his position much otherwise, and he might instead consider e5 (especially as White's lack of an lsb offsets the weakeness in his castle created by exchanging pawns on e6.  Black could also try Nxc4 as the pawn is no longer defended."
22,Qa5+,d8a5,r3kb1r/pp2pppp/3p4/qN1Pn3/2P5/4B3/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 1 12,"Instead Black develops the queen with check.  Without the c4 pawn, this would have been an excellent attack, and could have been usefully preceded by Nxc4."
23,Bd2,e3d2,r3kb1r/pp2pppp/3p4/qN1Pn3/2P5/8/PP1B1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 2 12,"White still eyes c7, using the discovered check to pick up the rook."

30,Nxa4,b2a4,r3kb1r/pp2pppp/1q1p4/1N1P4/n1P5/8/P2BKPPP/R6R w kq - 0 16,White now needs good activity if he is to compensate for the loss of material.  It's fair to say that this should be over if Black gets his pieces together.
31,Rab1,a1b1,r3kb1r/pp2pppp/1q1p4/1N1P4/n1P5/8/P2BKPPP/1R5R b kq - 1 16,White now needs good activity if he is to compensate for the loss of material.  It's fair to say that this should be over if Black gets his pieces together.

33,Rb4,b1b4,r3kb1r/pp3ppp/1q1p4/1N1Pp3/nRP5/8/P2BKPPP/7R b kq - 1 17,"Attacks the knight and allows the rooks to be doubled.  Note that White passes on 17. dxe5 e.p. because the d5 pawn is blocking the d6 pawn, which is itself blocking the black dsb."
