21,O-O,e1g1,rn1q1b1r/1p4pp/p1k1p3/2p3N1/4pPB1/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1B2RK1 b - - 1 11,"White, correctly in my view, prefers to castle than to capture the e4 or e6 pawn, continuing to develop quickly before trying to alter the material balance.  The disadvantage of failing to capture the e4 pawn early, though, is that it inhibits the development of the QB and QR by discouraging the d-pawn from moving."
22,Kb6,c6b6,rn1q1b1r/1p4pp/pk2p3/2p3N1/4pPB1/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1B2RK1 w - - 2 12,I hasten Henry to his safe haven.

24,Nc6,b8c6,r2q1b1r/1p4pp/pkn1p3/2p5/4NPB1/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1B2RK1 w - - 1 13,Black's earlier slow manoeuvres have allowed his Knight to find its best square.

27,Na4+,c3a4,r2q1b1r/1p4pp/pk2p3/2p5/N2nNPB1/8/PPPP2PP/R1B2R1K b - - 4 14,This check hastens my King to his safe haven but frees White's c-pawn to move and puts pressure on Black's c5 pawn.  White seems to be compounding his positional advantage.
28,Ka7,b6a7,r2q1b1r/kp4pp/p3p3/2p5/N2nNPB1/8/PPPP2PP/R1B2R1K w - - 5 15,"As Black still has nominal material advantage, swapping remains in his favour.  The piece being swapped is making its first move, whereas White has invested 3 moves in his knight, so this doesn't seem bad to me."

31,Nxc5,e4c5,r2q3r/kp4pp/p3p3/2N5/3n1PB1/8/PPPP2PP/R1B2R1K b - - 0 16,"The pawn on e6 has miraculously survived so long that I see no need to give it up immediately.  In the long term I don't expect to retain it but gradually nuntar manoeuvres me into a position where everything seems to depend on holding it, which I can't, and this leads to the denouement."

34,Nf5,d4f5,r2qr3/kp4pp/p3p3/2N2n2/5PB1/2P5/PP1P2PP/R1B2R1K w - - 1 18,"Now White develops his d-pawn to its best square and frees up the QB, simultaneously preventing my Q from jumping to d3 if the Nc5 moved."

37,Bh3,g4h3,r3r3/kp4pp/p3p3/2N2n2/3P1P1q/2P4B/PP4PP/R1B2R1K b - - 2 19,"Now I was lost for ideas, so decided to strengthen my N's position without changing the fundamental geometry of the position."
