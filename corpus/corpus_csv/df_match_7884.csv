1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Another game I lose but this time there is an interesting sacrifice that I feel must be taken into account.  At the time I couldn't figure out how to break it and I still have trouble with it.  I feel that it shouldn't be sound... I'd like outside opinion.  This game starts out with the king's Indian Defense.  Fairly interesting game I make one big error that allows black to break the bind making me with a bad bishop vs good knight.
