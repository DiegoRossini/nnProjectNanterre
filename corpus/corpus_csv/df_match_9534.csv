1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was a standard game between two lowish-ranked players (although this was my first game, so my rank may not be representative). I (fish613, playing black) annotated this game not because it's a stunning game, although it does exemplify how strategic advantages can be thrown away with tactical mistakes, but simply because I wanted to develop my own thoughts and thinking process further. Comments are welcome - I'm sure I've missed a lot."
