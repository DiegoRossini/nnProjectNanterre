1,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was a Bird's opening, similar to other one in which I played black, I diverge from my opponent in the other game by avoiding to exchange my light squares bishop, and avoiding also damage to my pawn structure, then followed a good plan to fianchetto the dark squares bishop, and exploit black's constricted position. Black's queen was soon trapped and black had to give up a piece to avoid losing his queen, due to heavily scattered pawn structure, a couple of advanced black pawns, and more active rooks consolidation was hard to achieve, but some poor move choices by black allowed the position to became slowly easier for white, until black finally lost all possible counterplay"
