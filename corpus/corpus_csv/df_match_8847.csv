1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!  Yet another round against Freddy and yet another date with Old Matey.  How did this happen, well, to summarise, I start of with c4 which is the English Opening which controls the squares b5 and d5 and also allows for Nc3 without blocking in the c pawn.  Freddy then surprises me with b5 - a gambit.  I decide to accept the gambit, well you never know, if I can hang on to the gambit material and he doesn't get any play for it then despite the near 500 rating difference I may be able to get an endgame victory.  But there is the saying ""Many a slip twixt cup and lip"" and boy doese'nt it happen here!  Freddy mixes things up in the database and I end up developing Fou Lenoir on the wrong square, d2 instead of b2.  This made one heck of a difference as I was unable to control the c column and so had to concede that to Freddy.  Freddy then won back the pawn and weakened my kingside pawn structure.  If only I could swap off the heavies.  Freddy only had pawns on the kingside and I had a remote passer - with opposite bishops that would most probably have meant two words ........ draw game ........ but the heavies stayed on.  Ironically the most active piece was, wait for it ............GLENDA!!  Unfortunately she strayed from Henry's side to try to aid promotion of my remote a pawn - unfortunately allowing for a decisive and fatal invasion of the Wicked Witch of the West and that is when Henry met an ignominious end.  Anyhow, on with the game."

Like a good little girl I start to play out the moves.  Freddy sets them up as conditionals.  I play out the moves because I will have a hands on tuition on how to conduct a king hunt to the death.  I am very inexperienced at this sort of thing.  I have mounted a few successful mating attacks on lower rated players but with Freddy announcing #11 this all seems so crude and amateurish compared to this awesome thing that Freddy is about to show me.  I suppose the first step to being able to mount a successful mating attack is to be on the receiving end of one!

Kd2 - now here is a fingerslip - I should have played Ke2 but, this turns out to be a happy fingerslip because although I still cop Old Matey I choose the quickest and least painful route.  For, after the game, I was able to access my personal db, call up this game and analyse what would have happened had I continue to play along with Freddy.  The answer - I would have lost all, yes all of my pieces bar Henry.  The bishop checkmate at the end would have been very pretty but I would have hated to give up all my pieces first, so at least I was spared that."
