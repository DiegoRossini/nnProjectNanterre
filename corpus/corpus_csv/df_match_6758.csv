2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,Im trying still to play something different. I have to know what to do in all sorts of openings.

7,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"Because we both have our E- pawns 1 square forward, and our knights next, the focus is actually on the queenside"
