1,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Henry Bird's opening.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The classic From Gambit. Other strategies against the Bird don't work as well (especially 1...d5, the Reversed Dutch.)"
3,g4,g2g4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/5PP1/8/PPPPP2P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,A suicidal move (what else could it be?).
4,Qh4+,d8h4,rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/5PPq/8/PPPPP2P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,Checkmate in two moves. How saddening. This is why I didn't say who white was.
