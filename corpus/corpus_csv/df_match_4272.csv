1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"Hi everyone!

This is the first of two games when I get into a reasonable position with a Master and an Expert and then I end up overplaying my hand.  In this game, Dave apparently walks into a knight fork, but he then showed me that things are not always what they seem.  Dave hit me with an even bigger stinger from the Wicked Witch of the West.  How does this happen?  Well, it is a case of looking at the Gameknot Analysis http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17205702&fb=1&rnd=0.547893998411963 and the commentary below.  The game starts with the Reti Opening which provides a lot of flexibility to white."
