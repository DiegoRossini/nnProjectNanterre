8,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/3PPpb1/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,Black creates an annoying pin on my knight.
9,Bxf4,c1f4,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/3PPBb1/5N2/PPP3PP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,I take the free pawn.

12,Bxf3,g4f3,r2qkbnr/pppn1ppp/3p4/8/2BPPB2/5b2/PPP3PP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"? This is a mistake, as it exchanges a piece that has moved twice for a piece that has moved only once. Such notions are essential in sharp game like these!"
13,Qxf3,d1f3,r2qkbnr/pppn1ppp/3p4/8/2BPPB2/5Q2/PPP3PP/RN2K2R b KQkq - 0 7,Here is the consequence of Black's last move: I have 3 developed pieces for Black's knight. My queen also aims for the f7 square.
14,Ne7,g8e7,r2qkb1r/pppnnppp/3p4/8/2BPPB2/5Q2/PPP3PP/RN2K2R w KQkq - 1 8,Another mistake. The king suffocates behind his pieces.
