1,a3,a2a3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/P7/1PPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game features an unusual opening, an exciting middlegame, and tantalizing missed opportunity on both sides... all in all, one of my favorite games so far from the recent tournament!

I start out with e4 most of the time, but I knew my tournament opponents would likely be well-versed in the standard openings.  So I dusted off an old favorite... 1. a3?!, Anderssen's opening, after a grandmaster famous for his wild and brilliant play (he was involved in both ""The Immortal Game"" and ""The Evergreen Game"", two of the most famous games in history.)"
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/P7/1PPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I'd like to think Black was a bit confused by my choice of opening, but he stuck to his plan and staked a claim for the center."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/P7/1P1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"My idea here was to get into a kind of reverse Sicilian, and possibly start expanding on the queenside with an eventual b4."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2P5/P7/1P1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,Fighting for control of e4.

6,Bc5,f8c5,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/2b1p3/2P5/P2P4/1P2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"(?!) Black points at f2.  I'm not worried about Ng4?, since I still have e3! in reserve.  Also, I can now play b4 at any time to gain a tempo."
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/2b1p3/2P5/P1NP4/1P2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 4,Continuing with development.
