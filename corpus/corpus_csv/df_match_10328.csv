1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,1. e4 - let's keep it simple - JS.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,1....... e5 (and ID replies in kind).
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,3.  I decide to play the Scotch Opening - Kasparov has played this - must be good!! - JS
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,3.  I decide to play the Scotch Opening - Kasparov has played this - must be good!! - JS
5,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,3.  I decide to play the Scotch Opening - Kasparov has played this - must be good!! - JS
6,exd4,e5d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"4.  .... The knight is twice attacked, so ......."
7,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"4.  .... The knight is twice attacked, so ......."
8,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b5/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"4.  .... The knight is twice attacked, so ......."
9,Be3,c1e3,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b5/3NP3/4B3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,5. Be3 - I try not to move the same piece twice.  Be3 develops a piece and the knight is defended twice.
10,Qf6,d8f6,r1b1k1nr/pppp1ppp/2n2q2/2b5/3NP3/4B3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 3 6,"5. ........ Qf6 (""I have to keep this pressure on, I have to keep this pressure on!!"" - quoted from Spandau Ballet by the way).  The knight is attacked once more, so....."
11,c3,c2c3,r1b1k1nr/pppp1ppp/2n2q2/2b5/3NP3/2P1B3/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,I defend it again with a pawn - 6. c3! - Now what's next Ion?
12,Nge7,g8e7,r1b1k2r/ppppnppp/2n2q2/2b5/3NP3/2P1B3/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,6. ....... Ng-e7 (develops a piece and prepares castling).
13,Be2,f1e2,r1b1k2r/ppppnppp/2n2q2/2b5/3NP3/2P1B3/PP2BPPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 2 7,7. Be2 - now I return the complement.
14,d5,d7d5,r1b1k2r/ppp1nppp/2n2q2/2bp4/3NP3/2P1B3/PP2BPPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"7. ........ d5 (hello, hello, hello - should I capture the pawn?).  No, thinks I because if I do he will take with the e7 knight and put my bishop under pressure, which is supporting my nicely positioned knight.  I have to move the same piece twice to back up the e pawn so I play ........"
15,Bf3,e2f3,r1b1k2r/ppp1nppp/2n2q2/2bp4/3NP3/2P1BB2/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 1 8,8. Bf3.  Now let's see what happens ......
16,dxe4,d5e4,r1b1k2r/ppp1nppp/2n2q2/2b5/3Np3/2P1BB2/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 9,"8. ...... dxe4 (now follows a plethora of exchanges over the next few moves leaving me with an IQP, grr and double grr - not good against a player nearly 500 points north of my rating!)"
17,Bxe4,f3e4,r1b1k2r/ppp1nppp/2n2q2/2b5/3NB3/2P1B3/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 0 9,"12. ...... c6 (what's this, an outpost for the knight on d5 I suppose).  This could be the plan if Ion plays Be6.  How do I prevent this, I know, by playing ........"
18,Bxd4,c5d4,r1b1k2r/ppp1nppp/2n2q2/8/3bB3/2P1B3/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 10,"12. ...... c6 (what's this, an outpost for the knight on d5 I suppose).  This could be the plan if Ion plays Be6.  How do I prevent this, I know, by playing ........"
19,Bxd4,e3d4,r1b1k2r/ppp1nppp/2n2q2/8/3BB3/2P5/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 0 10,"12. ...... c6 (what's this, an outpost for the knight on d5 I suppose).  This could be the plan if Ion plays Be6.  How do I prevent this, I know, by playing ........"
20,Nxd4,c6d4,r1b1k2r/ppp1nppp/5q2/8/3nB3/2P5/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 11,"12. ...... c6 (what's this, an outpost for the knight on d5 I suppose).  This could be the plan if Ion plays Be6.  How do I prevent this, I know, by playing ........"
21,Qxd4,d1d4,r1b1k2r/ppp1nppp/5q2/8/3QB3/2P5/PP3PPP/RN2K2R b KQkq - 0 11,"12. ...... c6 (what's this, an outpost for the knight on d5 I suppose).  This could be the plan if Ion plays Be6.  How do I prevent this, I know, by playing ........"
22,Qxd4,f6d4,r1b1k2r/ppp1nppp/8/8/3qB3/2P5/PP3PPP/RN2K2R w KQkq - 0 12,"12. ...... c6 (what's this, an outpost for the knight on d5 I suppose).  This could be the plan if Ion plays Be6.  How do I prevent this, I know, by playing ........"
23,cxd4,c3d4,r1b1k2r/ppp1nppp/8/8/3PB3/8/PP3PPP/RN2K2R b KQkq - 0 12,"12. ...... c6 (what's this, an outpost for the knight on d5 I suppose).  This could be the plan if Ion plays Be6.  How do I prevent this, I know, by playing ........"
24,c6,c7c6,r1b1k2r/pp2nppp/2p5/8/3PB3/8/PP3PPP/RN2K2R w KQkq - 0 13,"12. ...... c6 (what's this, an outpost for the knight on d5 I suppose).  This could be the plan if Ion plays Be6.  How do I prevent this, I know, by playing ........"
25,Nc3,b1c3,r1b1k2r/pp2nppp/2p5/8/3PB3/2N5/PP3PPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 1 13,"13. Nc3! (a developing move and it challenges control of the d5 square).  I have now come through the opening unscathed and in fact I now have a slight development lead!  So far, so very good!"
26,Be6,c8e6,r3k2r/pp2nppp/2p1b3/8/3PB3/2N5/PP3PPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 2 14,"13. ........ Be6 (catches up with development) and so, what do I do here?  Castle queenside!!"
27,O-O-O,e1c1,r3k2r/pp2nppp/2p1b3/8/3PB3/2N5/PP3PPP/2KR3R b kq - 3 14,"14. 0-0-0!  Good move because it completes my development, connects the rooks and backs up the d pawn instantly.  With the queens off the board I think my king is better placed nearer the centre than on the kingside."
28,Rd8,a8d8,3rk2r/pp2nppp/2p1b3/8/3PB3/2N5/PP3PPP/2KR3R w k - 4 15,14. ....... Rd8 (attacks the d pawn but I got the defense tempo in first - but will it do any good?).
29,Rd2,d1d2,3rk2r/pp2nppp/2p1b3/8/3PB3/2N5/PP1R1PPP/2K4R b k - 5 15,15.  I prepare to double rooks.  The white king is a good defender of the rooks and helps me keep control of the vital open d file.
30,O-O,e8g8,3r1rk1/pp2nppp/2p1b3/8/3PB3/2N5/PP1R1PPP/2K4R w - - 6 16,15. ..... 0-0 (so Ion finally castles and he too is fully developed).  I then follow through with my plan.
31,Rhd1,h1d1,3r1rk1/pp2nppp/2p1b3/8/3PB3/2N5/PP1R1PPP/2KR4 b - - 7 16,"16. Rh-d1 (I now have control of the d file, but for how long?).  Ion replies with Nd5 and we have another plethora of exchanges leading to a double rook ending)."
