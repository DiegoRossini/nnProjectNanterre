1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

A great start to my weekend with a victory.  This victory nicely rounds off my inter-continental mini-tournament in which I finished with 6 points out of 8 games with 4 wins and 4 draws so nice to come out unbeaten in a mini-tournament!  In this game an early tactical shot wins me the exchange, then up an rook for pawn and then more, in other words my advantage snowballs until I am more than 10 points up in material, but my opponent does not wave the white flag.  This means I have to work out a way to checkmate him.  Well, I think the Master Mater's lessons and encouragement to do some puzzles has come in very handy here and there will be a nice puzzle for you to solve at the end.  We start with a double king pawn opening, e4 e5."
