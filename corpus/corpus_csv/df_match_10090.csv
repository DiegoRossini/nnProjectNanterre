1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This game is a classic example of what happens when black does take to play along openning's strengths. white does a solid job in avoiding exchanges and in the end takes complete control
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"The modern benoni

The point of blacks thrust is to lure white to d5 and create a pawn imbalance on the opposite board. The disadvantage is that white usually has a slightly better game because of the enduring space advantage in the centre.

As a side note I do not recommend playing ...C5 right away. It is good to keep white guessing with ...e6. This allows you to transpose quickly into king indain lines if you feel things are not right to play the benoni."

However, in this particular position they do not really offer much in the way of counter play. White is able to continue his central build up virtually unmolested, whilst sooner or later black will be left wondering how on earth he ever imagined being able to generate any real counter play. The problem for black is that he suffers from a very cramped position. Thus, he should be aiming toward exchanges."
