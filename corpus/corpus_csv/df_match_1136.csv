If the knight moves to h5, I will have to do quite some maneuvering to get it out of the way (probably via Be2 and f4, both of which block easy access of my queen and dark-squared bishop to the king side). for the pawn storm it would be necessary to get a pawn to h5 anyway, so maybe I should try to do that first, before playing g5."

Of course, the black king can't castle long any more, but with the g- and h-file not being as safe as they may seem, it may have been better to keep the king in the middle, at least until some pieces are forced off the board through an attack on white's position."
