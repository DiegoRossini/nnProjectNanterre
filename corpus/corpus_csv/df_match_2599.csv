2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I've never played against the Caro-Kann OTB in a classical time  control (that being said I'm not sure I've EVER played against it OTB), but I  have some experience online against it. In this game I play the line I  usually go with, an ""Anti-Caro-Kann"" system."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/2P1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Contesting control of d5  early.
