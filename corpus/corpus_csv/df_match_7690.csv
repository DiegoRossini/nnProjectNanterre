1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

I decided to take another trip down memory lane.  This game ended on 21.08.08, over a year ago.  Somehow I get struck down by passivitis yet again, but as you will see, that passive position conceals a coiled serpent in the grass.  After a normal double king pawn start my opponent plays the Patzer's Opening, although, I have to say, that Master Freddy is not averse to playing the white side of it!  The move is 2. Qh5 trying for that evergreen famous Scholar's Mate."
