1,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"this move characterises Birds opening and is alot better than it looks. whites usual plan is to control the central dark squares with moves such as e3, Nf3 and Bb2. it also has surprise value which, in over the board games such as this one, comes into play. i decided to play this against my young (14ish) opponent so to test his knowledge of the opening not just his opening theory which most rely on."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"the move most people play, seems most natural however it plays into whites plans of dark square control. c5 with a later more restrained d6 is a bigger test where white does best to swich plans to light square control following moves like g3, Bg2 and d3."
3,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/5P2/4P3/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,b3 is slightly more accurate
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/5P2/4P3/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,b3 is slightly more accurate
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/5P2/4PN2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 3,b3 is slightly more accurate
