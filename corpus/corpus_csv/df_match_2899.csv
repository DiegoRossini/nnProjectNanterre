1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Sicilian Defence: very popular.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Sicilian Defence: very popular.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"This is called the 'Kopec' Variation of the Sicilian.   I very rarely play anything else on move two in this line, but 2...Nc6 is quite popular and playable, whilst 2...e6 I occasionally employ, and 2...Nf6 and 2...g7 are playable lines."
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"This is called the 'Kopec' Variation of the Sicilian.   I very rarely play anything else on move two in this line, but 2...Nc6 is quite popular and playable, whilst 2...e6 I occasionally employ, and 2...Nf6 and 2...g7 are playable lines."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"Unusual at this point.  White keeps his options open whether to play and Open or Closed Sicilian.  The most popular 'Open' line is usually heralded by 3.d4 cxd4  4.Nxd4 Nf6  5.Nc3.  But Black declines to play 3...Nf6 with the possibility of transposing, on account of 4.e5 - an annoying advance."
6,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pp1p/3p2p1/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Opting for something Dragon-like.  The GK engine doesn't like this move, preferring 3...Nf6  4.d4 cxd4 and transposing onto normal 'open' lines. But White could as well play 4.Bb5ch.  The move played is a little provocative, but in my opinion playable enough."
7,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pp1p/3p2p1/2p5/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"Actually, not bad!  White figures that Black might be reluctant to play 4...e6, and in fact I was.  That pawn advance is OK enough, but I prefer to hold it back for now.  At that 4...e5 would also have been playable for Black, here."
8,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk1nr/pp2ppbp/3p2p1/2p5/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,Calmly continuing as planned.  Would White take on f7 right now?  I didn't think it likely...
9,Bxf7+,c4f7,rnbqk1nr/pp2pBbp/3p2p1/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"(?) I guess the thing had to be tested, but after this White never quite gets enough attack.  I was half-expecting 5.Ng5 when I might well have played 5...e6.  This Bishop sac disrupts Black's King position, but the advantages that accrues aren't enough to square against the loss of the Bishop.  Very occasionally this kind of thing works.  Not this time."
10,Kxf7,e8f7,rnbq2nr/pp2pkbp/3p2p1/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 6,"'Show me.'  When examining moves by an opponent to involve him in the loss of material, always take into account he might be on to something good.  But to suppose is not to assume.  If you can't find that your opponent can recoup his material, make him 'show you'.  If he can't, then you have the material advantage.  Here Black really has no choice but to take."
11,Ng5+,f3g5,rnbq2nr/pp2pkbp/3p2p1/2p3N1/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 1 6,"I'm guessing White wanted to get in this check, and hence beef up the pressure on f7, whilst the getting was good.  First off, it makes way for the Queen to get into the game, and allows Black no time to keep him out by ...h6."
12,Ke8,f7e8,rnbqk1nr/pp2p1bp/3p2p1/2p3N1/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 2 7,Chosen to keep the f8-square open for the rook.
13,Nd5,c3d5,rnbqk1nr/pp2p1bp/3p2p1/2pN2N1/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 3 7,I'm guessing that White wanted to have something to play against the Black knight that would soon be landing on f6...
14,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqk2r/pp2p1bp/3p1np1/2pN2N1/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 4 8,"Black is quite strongly entrenched against White's cavalry attack.  Strong enough, in fact, that Black feels he can drive White back."

A piece behind, White will find it hard to develop enough resources to penetrate.  All the same, he does get quite close to the Black King eventually..."
