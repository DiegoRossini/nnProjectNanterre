1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"In this game, black (me) obtains major control of the game with a 7 or 8 point material advantage, but, the moral of the story, never give up!  Black makes a really, really bad move at 24 and allows white to knight fork its queen.  After that, things turned decidedly in white's favor.  White does an excellent job of executing the endgame.  White starts with the popular e4."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Black sets up the Sicilian, which is often an aggressive counter-attack."
3,c3,c2c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"I've come to learn from 1800  players that this is really smart.  I still don't know exactly why, but I guess it has to do with controlling the center 4 squares."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,Definitely Sicilian now.
5,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/3PP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,I usually like this because it gives me (black) the option to open up a hole in white's line.
6,cxd4,c5d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3pP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Which I exercise immediately.  Obviously, white can respond with cxd4 to balance out the trade or place the queen in the middle of the board.  Some like this for white, but I think it can be a weakness as it gives black a big target and an opportunity to chase the queen and develop at the same time."
7,cxd4,c3d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3PP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,White plays it safe.
8,e6,e7e6,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/8/3PP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,Defends against d5.
9,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/8/3PP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"According to the GK database, this is:
1. e4 c5 2. d4 cxd4 3. c3 Nc6 4. cxd4 e6 5. Nf3
B21: Sicilian, Smith-Morra gambit
(I just love these opening names.)"
10,g6,g7g6,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1p1p/2n1p1p1/8/3PP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"I liked the fianchetto here, as it puts stress on d4."
11,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1p1p/2n1p1p1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"Three knights in play, pretty typical."
12,Bg7,f8g7,r1bqk1nr/pp1p1pbp/2n1p1p1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 7,Equal pressure on d4 at this point.
13,Be3,c1e3,r1bqk1nr/pp1p1pbp/2n1p1p1/8/3PP3/2N1BN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 3 7,White regains the advantage on d4.
14,Nge7,g8e7,r1bqk2r/pp1pnpbp/2n1p1p1/8/3PP3/2N1BN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 4 8,"I think I'm worried about Nf6, as it might attract e5.  The problem here is that it hinders black's development opportunities."
15,a3,a2a3,r1bqk2r/pp1pnpbp/2n1p1p1/8/3PP3/P1N1BN2/1P3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,Probably a wasted move on white's part.  I suppose it does prevent Nb4.
16,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp1pnpbp/2n1p1p1/8/3PP3/P1N1BN2/1P3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 1 9,A relatively early castle.
17,Qd2,d1d2,r1bq1rk1/pp1pnpbp/2n1p1p1/8/3PP3/P1N1BN2/1P1Q1PPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 2 9,White looks to be in better position here.
18,d5,d7d5,r1bq1rk1/pp2npbp/2n1p1p1/3p4/3PP3/P1N1BN2/1P1Q1PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 0 10,"If white elected to capture, my responses would have been ...
10.	exd5 	Nxd5
11.	Nxd5 	Qxd5
12.	Bh6 	Bxh6
13.	Qxh6 	Nxd4
14.	Nxd4 	Qxd4"
19,e5,e4e5,r1bq1rk1/pp2npbp/2n1p1p1/3pP3/3P4/P1N1BN2/1P1Q1PPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 0 10,"White opts to advance, which is generally a good move in this situation."
20,Nf5,e7f5,r1bq1rk1/pp3pbp/2n1p1p1/3pPn2/3P4/P1N1BN2/1P1Q1PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 1 11,"Now, Ne7 doesn't look so bad.  Puts direct pressure on the bishop and forces white to maintain support of d4."
