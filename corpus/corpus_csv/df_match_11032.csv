1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"White began with a Scotch game. It usually leads to early simplification or gambit situations for White. If Black chooses to avoid trading pieces, white has the choice of comfort to either go for a try on a closed or semi-opened game with d5 or take on e5, and open up the center right away."

6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,Black is avoiding early trades.
7,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p1B1/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,"So white continues with the aggression. This pin on Nf6 renders its attack of the e4 square useless, and it threatens dxe5. It's a pin we have all encountered more than once so the position is well understood by most: The knight can't move or Black will loose the queen. The only way to free the Black knight is to intercept the line of fire with the Black's king side bishop or to counter-attack with h6, which may force a trade of pieces on f6."
8,d6,d7d6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4p1B1/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Black decided to respond to dxe5 by cementing up the e5 pawn with d6, but it compromises more that in accomplishes."
9,dxe5,d4e5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4P1B1/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"White takes the initiative to simplify. If black takes back with d6 pawn, white can trade queens and force weaknesses in Black position. If after 5. ... dxe5 6. Qxd1 Black takes back with the King, then (1) he can no longer castle to safety and will remain vulnerable in the center for quite some time and (2) White will have the option to double Black's pawns on the f file with the exchange of bishop for Knight. 6. ... Nxd8 might make more sense, but the d1 square is far from ideal for a Knight,White should seize the initiative with quicker development and some weaknesses on the King-side may be forced."
10,h6,h7h6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2pp1/2np1n1p/4P1B1/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Black attempts to counter-attack and somehow save the knight on f6. If the White bishop retreats to h4, then 6. ... f5 will save the f6 Knight from the pin and allow it to take on e4 or to retreat to a safer square."
11,Bxf6,g5f6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2pp1/2np1B1p/4P3/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"The pin on f6 was no longer possible so this was a good time to make the exchange. Although trading the a bishop while opening up the center of the board is often strategically unsound, Black is forced to mess up the pawn structure with doubled pawns on the f file."
12,gxf6,g7f6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2p2/2np1p1p/4P3/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"It makes no sense to take back on f6, because one isolated pawn is easier to defend that two doubled isolated pawns. Therefore, White takes  the e pawn with 7. exd6.
The first pin of the game has forced a considerable weakness in Black's King side pawn structure."
13,exd6,e5d6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2p2/2nP1p1p/8/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"It makes no sense to take back on f6, because one isolated pawn is easier to defend that two doubled isolated pawns. Therefore, White takes  the e pawn with 7. exd6.

14,cxd6,c7d6,r1bqkb1r/pp3p2/2np1p1p/8/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,"Here black should have taken back with the bishop 7. ... Bxd6. Second best choice would have probably been to take back with the Queen 7. ... Qxd6 and after the trade of queens to again take back with the bishop 8. Qxd6 Bxd6. After the trades, black could plan castling Queen-side and doubling rooks on the open g file if White ever castles King side. 
The move cxd6 further weakens Black's pawns. Just 7 moves into the game and Black now has 4 pawn islands! This can't be good... 
Finally, this move limits the mobility and even momentarily traps the Black bishop on f8, which would have been a very important piece on this semi-open board for Black."
15,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkb1r/pp3p2/2np1p1p/1B6/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 1 8,"White continues with yet another Pin on Black's only developed piece. The Black knight on c6 could have found a sweet spot on e5, offering a trade of knights on e5 which would greatly improve Black's pawn structure and control over the center of the board. 
Whereas pinning a piece to a piece of greater value threatens to win material, pinning a piece to the opponent's King completely immobilizes it. Given the situation on the board, the Black Knight is the only active Black piece. The remaining Black's forces are still undeveloped..."
16,Bg4,c8g4,r2qkb1r/pp3p2/2np1p1p/1B6/4P1b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 2 9,"Black now pins the White Knight to the Queen. White did have a threat of bringing that Knight to d4 attacking the pinned knight on 6, but that plan would have been far-fetched - Black could easily defend by developing that light-square bishop to d2.
Better would have been 8. ... Rg8, pressuring White's g2 pawn. That would also prevent White from castling King side, because after castle 9. o-o, Black would have a powerful pin 9. ... Bh3! - g2 would be pinned by the rook on g8 so gxh3 is impossible. Black would threaten to take the g2 pawn with the bishop setting up a discovery check and if 10. g3 Black would win the exchange with 10. ... Bxf1."

This move also blocks the a5-e1 diagonal, guarding the White king from checks."

21,O-O,e1g1,r3k2r/pp2bp2/1qnp1p1p/1B6/2P1P1b1/5N2/PP1N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 2 11,"White King moves to safety. Without the Black rook on g8, castling King side is absolutely safe."

The White Queen on b3 does many things. First, it relieves the pin on the f3 Knight. Second, it frees the d2 knight from the defensive bind to the f3 knight, because the White queen is now also defending it from a safe square; therefore now, if Black makes the pawn trade 13. ... fxe4, white can centralize the d2 knight with 14. Nxe4
Qb3 is a good move. It brings many of White pieces to life."
