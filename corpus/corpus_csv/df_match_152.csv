1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The Nimzo-Indian, a defence I've rarely played. But I should; it's direct - Black gets his pieces out quickly to enable fast castling, and often doubles White's pawns."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"The Nimzo-Indian, a defence I've rarely played. But I should; it's direct - Black gets his pieces out quickly to enable fast castling, and often doubles White's pawns."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"The Nimzo-Indian, a defence I've rarely played. But I should; it's direct - Black gets his pieces out quickly to enable fast castling, and often doubles White's pawns."
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"The Nimzo-Indian, a defence I've rarely played. But I should; it's direct - Black gets his pieces out quickly to enable fast castling, and often doubles White's pawns."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"The Nimzo-Indian, a defence I've rarely played. But I should; it's direct - Black gets his pieces out quickly to enable fast castling, and often doubles White's pawns."
6,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"The Nimzo-Indian, a defence I've rarely played. But I should; it's direct - Black gets his pieces out quickly to enable fast castling, and often doubles White's pawns."
7,a3,a2a3,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/P1N5/1P2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,White can play 4.Qc2 here to avoid the doubled pawns...
8,Bxc3+,b4c3,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/P1b5/1P2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,But in this line White accepts the doubled pawns for a strong pawn centre. It also means Black has no dark-squared Bishop.
9,bxc3,b2c3,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/P1P5/4PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,But in this line White accepts the doubled pawns for a strong pawn centre. It also means Black has no dark-squared Bishop.
10,d5,d7d5,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/P1P5/4PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,Black must counter quickly in the centre.
11,c5,c4c5,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/2Pp4/3P4/P1P5/4PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,"Now my opponent has gone a little astray, but not disastrously so. It's just that advancing the pawn is rather against the spirit of the variation, I would have thought. White's strength is in those pawns, and more usual is 6.e3 or even 6.f3, which I see was the most popular move in the database. Already there are only nine games with this position."
12,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/2Pp4/3P4/P1P5/4PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 7,Now my move is rather against the idea of the opening - swift castling. Instead I develop a piece and in fact don't castle K-side at all.
13,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/2Pp2B1/3P4/P1P5/4PPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 2 7,The lack of Black's dark-squared Bishop is immediately exploited.
14,h6,h7h6,r1bqk2r/ppp2pp1/2n1pn1p/2Pp2B1/3P4/P1P5/4PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 8,So the attacker must be driven away.
15,Bh4,g5h4,r1bqk2r/ppp2pp1/2n1pn1p/2Pp4/3P3B/P1P5/4PPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 1 8,And again...
16,g5,g7g5,r1bqk2r/ppp2p2/2n1pn1p/2Pp2p1/3P3B/P1P5/4PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 9,And again...
17,Bg3,h4g3,r1bqk2r/ppp2p2/2n1pn1p/2Pp2p1/3P4/P1P3B1/4PPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 1 9,Black has really seized the initiative now.
18,Ne4,f6e4,r1bqk2r/ppp2p2/2n1p2p/2Pp2p1/3Pn3/P1P3B1/4PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 2 10,Black has really seized the initiative now.
19,Qd3,d1d3,r1bqk2r/ppp2p2/2n1p2p/2Pp2p1/3Pn3/P1PQ2B1/4PPPP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 3 10,"White really doesn't want a second set of doubled pawns, and this is the only way to avoid them."
20,f5,f7f5,r1bqk2r/ppp5/2n1p2p/2Pp1pp1/3Pn3/P1PQ2B1/4PPPP/R3KBNR w KQkq - 0 11,"A little drastic, but threatening to cut off the Bishop."
21,h3,h2h3,r1bqk2r/ppp5/2n1p2p/2Pp1pp1/3Pn3/P1PQ2BP/4PPP1/R3KBNR b KQkq - 0 11,Instead it's driven back.
22,f4,f5f4,r1bqk2r/ppp5/2n1p2p/2Pp2p1/3Pnp2/P1PQ2BP/4PPP1/R3KBNR w KQkq - 0 12,Instead it's driven back.
23,Bh2,g3h2,r1bqk2r/ppp5/2n1p2p/2Pp2p1/3Pnp2/P1PQ3P/4PPPB/R3KBNR b KQkq - 1 12,At this point we are a few moves out of the databse and I'm unsure of the best continuation. I feel like I'm on top...
24,e5,e6e5,r1bqk2r/ppp5/2n4p/2Ppp1p1/3Pnp2/P1PQ3P/4PPPB/R3KBNR w KQkq - 0 13,And I'm sure White won't want to take this pawn and saddle himself with pawns that are doubles and isolated.
25,f3,f2f3,r1bqk2r/ppp5/2n4p/2Ppp1p1/3Pnp2/P1PQ1P1P/4P1PB/R3KBNR b KQkq - 0 13,"He can, however, drive away my Knight quite easily."
26,Nf6,e4f6,r1bqk2r/ppp5/2n2n1p/2Ppp1p1/3P1p2/P1PQ1P1P/4P1PB/R3KBNR w KQkq - 1 14,"I'm eyeing that open diagonal against the KIng, but I can't see how to exploit it."
27,e4,e2e4,r1bqk2r/ppp5/2n2n1p/2Ppp1p1/3PPp2/P1PQ1P1P/6PB/R3KBNR b KQkq e3 0 14,"White can actually exploit the fact that I didn't castle when I had the opportunity, and play 14.Qg6+, preventing castling altogether. Instead he tries to challenge in the centre and free his Bishop. But this just loses a pawn."
28,dxe4,d5e4,r1bqk2r/ppp5/2n2n1p/2P1p1p1/3Ppp2/P1PQ1P1P/6PB/R3KBNR w KQkq - 0 15,"16...Qxd4 is better, since White is probably obliged to exchange Queens, but I feel like the momentum is with me..."
29,fxe4,f3e4,r1bqk2r/ppp5/2n2n1p/2P1p1p1/3PPp2/P1PQ3P/6PB/R3KBNR b KQkq - 0 15,"16...Qxd4 is better, since White is probably obliged to exchange Queens, but I feel like the momentum is with me..."

33,Rd1,a1d1,r1bqk2r/ppp5/5n1p/2P3p1/3nPp2/P2Q3P/6PB/3RKBNR b Kkq - 1 17,"White can accomplish what he wants to accomplish by castling Q-side, but probably didn't fancy all that space. In the end, his centrally placed King was his undoing. Curiously, I hadn't even spotted this, which rather forces me back..."
