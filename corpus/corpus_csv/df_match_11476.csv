1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I choose the Scandanavian, which is a favorite of mine. I find that the resulting pawn chain and knight placement are positive for black, and I play it a lot vs. 1.e4 players."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I choose the Scandanavian, which is a favorite of mine. I find that the resulting pawn chain and knight placement are positive for black, and I play it a lot vs. 1.e4 players."
3,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"White accepts, with the usual thought of trying to maintain initiative and tempo."
4,Qxd5,d8d5,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Maintaining material balance.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"Developing, while chasing the queen. All pretty standard so far, and I've seen it a million times."
6,Qa5,d5a5,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/q7/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"A very standard response. With the queen on a5, I plan on playing an eventual c6 to create an escape alley for her to retreat down, all the while bolstering the center. I envision playing Bg4 after white's Nf3, and I plan on knights posted on d7 and f6, and castling short."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/q7/8/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 4,"Interposing the pin, and preparing to castle."
8,Bg4,c8g4,rn2kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/q7/6b1/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 4 5,"Interposing the pin, and preparing to castle."
9,Be2,f1e2,rn2kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/q7/6b1/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 5 5,"Interposing the pin, and preparing to castle."
10,Nf6,g8f6,rn2kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/q7/6b1/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 6 6,"I was a little surprised here, as I would have expected d3 or even b3. My choices now are either developing my dark squared bishop, or ensuring my queen's long term safety."
11,O-O,e1g1,rn2kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/q7/6b1/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 7 6,"I was a little surprised here, as I would have expected d3 or even b3. My choices now are either developing my dark squared bishop, or ensuring my queen's long term safety."
12,e6,e7e6,rn2kb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/q7/6b1/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,"I was a little surprised here, as I would have expected d3 or even b3. My choices now are either developing my dark squared bishop, or ensuring my queen's long term safety."

15,b4,b2b4,rn2kb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/q7/1P4b1/P1N2N2/2PPBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,"? A big mistake.  Black can now grab a pawn while freely developing to a pretty good square. Obviously, white cannot grab the bishop for fear of losing a rook."
16,Bxb4,f8b4,rn2k2r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/q7/1b4b1/P1N2N2/2PPBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 9,"While now a pawn down, this is a good developing move as white is seeking control of this long diagonal and possibly even considering BxN which would damage a king's potentially castled position."
17,Bb2,c1b2,rn2k2r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/q7/1b4b1/P1N2N2/1BPPBPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 1 9,"While now a pawn down, this is a good developing move as white is seeking control of this long diagonal and possibly even considering BxN which would damage a king's potentially castled position."

19,h3,h2h3,rn2k2r/pp2bppp/2p1pn2/q7/6b1/P1N2N1P/1BPPBPP1/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 10,"Had this move been made earlier and I had not won a pawn already, I would have played BxN (a position I have been in numerous times). However, now up a pawn, I retreat and try to keep every advantage I have."
20,Bh5,g4h5,rn2k2r/pp2bppp/2p1pn2/q6b/8/P1N2N1P/1BPPBPP1/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 1 11,"White starts seriously slugging. While this move weakens his castled position, it is very aggressive and shows me that this guy is not scared of me at all. My compliments."
21,g4,g2g4,rn2k2r/pp2bppp/2p1pn2/q6b/6P1/P1N2N1P/1BPPBP2/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 11,"White starts seriously slugging. While this move weakens his castled position, it is very aggressive and shows me that this guy is not scared of me at all. My compliments."

27,Nb3,d4b3,r4rk1/pp1nbppp/2p1pnb1/q7/6P1/PNNP3P/1BP1BP2/R2Q1RK1 b - - 4 14,"As I was intending to play Qc7 or Qd8 anyway, this move didn't scare me."
28,Qc7,a5c7,r4rk1/ppqnbppp/2p1pnb1/8/6P1/PNNP3P/1BP1BP2/R2Q1RK1 w - - 5 15,"Getting a rook to a half open file, which is good."
