1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone! I am playing against dmaestro in this game - do not be fooled by that low rating by his name, but remember, his optimum rating is 1730 so he is not to be underestimated.  He played very well right up until the end and a slip up cost him two pawns.  There was an interesting material imbalance.  Dmaestro had a rook + pawn against B + Knight.  Here is how the drama unfolds.  Firstly dmaestro kicks off with d4 and I decide to experiment with the Englund gambit with e5."
