1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This opening is called the center counter defense or the scandinavian defense. The idea for black is to avoid White getting a strong center. The drawback for black is how to answear, when/if White simple takes the pawn. If black for instance tries to recapture with the queen, he will a lose a tempo, if white replies with Nc6."

As filippus kindly pointed out for me, after 8...Bxf6, 9. Bxf6, Black cant take the unprotected c-pawn with the Knight as White can play Qa4  or Bxb7 winning material...
Howevever, as we shall see, White overlooked this fact."
16,c6,c7c6,rn1qk2r/pp2ppbp/1np3p1/8/2PP2b1/2N1BN2/PP2BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 9,"I think castling or Nc6 would have been stronger and more natural. Black must keep up in ""the develop-race"".
But the pupose of this move is clear: W. can no longer respond with Qa4  or Bxb7(as the c6-pawn is blocking), after 8....Bxf6, 9. Bxf6. So W is now forced to recapture with the g-pawn if he wants to keep his c-pawn..."
