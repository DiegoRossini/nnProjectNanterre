1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"After learning 1. e4 opening, Now a day i am practicing queens Pawn opening with several variation. So 1. d4"
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,He stuck directly in the center that is ok but little bit unusual for me because when i open with d4 the usual response of maximum player here is Nf6.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,So i play queens Gambit.
4,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,gambit decline and a perfect response with c6. The other option may be defend d5 with Nf6.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,I continue developing and putting pressure on d5.
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,So the he continue developing and defending d5 with Nf6.
7,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 3 4,whenever opportunity comes I am always happy to pin the knight (BTW it is still not pinned against black queen due to e7 pawn) rather than develop any of bishop on f4 or c4.
8,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"So he add another defender to d5 if in case his knight at f6 fall. Although, I never want an exchange of bishop with Knight at f6 or c6 unless it is forced or make opponent position week after exchange."
9,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"With e3 i an now able to develop my lsb but i will be very cautious to loss of tempo in this variation. Particularly, after development of bishop at d3 black just take c4 pawn to force me to regain material equality but lose tempo."
10,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,He continues developing. This is another move i like to play if opportunity comes as connected knight are very good combo.
11,Qc2,d1c2,r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N1P3/PPQ2PPP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 2 6,"Qc2!!!!. at the time of making this move my main purpose to confuse my opponent and guessing his intent of attack. See, not a single piece of king side out from the hut. They are still sleeping."
12,Qa5,d8a5,r1b1kb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/q2p2B1/2PP4/2N1P3/PPQ2PPP/R3KBNR w KQkq - 3 7,"after black response of Qa5,  i realize Qc2 is an inaccuracy because black intent is clear to use pin of my knight at c3 and exploit my queen side."
13,a3,a2a3,r1b1kb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/q2p2B1/2PP4/P1N1P3/1PQ2PPP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 0 7,oops!!! another inaccuracy as suggest by post game computer analysis at chess.com. Analysis suggest a better line as  (7. Nf3 7... Bb4 8. Bxf6 8... Nxf6 9. Bd3 9... dxc4 10. Bxc4 10... Nd5 11. Bxd5 11... exd5)
14,Ne4,f6e4,r1b1kb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1p3/q2p2B1/2PPn3/P1N1P3/1PQ2PPP/R3KBNR w KQkq - 1 8,of course wtih Ne4 black start to multi threaten me as i also do something to my dsb at d5.
15,Bf4,g5f4,r1b1kb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1p3/q2p4/2PPnB2/P1N1P3/1PQ2PPP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 2 8,SO i just move to a safer place.

19,f3,f2f3,r1b1k2r/pp2bppp/2p1pn2/q2p4/2PPnB2/P1NBPP2/1PQ3PP/R3K1NR b KQkq - 0 10,Where my common sense goes and why not my favorite Ne2. Computer analysis rated this as a mistake.
20,Nxc3,e4c3,r1b1k2r/pp2bppp/2p1pn2/q2p4/2PP1B2/P1nBPP2/1PQ3PP/R3K1NR w KQkq - 0 11,he takes
