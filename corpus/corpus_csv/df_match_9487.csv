14,Nxe4,f6e4,r3kb1r/p1ppqppp/b1p5/4N3/3PnB2/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 8,Little if anything is gained by the a4 push.  White should have used this opportunity to develop the knight on b1 or perhaps push the b pawn to b3 in preparation to c4 which would allow the castle.  White would then have a strong center.  This move allows black to continue the attack.

The attack on the b pawn is easily defended and in fact allows white to make the good move.  Re8 would be much better with white not being able to defend the pawn on e5 and allowing black the ability to centralize his rook.
