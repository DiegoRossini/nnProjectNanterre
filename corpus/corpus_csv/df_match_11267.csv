2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Ah Philidore. Creates an early strong point at e5. This is not exceptable to me. I wish to open the game and complicate with tactics! White will counter attack this without delay!

Paul morphy played against this, one of my favorite games. black played Bg4 here, but the pin doesn't help black. 3...Bg4 4. de Bxf3 5. Qxf3 de 6. Bc4! Nf6 7. Qb3! hitting the f7 pawn and b7 pawn. Morphy plays a knight sac and wins the game!!"
6,d5,d6d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,this seems dubius. and a wasted tempo to move it twice.

28,Na5,c6a5,3rk2r/ppp2ppp/8/n1qB4/3pP3/5P1P/PPPQ1P2/2KR2R1 w k - 6 15,?! I thought Nb4 was strong here. hitting a2 and forcing a pawn move. perhaps he is hoping for Qxd4 c7! and the bishop is lost due to the pin. or else feared Bxb7. yes Nb4 would hit the bishop on d5 winning a pawn as well as causing my king protection to move. I would not have time to take b7.
