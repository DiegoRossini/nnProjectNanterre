1,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/2N5/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 1,"This seems to be called either the ""van Geet"", after a Dutch International Master, or the ""Dunst"" opening after a New York master.  It's a flexible opening that allows quite a few transpositions, but is less popular than some due to the possibility of black playing d5-d4, forcing the knight to move."

I decide to offer a bishop trade in the hopes of opening the f file for my rook while removing the hated bishop.  I marked this as interesting, not so much because of the individual move itself, but rather the idea behind it."

This forces me to use pieces to defend both e pawns, emphasizing the problem with doubled pawns.

Nd5 or Nd7 followed by Bg5 or Bh4 may have been better here.  I intended to force white's knight to move with e4, but went about it badly and almost got myself into trouble."

Closes the b8-h2 diagonal and makes my bishop look a little foolish.  On the other hand, it opens the d4 square and the a7-g1 diagonal.  White should probably open the game, but I believe he was still eyeing my pawns and this traps the pawn on e5."

Doubling rooks was my goal, but with the knight on g5, this was the wrong time to do it."
