8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"Trusting an opening database here.  This type of opening, where a weak square is created between two advanced pawns seems strange to me.  But the databases show decent success.  A trade off of strong influence over the opponent's 4th rank and some mobility for some weakness behind the advanced pawns.  white's lsb doesn't look great here either.  some hinderances for black. +++++ looking back from the end of the game, black does make very good use of the d4 square, his N and his B both making key stops there!  this opening might lead to success.  But it looks like I need to learn to play it correctly, ...adequate guarding of d4 being critical!"

I did observe here that my lsb was partly bad.   It has a long diagonal but is cut off from half of the board.  probably a factor in Ion not playing NxB, this B not presenting a threat.  I on the other hand would have been happy for that exchange, active N for semi-bad B.  I also observed here that my potentially pinned N was a potential liability.  As it turns out that does cause trouble.  Note that occupation of d4 traces back to 6. c4."
