1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Before this game, I was 2-2 vs. Will.  I rely heavily on attacking and position play; Will seems to play from position and combinations.  I wanted to play a Queen-side game because the wider King-side often leads me into sloppy attacks."

I'm not sure of the exact continuation from here, but White's next three moves are 7. O-O, 8. Ne2, 9. Qa4 eventually winning the bishop.  I established a strong position, and then lost the game later by moving e5, unblocking the bishop.  Game was eventually called a draw about seven moves later after Will failed to find the mate.  He had mate in 2 plus some garbage stall moves by White."
