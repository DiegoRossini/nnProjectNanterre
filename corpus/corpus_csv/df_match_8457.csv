1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Usually, the response is Nc6. But swindon went for the Petroff Defense. Otherwise known as the 'Russian Game'. Black is simply trying to keep things equal and nullify the advantage of White's first move and achieve simple equality."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Usually, the response is Nc6. But swindon went for the Petroff Defense. Otherwise known as the 'Russian Game'.

5,Nxe5,f3e5,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"Usually, the best move for black here was d6. Nxe4(?!) as the old trap here is possible."
6,Nxe4,f6e4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4N3/4n3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Usually, the best move for black here was d6. Nxe4(?!) as the old trap here is possible."
7,Qe2,d1e2,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4N3/4n3/8/PPPPQPPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"Qe2 is the normal response to Nxe4, hoping that black is silly enough to do 4...Nf3 5.Nc6!! when  white wins black's queen due to the discovered check from the queen."
8,Qe7,d8e7,rnb1kb1r/ppppqppp/8/4N3/4n3/8/PPPPQPPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 2 5,"Qe7(!?) black trying to keep the game as symmetrical as possible. I find that in general, the Petroff Defense is played by those who don't mind drawing as black. If you are in a must-win situation, this opening would not be a good choice. Just in-case you wanted to know so far is the position American Champion Frank Marshall had, who liked to play for the win as black. However, if white plays d3 white has what few chances there are."
9,Qxe4,e2e4,rnb1kb1r/ppppqppp/8/4N3/4Q3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"Qxe4 (!?) Well, i thought i should might as well take the knight so i'm a whole piece up so early in the game. Only downside of this is that the knight is pinned due to the black queen."
10,d6,d7d6,rnb1kb1r/ppp1qppp/3p4/4N3/4Q3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Obviously trying to get rid of the knight, which becomes en prise from the pawn."
11,d4,d2d4,rnb1kb1r/ppp1qppp/3p4/4N3/3PQ3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 6,d4 just keeps the knight feeling a bit safer and gains more control in the center of the board.
12,dxe5,d6e5,rnb1kb1r/ppp1qppp/8/4p3/3PQ3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"Exchange helps white to win a piece back, though still a pawn down, with no central pawns."
13,dxe5,d4e5,rnb1kb1r/ppp1qppp/8/4P3/4Q3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"Exchange helps white to win a piece back, though still a pawn down, with no central pawns."
14,Qb4+,e7b4,rnb1kb1r/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/1q2Q3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 1 8,Qb4+ is there really any point to exchange queens off right now? I don't think so.
15,Qxb4,e4b4,rnb1kb1r/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/1Q6/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 8,I exchanged queens off as i am a pawn up and i was forced to or i would have lost my queen.
16,Bxb4+,f8b4,rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/1b6/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 9,I exchanged queens off as i am a pawn up and i was forced to or i would have lost my queen.
17,Bd2,c1d2,rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/1b6/8/PPPB1PPP/RN2KB1R b KQkq - 1 9,Black retreats his bishop to c5 to try an attack on f2.
18,Bc5,b4c5,rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/8/2b1P3/8/8/PPPB1PPP/RN2KB1R w KQkq - 2 10,Black retreats his bishop to c5 to try an attack on f2.
19,f4,f2f4,rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/8/2b1P3/5P2/8/PPPB2PP/RN2KB1R b KQkq - 0 10,"I feel this is the obvious move,  getting rid of the threat, and beefing up the e5 pawn. White has complete control in the center."
20,Bd4,c5d4,rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/3b1P2/8/PPPB2PP/RN2KB1R w KQkq - 1 11,"Black bishop attempts an attack on b2, which is very easy to spot."
21,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/3b1P2/2N5/PPPB2PP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 2 11,"Bd4 just helps white really with Nc3, helping white to develop. White has now 4 pieces out on the board (Nc3,Bd2,e5,f4) while Black has only his bishop on d4. However, i think the b6-g1 diagonal, is quite a nice one for it."
22,Bxc3,d4c3,rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/5P2/2b5/PPPB2PP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 12,Bxc3? Why get rid of your only active piece which is in a nice position for a not-as-well-placed knight? Black has just got rid of his ONLY active piece!
23,Bxc3,d2c3,rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/5P2/2B5/PPP3PP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 12,The exchange puts me into a brilliant position.
24,O-O,e8g8,rnb2rk1/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/5P2/2B5/PPP3PP/R3KB1R w KQ - 1 13,Castles to get his king out of danger.
25,O-O-O,e1c1,rnb2rk1/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/5P2/2B5/PPP3PP/2KR1B1R b - - 2 13,I queenside castle to get my rook onto an open file. You might have heard that opposite side castling has an aggressive game to come.  Find out more about opposite side castling in 'The Art of Attack' by Keres and Kotov (a classic little book).  That book gives a fine discussion of opposite castling.
26,Nc6,b8c6,r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/2n5/4P3/5P2/2B5/PPP3PP/2KR1B1R w - - 3 14,Black begins to get his pieces involved...
27,Bc4,f1c4,r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/2n5/4P3/2B2P2/2B5/PPP3PP/2KR3R b - - 4 14,...and so do I. I should of actually tried to exchange the knight off though.
