1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"I often play Tag (our team Cap'n) under the ruse that I have some superior skill level.  Troop on our team suggested a rule #7 to improve your rating by playing Cap'n Tag, so I invoked the rule.  I don't really believe it, but  is fun to get in his head like this."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,"Tag opens with nf3, an opening i don't particularly like , I ignore this move (as I do many moves I shouldn't ignore) and just push to d5"
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,"he opens his queenside and attacks, I don't like the trade here"
4,d4,d5d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2Pp4/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,so I push
5,d3,d2d3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2Pp4/3P1N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"he opens up the black bishop for some reason,  the king side seems real srtong and I have no pieces developed."
6,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2p5/2Pp4/3P1N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,I really don't like my pawn hanging out there by itself in the middle.  the only support would seem to overdevelop the queen .
7,g3,g2g3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2p5/2Pp4/3P1NP1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"ok,  so now he starts to develop the white bishop it would appear,  I still have nothing going"
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/2p5/2Pp4/3P1NP1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"I don't like the idea of him going Bg2 and basically freezing my white bishop so I defend by blocking with the knight, I still don't like the lack of development on my king side."
9,Bg2,f1g2,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/2p5/2Pp4/3P1NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 5,"he does the anticipated move, maybe giving me a slight chance to recapture some tempo (whatever the f*** that is)"
10,e5,e7e5,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n5/2p1p3/2Pp4/3P1NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"I thought about Nf6 but wanted to open up my black bishop towards the middle, maybe not the best move, but I did it anyway"
11,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n5/2p1p1B1/2Pp4/3P1NP1/PP2PPBP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"Wow, this comes as a total surprise....."
12,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk1nr/pp2bppp/2n5/2p1p1B1/2Pp4/3P1NP1/PP2PPBP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 2 7,"not exactly the way I wanted to clear out my kingside castle, but I hate the fact that he has his bishop there."
13,Bxe7,g5e7,r1bqk1nr/pp2Bppp/2n5/2p1p3/2Pp4/3P1NP1/PP2PPBP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 0 7,we swap
14,Ngxe7,g8e7,r1bqk2r/pp2nppp/2n5/2p1p3/2Pp4/3P1NP1/PP2PPBP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 8,I take with the N to make it possible for me to castle
15,Nbd2,b1d2,r1bqk2r/pp2nppp/2n5/2p1p3/2Pp4/3P1NP1/PP1NPPBP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 8,I don't know what he is doing so ... I figure I will do something stupid I guess
16,Be6,c8e6,r2qk2r/pp2nppp/2n1b3/2p1p3/2Pp4/3P1NP1/PP1NPPBP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 9,I really should have castled then I think. but my kingside is now strong
17,O-O,e1g1,r2qk2r/pp2nppp/2n1b3/2p1p3/2Pp4/3P1NP1/PP1NPPBP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 3 9,he finally castles
18,h6,h7h6,r2qk2r/pp2npp1/2n1b2p/2p1p3/2Pp4/3P1NP1/PP1NPPBP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 10,"I didn't want him to Ng5 to attack my bishop, so I pushed here istead of castling"
19,Nh4,f3h4,r2qk2r/pp2npp1/2n1b2p/2p1p3/2Pp3N/3P2P1/PP1NPPBP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 1 10,"to me,  this was a weird time for him to do this,  I really didn't give a rip about the bishop for Knight swap, so I FINALLY castle"
20,O-O,e8g8,r2q1rk1/pp2npp1/2n1b2p/2p1p3/2Pp3N/3P2P1/PP1NPPBP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 2 11,whew  safe at last.
