1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

I looked at this little brevity from jkarp, who managed to reach 1200 today - although he has dropped back I think he is on an upward curve.  However, the Master Mater has still shown his opponents that no king is ever safe against him and if they do not watch out they are gonna get Freddied! Sadly King Joe met this fate after less than 15 moves.  Master Freddy is truly back with a vengeance!"
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"2. ..... d5 - Freddy plays the Centre Counter or Scandinavian Defense.  The BQ will end up being chased around the board but beware - she may well find a nice little niche - as she does in the hands of a player like Freddy, sigh and double sigh!"
3,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,2. .... Nf6 - Freddy decided to develop a piece rather than immediately recapture on d5.

9,Nf3,g1f3,rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,6. Bd3 - not sure that blocking in your dsb is a good idea here.  Joe - you need to get your pieces on to decent squares pretty quick or Freddy will dominate you big time!

He goes for the quick death and Freddy commits regicide on the next move.  Well, I am down to play him in a best of two in my Welcome MT Part 3.  I just hope I can do enough to avoid letting him 'ave 'me 'enry and making me a right damsel in distress, but we shall see!"
