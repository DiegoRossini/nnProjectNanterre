1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game features a pleasing rook sac. In my analysis during the game, I thought it would lead to a level endgame, but I was equally convinced that Jim, my opponent would not find his way through the complications, and would lose. I was delighted to be proved right, and equally delighted that post-match analysis showed that the sacrifice didn't actually lead to a level ending, but in fact won in all variations."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,So standard Sicilian

4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,And so do I
5,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,He opts for the open variation
6,cxd4,c5d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,Black more-or-less has to take
7,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,And he recaptures rather than gambit with c3
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,I put pressure on the e pawn.
9,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,He defends in the best way

11,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,He plays the Richter-Rauzer Attack
12,e6,e7e6,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2nppn2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,and I continue with the most popular

15,O-O-O,e1c1,r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1nppn2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPPQ1PPP/2KR1B1R b kq - 1 8,Jim castles

18,b5,b7b5,r2qkb1r/3b1ppp/p1nppn2/1p4B1/3NP3/P1N5/1PPQ1PPP/2KR1B1R w kq - 0 10,So I continue with the thematic queen side expansion.
