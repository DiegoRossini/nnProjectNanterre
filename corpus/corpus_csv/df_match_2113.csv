1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Ok I'll play the waiting game and see how white wants to progress with his d4 opening.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,Ok I'll play the waiting game and see how white wants to progress with his d4 opening.
3,f3,f2f3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/5P2/PPP1P1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,I admit I had to look up what this opening was called. Apparently the Paleface Gambit...so I guess I'm the natives then looking to break through the circle of wagons.
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/3P4/5P2/PPP1P1PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"I'll carry on with a King's Indian sort of defense, no offence but against a Paleface gambit in retrospect it seemed rather appropriate."
5,Bf4,c1f4,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/3P1B2/5P2/PPP1P1PP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,Bishop development but attacking my c7 square...
6,d6,d7d6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3P1B2/5P2/PPP1P1PP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,....so best way to defend for now and allow development of my opposing bishop
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3P1B2/2N2P2/PPP1P1PP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,I complete the classic King's Indian opening putting my bishop of g7.
8,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3P1B2/2N2P2/PPP1P1PP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 2 5,I complete the classic King's Indian opening putting my bishop of g7.
9,e4,e2e4,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PPB2/2N2P2/PPP3PP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,Taking the centre with his pawns but my knight on f6 is not too worried as there are still options for his to flee and attack against advance to e5
10,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk2r/ppp1ppbp/2np1np1/8/3PPB2/2N2P2/PPP3PP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,So I just bring my second knight out to apply more pressure on the middle of the board
11,Nd5,c3d5,r1bqk2r/ppp1ppbp/2np1np1/3N4/3PPB2/5P2/PPP3PP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 2 6,Bit early for white to move this knight ahead of the advanced pawns!
12,Nxd5,f6d5,r1bqk2r/ppp1ppbp/2np2p1/3n4/3PPB2/5P2/PPP3PP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,"So I'll exchange off, double the pawns at least for a brief moment."
13,exd5,e4d5,r1bqk2r/ppp1ppbp/2np2p1/3P4/3P1B2/5P2/PPP3PP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 7,May as well isolate the d5 pawn as only the queen was protecting it as I disclosed a second piece attacking the backward of the doubled pawns.
14,Nxd4,c6d4,r1bqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p2p1/3P4/3n1B2/5P2/PPP3PP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 8,May as well isolate the d5 pawn as only the queen was protecting it as I disclosed a second piece attacking the backward of the doubled pawns.
15,c3,c2c3,r1bqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p2p1/3P4/3n1B2/2P2P2/PP4PP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 8,"More or less forced to chase my knight away as ...Bc5, ...Nxc2 would have caused issues. Ne2 from white would not have taken away that threat."
16,Nf5,d4f5,r1bqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p2p1/3P1n2/5B2/2P2P2/PP4PP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 1 9,Keeping my knight in the centre of the board
17,Qe2,d1e2,r1bqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p2p1/3P1n2/5B2/2P2P2/PP2Q1PP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 2 9,Only reason I can think for this move now is that he was worried I'd play Ne3 immediately which was not my intention.
18,b6,b7b6,r1bqk2r/p1p1ppbp/1p1p2p1/3P1n2/5B2/2P2P2/PP2Q1PP/R3KBNR w KQkq - 0 10,Potential to pin his queen with my white bishop after a5
19,O-O-O,e1c1,r1bqk2r/p1p1ppbp/1p1p2p1/3P1n2/5B2/2P2P2/PP2Q1PP/2KR1BNR b kq - 1 10,Castling queen side but after the c3 move to force my knight away unto an already weakened side of the board that I will seek to exploit later.
20,a5,a7a5,r1bqk2r/2p1ppbp/1p1p2p1/p2P1n2/5B2/2P2P2/PP2Q1PP/2KR1BNR w kq - 0 11,There's the a5 move to threaten the pin
21,Qd2,e2d2,r1bqk2r/2p1ppbp/1p1p2p1/p2P1n2/5B2/2P2P2/PP1Q2PP/2KR1BNR b kq - 1 11,White is scared of it and moves off his queen off the diagonal.
22,Bd7,c8d7,r2qk2r/2pbppbp/1p1p2p1/p2P1n2/5B2/2P2P2/PP1Q2PP/2KR1BNR w kq - 2 12,Give my bishop options to go whichever side of the board he will be needed.
23,Nh3,g1h3,r2qk2r/2pbppbp/1p1p2p1/p2P1n2/5B2/2P2P1N/PP1Q2PP/2KR1B1R b kq - 3 12,Would have though N32 would have been better for white as it give him more options while still protecting the bishop. Here it has only one advancement opportunity which can be repelled by a pawn move.
