12,e5,e7e5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2np1n2/4p3/3NP3/2N2P2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,So I strike out in the centre.
13,Nb3,d4b3,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2np1n2/4p3/4P3/1NN2P2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 7,Knight retreats.
14,Be6,c8e6,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/2npbn2/4p3/4P3/1NN2P2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 8,I prevent him from playing 8. Bc4

After the game we looked at this position on Fritz and it seems black can just give up his weak d pawn with 0-0 and have compensation in better development. Later still I saw that in this position 11....0-0 was played in Rodriguez, Andres (2475) vs. Scarella, Enrique Alejandro (2380)	which ended in a draw http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=x698505&fb=1&mv=21&rnd=0.19866226531272724"
