16,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2n1p3/3pPn2/3P4/3BBN2/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 3 9,Master move alert! Finish developing before kick starting exchanges in the centre.
17,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2n1p3/3pPn2/3P4/2NBBN2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 4 9,Even though I have completed half my development this seemed to be the best moment to exchange as moves like ...Bd7 or ...Qb6 did not seem to be as forcible as the text move. I.E it creates a weakness

27,b4,b2b4,2rq1rk1/1p1bbppp/p1n1p3/3pP3/1P1P4/P1NBPN2/6PP/2RQ1RK1 b - - 0 14,white has good pressure on b5 so it is important that I take care of the weakness. Besides clearing the c-file for my rook it does prevent the immediate b4-b5. The trade off is that I have a poor knight.
28,Na7,c6a7,2rq1rk1/np1bbppp/p3p3/3pP3/1P1P4/P1NBPN2/6PP/2RQ1RK1 w - - 1 15,white has good pressure on b5 so it is important that I take care of the weakness. Besides clearing the c-file for my rook it does prevent the immediate b4-b5. The trade off is that I have a poor knight.

33,Kh1,g1h1,2rq1rk1/np1b1ppp/p3p2b/3pP3/1P1P4/PQNBPN2/6PP/2R1R2K b - - 6 17,dodging any business on e3.

35,Qb1,b3b1,2rq1rk1/np1b1p1p/p3p1pb/3pP3/1P1P4/P1NBPN2/6PP/1QR1R2K b - - 1 18,The rook takes the lead on attacking white's other weakness on c3.

My goal is to slowly improve my piece development without creating further weakness in my position. While at the same time hoping for white to overextend himself somehow.
38,Qc7,d8c7,5rk1/npqb1p1p/p1r1p1pb/3pP3/1P1P4/P1NBPN2/1Q4PP/2R1R2K w - - 4 20,White so far has managed to maintain the balance in the position but things are about to change quickly.
