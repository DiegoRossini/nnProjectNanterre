1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,So it started pretty conventionally...
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Unusual move. Anyway, I went with my usual..."

5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P1B2/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 3 3,"Unusual move. Anyway, I went with my usual..."
6,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bqkb1r/pppnpppp/5n2/3p4/3P1B2/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 4 4,"Unusual move. Anyway, I went with my usual..."

9,e4,e2e4,r1bqkb1r/pppn1ppp/4pn2/3p4/3PPB2/5N2/PPPN1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,...and tried this one.
10,dxe4,d5e4,r1bqkb1r/pppn1ppp/4pn2/8/3PpB2/5N2/PPPN1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Better for black was to take with the N first, so if I wanted to recover the pawn in a Budapestian way (Ng5), he would have had f5. This allows Qh5+, so... you know. Looking for troubles, as always..."
11,Ng5,f3g5,r1bqkb1r/pppn1ppp/4pn2/6N1/3PpB2/8/PPPN1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"...not allowing this,"
12,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/pppnbppp/4pn2/6N1/3PpB2/8/PPPN1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 7,"Maybe not the best, but I couldn't find anything better. I'm not threatening anything, though."

14,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pppnbppp/4pn2/8/3PNB2/8/PPPN1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 1 8,"Now I do. My opponent thought for a good while, and played..."
15,g4,g2g4,r1bq1rk1/pppnbppp/4pn2/8/3PNBP1/8/PPPN1P1P/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 8,"Now I do. My opponent thought for a good while, and played..."
16,b6,b7b6,r1bq1rk1/p1pnbppp/1p2pn2/8/3PNBP1/8/PPPN1P1P/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 9,! Now it's up to me how to lead the attack without being too much bothered by his lsb. So...
17,Rg1,h1g1,r1bq1rk1/p1pnbppp/1p2pn2/8/3PNBP1/8/PPPN1P1P/R2QKBR1 b Q - 1 9,Thinking in supporting g5.
18,Bb7,c8b7,r2q1rk1/pbpnbppp/1p2pn2/8/3PNBP1/8/PPPN1P1P/R2QKBR1 w Q - 2 10,"Eyeing h7, of course, more than defending the N."

23,Nxe4,d2e4,r2q1rk1/pb1nbppp/1p2p3/2p3P1/3PNB2/3B4/PPP2P1P/R2QK1R1 b Q - 0 12,"!? Now, c4 seems to win a piece, but Nf6+, and maybe, just maybe, white has some compensation with tricks on the black's K."
24,cxd4,c5d4,r2q1rk1/pb1nbppp/1p2p3/6P1/3pNB2/3B4/PPP2P1P/R2QK1R1 w Q - 0 13,My opponent preferred to walk the soft way. Good for me... maybe.
25,Qh5,d1h5,r2q1rk1/pb1nbppp/1p2p3/6PQ/3pNB2/3B4/PPP2P1P/R3K1R1 b Q - 1 13,"Let's make him move those pawns. I have both B, I will get return for any pawn move."
26,e5,e6e5,r2q1rk1/pb1nbppp/1p6/4p1PQ/3pNB2/3B4/PPP2P1P/R3K1R1 w Q - 0 14,"I thought that this was the classic ""tactic trainer"" position, and I thought that..."
27,Nf6+,e4f6,r2q1rk1/pb1nbppp/1p3N2/4p1PQ/3p1B2/3B4/PPP2P1P/R3K1R1 b Q - 1 14,...would have given me the win.
28,Nxf6,d7f6,r2q1rk1/pb2bppp/1p3n2/4p1PQ/3p1B2/3B4/PPP2P1P/R3K1R1 w Q - 0 15,"...in fact, the only thing is that I recover the piece, but black's central pawns will be a headache."
29,gxf6,g5f6,r2q1rk1/pb2bppp/1p3P2/4p2Q/3p1B2/3B4/PPP2P1P/R3K1R1 b Q - 0 15,"...in fact, the only thing is that I recover the piece, but black's central pawns will be a headache."
