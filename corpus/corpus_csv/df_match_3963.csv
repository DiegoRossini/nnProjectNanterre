1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I had a trio of games with this opponent. The first one I made a physical error around the 15th move and moved the wrong pawn (i seem to come up with a lot of different ways to lose a chess game.) The second game I won but only because he hung his bishop. I think it bothered him as near the end of that game he challenged me to a third game which is the one I'm annotating here. It was my best game of the three. I'm currently learning some new openings. The English Defense and her cousin the Nimzo-Larsen Attack. This is an English defense...Please forgive my annotations. I am a very self-absorbed person and focus on the things that are going on in my own head during a game. I'm sure my opponents would have their own slant on things. A chess game is a fight, a war and a drama that unfolds on a 64 square field where we are the kings and the masters of our own fate."

3,Bf4,c1f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3P1B2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"7beaufeet7, my opponent likes the London System of developing his pieces. I'm also learning that system as well so I'm familiar with what he is trying to do here."
4,b6,b7b6,rnbqkbnr/p1pp1ppp/1p2p3/8/3P1B2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,The English Defense like the Nimzo-Larsen involves fianchettoing the queen bishop.
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/p1pp1ppp/1p2p3/8/3P1B2/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,Welcome to the English Defense.
6,Bb7,c8b7,rn1qkbnr/pbpp1ppp/1p2p3/8/3P1B2/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,Welcome to the English Defense.
7,e3,e2e3,rn1qkbnr/pbpp1ppp/1p2p3/8/3P1B2/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,7beaufeet7 continues with his London style development which usually entails developing his pieces within a solid pawn structure. This tells me that he is more of a counter attacker like myself but in this game I become uncharacteristically aggressive.
8,f5,f7f5,rn1qkbnr/pbpp2pp/1p2p3/5p2/3P1B2/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,I strike out at the center. I'm trying to take control of the E4 square.
9,Be2,f1e2,rn1qkbnr/pbpp2pp/1p2p3/5p2/3P1B2/4PN2/PPP1BPPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 1 5,We continue to develop our pieces.
10,Nf6,g8f6,rn1qkb1r/pbpp2pp/1p2pn2/5p2/3P1B2/4PN2/PPP1BPPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 2 6,We continue to develop our pieces.

This move looks awkward but in replaying several master games of this defense I came upon this move being made again and again. I think it is just within the nature of this opening.

20,Rc8,a8c8,2rq1rk1/pb1p2pp/np1ppn2/5p2/3P4/4PN1P/PPP1BPP1/RN1Q1RK1 w - - 4 11,I grab the half open file with my rook which is also nicely protected by my bishop.

My pawn structure in the center reminds me of a piece of DNA, I liken it to a corkscrew. I'm going to attack White's pawn structure in waves of pawn advances. Notice both my rooks are on the half opened files vacated by my pawns."
