On a side note, this is how I usually play against my brothers.  I will let him put his own pieces in poor positions and then he ends up blocking his own pieces from having any kind of attacking or defending power.  This is a great skill to learn and chess and can be used at various levels.  However, I have found it more difficult to do this type of thing to very good players of course."
