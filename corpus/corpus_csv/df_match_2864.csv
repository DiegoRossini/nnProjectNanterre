1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi all, I've got a very fun game between chicoboy and I to show off from early this month. This is the closest he's come to beating me yet, and let me tell you, it was close indeed!"
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I've been playing the Latvian Gambit exclusively in these games. Gerhard has been getting much better at thwarting it. I'm not going to give the opening itself a lot of detail; I have a whole series of annotations on it if you want that.

6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/2n5/4pp2/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,Getting the Knight out and defending e5.
7,Be3,c1e3,r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/2n5/4pp2/4P3/3PBN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,"This isn't necessarily the best place for this Bishop, since it could be easy to chase with f5-f4."
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp2pp/2n2n2/4pp2/4P3/3PBN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 3 5,This is essentially why I think 3.d3 is not ideal for White--his best chances lie in an all-out total war against the Black kingdom. Kudos to White for recognizing that and making the second pawn move.

Rxg2+ 22.Kh1 Rxf2+! 23.Kg1 Rg2+ 24.Kh1 Rg3+ 25.Rf3 Bxf3+ 26.Qxf3 Rxf3 and Black has a fine position, though he's still a little behind."
