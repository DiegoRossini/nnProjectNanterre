Like most of the time I play c5 vs e4; we will see that Sicilians are full of tricks and I will be in a position I do not appreciate a lot but eventually win by a slight white's mistakes."

According to chessdatabes this move leads to white's wins in 66% out of 100 games...I must say I realised how bad it was later on: Egold will set a cental Queen and many possible traps."

13,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/3pp3/8/2BQP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 1 7,Whites are far more developped than blacks and can castle on both sides.

if I play b*f6 he would go for d6 (1 pawn won)
if I play g*f6, my king's side is messed forcing black to play with a central king; not easy to deal with."

With the other line gxf6, I'd keep d6 with a central king and a passive position; whites will eventually win.
=> Realistically, any strong player would have kill the game easily from here."
