1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Mr Kitrich brought his legendary class to the chessboard in what can only be described as a cold, reptilian dispatching of his larger opponent."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,A lazy reply to the English.  The subsequent forcing sequence will leave black behind in development.
3,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3P4/8/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Early though it is, white not only leads in development, but retains considerable scope for transpositions or creativity."
4,Qxd5,d8d5,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Early though it is, white not only leads in development, but retains considerable scope for transpositions or creativity."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"Early though it is, white not only leads in development, but retains considerable scope for transpositions or creativity."
6,Qd8,d5d8,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/8/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"Early though it is, white not only leads in development, but retains considerable scope for transpositions or creativity."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/8/2N2N2/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 4,"Early though it is, white not only leads in development, but retains considerable scope for transpositions or creativity."
8,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/8/2N2N2/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Early though it is, white not only leads in development, but retains considerable scope for transpositions or creativity."
9,d3,d2d3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/8/2NP1N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,Kitrich played the seemingly timid 5.d3 as against the bolder 5.d4.  It is clear white will fianchetto his light-squared bishop.
10,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/1b6/2NP1N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,Predictable play from black.  The pin has no practical implications.
11,g3,g2g3,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/1b6/2NP1NP1/PP2PP1P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"White is now clearly better.  Kitrich enjoys asymmetrical pawn structures.  The dark-squared bishop already looks like a classy piece, with possibilities of Ba3 or Bb2."
12,Bxc3+,b4c3,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/8/2bP1NP1/PP2PP1P/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"White is now clearly better.  Kitrich enjoys asymmetrical pawn structures.  The dark-squared bishop already looks like a classy piece, with possibilities of Ba3 or Bb2."
13,bxc3,b2c3,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/8/2PP1NP1/P3PP1P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"White is now clearly better.  Kitrich enjoys asymmetrical pawn structures.  The dark-squared bishop already looks like a classy piece, with possibilities of Ba3 or Bb2."
14,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/8/8/2PP1NP1/P3PP1P/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,Kitrich did not like 8. Bg5 in light of 8...h6.
15,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/8/8/2PP1NP1/P3PPBP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 8,Kitrich did not like 8. Bg5 in light of 8...h6.
16,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/4pn2/8/8/2PP1NP1/P3PPBP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 3 9,"With 8...0-0, and blacks lack of the dark-squared bishop, the first implications of white's icy attack may be discerned."
17,Bb2,c1b2,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/4pn2/8/8/2PP1NP1/PB2PPBP/R2QK2R b KQ - 4 9,The possibility of an attack along the long diagonal is now apparent.
18,Nc6,b8c6,r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/8/8/2PP1NP1/PB2PPBP/R2QK2R w KQ - 5 10,"Question: did white have any stronger moves here?  Mr Kitrich considers 10. 0-0 to be ""effete""."
19,O-O,e1g1,r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/8/8/2PP1NP1/PB2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 6 10,"Question: did white have any stronger moves here?  Mr Kitrich considers 10. 0-0 to be ""effete""."
20,Bd7,c8d7,r2q1rk1/pppb1ppp/2n1pn2/8/8/2PP1NP1/PB2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 7 11,Where 7...b6 followed by Bb7 may have been stronger.
21,c4,c3c4,r2q1rk1/pppb1ppp/2n1pn2/8/2P5/3P1NP1/PB2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 11,"Question: is 11. c4 strong?  Though it opens the diagonal, does it invite 11...Nb4 or 11...e5?"
22,Qe7,d8e7,r4rk1/pppbqppp/2n1pn2/8/2P5/3P1NP1/PB2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 1 12,The threat of Qa3 does not intimidate.
23,Rb1,a1b1,r4rk1/pppbqppp/2n1pn2/8/2P5/3P1NP1/PB2PPBP/1R1Q1RK1 b - - 2 12,"Kitrich considers this move to be ""unappealing"" and ""quite beside the point""."

26,Rab8,a8b8,1r3rk1/p1pbqppp/1pn1pn2/8/2P5/P2P1NP1/1B2PPBP/1R1Q1RK1 w - - 1 14,"Seemingly preparing b5, but is black better off with 13...e5, solving the problem of the d7 bishop?"
27,Qd2,d1d2,1r3rk1/p1pbqppp/1pn1pn2/8/2P5/P2P1NP1/1B1QPPBP/1R3RK1 b - - 2 14,"White's class begins to announce itself.  Obvious threats of Qc3, followed by an effort to reduce black's f6 knight."
28,Rfd8,f8d8,1r1r2k1/p1pbqppp/1pn1pn2/8/2P5/P2P1NP1/1B1QPPBP/1R3RK1 w - - 3 15,"""This move may not be so bad as it looks,"" said Kitrich, ""but it probably is."""
