1,g4,g2g4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/6P1/8/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

This game came from Dennis Hebblnyck's THEM Tournaments, which are a correspondence chess site which is not related to Gameknot.  This game is THEM27-34 FRITZ GAMBIT (known as The Grob on Gameknot).  My opponent is Guy Shelmerdine.  Because of the involvement in the Club I ended up taking too long over responding to Guy's moves.  Thankfully Guy decided to join Gameknot and we finished our games on Gameknot.  This is the first of a best of two.  I won by 1.5 - 0.5 on aggregate.  So, I kick off with the thematic 1. g4 of which my opponent responds d5 and I play Bg2 and my opponent then takes on g4."

Glenda has been eyeing up the square a4 and has been itching to fork the BK and the bishop on g4.  However, that prelate or the Witch can interpose on d7 and either way the bishop is protected.  However ......"

There is no way for black to play those moves which will avoid being a piece for pawn down.  Now Glenda takes a jump to the left and then six steps to the right and the black prelate on g4 finds himself doing that timewarp in the sky!
