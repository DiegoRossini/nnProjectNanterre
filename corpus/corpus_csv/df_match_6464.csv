1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Turns out like a normal queen's pawn opening...
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Turns out like a normal queen's pawn opening...
3,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"but this move is new to me. Whenever I see 1.d4 I either reply 1...d5, where my opponent always plays the queen's gambit of 2.c4 (as far as I can remember, anyway) or 1...g6, with possible ideas of going into King's Indian Defence lines (though to be honest, I don't have a lot of experience in those lines)"
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,knight development....
5,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/3BP3/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 3,and bishop development. There doesn't seem to be much point in going to b5 - the bishop just looks silly there.
6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3P4/3BP3/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 4,"Opening a path for the dark-square bishop, but blocking the light square bishop - but then again, Black, like White, has nowhere sensible to put it"
7,Nd2,b1d2,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3P4/3BP3/PPPN1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 4,White works on building his Stonewall
8,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/3P4/3BP3/PPPN1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 2 5,"seems a little passive to me, this move... but all these moves are thematic for the tournament so it has to be ok"
9,f4,f2f4,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/3P1P2/3BP3/PPPN2PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,three out of White's four stonewall pawns have been deployed!
10,c5,c7c5,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/4pn2/2pp4/3P1P2/3BP3/PPPN2PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,Black thrusts his own pawns forward...
11,c3,c2c3,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/4pn2/2pp4/3P1P2/2PBP3/PP1N2PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 6,"and here we go! White has now a very strong barrier in the centre of the board. Both sides will now be acting on the wings - White on the kingside, Black on the queenside from what I've seen so far."
12,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/4pn2/2pp4/3P1P2/2PBP3/PP1N2PP/R1BQK1NR w KQ - 1 7,"Funnily enough, although this is still in the thematic moves for the tournament, this isn't considered the best move for Black, as it releases the tension in the centre. Of course, it doesn't mean that Black is lost or else there wouldn't be much point to this mini-tournament :P"
13,Ngf3,g1f3,rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/4pn2/2pp4/3P1P2/2PBPN2/PP1N2PP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 2 7,"Funnily enough, although this is still in the thematic moves for the tournament, this isn't considered the best move for Black, as it releases the tension in the centre. Of course, it doesn't mean that Black is lost or else there wouldn't be much point to this mini-tournament :P"
14,c4,c5c4,rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/4pn2/3p4/2pP1P2/2PBPN2/PP1N2PP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 8,"Funnily enough, although this is still in the thematic moves for the tournament, this isn't considered the best move for Black, as it releases the tension in the centre.

15,Bc2,d3c2,rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/4pn2/3p4/2pP1P2/2P1PN2/PPBN2PP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 1 8,And we have now reached the starting position for The Stone Wall Project.
16,Nc6,b8c6,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/3p4/2pP1P2/2P1PN2/PPBN2PP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 2 9,And we have now reached the starting position for The Stone Wall Project.
17,e4,e3e4,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/3p4/2pPPP2/2P2N2/PPBN2PP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 9,Freddy starts applying a little pressure right away. Black has two choices; take the pawn or leave it. Taking the pawn would bring White's e2 knight out to a more active position...
18,Nd7,f6d7,r1bq1rk1/pp1nbppp/2n1p3/3p4/2pPPP2/2P2N2/PPBN2PP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 1 10,"so I simply leave it. Why this move, though? Because of the sample game in the forum in the club. In that game, both White and Black go for a pawn storm on kingside and queenside respectively... and White won. (though 0-0 was played before e4) One of the ingredients of that attack was a knight on e5, and by moving this knight, it allows for f6 should White try that"
19,Qe2,d1e2,r1bq1rk1/pp1nbppp/2n1p3/3p4/2pPPP2/2P2N2/PPBNQ1PP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 2 10,"I'm not sure why this move was played (heading for f2 to escape, maybe?) perhaps it was a waiting move..."
20,b5,b7b5,r1bq1rk1/p2nbppp/2n1p3/1p1p4/2pPPP2/2P2N2/PPBNQ1PP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 0 11,"Confident that White cannot try an attack like that in the example game, Black starts activity queenside"
21,Ng5,f3g5,r1bq1rk1/p2nbppp/2n1p3/1p1p2N1/2pPPP2/2P5/PPBNQ1PP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 1 11,"Now this was interesting... What is the idea behind this move? there were two possibilities that came to mind; 1) Hoping to attract the exchange with 11...Bxg5 12.fxg5 Qxg5 13.Nxc4! [Black has to deal with the discovered attack on the queen] and this blunts Black's pawn chain. 2) Like in the sample game, White may want to sac on f7 (that has happened to me in another game already, and the resulting position is interesting!). I could ignore the knight, but given who I'm up against, that doesn't seem too smart."
22,h6,h7h6,r1bq1rk1/p2nbpp1/2n1p2p/1p1p2N1/2pPPP2/2P5/PPBNQ1PP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 0 12,I preferred this over 11...f3 for fear of Nxh7
23,Ngf3,g5f3,r1bq1rk1/p2nbpp1/2n1p2p/1p1p4/2pPPP2/2P2N2/PPBNQ1PP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 1 12,"and Freddy's knight retreats.... ok, so far, so good..."
24,f5,f7f5,r1bq1rk1/p2nb1p1/2n1p2p/1p1p1p2/2pPPP2/2P2N2/PPBNQ1PP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 0 13,"? And now here's my first mistake. My plan here was to own the f-file with my rook after a pawn exchange e.g. 13.exd5 exd5 [then White makes a move] 14...Re8 15.0-0 [to avoid the queen pin] Bg4 and hey presto! I control the e-file, and things like that can be good to achieve against such higher rated players. The other option was e5, and I didn't mind at all! The only worry I had was that there was a weakness in my castled position, but I figured that there was no way that Freddy could take advantage of that [famous last words ;)]"
