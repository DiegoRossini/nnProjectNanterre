1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Midway into this game, white had the advantage of piece, position, and tempo.  White could exert strong influence on black's side of the board.  However, through a few false moves, white allowed black to turn back his intrusions into the black side.  Once black gained the upper hand, black was able to threaten mate and force white to resign."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,White opens with a defensive position instead of with offensive moves.

6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3p4/3P4/4P2P/PPP2PP1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,Another defensive move by white.  A major disadvantage to playing defensively is allowing the opponent to push forward and hence push back one's own pieces.  The result is that a defensive player gets boxed inside his own pawns.

16,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/1pp2ppp/p1nbpn2/8/2BP4/2N1PN1P/PP3PP1/R1BQK2R w KQ - 4 9,"Seeing how the e4 pawn is protected only by the knight on c3, if I can push a pawn forward and coax the knight off c3, I can take the e4 pawn for free.  The first step is to scare the bishop on c4 away."

With the bishop on d3, white could have protected the e4 pawn and once the queen is on c2, white can push the e4 pawn towards the knight on f6.  Once that knight is out of the way, white's bishop can take out the h7 pawn for free and expose black's king."

22,bxc3,b4c3,r1bq1rk1/2p2ppp/p1nbpn2/4P3/3P4/1Bp2N1P/PP3PP1/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 12,"Black has two basic choices - either play aggressively or defensively. Aggressively is to take out the knight on c3 and disrupt white's pawn structure.  Defensively is to to move the d6 bishop or f6 knight to safety.  Since both knight and bishop are threatened by the same piece, any safety is just an illusion since the safety of one means the death of the other.  If white's pawn captures either black's bishop or knight, the pawn is left undefended on the next move.  Seeing that - and seeing a way to disrupt white's own pawn structure - the best defense is a good offense!  Black's pawn removes the knight."

Better to take out the white d6 pawn with the c7 pawn in order to have a good pawn structure for defense later.  In this move, the best offense (later) is a good defense (now)."

However, it will eventually lead to white gaining a piece since white can take out the knight on d7 and if black recaptures the d7 square with the queen, the unlucky knight on c6 is left unprotected by anybody."
