1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Sometimes in chess material advantages do not mean a whole lot and the Tarrasch Defense proves this point. In exchange for the isolated d-pawn black gains space free development and attacking chances. This game features perfectly the key characteristics of well coordinated pieces in tandem with superior mobility that are trademark Tarrasch.

10,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/5n2/2Pp4/8/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,"In this line of the Tarrasch white seeks to retain his pawn advantage. However, just like in the Queen's Gambit accepted it is wiser to give it back the extra pawn for rapid development.  I consider this an inferior move that in the end creates serious holes on the queen side especially on c3. 

As it turns out I have played this move myself to a winning advantage. here is the link

12,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/5n2/2Pp4/1P6/2N5/P3PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 7,"business as usually. I complete my development before attacking. other than my isolated pawn I have no serious weaknesses. Notice that I have not developed any of my queen side pieces? This is because the threat of b4-b5, also most grandmasters delay developing the light bishop until white plays his."
13,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/5n2/2Pp4/1P6/2N2N2/P3PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 7,"business as usually. I complete my development before attacking. other than my isolated pawn I have no serious weaknesses.

15,a3,a2a3,rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/5n2/2Pp4/1P6/P1N2N2/4PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQ - 0 8,the proof of the shakiness of 6. b4 is that white thinks it is necessary to support it. Although at this point it is not in any danger so the move is a bit of a waste of tempo. I kinda like the idea of Bb2 myself
16,a5,a7a5,rnbq1rk1/1p2bppp/5n2/p1Pp4/1P6/P1N2N2/4PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 0 9,"This is a bit of a risky move, however I felt that with my king tucked away it was time to deal with the chief reason why my queen side pieces were not developed(b4!). With ...a5 I bust open for use the h file and create some time and space to take advantage of the fact that whites king is still in the centre."
17,Bf4,c1f4,rnbq1rk1/1p2bppp/5n2/p1Pp4/1P3B2/P1N2N2/4PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 1 9,I am not sure this is the best diagonal for this bishop. I prefer 9.Bb2 where it can keep an eye on the a1-a8 diagonal
18,axb4,a5b4,rnbq1rk1/1p2bppp/5n2/2Pp4/1p3B2/P1N2N2/4PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 10,This works because white did not play 9.Bb2
19,axb4,a3b4,rnbq1rk1/1p2bppp/5n2/2Pp4/1P3B2/2N2N2/4PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 10,with the queen deflected to a1 the black d5 pawn is can breath a bit easy now. This is a good thing because it gives me time to play Nc6 now.
20,Rxa1,a8a1,1nbq1rk1/1p2bppp/5n2/2Pp4/1P3B2/2N2N2/4PPPP/r2QKB1R w K - 0 11,with the queen deflected to a1 the black d5 pawn is can breath a bit easy now. This is a good thing because it gives me time to play Nc6 now.
21,Qxa1,d1a1,1nbq1rk1/1p2bppp/5n2/2Pp4/1P3B2/2N2N2/4PPPP/Q3KB1R b K - 0 11,with the queen deflected to a1 the black d5 pawn is can breath a bit easy now. This is a good thing because it gives me time to play Nc6 now.
22,Nc6,b8c6,2bq1rk1/1p2bppp/2n2n2/2Pp4/1P3B2/2N2N2/4PPPP/Q3KB1R w K - 1 12,black is down by a pawn but has the initiative for it. Black has two threats one is to advance the d pawn and the second is to capture b4.
23,Qb1,a1b1,2bq1rk1/1p2bppp/2n2n2/2Pp4/1P3B2/2N2N2/4PPPP/1Q2KB1R b K - 2 12,? this is no better than the queen sitting on a1
24,d4,d5d4,2bq1rk1/1p2bppp/2n2n2/2P5/1P1p1B2/2N2N2/4PPPP/1Q2KB1R w K - 0 13,12. Qb2 would have prevented this nasty thrust. Black's IDP is a double edge sword it is both his weakest point but if not respected(like in this game) it becomes his most powerful weapon.

27,Bc7,f4c7,2bq1rk1/1pB1bppp/5n2/1NP5/1n1p4/5N2/4PPPP/1Q2KB1R b K - 1 14,the only way to take the Knight on b4. However I have a nice tactical plan in the event of Qxb4
28,Qd7,d8d7,2b2rk1/1pBqbppp/5n2/1NP5/1n1p4/5N2/4PPPP/1Q2KB1R w K - 2 15,And here it is I sacrifice the knight for a strong attack. This is a sound sacrifice that I am sure caught Valeriuzahia by surprise.
29,Qxb4,b1b4,2b2rk1/1pBqbppp/5n2/1NP5/1Q1p4/5N2/4PPPP/4KB1R b K - 0 15,And here it is I sacrifice the knight for a strong attack. This is a sound sacrifice that I am sure caught Valeriuzahia by surprise.

33,Qxd5,d4d5,2b2rk1/1pB1bppp/8/1qPQ4/8/5N2/4PPPP/4KB1R b K - 0 17,"In exchange for the knight black has gained excellent mobility, a supported past pawn, back rank threats and dominance on the queen side."

35,e4,e2e4,2b2rk1/1pB2ppp/8/1qbQ4/4P3/5N2/5PPP/4KB1R b K - 0 18,a must because 18 ...Qb1+ wins or 18. e3 wins the queen via 18. ...Bb4+
36,Qb1+,b5b1,2b2rk1/1pB2ppp/8/2bQ4/4P3/5N2/5PPP/1q2KB1R w K - 1 19,This prevents white from castling and makes it very difficult for white to bring his rook into the action. As a result even though black is technically a minor piece behind he is practically two pawns to the good because of the lack of communication between white camp.
37,Ke2,e1e2,2b2rk1/1pB2ppp/8/2bQ4/4P3/5N2/4KPPP/1q3B1R b - - 2 19,"hinders mobility of the white bishop, places the pawn on a safer square and opens the a6-f1 diagonal for the light bishop."
