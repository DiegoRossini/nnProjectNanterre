I'm unsure why I chose Nge2 as this restricted the movement of my Queen and gave me less far-reaching control of the center squares."

Bf4 would have placed my bishop in a nice central location with protection from the knight on e2.  I liked the idea, however, of advancing a triple-protected pawn to d5."

Second best move by Fritz is 9. Nxd5 (-0.43) with my choice coming in third 9. exd5 (-0.50)

I agree with Fritz that Bxd5 would have been a good move.  I would then have a direct threat on my opponent's King, and the pawn on f7 would be pinned."

I moved b3 to open up b2 for my bishop.  I'm not sure why Fritz panned the move.  Bb3 would put the bishop out of the reach of the knight on e5, but otherwise doesn't seem to accomplish much."

Bf4 still seems like a good move.  My thought was that by placing my bishop on b2 I could establish a long-term threat against the King's region of the board."

Ng3 would be nice because it would open the e file and move my knight more towards my opponent's King.  I'm not certain why I chose Qd3.  Qd4 may have been nice to place my queen on the same diagonal as the b2 bishop, for a coordinated attack."

17. Ng3 (0.54) is rated as the second best move.

Qc3 would have placed the queen on the same diagonal as the b2 bishop, directly threatening checkmate at g7.  However, expecting my opponent would simply counter with 17 ... f6, I elected to clear the e file for my e1 rook."

Rac1 would have been nice because I would then dominate two files with my rooks.  Rac1 was part of a rather clumsy attempt to place two rooks on the same file.  It's a powerful result, but takes two turns to establish."

19. Qf3 (0.38) was rated second and 19. Re3 (0.27) was rated third.

This move was silly.  It invites f5 which means I will have to move my queen again, wasting more time.  I should have gone ahead with my plan, Rae1.  It's kind of embarrassing that Fritz is recommending I reverse my last move."
