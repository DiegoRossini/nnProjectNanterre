1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,So he opens with the standard
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I reply with the Sicilian Defence
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,He carries on with the most popular
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,And I play the Classical Variation
5,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,He turns it into an Open Sicilian
6,cxd4,c5d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,And I take
7,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,He recaptures
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,I carry on with the main line
9,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,This is the only sensible way to defend the e pawn
10,d6,d7d6,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,I carry on with main line
11,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/8/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"This was Bobby Fischer's favourite, the Sozin variation, but I, and probably most Sicilian players, prefer to meet this, rather than the Richter-Rauzer Attack (B63)
1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 d6 3 d4 cxd4 4 Nxd4 Nf6 5 Nc3 Nc6 6 Bg5"
12,e6,e7e6,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2nppn2/8/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,Black has to do something about the White threat to take on c6 and then play e5.
13,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2nppn2/8/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 7,"I, and probably most Sicilian players, prefer to meet this, rather than the sharper variations where White castles queen side and Black on the king side and both sides throw forward their pawns against the respective kings."
14,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2nppn2/8/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 8,So I carry on developing.
15,f4,f2f4,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2nppn2/8/2BNPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,This is a bit unusual
16,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2nppn2/8/2BNPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 9,So I castle.
17,Nf3,d4f3,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2nppn2/8/2B1PP2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 2 9,"This is unusual too. He is hoping to follow up with e5. It is not on Gameknot's world database, it is on their database of Gameknot games - although of course, as this is an over-the-board game, I didn't know at the time."
18,Qc7,d8c7,r1b2rk1/ppq1bppp/2nppn2/8/2B1PP2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 3 10,"Now this move is not in any database, but it seemed quite logical to me - delay his intended e5 advance. Instead the database has 6 games with a6, one with Bd7 (white win) and one with Nxe4 (black win). The computer actually spots a tactic in this position, b5 is playable."
19,Qe2,d1e2,r1b2rk1/ppq1bppp/2nppn2/8/2B1PP2/2N2N2/PPP1Q1PP/R1B2RK1 b - - 4 10,So he renews the threat of e5.
20,Rd8,f8d8,r1br2k1/ppq1bppp/2nppn2/8/2B1PP2/2N2N2/PPP1Q1PP/R1B2RK1 w - - 5 11,Played to discourage e5 - I can exchange on e5 and then dump my Knight on d5. Computer prefers a6.
