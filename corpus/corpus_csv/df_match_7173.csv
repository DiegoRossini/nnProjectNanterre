1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"stony and I have played a number of games, with each of us pounding the other sometimes and each making mistakes, though I take the cake on that one.  Here, I had to get away from e4, sicilian, ruy lop stuff and try to get him.  Reti seemed like a good choice.  KodiakJack got me thinking about it."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,"so far, so good.  decent opening moves, getting the pieces out there.  now, the question of whether to take.  After playing the Tromp, it seems that there are benefits from exchanging here, but losing the dark-sq B is risky.  I hold my breath..."

11,Bxf6,g5f6,r1bqk2r/ppp1ppbp/2n2Bp1/3p4/3P4/2N1PN2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,and go for the it.  It's not as good when he can ( and will ) take with the B.  Part of the allure of such a move is to ruin pawn structure.  he doesn't fall for easy stuff.
12,Bxf6,g7f6,r1bqk2r/ppp1pp1p/2n2bp1/3p4/3P4/2N1PN2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"Again, just making a piece immobile is a slight advantage, but any decent player will deal with this directly.."

14,Bd7,c8d7,r2qk2r/pppbpp1p/2n2bp1/1B1p4/3P4/2N1PN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 8,"like this, say.  castling also works, but does screw up the pawn skeleton"
15,Nxd5,c3d5,r2qk2r/pppbpp1p/2n2bp1/1B1N4/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 8,that was free. the B cut off Q protection.
16,O-O,e8g8,r2q1rk1/pppbpp1p/2n2bp1/1B1N4/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 1 9,Most of my games now see me castling later.  I have some embarrassing times when castling early leads to onslaught and no one likes that
17,Nxf6+,d5f6,r2q1rk1/pppbpp1p/2n2Np1/1B6/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 9,The forcing nature of this move is to Andy Soltis' liking and of course the messing up of the pawn struct.  moving the king is not really an option
18,exf6,e7f6,r2q1rk1/pppb1p1p/2n2pp1/1B6/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 10,"Now, castle.  KodiakJack said around moves 10-12.  and I trust him."

20,a6,a7a6,r2q1rk1/1ppb1p1p/p1n2pp1/1B6/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 11,"it depends on what mood I'm in...do I take or run?  with a slight point advantage, one can argue that killing the N is ok, but then a potential endgame with B vs. N is not really good for N.  run away, run away!"
21,Bc4,b5c4,r2q1rk1/1ppb1p1p/p1n2pp1/8/2BP4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 11,"yeah, yeah.."

29,dxe5,d4e5,1r1q1rk1/2pb1p1p/p5p1/1p1BPp2/8/4P3/PPP1QPPP/R4RK1 b - - 0 15,"Now, I'm the one with the suffering pawn structure."
30,Re8,f8e8,1r1qr1k1/2pb1p1p/p5p1/1p1BPp2/8/4P3/PPP1QPPP/R4RK1 w - - 1 16,I really fight to stay a point up

33,Qxa6,e2a6,1r1qr1k1/2pb1p1p/Q5p1/3BPp2/1p3P2/4P3/PPP3PP/R4RK1 b - - 0 17,special today; free pawns
34,Bb5,d7b5,1r1qr1k1/2p2p1p/Q5p1/1b1BPp2/1p3P2/4P3/PPP3PP/R4RK1 w - - 1 18,"this is not my favorite point about mr. spider.  he comes up with a beautiful tactical move that forces several issues simulaneously.  I'm not hip enough to see the best way out.  Again, I hear soltis with his forcing moves and try to at least keep control..."
