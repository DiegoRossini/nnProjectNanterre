17,O-O,e1g1,r1b1kb1r/pp1n1ppp/1qn1p3/3pP3/3P4/3B4/PP1NNPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 2 9,White castles and offers the d (gambit) pawn.
18,Nxd4,c6d4,r1b1kb1r/pp1n1ppp/1q2p3/3pP3/3n4/3B4/PP1NNPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 10,I decide to take the pawn. Surely white's attack can't be that strong?
19,Nxd4,e2d4,r1b1kb1r/pp1n1ppp/1q2p3/3pP3/3N4/3B4/PP1N1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 10,White attacks black's Q and defends the e-pawn.

26,a6,a7a6,r1b1k2r/1p1n1ppp/pq2p3/2bpP3/Q7/P2B1N2/1P3PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 0 14,Black plays a6 creating a retreat square for his queen and preventing Bb5. This is the first move not in the World DB. Omens are not good though... in the Gameknot DB 13...a6 has 100% (3x) win for white.
27,Bd2,c1d2,r1b1k2r/1p1n1ppp/pq2p3/2bpP3/Q7/P2B1N2/1P1B1PPP/R4RK1 b kq - 1 14,White gets further ahead with development

33,Be3,d2e3,r1b1kb1r/qp1n1p1p/p3p1p1/3pP3/1P4Q1/P2BBN2/5PPP/R4RK1 b kq - 2 17,White can finally play Be3 and black's queen is hit again. That pawn is getting more and more expensive!
34,Qb8,a7b8,rqb1kb1r/1p1n1p1p/p3p1p1/3pP3/1P4Q1/P2BBN2/5PPP/R4RK1 w kq - 3 18,Black retreats but hits the pawn on e5.

36,Bg7,f8g7,rqb1k2r/1p1n1pbp/p3p1p1/3pP1Q1/1P6/P2BBN2/5PPP/R4RK1 w kq - 5 19,More pressure on e5 and freeing the back rank.
