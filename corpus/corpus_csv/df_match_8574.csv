1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Another Remohgramps game, this one is quick and brutal. Not much to see here (just annotating it because I annotate all my games). We were both playing fast, the game ended in just a few hours while we were both playing frequenly in multiple other games as well - a sure recipe for disaster. White's d4 meets black's Indian System."
