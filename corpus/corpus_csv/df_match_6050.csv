12,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"7. Bc4 combined with Bg5 is unknown to me, though I have encountered it in speed games, but never looked it up in libraries or saw it in pros games."
13,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/6B1/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 7,"7. Bc4 combined with Bg5 is unknown to me, though I have encountered it in speed games, but never looked it up in libraries or saw it in pros games."
14,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/1p2bppp/p2ppn2/6B1/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 8,I decide to play the usual suspects.
15,Qf3,d1f3,rnbqk2r/1p2bppp/p2ppn2/6B1/2BNP3/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 3 8,This leaves the d4 knight unprotected and prevents f4. I feel relieved. Business stuff severely reduces my thinking time these days.
16,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk2r/1p2bppp/p1nppn2/6B1/2BNP3/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 4 9,"I know this is strange with a6 and no bishop or queen aside to take back on c6. So I have a battery of pawns on the 6th range ""doing the same job"". Still I opt for this to strengthen my center."
17,Nxc6,d4c6,r1bqk2r/1p2bppp/p1Nppn2/6B1/2B1P3/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 0 9,Of course my opponent goes for this scenario.
18,bxc6,b7c6,r1bqk2r/4bppp/p1pppn2/6B1/2B1P3/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 10,An additional benefit is the newly opened b-file. Of course ...a6 was wasting time now.
19,O-O-O,e1c1,r1bqk2r/4bppp/p1pppn2/6B1/2B1P3/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b kq - 1 10,"Still my rival is keen for double edged play. Now his rook is opposite my queen, attacking the d-pawn. But I feel one single center pawn is not enough."
20,Qb6,d8b6,r1b1k2r/4bppp/pqpppn2/6B1/2B1P3/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/2KR3R w kq - 2 11,Some calculation assures the d-pawn is poisoned. So I can forcefully develope my queen.
21,Bxf6,g5f6,r1b1k2r/4bppp/pqpppB2/8/2B1P3/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b kq - 0 11,It seems my opponent goes for the d-pawn.
22,Bxf6,e7f6,r1b1k2r/5ppp/pqpppb2/8/2B1P3/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/2KR3R w kq - 0 12,I leave the pawn en pris because taking it just helps me.
23,Rxd6,d1d6,r1b1k2r/5ppp/pqpRpb2/8/2B1P3/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/2K4R b kq - 0 12,There is a direct line winning the exchange plus keeping the pressure towards the queenside.
24,Qc5,b6c5,r1b1k2r/5ppp/p1pRpb2/2q5/2B1P3/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/2K4R w kq - 1 13,Forking rook and bishop.
25,Qd3,f3d3,r1b1k2r/5ppp/p1pRpb2/2q5/2B1P3/2NQ4/PPP2PPP/2K4R b kq - 2 13,Naturally defending both.
26,Be7,f6e7,r1b1k2r/4bppp/p1pRp3/2q5/2B1P3/2NQ4/PPP2PPP/2K4R w kq - 3 14,Taking away the squares of the rook.
27,Rd4,d6d4,r1b1k2r/4bppp/p1p1p3/2q5/2BRP3/2NQ4/PPP2PPP/2K4R b kq - 4 14,"Wrongly trying to keep the exchange. I guess, 14. Rhd1 was way better."
28,e5,e6e5,r1b1k2r/4bppp/p1p5/2q1p3/2BRP3/2NQ4/PPP2PPP/2K4R w kq - 0 15,There goes the rook!
29,Bxf7+,c4f7,r1b1k2r/4bBpp/p1p5/2q1p3/3RP3/2NQ4/PPP2PPP/2K4R b kq - 0 15,Instead of giving the rook white correctly gives the bishop and causes some stir.
