11,Ndb5,d4b5,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/1N2p3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,This seems a good outpost for the knight as it threatens to cause problems on d6 or c7
12,d6,d7d6,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2np1n2/1N2p3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"Now he can either lose a rook to a fork, or exchange knights and then be forced to move his remaining knight"
13,Nd5,c3d5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2np1n2/1N1Np3/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 7,"Now he can either lose a rook to a fork, or exchange knights and then be forced to move his remaining knight"

15,exd5,e4d5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2np4/1N1Pp3/8/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,pressuing the d pawn but notice that his king is now almost completely surrounded
16,Ne7,c6e7,r1bqkb1r/pp2nppp/3p4/1N1Pp3/8/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 9,pressuing the d pawn but notice that his king is now almost completely surrounded
17,c4,c2c4,r1bqkb1r/pp2nppp/3p4/1N1Pp3/2P5/8/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 9,"reinforces the d pawn, but more importantly opens the diagonal to a4 for my queen. I'm not sure if c3 would be better as that leaves my lsb with a better run should it be needed"
18,a6,a7a6,r1bqkb1r/1p2nppp/p2p4/1N1Pp3/2P5/8/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 10,Although this attempts to move the knight I think it should have been done earlier (before I moved my c pawn).
19,Qa4,d1a4,r1bqkb1r/1p2nppp/p2p4/1N1Pp3/Q1P5/8/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 1 10,"Should he take the knight he will clearly lose the rook, however this could save the game for black. If he cannot open some space around the king I have Nd6"

21,Nc7+,b5c7,r1bqkb1r/1pN2ppp/p2p2n1/3Pp3/Q1P5/8/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 3 11,"This at least would gain me a rook.

Black resigned. Interestingly we are still within the Gameknot Database here."
