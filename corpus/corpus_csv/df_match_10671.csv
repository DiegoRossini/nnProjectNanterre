3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Most common move, White can also try
 A. 2.d4 smith morra gambit ( Black MUST be careful i recommend it!)
 B. 2.b4 wing gambit ( not very common, i don't recommend it)
C. 2.c3 alapins ( Is considered quite harmless to Black)
D. 2.Nc3 and follow up with 3.f4, 4.Nf3 and then 5.Bc4 for the Grand Prix attack!"
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"2. d6 is the most common but also Black can play.
 
 A. 2.Nc6
 B. 2.e6"
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"White alternative choices are...
 
A. 3.Bb5  is Moscow variation it helps Black's development, so i dont recommend
B. 3. c3 the alapins it sets a trap up too after 3.Nf6 4.Be2 Nxe4?? 5.Qa5 ! wins
        a bishop but the problem is after 4. Nbd7 White will have a awkward 
      position after 5. Qe2 or 5.Bd3"

9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,"This move initiates the Najdorf's pet opening the Narjdorf variation
 Other choices Black has instead are;
 
A. 5. g6 Sicilian dragon (most popular, I don't play it much, but i recommend it)

B. 5.Nc6 Sicilian classical variation ( not the  fun Sicilian, i dont recommend)

C. 5. e6  I like to play as White because I like to use the Keres attack 6.g4
        ( another reason Paul Keres is my faveroute chess player."

 Also possible are
  A. 6.Bc4 Bobby Fisher's move of his choice and I recommend it!
  B. 6. Be3  I dont  recommend because a future Ng4 will disrupt development.
  C. 6. Be2 I don't recommend because it is passive
  D. 6.  f3  Is atleast ok. follow up with 7.Be3 but it looks rather slow."

 also allows White to castle Queen-side and supports a future f5."

 Knight and also has the advantage of the 2 bishops."

  If Black accepts the Bishop 13. pxb5 then 14. 0-0 ! The castling also gives a
  check, how funny! 14. Bf6 ( If 14. Kg8 or Kg7 Black walks straight into 
  checkmate after 15. Qf7 mate) 15. pxf6  ( If 14. Nf6?? after 15.pxf6 White gets his piece back plus the Bishop on e7 because it is totally paralyzed!) and White
 anyway has the better position."
