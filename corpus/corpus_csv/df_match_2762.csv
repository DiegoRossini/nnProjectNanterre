Especially when my source for the game indicated it was dedicated by Mr. Wellmuth to the late Perrier. The sparkling gem was created in the middle of a World War, when there wasn't time or opportunity serious tournament play, and I'll admit the the other offerings fro that year didn't impress me enough to set this aside, and besides, it doesn't seem to be well known. Actually, it isn't all that complicated, just long. Notice how few branches had to be calculated. A very short computer analysis found the move, but concluded that Black might gain a slight advantage. Of course an exhaustive search would have led the program to the correct conclusion. Even after looking just 7 movesahead, White gained advantage."
