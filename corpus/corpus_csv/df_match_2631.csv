11,Ne5,f3e5,rnbqk2r/ppp3pp/3bpn2/3pNp2/3P1B2/4P3/PPPN1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 2 6,I like this move. Specially when the black knight is on f6.
12,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp3pp/3bpn2/3pNp2/3P1B2/4P3/PPPN1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 3 7,"Normally I play the pawn in g4, but now... and to prepare it with h3 is delaying my developement."
13,Be2,f1e2,rnbq1rk1/ppp3pp/3bpn2/3pNp2/3P1B2/4P3/PPPNBPPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 4 7,"That leaves me behind in my plan to castle queenside, in order to be free to attack his kingside. But you can't have it all. That darn pawn in f5 is a good soldier!"
14,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bq1rk1/pppn2pp/3bpn2/3pNp2/3P1B2/4P3/PPPNBPPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 5 8,"Black's compressed power is growingly slowly. But with this move, he have to think about what happens if he moves the c pawn (say c5) and my knight jumps to f7, since his bishop is undefended. Nothing definite, still."
15,g4,g2g4,r1bq1rk1/pppn2pp/3bpn2/3pNp2/3P1BP1/4P3/PPPNBP1P/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 8,You play for a win. Even with a stronger opponent.

Obviously, if I take with the knight, the following exchanged would have been in black's favour, so I opted for losing the nice bishop's pair  but keep the initiative on the g column. A strong attack, with its counters."
17,Bxg4,e2g4,r1bq1rk1/pppn2pp/3bpn2/3pN3/3P1BB1/4P3/PPPN1P1P/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 9,"I'm pretty sure he didn't expect this planned continuation.

24,Qf6,d8f6,r1b2rk1/ppp3pp/3bpq2/3pN3/3PnB2/4P3/PPPN1PQP/R3K1R1 w Q - 5 13,"Here the first mistake. I had to exchange the knight and take the pawn. Good for me. I played the knight thinking about anything to ""brake"" black's defences. Black overlooked Bb4+, and I can't play c3 (Nxc3 with fork to follow). True, I planned to move theking just to e2, overlooking the dangerous b6 (for Ba6+)."
