1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"""Can I become a queen this game please daddy?"" As you will know, Paula the petulant pawn longed to become a queen (see http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/the-petulant-pawn?gm=28212 for details?)
""I don't know"" replied the king, placing her on the c2 square."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"Out comes the knight, in particularly, preventing 2. e4"
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"The Bishop behind Paula gave her a hearty push, as the King bellowed ""c4"". Paula found her self advancing 2 spaces. ""Good at least I have made a start"" she said to herself."
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Black plays the Nimzo-Indian defence, controling the centre with pieces rather than pawns."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"""We'll hang out the washing on the c3 line"" sang the white knight to himself, as he jumped into action."
6,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,Black finds another way to prevent white from playing e4.
7,e3,e2e3,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,The white king shoved the e pawn forwarded one space. This is The Rubinstein System (named after Akiba Rubinstein)
8,b6,b7b6,rnbqk2r/p1pp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/1bPP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"Slightly unusual, but perfectably playable. 0-0 and c5 are more common here."
9,f3,f2f3,rnbqk2r/p1pp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/1bPP4/2N1PP2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"The white king pushes forward the f2 pawn one square. This again is unusual, white's more common 5th moves in this position are Bd3, Nge2, Nf3, a3, Bd2 or Qc2. There is a certain logic to f3. It reduces the power of the Black bishop if it goes to b7, prevents Ne4 from black and prepares e4 for white. The down side is that it is not developing a piece, and slightly weakening the white king side."
10,Nh5,f6h5,rnbqk2r/p1pp1ppp/1p2p3/7n/1bPP4/2N1PP2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,"So black moves his knight, threatening Qh4 check. c5 is the only move here for black on the Gameknot databases."
11,Nh3,g1h3,rnbqk2r/p1pp1ppp/1p2p3/7n/1bPP4/2N1PP1N/PP4PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 6,"So white covers that, and prepares to reply to the check with Nf2."
12,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/p1pp1ppp/1p2p3/7n/1bPP4/2N1PP1N/PP4PP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 3 7,"Black castles, a good move, taking the king to safety and developing the rook."
13,Bd2,c1d2,rnbq1rk1/p1pp1ppp/1p2p3/7n/1bPP4/2N1PP1N/PP1B2PP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 4 7,White prevents his c pawns from being doubled.
14,c5,c7c5,rnbq1rk1/p2p1ppp/1p2p3/2p4n/1bPP4/2N1PP1N/PP1B2PP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 8,"So here comes c5, as expected really."
15,a3,a2a3,rnbq1rk1/p2p1ppp/1p2p3/2p4n/1bPP4/P1N1PP1N/1P1B2PP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 8,"So having played Bd2, this is a logical follow up, if black exchanges on c3, my bishop is powerful on c3."
16,Ba5,b4a5,rnbq1rk1/p2p1ppp/1p2p3/b1p4n/2PP4/P1N1PP1N/1P1B2PP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 1 9,So black retreats.
17,dxc5,d4c5,rnbq1rk1/p2p1ppp/1p2p3/b1P4n/2P5/P1N1PP1N/1P1B2PP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 9,"White exchanges. Black's d pawn is now somewhat backward and there is a weak square on d6. After the recapture, white also has a backward b pawn and a weak square on b3, but this is less important, as 1. It is further away from the centre, the main scene of the action, and 2. It will take time for black to line up pieces on the b file and move the knight towards b3. Black in fact never does this, but white immediately starts making threats."
18,bxc5,b6c5,rnbq1rk1/p2p1ppp/4p3/b1p4n/2P5/P1N1PP1N/1P1B2PP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 10,So black recaptures.
19,Ne4,c3e4,rnbq1rk1/p2p1ppp/4p3/b1p4n/2P1N3/P3PP1N/1P1B2PP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 1 10,White threatens the c pawn and eyes the weakness on d6.
20,Bb6,a5b6,rnbq1rk1/p2p1ppp/1b2p3/2p4n/2P1N3/P3PP1N/1P1B2PP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 2 11,Black is rather forced into defensive measures.
