1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

The Sicilian is not an opening for the faint hearted.  Defense and passivitis will get you nowhere in the middlegame!  Well, I can tell you that neither player showed much passivitis in the middlegame.  However, unfortunately for my opponent, small-potato, a bigger concentration of white pieces in his position at the right time ensured that it was not Henry that was to topple.  In this game, much to black's chagrin, Glenda snapped out of her defensive role and became one hot potato!  So, how did all this happen?  Well, let's kick off with 1. e4 c4.  This is the Sicilian Defense and the word defense is a misnomer because both sides may end up being at each other's throats."

Now if the two sides castle on the opposite side (white normally queenside), then I am aware of the fact that Henry can be subject to an almighty barrage down the a-c columns by major pieces and they can all line up neatly behind the pushed pawns.  So somehow, I must counter-attack vigorously on the kingside and get my punch in first."
