1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I had played a few dozen games trying to learn the Stonewall Attack (watched some videos on YouTube and it looked like an interesting option for D4) but found there were too many issues for me as white to cover all the time. I guess most players in the range I play (1250 to 1500) recognize the line, as I do now, and know if they block or eliminate white's LS bishop the basic line is rendered useless. There are no doubt other variations but I do not have the time and skill to study chess that deeply really. So this game was not to be a Stonewall game and I think was I trying to go for a Spanish game when I opened with E4 as that I what I like to explore lately. But you will see it ended up resembling a board you might well see in a classic Stonewall Attack game."
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"But seems black wants to do a French Defense here, which is okay with me as it is my favorite to use as black (avoiding that annoying assault on F7 right off the bat that many players like to employ) , along with the slightly similar Caro-Kann. I figured I would do the advance variation as i am used it when I play black."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"But I decided not to do the advance because as black I get so burned out with it. 9 out of 10 times I deal with the advance so I try Knc3, which is the most popular move according to the Gameknot World DB. Few people at my level at GK use it so I thought I would give it a go, win or lose, and see where it led."

6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,This looks odd for white but I do not feel like I am too screwed. I like to play the King's Gambit and Vienna Gambit so I am a little okay with this sort of set up as long as I can castle king side and have the semi-open F-file I figure I will manage later.

Not a perfect book set up but I recall things looking this way. Of course one does not have to play something just like it goes in a book example to arrive at a similar board. The Caro-Kann winds up often looking like a French Defense game after black advances his pawn to D5 and it is covered by his DS bishop. I keep this in mind as we continue with what seems to be mostly book moves from the Database though I do not recall using it too much this game.

But in the end, as the games advances,  my pawn on the G-file proves to be helpful to me and a problem for black."

At this point the only thing keeping me going is the few dozen Stonewall games I had played and even won a few. The board does not look all that alien to me now and for all practical purposes I could have started the game as a SW game. I am not confident, but as long as I am in slightly charted waters I am a little okay. I did not like losing that pawn but I also feel it it not a necessary piece for now and I am about to lose bigger fish anyway as my next move is to sacrifice my LS bishop on H7."

As if they were saying ""I will not fall for that one!"" or something, allowing white to keep the piece. That is totally great for white, but my opponent is a solid player really and does what needs to be done. I saw he ran an analysis on the game and this is an inaccuracy for white really. The analysis suggests rook to F4, attacking the knight and getting it out to where I want it to be anyway. I had considered that but felt black would just guard the knight with his C pawn and my rook was coming out in a couple moves anyway to harass the knight."

My bishop has to move now after his attack. This is one of those moves I would not have made had he not forced me to.  I sacrifice my DS square bishop. It is a gamble but it can work if things go a certain way. Of course I would like his king to take it so my queen and pawn can work together a bit.
