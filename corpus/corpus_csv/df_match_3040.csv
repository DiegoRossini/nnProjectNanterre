1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"Hi everyone!

As I stated in my Club thread - I seem to be getting through my games very slowly.  The reason is, my opponents have put up such a good show against me that I am trying hard to make sensible moves, but it is like wading through treacle.  This game was no different. Wolfgang kept me in such a bind for a good part of the game it was unbelievable.  It took a lot of horse manoeuvring before I was able to get anywhere.  But suddenly I did, and it was all over and I netted a 6.5 rating point haul over my fellow Class A opponent. He starts off with the Reti Opening, which is Nf3 and I make the most popular response with 1. ..... d5."
