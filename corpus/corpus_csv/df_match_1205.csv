1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,We start with the Reti Opening.
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,I reply with this- I've also found Nf6 to be equally effective...
3,g3,g2g3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5NP1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,"Instead of continuing the Reti via c4, so that White can contest Black's ability to own the centre (a reason I find Reti games a bit scary to deal with at times), he instead goes into a King's Indian Attack, planning to fianchetto the bishop right away."
4,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/8/5NP1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,I decide to undermine the incoming fianchetto.
5,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/8/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 3,Which he still performs.
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/8/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 4,More development. I'm a bit relaxed at his reluctance to push pawns.
7,O-O,e1g1,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/8/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 3 4,"And now he castles. Once again, I'm not complaining- should White try to contest d5 right away, it is well defended. However, if White doesn't try to gain space with pawns soon, I'll gain the initiative sooner or later..."
8,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/6b1/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 4 5,"White's Nf3 is a lot stronger than his Bg2. So this is a nice neat way to threaten a pin if he decides to budge the e pawn, but also allows me to kill the knight if I decide I hate it too much."
9,d3,d2d3,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/6b1/3P1NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 5,"This might appear passive at first glance, but it makes e4 and c4 to be much stronger moves by White- and it also brings his dark bishop into the game."
10,Nbd7,b8d7,r2qkb1r/pp1npppp/2p2n2/3p4/6b1/3P1NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 6,"I want to play e5, but if I do that now, he just plays Nxe5."
11,Qe1,d1e1,r2qkb1r/pp1npppp/2p2n2/3p4/6b1/3P1NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNB1QRK1 b kq - 2 6,"But I'm not sure why he wanted the queen here instead of the rook. I don't think the Bg4 pin should be that frightening for White- if it was, then I think he should have played h3..."
12,e5,e7e5,r2qkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p2n2/3pp3/6b1/3P1NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNB1QRK1 w kq - 0 7,"This pawn is now secure, and I'm able to stake a claim into the centre."
13,e4,e2e4,r2qkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p2n2/3pp3/4P1b1/3P1NP1/PPP2PBP/RNB1QRK1 b kq - 0 7,"I think White's planning to open the files up so that the Queen starts hitting my King, but I don't think the plan is going to work unless I decline the exchange."
14,dxe4,d5e4,r2qkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p2n2/4p3/4p1b1/3P1NP1/PPP2PBP/RNB1QRK1 w kq - 0 8,Which I don't. I have enough to fight with on the e4 square.
15,dxe4,d3e4,r2qkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p2n2/4p3/4P1b1/5NP1/PPP2PBP/RNB1QRK1 b kq - 0 8,"He takes back, and now I hold the first move."
16,Be7,f8e7,r2qk2r/pp1nbppp/2p2n2/4p3/4P1b1/5NP1/PPP2PBP/RNB1QRK1 w kq - 1 9,"This preemptively removes the threat of Bg5, and now I can castle. Black appears to be very solid right now, and it would seem White will have to scramble to find a secure way into my defenses. Black's pieces are almost developed, whereas White's queenside remains largely untouched..."
17,b3,b2b3,r2qk2r/pp1nbppp/2p2n2/4p3/4P1b1/1P3NP1/P1P2PBP/RNB1QRK1 b kq - 0 9,Perhaps he felt that way too. So he moves to open a second fianchetto on b2.
18,O-O,e8g8,r2q1rk1/pp1nbppp/2p2n2/4p3/4P1b1/1P3NP1/P1P2PBP/RNB1QRK1 w - - 1 10,I castle before White can further any development.
19,Bb2,c1b2,r2q1rk1/pp1nbppp/2p2n2/4p3/4P1b1/1P3NP1/PBP2PBP/RN2QRK1 b - - 2 10,And White continues his plan.
20,Bxf3,g4f3,r2q1rk1/pp1nbppp/2p2n2/4p3/4P3/1P3bP1/PBP2PBP/RN2QRK1 w - - 0 11,"Now, for this... I'm sure there was plenty else Black could have done at this point. I personally didn't believe the light bishop was terribly frightening, but the Nf3 was weakening my e5 control rapidly. As it would turn out, it was never going to be the light bishop to cause me so much grief, so all in all, I think this was probably the right call in the long run."
