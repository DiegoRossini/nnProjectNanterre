It does make a threat of capture on c2 which has to be answered.    6. O-O is a straightforward answer, taking away the possibility of a fork (and if black still tries to grab the c-pawn, either 7. Nc3 or 7. Bd3 will make him pay for it).  6. Na3 would also defend the square in a straightforward way.  6.   Nc3 is a less obvious defense by making a counterthreat."
