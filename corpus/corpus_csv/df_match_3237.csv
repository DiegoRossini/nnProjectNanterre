1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,King's pawn open.  My default.
2,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Apparently, this is called the Robatsch defence, but I'm not very familiar with it."
3,c3,c2c3,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,I wanted to protect the main diagonal because I've gotten burned and lost my rooks early in some previous games.  Planning on playing 3.d4
4,b6,b7b6,rnbqkbnr/p1pppp1p/1p4p1/8/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"I found this to be an odd move.  This does open up the light diagonal, but it's already closed off by my pawn on e4."
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/p1pppp1p/1p4p1/8/3PP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,Now I take control of the center squares and free up my dark bishop.
6,Bb7,c8b7,rn1qkbnr/pbpppp1p/1p4p1/8/3PP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"Again, I don't really get this move.  He may be trying to force me to protect my pawn, but it really accomplishes very little."
7,Nd2,b1d2,rn1qkbnr/pbpppp1p/1p4p1/8/3PP3/2P5/PP1N1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 4,"Protecting my pawn.  In hindsight, 4.f3 probably was a better choice, but it was a blitz game and I didn't think this move over for a long time.  Oh well, this still worked well enough."
8,Nf6,g8f6,rn1qkb1r/pbpppp1p/1p3np1/8/3PP3/2P5/PP1N1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 3 5,Now he starts developing some of his pieces.
9,e5,e4e5,rn1qkb1r/pbpppp1p/1p3np1/4P3/3P4/2P5/PP1N1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"Now I start to set up what I like to call the ""Flying V"".  There's probably a more technical name than that, but I like my name for it."
10,Nd5,f6d5,rn1qkb1r/pbpppp1p/1p4p1/3nP3/3P4/2P5/PP1N1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,He saves his knight and gives me the chance to truly set up the flying V.
11,Nc4,d2c4,rn1qkb1r/pbpppp1p/1p4p1/3nP3/2NP4/2P5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 6,A development move.  Opens up the dark bishop and gets my knight into an attacking position.
12,g5,g6g5,rn1qkb1r/pbpppp1p/1p6/3nP1p1/2NP4/2P5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,"No idea why he made this move.  He leaves an unprotected pawn right in my bishop's path and also likely destroys his ability to king-side castle.  This does nothing for development, and will most likely end up only hurting him."
13,f3,f2f3,rn1qkb1r/pbpppp1p/1p6/3nP1p1/2NP4/2P2P2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 7,"... I should've played 7.Bxg5.  I looked back right after I made this move and facepalmed immediately.  I gave him a free out for his previous bad move.  I'll give myself a ""?"" on this move."
14,Nf4,d5f4,rn1qkb1r/pbpppp1p/1p6/4P1p1/2NP1n2/2P2P2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 8,"Now the pawn move makes sense, even though I should have never let this move happen."
15,Ne2,g1e2,rn1qkb1r/pbpppp1p/1p6/4P1p1/2NP1n2/2P2P2/PP2N1PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 8,I decided not to let his knight stay comfortable.  I decided to threaten it immediately and try to get it on the move.
16,Bh6,f8h6,rn1qk2r/pbpppp1p/1p5b/4P1p1/2NP1n2/2P2P2/PP2N1PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 3 9,"He refuses to move, and instead beefs up his defenses."
17,g3,g2g3,rn1qk2r/pbpppp1p/1p5b/4P1p1/2NP1n2/2P2PP1/PP2N2P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 9,"No rest for his knight, so I up the pressure."
18,Nh3,f4h3,rn1qk2r/pbpppp1p/1p5b/4P1p1/2NP4/2P2PPn/PP2N2P/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 10,"Another ""?"" move, where he leaves an unprotected piece directly in my line of attack.  I wasn't going to let it slide this time."
19,Bxh3,f1h3,rn1qk2r/pbpppp1p/1p5b/4P1p1/2NP4/2P2PPB/PP2N2P/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 10,"Boom, early material and development advantage."
20,Rg8,h8g8,rn1qk1r1/pbpppp1p/1p5b/4P1p1/2NP4/2P2PPB/PP2N2P/R1BQK2R w KQq - 1 11,"Don't know what he was going for here.  Not a bad move, but it really accomplishes nothing."
