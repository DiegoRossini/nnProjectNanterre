1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,The game starts out with a classical Queen pawn formation.
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,The game starts out with a classical Queen pawn formation.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,I feel like playing for a Queen Gambit.

5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"With this move the computer introduces a Tarrasch Opening, which I had no idea what it was when I was playing this, but upon looking it up in the MCO later I was very pleased in my intuitive play, but also impressed that the computer would choose this opening over other main line QGD choices."
6,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2pp4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"With this move the computer introduces a Tarrasch Opening, which I had no idea what it was when I was playing this, but upon looking it up in the MCO later I was very pleased in my intuitive play, but also impressed that the computer would choose this opening over other main line QGD choices."
7,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2pP4/3P4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"I remember when I first evaluated this position that this choice appears more correct than 4.dxc5 because 4...d4 can smother white positionally by forcing a withdrawl of the knight or akward placement, and simply leaving the pawns and waiting for 4...cxd4 is likewise unwanted. Another benefit of the text move is that black will be likely to be left with an isolated pawn at some point, which will tie up pieces."
8,exd5,e6d5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/8/2pp4/3P4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"This position gave me pause for thought where I considered that 5...c4 could be positionally unpleasant for my bishop, but also considered that this could be remedied with a later e4 or b3 pawn move, so developing to cover d4 with a piece instead of the queen alone made sense, and this facilitates castling and rapid development."
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/8/2pp4/3P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"This position gave me pause for thought where I considered that 5...c4 could be positionally unpleasant for my bishop, but also considered that this could be remedied with a later e4 or b3 pawn move, so developing to cover d4 with a piece instead of the queen alone made sense, and this facilitates castling and rapid development."
10,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n5/2pp4/3P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,"Black brings some pressure to d4, and could, speculatively, be planning 0-0-0, but I only considered this a mild possibility."
11,e3,e2e3,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n5/2pp4/3P4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"Refuting 6...Bg4 before it can be played, this keeps d4 safe, and activates the bishop. The plan for white is to castle short, then look for a good plan for creating an improved position. I did not find this move in the MCO, so if anyone out there has some thoughts about it, please, let me know, thanks. The norm is to play 6.g3 instead."
12,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/2pp4/3P4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,"The knight covers d5, which enables queen play, and also suggests that 0-0 can be expected. It is possible that ...Ne4 may be played later, but at the moment that move carries no weight."
13,dxc5,d4c5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/2Pp4/8/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"The idea here is to lessen the black pawn presence in the center, and though it develops a bishop for black, the bishop will be a target for future attack when white is ready."
14,Bxc5,f8c5,r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/2bp4/8/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,"I ran a quick Toga analysis afer my analysis, and this is the last book move per Toga."
15,a3,a2a3,r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/2bp4/8/P1N1PN2/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,"!? With this move the obvious 9.b4 is planned, and black will have difficulties to parry this move, (8...a5) to try and prevent the move will receive (9.Qa4) !? followed by (10.b4) anyway. This could get much more complicated afterwards to undetermined favor, but this was my take on the position at the time."
16,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2n2n2/2bp4/8/P1N1PN2/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 1 9,Black is the first to castle and so enjoys a lead in development due to whites positional moves. Now the question will be which player has a better chance of orchestrating a good plan from the position.
17,b4,b2b4,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2n2n2/2bp4/1P6/P1N1PN2/5PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQ - 0 9,"The idea is to cost black a tempo while developing Bb2 where it points in the right direction, plus gaining a little expansion. My guess is that in this opening white is usually concentrating on queenside play, but since the formation of the pawns has taken on a new profile, play towards the kingside seems to be warranted."
18,Bb6,c5b6,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/1bn2n2/3p4/1P6/P1N1PN2/5PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 1 10,"Black maintains what could be a good bishop line, if not for the e3 pawn, but this is a good line all the same because the e3 pawn is not fixed and could perhaps be motivated to move a little later on."
19,Bb2,c1b2,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/1bn2n2/3p4/1P6/P1N1PN2/1B3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 2 10,"White almost seems to be playing with recklessness, but there is actually no reason for concern because black has no immediate threats with which to catch the king out in the open, and castling is not far away. White simply has plans which in order to be realized require a particular ordering of pieces beforehand, even at the cost of slow castling."
20,Bf5,c8f5,r2q1rk1/pp3ppp/1bn2n2/3p1b2/1P6/P1N1PN2/1B3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 3 11,"The text move provides good central control, but I wonder if 10...Bg4 would not perhaps be an improvement."
21,Be2,f1e2,r2q1rk1/pp3ppp/1bn2n2/3p1b2/1P6/P1N1PN2/1B2BPPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 4 11,"I gave consideration to playing (11.Bb5 a6  12.Ba4) but decided against it because I wanted to make castling the priority, and because I did not want the bishop idling on the a4 diagonal - there is simply nothing to do there."
22,d4,d5d4,r2q1rk1/pp3ppp/1bn2n2/5b2/1P1p4/P1N1PN2/1B2BPPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 12,"!? A move that could be considered good or bad, depending upon ones point of view. It certainly did open up a box of fireworks, and so I definitely approve of the action it generates, but to whose favor does this move lean? The results may make one think white, the computer was probably heading for complexity to favor black, but perhaps the truth is actually balancing somewhere in the middle."
23,exd4,e3d4,r2q1rk1/pp3ppp/1bn2n2/5b2/1P1P4/P1N2N2/1B2BPPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 12,"Essentially this move answers the question, do you like a complicated game, and the answer is a resounding yes."
