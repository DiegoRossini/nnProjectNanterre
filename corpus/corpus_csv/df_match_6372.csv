1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"this was an interesting game where i had to conserve my nerves against a powerful and intimidating attack. hopefully there was nothing probing in it, and i had the opportunity to claim back the center to take the initiative, until i had the possibility to gain a pawn, There is wher my opponent decided to ""give"" me a bishop... the end is less funny."
