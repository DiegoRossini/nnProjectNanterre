1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I usually play d4 first move but recently i saw a beautiful game with a variation in king's gambit that i never saw before: 3.Bc4 instead of Nf3.
I thought that in king's gambit not to play 3.Nf3 is madness.I already won 2 or 3 games with this variation and lost only one.I like it very much because it leads to open game with great attacking potential from both sides.
So i start with e4 and hope for e5"
