16,O-O-O,e8c8,2kr1bnr/pppq2pp/2p1b3/4Pp2/3P4/2P5/PP2QPPP/RNB1KB1R w KQ - 1 9,Black has a slight edge in development thanks to White's misplaced Queen.

On the one hand, White is anticipating the coming endgame by keeping his King centralized. It also is the least disruptive to White's current plans. On the other hand, it's not the endgame *yet* by any means, so Black might be able to make some tactical opportunities against the exposed, centralized King. In the game, I was expecting 18.Bd2."
