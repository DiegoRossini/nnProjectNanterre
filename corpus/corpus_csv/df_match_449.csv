6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3pP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"I prefer not to give up the center to two attacking bishops and no development, so I like the Soerensen defense.  d5 allows both of my bishops to get into the mix and provides a counterpunch in the center."
7,Qxd4,d1d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3QP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"A fairly common response, White wastes no time regaining pawn parity and has a strong presence with the queen."
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/3QP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 1 5,Standard development.  Aids the d pawn.
9,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p2B1/3QP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RN2KBNR b KQkq - 2 5,Applying pressure to the knight to pin against the queen.
10,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bqkb1r/pppn1ppp/5n2/3p2B1/3QP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RN2KBNR w KQkq - 3 6,protecting the f knight but also offering a queen trade if White really wants it.
11,Qxd5,d4d5,r1bqkb1r/pppn1ppp/5n2/3Q2B1/4P3/2P5/PP3PPP/RN2KBNR b KQkq - 0 6,"I knew that my options to castle would die, but I opted to try something different.  Perhaps keeping the knight and immediately retaking with 7.... kxd8 would have been better, planning to retake the pawn with Bxf2 down the road, but I just wanted to see what would happen here...  If White takes Bxc7, I can retake Nxe4."
12,Nxd5,f6d5,r1bqkb1r/pppn1ppp/8/3n2B1/4P3/2P5/PP3PPP/RN2KBNR w KQkq - 0 7,"I knew that my options to castle would die, but I opted to try something different.

15,Nxc3,b1c3,r1bBkb1r/pppn1ppp/8/8/4P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 0 8,"Best response from White.  Any time you can regain parity and develop a piece, it's a win."
16,Kxd8,e8d8,r1bk1b1r/pppn1ppp/8/8/4P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R3KBNR w KQ - 0 9,We're pretty even at this point.  White needs to try and get his castle on to link up his rooks if possible.

19,Bc4,f1c4,r1bk3r/pppn1ppp/8/8/1bB1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R3K2R b KQ - 3 10,breaking up his pawns that would eventually threaten my queenside.  My hope is that the 3-2 pawn advantage will turn into a promotion.
20,Bxc3+,b4c3,r1bk3r/pppn1ppp/8/8/2B1P3/2b2N2/PP3PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 11,breaking up his pawns that would eventually threaten my queenside.  My hope is that the 3-2 pawn advantage will turn into a promotion.
21,bxc3,b2c3,r1bk3r/pppn1ppp/8/8/2B1P3/2P2N2/P4PPP/R3K2R b KQ - 0 11,protecting the pawn from the bishop
22,f6,f7f6,r1bk3r/pppn2pp/5p2/8/2B1P3/2P2N2/P4PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 12,protecting the pawn from the bishop
23,O-O,e1g1,r1bk3r/pppn2pp/5p2/8/2B1P3/2P2N2/P4PPP/R4RK1 b - - 1 12,Giving my king a space for a manual castle.
24,c6,c7c6,r1bk3r/pp1n2pp/2p2p2/8/2B1P3/2P2N2/P4PPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 13,Giving my king a space for a manual castle.
25,Rad1,a1d1,r1bk3r/pp1n2pp/2p2p2/8/2B1P3/2P2N2/P4PPP/3R1RK1 b - - 1 13,"Adding pressure to my knight, perhaps with an eye towards Be6 down the road."
26,Kc7,d8c7,r1b4r/ppkn2pp/2p2p2/8/2B1P3/2P2N2/P4PPP/3R1RK1 w - - 2 14,I'm not certain of the utility of this move.  The lone pawn can only do so much.  Odds are bringing the knight closer (Nd4) to the Black king would provide more options for mounting an attack.  The other downside is that this move allows Black to go up a pawn.
27,a4,a2a4,r1b4r/ppkn2pp/2p2p2/8/P1B1P3/2P2N2/5PPP/3R1RK1 b - - 0 14,I'm not certain of the utility of this move.  The lone pawn can only do so much.

28,Nc5,d7c5,r1b4r/ppk3pp/2p2p2/2n5/P1B1P3/2P2N2/5PPP/3R1RK1 w - - 1 15,"I think ultimately White would be better served to keep the pawn on a4, as two passed pawns down the line can spell trouble."
29,e5,e4e5,r1b4r/ppk3pp/2p2p2/2n1P3/P1B5/2P2N2/5PPP/3R1RK1 b - - 0 15,"I think ultimately White would be better served to keep the pawn on a4, as two passed pawns down the line can spell trouble."
30,fxe5,f6e5,r1b4r/ppk3pp/2p5/2n1p3/P1B5/2P2N2/5PPP/3R1RK1 w - - 0 16,"Despite being up a pawn, I need to get my rooks into the game."
31,Nxe5,f3e5,r1b4r/ppk3pp/2p5/2n1N3/P1B5/2P5/5PPP/3R1RK1 b - - 0 16,"Despite being up a pawn, I need to get my rooks into the game."

33,Rd4,d1d4,r1b4r/ppk3pp/2p5/4N3/n1BR4/2P5/5PPP/5RK1 b - - 1 17,I'm not interested in taking the c pawn as that would give his rooks and two pieces direct lines of attack on my king.
34,b5,b7b5,r1b4r/p1k3pp/2p5/1p2N3/n1BR4/2P5/5PPP/5RK1 w - - 0 18,Hope to chase away that pesky bishop into a less desirable location.
