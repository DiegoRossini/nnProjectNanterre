1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Same routine King Pawn 2
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,He has mirrored.  I quite like that.
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,Protect my pawn. Ng6?
4,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/8/2p1p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,That is so he can bring his Knight out off b8 without trapping c7 pawn (He told me last time we played).
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/8/2p1p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,So Knight out..  Next Nc6!!
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n5/2p1p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,Told you.
7,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n5/2p1p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 4,Bishop attacks f7 and enables castling option.
8,h6,h7h6,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1pp1/2n4p/2p1p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,Brother Dardon and I play all the time he always thinks I am after his rook.  I am guessing this is to stop my knight moving to g5 threatening the fork on f7.
9,a3,a2a3,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1pp1/2n4p/2p1p3/2B1P3/P1N2N2/1PPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,This will be no surprise to him.  He knows I do this for the extra space for my bishop on a2 whilst preventing Nb4.
10,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1pp1/2n2n1p/2p1p3/2B1P3/P1N2N2/1PPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 6,The trouble you get when you talk about your games is the player you talk to starts to understand your way of thinking.  I thought h6 was to protect my knight going for the fork (as he told me was a concern previously).  But instead it is to prevent......
11,d3,d2d3,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1pp1/2n2n1p/2p1p3/2B1P3/P1NP1N2/1PP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,.......me going to g5 with my bishop and taking his knight after this move    ( as I told him due to my liking for the d5 square attacked with knight on f6)
12,d6,d7d6,r1bqkb1r/pp3pp1/2np1n1p/2p1p3/2B1P3/P1NP1N2/1PP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,Strengthening the two pawns this also opens up his white squared bishops diagonal.
13,Nd5,c3d5,r1bqkb1r/pp3pp1/2np1n1p/2pNp3/2B1P3/P2P1N2/1PP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,Not liking his knight protecting this square I offer knight for knight.  I am sure he knows I want it but will he accept?
14,Be6,c8e6,r2qkb1r/pp3pp1/2npbn1p/2pNp3/2B1P3/P2P1N2/1PP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 8,After our previous discussion he chooses to refuse the knight exchange.  I do not like this move as It may harm my pawn structure in the event of exchanges.
15,Nxf6+,d5f6,r2qkb1r/pp3pp1/2npbN1p/2p1p3/2B1P3/P2P1N2/1PP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,I decide to at least take his knight.  I am not sure if he wants knight or bishop and I preferably do not want to exchange both of them.
16,Qxf6,d8f6,r3kb1r/pp3pp1/2npbq1p/2p1p3/2B1P3/P2P1N2/1PP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,"Got my knight.  This attacks my king side of the board in the event of me castling.  Clears the path for his queenside castling.  Backs up his bishop If I decide to exchange, keeping his pawn structure in tact."
17,Bd2,c1d2,r3kb1r/pp3pp1/2npbq1p/2p1p3/2B1P3/P2P1N2/1PPB1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 9,Because of the attack on my king side and the strength of his defence king side. I am going to open up the possibility of queen side castling. Bd2 protects king here for now and keeps diagonal options open.
18,Qd8,f6d8,r2qkb1r/pp3pp1/2npb2p/2p1p3/2B1P3/P2P1N2/1PPB1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 10,Strange move.  Cant see what it acheives.  Perhaps wants to bring out his bishop for king side castle without making queen vulnerable.
19,Bxe6,c4e6,r2qkb1r/pp3pp1/2npB2p/2p1p3/4P3/P2P1N2/1PPB1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 10,Originally I didn't want bishop for bishop but this will open up his king slightly and tie up f7 pawn doubling it up with e5 pawn.
20,fxe6,f7e6,r2qkb1r/pp4p1/2npp2p/2p1p3/4P3/P2P1N2/1PPB1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 11,now e6 pawn is weak and king is open for Qh5 attack.
