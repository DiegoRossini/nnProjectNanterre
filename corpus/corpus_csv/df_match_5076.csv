7,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3P4/3P4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"I decided to play the exchange variation, having lost my last outing with the quirky 4. f3 (see http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/is-this-rook-sac-really-sound?gm=36183)"
8,Nxd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/6p1/3n4/3P4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,So he takes back
9,e4,e2e4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/6p1/3n4/3PP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,I grab the centre
10,Nxc3,d5c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/6p1/8/3PP3/2n5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,He exchanges
11,bxc3,b2c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/6p1/8/3PP3/2P5/P4PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,and I take back
12,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/2P5/P4PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 7,Roman continues to develop
13,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 7,"When I first played the Gruenfeld, this was regarded as a blunder, as it allowed black to pin the knight with Bc8-g4. Instead Bc4 followed by Ne2 was recommended. I studied many games with this variation (for instance Boris Spassky beat Bobby Fischer with it at the Siegen Olympiad), and I have played it as black frequently. However in the 1980s this move came back into fashion, combined with the pawn sacrifice which occours in the game."
14,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 3 8,Black continues to develop
15,Be2,f1e2,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/2P2N2/P3BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 4 8,as does white

17,Rb1,a1b1,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/2p5/3PP3/2P2N2/P3BPPP/1RBQK2R b K - 1 9,"Now this was the ""new"" move which became popular in the 1980s. It discourages the development of the Bc8 and moves the rook off the long black diagonal, preparing the forthcoming pawn sacrifice."
