1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This is a strange game that vacillated between Queen's Pawn Gambit Declined and Accepted and ended up not really conforming to anything that I can find.
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Looking like QPG Declined
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Looking like QPG Declined
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Looking like QPG Declined
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,I go back and forth between this and Nc3
6,dxc4,d5c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/2pP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,Now the Gambit is accepted and I'm flummoxed
7,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/2pPP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,I like e4 when the Gambit is accepted by as far as I can tell we are out of book at this point
8,Bb4+,f8b4,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/1bpPP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,Development with check
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/1bpPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,I like my dark squared Bishop in the accepted gambit and this also develops my Knight
10,Bxc3+,b4c3,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/2pPP3/2b2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,This surprised me. Black loses his one developed piece and my control of the center is very strong now
11,bxc3,b2c3,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/2pPP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,I think trying to save the c pawn in the Gambit Accepted is usually a dangerous idea.
12,b5,b7b5,rnbqk1nr/p1p2ppp/4p3/1p6/2pPP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,I think trying to save the c pawn in the Gambit Accepted is usually a dangerous idea.
13,a4,a2a4,rnbqk1nr/p1p2ppp/4p3/1p6/P1pPP3/2P2N2/5PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,I remember when I first learned about a4 in this situation (from books) and was very happy.
14,c6,c7c6,rnbqk1nr/p4ppp/2p1p3/1p6/P1pPP3/2P2N2/5PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,I decided on a second knight move here because it puts pressure on the back c pawn and prevents devopment of black's queen side knight. It does delay my development for a move and 8. ... f6 is possible to drive me away although weakining the King side.
15,Ne5,f3e5,rnbqk1nr/p4ppp/2p1p3/1p2N3/P1pPP3/2P5/5PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 8,I decided on a second knight move here because it puts pressure on the back c pawn and prevents devopment of black's queen side knight. It does delay my development for a move and 8. ... f6 is possible to drive me away although weakining the King side.
16,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqk2r/p4ppp/2p1pn2/1p2N3/P1pPP3/2P5/5PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 9,Developing and attacking my e pawn
17,Ba3,c1a3,rnbqk2r/p4ppp/2p1pn2/1p2N3/P1pPP3/B1P5/5PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 3 9,I was eager to prevent the castle and completely overlooked my hanging e pawn. Ooops.
18,Ba6,c8a6,rn1qk2r/p4ppp/b1p1pn2/1p2N3/P1pPP3/B1P5/5PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 4 10,Missed the free pawn and continues to support the b pawn. I'm guessing my opponent is hoping for eventually opening of the diagonal but I think this puts the Bishop in a poor position.
19,Qc2,d1c2,rn1qk2r/p4ppp/b1p1pn2/1p2N3/P1pPP3/B1P5/2Q2PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 5 10,I thought this was a better spot for my Queen to cover the formerly hanging e pawn rather than 10. Qe2 because she can develop if the e pawn ever moves forward
20,Qb6,d8b6,rn2k2r/p4ppp/bqp1pn2/1p2N3/P1pPP3/B1P5/2Q2PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 6 11,I think hoping for eventually 11. ... Nbd7 12. Nxd7 Nxd7 to get rid of my well placed knight
21,Rb1,a1b1,rn2k2r/p4ppp/bqp1pn2/1p2N3/P1pPP3/B1P5/2Q2PPP/1R2KB1R b Kkq - 7 11,Pinning the b pawn
22,Nbd7,b8d7,r3k2r/p2n1ppp/bqp1pn2/1p2N3/P1pPP3/B1P5/2Q2PPP/1R2KB1R w Kkq - 8 12,Because of the pin I don't have to exchange or retreat anymore
23,Nxc4,e5c4,r3k2r/p2n1ppp/bqp1pn2/1p6/P1NPP3/B1P5/2Q2PPP/1R2KB1R b Kkq - 0 12,Preventing 13. Nd6+. Also available was 12. ... Qb8. Both 12. ... Qb7 and 12. Qc8 run into 13. Nd6+ Royal Fork
24,Qc7,b6c7,r3k2r/p1qn1ppp/b1p1pn2/1p6/P1NPP3/B1P5/2Q2PPP/1R2KB1R w Kkq - 1 13,Preventing 13. Nd6+. Also available was 12. ... Qb8. Both 12. ... Qb7 and 12. Qc8 run into 13. Nd6+ Royal Fork
25,Bd6,a3d6,r3k2r/p1qn1ppp/b1pBpn2/1p6/P1NPP3/2P5/2Q2PPP/1R2KB1R b Kkq - 2 13,I'm thinking eventually e5 makes that Bishop difficult to dislodge. It also continues to prevent the Kingside Castle and threatens the Queen preventing black from 13. ... bxc4. I also thought about 13. e5 now but I'm still several moves from castling on my Kingside and I didn't want the knight heading in that direction
