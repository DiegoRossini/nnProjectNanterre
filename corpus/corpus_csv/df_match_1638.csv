3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,White goes for the closed Sicilian to try for a more positional type of game.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,"Logical moves have been played so far. With d4, white plans to dominate and attack the center while I will continue natural development until I see which side of the board white chooses to castle."

8,cxd4,c5d4,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/8/3pP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"While the Sozin variation is still playable, it is not as popular as it once was because a pawn push to e6 neutralizes much of the LSB power along the a2-g8 diagonal."

12,e6,e7e6,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2nppn2/8/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"As mentioned before, this move shuts out the bishop from any future king-side attacks."
13,Be3,c1e3,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2nppn2/8/2BNP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 7,"All part of the main variation. With the swift development of the queen side, white aims to castle on the queen side and look to push through the black's king side with a pawn storm."

21,Rhg1,h1g1,r1b2rk1/1pq1bppp/p1nppn2/8/3NP3/1BN1B3/PPP1QPPP/2KR2R1 b - - 5 11,"Although 11. g4 could have been played right away by white, this move further supports the advancement to try and rip open black's king side."
22,b5,b7b5,r1b2rk1/2q1bppp/p1nppn2/1p6/3NP3/1BN1B3/PPP1QPPP/2KR2R1 w - - 0 12,The first deviation from the main line. This knight exchange benefits black because it gives more time and space for queen side development.
23,Nxc6,d4c6,r1b2rk1/2q1bppp/p1Nppn2/1p6/4P3/1BN1B3/PPP1QPPP/2KR2R1 b - - 0 12,The first deviation from the main line. This knight exchange benefits black because it gives more time and space for queen side development.

27,g4,g2g4,r4rk1/3bbppp/p1qppn2/1p6/4P1P1/1BN1BP2/PPP1Q2P/2KR2R1 b - - 0 14,"Threatening to trap white's bishop. However, before white looks to defend, it is crucial that white continues with its plan first before defending."

29,a4,a2a4,r4rk1/3bbppp/2qppn2/pp6/P3P1P1/1BN1BP2/1PP1Q2P/2KR2R1 b - - 0 15,"?! This move can wait. It was important for white to continue with its own by playing 15. g5! first to force the knight to retreat to e8 so that the rook on f8 would remain inactive. Now, after the exchange of pawns there will be an open file that the f8 rook can exploit."
30,bxa4,b5a4,r4rk1/3bbppp/2qppn2/p7/p3P1P1/1BN1BP2/1PP1Q2P/2KR2R1 w - - 0 16,The most logical square to retreat to where the queen can potentially attack the weak b2 pawn.

34,Rfc8,f8c8,r1r3k1/1q1bbppp/3ppn2/p7/B3P1P1/1PN1BP2/2P1Q2P/2KR2R1 w - - 1 18,Exploiting the weakness of the dark squares around white's king to develop and attack the knight at the same time.
35,Bxd7,a4d7,r1r3k1/1q1Bbppp/3ppn2/p7/4P1P1/1PN1BP2/2P1Q2P/2KR2R1 b - - 0 18,"? A mistake, leaving me two options the knight or the bishop. If I was to play Nxd7 my knight could have made excellent use of the e5 square afterwards and I would be able to put a lot of pressure of the king. However, I opted to capture the knight which also puts great pressure on the king."
