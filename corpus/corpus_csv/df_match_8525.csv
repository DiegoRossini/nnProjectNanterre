Nc3 we reach the Owen's Defense (more common from a side line of the French Defense with 1. e4 e6, 2. d4 b6, 3 Nc3). Owen's Defense is considered by most to be fairly inferior, allowing white to establish and hold a superior center while black falls behind in development. According to Wiki, it's greatest use is surprising opponents who aren't prepared for it, which may be great in a tournament hall, but not so great in online or correspondence chess where books and other references are allowed. However, white deviates with a different line, preparing to castle kingside earlier than would be possible after 3. Nc3."

I'm juggling 25 games or so, I've never seen this opening, and I'm relying on the GK DB to guide me through the first moves so I don't screw them up while I spend much more time on a dozen other games that are all demanding moves. The DB said 4. Bd3. I looked in the DB, came back to the game and played 4. Be3?. I don't know why. I guess too much hurry and not enough attention, and zero analysis of what the move actually looked like. So yeah, white loses a pawn here, for nothing. Because I'm an idiot."
