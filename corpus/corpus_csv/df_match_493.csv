We needed at least a draw away to Wrexham 2 to become champions. They out-rated us on the top board, but we out-rated them on the bottom three boards."

13,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqk1nr/pp3pbp/2npp1p1/2p5/4PP2/2NP1NP1/PPP3BP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,The logical square for his King side knight.

17,Be3,c1e3,r1bqk2r/1p2npbp/p1npp1p1/2p5/4PP2/2NPBNP1/PPP3BP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 1 9,"With is bishop on this square I now begin to think in terms of playing d6-d5 and threaten d5-d4 forking his Be3 and Nc3. However an immediate d6-d5 is met by Be3xc5, so I have to prepare with b7-b6. An immediate 9....b7-b6 leaves me weak on the long white diagonal, for instance he can play 10. e4-e5 and if dxe4 he has 11. Nf3xe5 and my Nc6 is pinned along the diagonal. So I decide to move my rook off a8 first."
