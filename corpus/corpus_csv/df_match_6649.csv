1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

This game was viewed as a success because although it is a draw on paper, any Expert Draw is a moral victory, at least at the moment!  The Petrov starts off as 1. e4 e5, Nf3 and then Nf6 instead of the usual Nc6.  The Petrov has been discussed a little more in my previous annotation against dtdominates in which I won.  So we pick up the action from move 5 where Dave deviated from that game with Nc3 instead of d3."
