1,b3,b2b3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,The Nimzo-Larsen Attack...a hypermodern opening with the idea to counter-attack from the flank. There will be no variations given as this is my first effort and I plan on taking a more narrative approach.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Already I was uncomfortable at his response, i'm still learning this opening and i have never seen this response before, i'm sure my discomfort will pass, it's all part of the learning curve when using a new opening."
3,Bb2,c1b2,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/8/1P6/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"fianchettoing my queen's bishop, notice how it points like a lazer beam down into the heart of black's king side."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/8/1P6/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,Both sides appear to be approaching the center from a safe distance.
5,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/8/1P3N2/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 3 3,developing my pieces getting them ready to see active duty.
6,d5,d7d5,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/2pp4/8/1P3N2/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Okay, now black has taken a foothold in the center."
7,e3,e2e3,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/2pp4/8/1P2PN2/PBPP1PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,i continue to develop `nimzo-larsen` style...this pawn move allows me to develop my king's bishop while possibly supporting another pawn advance in the center later on in the game.....er war...my queen is also is allowed a little more space.
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/2pp4/8/1P2PN2/PBPP1PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,This bishop will play an important role of omission later in the game. On one level it is comedy but to the white king it will be a tragedy.
9,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/1Bpp4/8/1P2PN2/PBPP1PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 2 5,This bishop will play an important role of omission later in the game. On one level it is comedy but to the white king it will be a tragedy.
10,Bd7,c8d7,r2qkb1r/pp1bpppp/2n2n2/1Bpp4/8/1P2PN2/PBPP1PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 3 6,black of course pursues his own plans of developing his pieces.
11,O-O,e1g1,r2qkb1r/pp1bpppp/2n2n2/1Bpp4/8/1P2PN2/PBPP1PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 4 6,black seeks to counteract my own bishop on the long diagonal.
12,g6,g7g6,r2qkb1r/pp1bpp1p/2n2np1/1Bpp4/8/1P2PN2/PBPP1PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 0 7,black seeks to counteract my own bishop on the long diagonal.
13,c4,c2c4,r2qkb1r/pp1bpp1p/2n2np1/1Bpp4/2P5/1P2PN2/PB1P1PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 0 7,"Classic `nimso-larsen`stuff, I attack his center from the flank, notice how my b pawn backs up this attack on black's center."
14,dxc4,d5c4,r2qkb1r/pp1bpp1p/2n2np1/1Bp5/2p5/1P2PN2/PB1P1PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 0 8,"an important development, he gives up a center pawn while I hang on to my own, this will help give me a more attractive pawn structure going into the middle game, notice too how i have not committed either of my center pawns to the center yet, they stand ready to advance later in the middle game, i like the idea of holding my center pawns back initially, all part and parcel of hypermodern strategy."
15,bxc4,b3c4,r2qkb1r/pp1bpp1p/2n2np1/1Bp5/2P5/4PN2/PB1P1PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 0 8,"an important development, he gives up a center pawn while I hang on to my own, this will help give me a more attractive pawn structure going into the middle game, notice too how i have not committed either of my center pawns to the center yet, they stand ready to advance later in the middle game, i like the idea of holding my center pawns back initially, all part and parcel of hypermodern strategy."
