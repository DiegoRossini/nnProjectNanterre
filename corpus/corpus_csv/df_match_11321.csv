1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I am White. I played this game in a live tournament where I won a first place trophy with a 5-0 score.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Mostly all of the players in Bakersfield tournaments including me play 1...c5
3,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,"I usually play c3 instead of Bc4, but I'm the scourge of Bakersfield tournaments and was afraid the players were getting accustomed to my normal openings."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 3,"One of several good moves. Other good moves are 2...g6, 2...d6, 2...e6, and 2...Nf6. 
I play 2...Nf6 because I like the sharp unbalanced battles that arise after 2...Nf6 e5 d5 exf6 dxc4 fxg7 Bxg7, because I am leading in development, but my doubled c-pawns could become a weakness."
5,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 3 3,"I need to control d5 as much as possible, because in this opening, it is common for Black to play e6 Ne7 d5, gaining space in the centre and making my bishop move again."
6,d6,d7d6,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/2p5/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 4,"This move adds to Black's control of the central dark squares, and g6 Bg7 does the same. I recommend g6 Bg7 in this position because it aids in castling along with control of the dark squares. The move d6 should only be played if extra control of e5 is needed, or if Black needs to develop his queen's bishop."
7,f4,f2f4,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/2p5/2B1PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 4,"This is the Grand Prix Attack. I rarely play this opening as White, but will if I am playing a low rated player or someone who knows my normal c3 opening. I never studied it, so most of my experience came from when I play against this opening as Black."
8,e5,e7e5,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2np4/2p1p3/2B1PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,"This move may appear strong to amateurs, because Black is clearly dominating the dark squares, but he has given me a spot on d5 where I can keep a piece in his territory, and he cannot chase it away with a pawn."
9,d3,d2d3,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2np4/2p1p3/2B1PP2/2NP4/PPP3PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,"5. fxe5? is a bad move, even though it gives up an f-pawn for a more important d-pawn, it gives Black an open d-file, and I need my f-pawn because a common move in this opening is to play f5, gaining space on the kingside, and maybe following up with g4 h4 then g5.
So f5 was a good move in this position, but I played d3 because I wanted Black to take on f4, giving me a more mobil and better developed position. But f5 was better, because Black has usually played g6, stopping f5."
10,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2np1n2/2p1p3/2B1PP2/2NP4/PPP3PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 1 6,"Black should've played g6, which stops f5, but instead allows the f5 move again."
11,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2np1n2/2p1p3/2B1PP2/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 6,"A positional blunder. Much better is f5 followed by g4 and h4, with a strong kingside attack. But I wasn't very experienced playing this opening as White. Here Black should've played Bg4, because after trading on f3, Black has control of d4, giving me complications."
12,Nd4,c6d4,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/3p1n2/2p1p3/2BnPP2/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 3 7,"Black wants to defend against my threat of Ng5 by moving a piece to e6 obstructing the bishop's path, but Bg4 is a much easier way of doing this, and after he trades, he should have about equality."
13,Ng5,f3g5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/3p1n2/2p1p1N1/2BnPP2/2NP4/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 4 7,"I'm not winning yet, but I'm starting to gain a kingside initiative."
14,Be6,c8e6,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/3pbn2/2p1p1N1/2BnPP2/2NP4/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 5 8,"Ne6 gives Black an uncomfortable cramped position after Nxf7 Kxf7 f5, because I win the piece back while exposing Black's king."
15,Nxe6,g5e6,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/3pNn2/2p1p3/2BnPP2/2NP4/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,"Nxe6 gives me an f5 tempo, plus good control of the light squares because Black's light bishop is gone."
16,fxe6,f7e6,r2qkb1r/pp4pp/3ppn2/2p1p3/2BnPP2/2NP4/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,"Nxe6 gives me an f5 tempo, plus good control of the light squares because Black's light bishop is gone."
17,fxe5,f4e5,r2qkb1r/pp4pp/3ppn2/2p1P3/2BnP3/2NP4/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 9,"Black stopped the possible f5 plan, so now I want to weaken Black's centre pawns to attack."
18,dxe5,d6e5,r2qkb1r/pp4pp/4pn2/2p1p3/2BnP3/2NP4/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 10,Black's e-pawns are weak because neither can be protected by pawns.
19,O-O,e1g1,r2qkb1r/pp4pp/4pn2/2p1p3/2BnP3/2NP4/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 10,"Not completely neccesary. I wanted to control the f-file with my rook, but it does hardly anything for my plan to weaken Black's doubled pawns."
20,a6,a7a6,r2qkb1r/1p4pp/p3pn2/2p1p3/2BnP3/2NP4/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 11,"Black wants to gain space on the queenside with b5, disrupting my c-file units."
21,a4,a2a4,r2qkb1r/1p4pp/p3pn2/2p1p3/P1BnP3/2NP4/1PP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 11,"I don't need any further complications interfering with my plans, so this simple move stops Black's intended queenside expansion."
