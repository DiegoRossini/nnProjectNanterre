1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"On to round two of the 2007 Alabama State Championship. Feeling a little lucky after escaping round one with the full point, I approach this game with a fresh attitude and my new pet 1. Nf3."
2,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,"?! We could debate the pros and cons of this move forever, but I question it on many levels. Suffice it to say that I felt this move a provacative insult, fully deserving to be punished as soon as possible."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,Logical development which also hits e5.
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3pp3/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,?! Another move that just begs to be punished. Time for a big center and rapid development.
5,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3pp3/8/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,Of course.
6,h6,h7h6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/3pp2p/8/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"?  I'm trying not to actually salivate on the board. I have no idea what my opponent is thinking, but I am hoping that he continues to think it."
7,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/3pp2p/8/2PPP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,Laying claim to a HUGE center.
8,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp3pp1/2ppp2p/8/2PPP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"? Black has shown me nothing so far. I guess he decided to just hunker down to defend my first attack. I have determined that this game is gonna be 100% offense for me. With my huge space advantage and lead in development, I figure this to be a very entertaining attack."
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp3pp1/2ppp2p/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,I have no idea.............
10,Qc7,d8c7,rnb1kbnr/ppq2pp1/2ppp2p/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,I have no idea.............
11,Bd3,f1d3,rnb1kbnr/ppq2pp1/2ppp2p/8/2PPP3/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 6,Prepping e5 which opens lines if he 0-0.
12,g5,g7g5,rnb1kbnr/ppq2p2/2ppp2p/6p1/2PPP3/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"? Ugly. Six moves in and black has yet to develop a knight or bishop, and 6...g5 just opens up real estate around his king. This is gonna be fun:)"
13,e5,e4e5,rnb1kbnr/ppq2p2/2ppp2p/4P1p1/2PP4/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,My LSB is now a righteous dude.
14,Nd7,b8d7,r1b1kbnr/ppqn1p2/2ppp2p/4P1p1/2PP4/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 8,Keep your eyes on this knight. He sits right here on d7 for the next 14 moves:)
15,exd6,e5d6,r1b1kbnr/ppqn1p2/2pPp2p/6p1/2PP4/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,"?! Perhaps not my best, as this move allows black to develop. However, I'm thinking Ne4 holds promise."
16,Bxd6,f8d6,r1b1k1nr/ppqn1p2/2pbp2p/6p1/2PP4/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,"The primary goal of this move is to immediately threaten capture on f6 if he moves a knight there. The second goal of this move is to trade knight for bishop on d6, then play an eventual Ne5 blockading his e pawn (which by proxy blockades his LSB). If I can accomplish this, then I should have some really good attacking lines on the kingside."
17,Ne4,c3e4,r1b1k1nr/ppqn1p2/2pbp2p/6p1/2PPN3/3B1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 9,"The primary goal of this move is to immediately threaten capture on f6 if he moves a knight there. The second goal of this move is to trade knight for bishop on d6, then play an eventual Ne5 blockading his e pawn (which by proxy blockades his LSB).

19,Bd2,c1d2,r1b1k1nr/ppqn1p2/2p1p2p/6p1/1bPPN3/3B1N2/PP1B1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 3 10,?? Now he wants to trade queens and double his f pawns? I'm drooling again.

24,gxf4,g5f4,r1b1k1nr/pp1n1p2/2p1p2p/8/2PPNp2/3B1N2/PP3PPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 13,"I'm reminded of the Marcellus Wallace line from 'Pulp Fiction'. You know, the one about getting medeival:)"
25,Nd6+,e4d6,r1b1k1nr/pp1n1p2/2pNp2p/8/2PP1p2/3B1N2/PP3PPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 1 13,"I'm reminded of the Marcellus Wallace line from 'Pulp Fiction'. You know, the one about getting medeival:)"
26,Ke7,e8e7,r1b3nr/pp1nkp2/2pNp2p/8/2PP1p2/3B1N2/PP3PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 2 14,?! Kf8 looks so much better here.
