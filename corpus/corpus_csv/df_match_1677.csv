5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"Nxe5 is actually pretty common.  It looks like a stupid trade, a knight for a pawn, but black generally does not take the knight, because white responds with Qh5+.  Whether black responds with g6 or Ke7, white comes back with Qxe5+."
