I still remember a tournament I played in back in the 80s. Every game reached a similar position, and they were all kind of dull; I think I went 2-3 in that tournament. I remember thinking that if I wanted to excel in chess, I should study and become an expert in that position and drive all of my games to that position.  And I knew if I did that, I'd get bored with chess and not be playing after a few years. My decision after that tournament was to try to avoid playing boring chess -- when I have a choice between a safe and an interesting move, I want to play the interesting move. And chess has always been fun for me using that philosophy!
