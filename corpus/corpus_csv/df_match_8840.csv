1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Welcome to my Trompowsky annotation. This opponent had previously employed the Samisch to attack my King's Indian Defense when we last played with the same colors. The success of the KID in that game had me on red alert for what to expect from this encounter.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,I proceed with my KID.
3,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/6B1/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 2 2,This introduces the Trompowsky Attack. White does not want a conventional King's Indian Defense and intends to take the game into original territory by exchanging bishop for knight and doubling Black's f-pawns.
4,Ne4,f6e4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/6B1/3Pn3/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 3 3,"White has essentially put the question to the knight (and the pawns that would have had to recapture). Black has a number of responses here including 2_c5, 2_e6, and the text. I prefer the text because it often leads to active positional play and because I also like reflecting White's strategy by putting the question back on the bishop."
5,Bf4,g5f4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/8/3PnB2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 4 3,3.h4 is also currently fashionable.
6,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3PnB2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Both sides have a minor piece that has been developed, attacked, and moved again. Black plays 3_c5 hoping to maintain the knight on e4 or at least gain a concession before retreating it."
7,f3,f2f3,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3PnB2/5P2/PPP1P1PP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,Now White enters one of the most popular lines of the Tromp. Whether the game remains open or closed (and it can do both from this tabia in my experience) the play is usually very sharp. Since my worthy opponent had previously employed the Samisch it seems fitting here that he employs a system with a similar pawn structure (f3) that is so thematic in that opening as well. This move does challenge the knight on the e4 square but it does so at the cost of White taking away the best development square from his own knight (see previous note).
8,Qa5+,d8a5,rnb1kb1r/pp1ppppp/8/q1p5/3PnB2/5P2/PPP1P1PP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,This is the point of Black's previous move. It allows the knight on e4 to influence White's game before it has to retreat (or be exchanged).
9,c3,c2c3,rnb1kb1r/pp1ppppp/8/q1p5/3PnB2/2P2P2/PP2P1PP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,Logical.
10,Nf6,e4f6,rnb1kb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/q1p5/3P1B2/2P2P2/PP2P1PP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,White has an important decision to make.
11,Nd2,b1d2,rnb1kb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/q1p5/3P1B2/2P2P2/PP1NP1PP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 2 6,"6.d5 is a strong alternative that grabs space. The text, however, is usually going for an endgame where White's better pawns are mitigated by Black's bishop pair."
12,cxd4,c5d4,rnb1kb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/q7/3p1B2/2P2P2/PP1NP1PP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,Freeing my Queen from having to recapture on the next move and exposing the fifth rank to my queen's influence (no Bg5 repetitions thank you!).
13,Nb3,d2b3,rnb1kb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/q7/3p1B2/1NP2P2/PP2P1PP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 1 7,This is what White is playing for when he plays 6.Nd2.
14,Qb6,a5b6,rnb1kb1r/pp1ppppp/1q3n2/8/3p1B2/1NP2P2/PP2P1PP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 2 8,8_Nc6 is the popular move here. But I like the text better. White wanted an endgame with the better pawns. Had I played 8_Nc6 White could have proceeded with 9.Qxb6 when 9_axb6 is just the pawn-weakening White was aiming for.
15,Qxd4,d1d4,rnb1kb1r/pp1ppppp/1q3n2/8/3Q1B2/1NP2P2/PP2P1PP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 0 8,8_Nc6 is the popular move here. But I like the text better. White wanted an endgame with the better pawns. Had I played 8_Nc6 White could have proceeded with 9.Qxb6 when 9_axb6 is just the pawn-weakening White was aiming for.
16,Qxd4,b6d4,rnb1kb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/8/3q1B2/1NP2P2/PP2P1PP/R3KBNR w KQkq - 0 9,8_Nc6 is the popular move here. But I like the text better. White wanted an endgame with the better pawns. Had I played 8_Nc6 White could have proceeded with 9.Qxb6 when 9_axb6 is just the pawn-weakening White was aiming for.
17,Nxd4,b3d4,rnb1kb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/8/3N1B2/2P2P2/PP2P1PP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 0 9,"I was expecting 9.cxd4 when White has a formidable center that Black will have to be careful about handling. With the piece recapture it gives Black, at the cost of a few forced moves, an easier game in my opinion."
18,a6,a7a6,rnb1kb1r/1p1ppppp/p4n2/8/3N1B2/2P2P2/PP2P1PP/R3KBNR w KQkq - 0 10,Keeping the knight away from b5 and c7.
19,e4,e2e4,rnb1kb1r/1p1ppppp/p4n2/8/3NPB2/2P2P2/PP4PP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 0 10,"Logical. Improving the White position, releasing the White squared bishop (that once deployed will allow the g1 knight an opportunity on the e2 square), and threatening 11.e5."
20,d6,d7d6,rnb1kb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NPB2/2P2P2/PP4PP/R3KBNR w KQkq - 0 11,This felt forced for me. Its obvious I'm trying to punish the knight recapture on move 9 with a fork on the e5 square. But the text also prevents 11.e5 and opens the diagonal for my own White squared bishop.
21,Nb3,d4b3,rnb1kb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/4PB2/1NP2P2/PP4PP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 1 11,Avoiding the fork and putting an eye on the a5 square.
22,e5,e7e5,rnb1kb1r/1p3ppp/p2p1n2/4p3/4PB2/1NP2P2/PP4PP/R3KBNR w KQkq - 0 12,This was going to be a KID if you remember. I was hoping to get in Be6 & d5 (potentially with a knight on b6 and a rook on d8 defending) making the d6 pawn backward only temporarily. White could prevent it but would have to forgo developing his kingside pieces.
