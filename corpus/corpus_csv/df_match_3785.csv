In this case the exchange is by far the most often played, in the 4...c5 line Black has the option of choosing the sideline 5...cxd4!? 6.axb4 dxc3 and now not 7.bxc3?! but 7.Nf3! with good play for the pawn."
10,Bxc3+,b4c3,rnbqk2r/ppp1nppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/P1b5/1PP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"!? A rare line, far more common is 6...c5, striking immediately at white's center. After some research I found out that the idea of this line is probably to play ...Ba6, exchanging White's strong Bishop for the 'French bishop' which is often a problem for Black, but considering the continuation of this game I'm not quite sure if Black was aware of the plan in this opening."

According to the DB's this is also the main line here. It strikes at Black's g7 pawn and sets up an attack against the Black kingside."
14,Ng6,e7g6,rnbqk2r/p1p2ppp/1p2p1n1/3pP3/3P2Q1/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 2 8,"The most played move in this position, but according to my coach this is a bad place for the knight, because it does nothing except for blocking off the Queen's way to g7. But probably Black can't let go the g7 pawn in this variation, because he doesn't have the quick counterplay like in the main line Winawer. Other moves would not be very good: 7...O-O is just castling into the storm, 7...Nf5 invites 8.Bd3 attacking the knight and threatening to remove the protection of the g7 pawn with 9.Bxf5 exf5, 7...Kf8 takes away Black's castling opportunity so the rook won't get into the game very soon and 7...g6 is just a weakening move. All in all I think this was the best move in the position."

Black should really seek counterplay with ...c5 at some point and this blocks off that option, so Black would need at least one other move to make it possible. Here 8...Ba6 was played 9 times and 8...Qh4 twice, according to the 365chess.com database."
