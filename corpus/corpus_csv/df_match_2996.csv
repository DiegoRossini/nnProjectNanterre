12,b5,b7b5,rnbqkb1r/4pppp/p2p1n2/1p6/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"Interesting .... Normal is 6...e6.  Hendrik explained that this has the advantage of preventing White from answering 6...e6 with 7.a4, which is not a move I've contemplated before.  As played, we trasnpose to the normal line anyway."
13,Bb3,c4b3,rnbqkb1r/4pppp/p2p1n2/1p6/3NP3/1BN5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,"White attacks the centre without delay.  I find I'm slightly more successful with this than with immediate castling.  The difficulty with this opening is getting the move order right to gain the initiative without leaving oneself open to devastating counters.  This move, for example, leaves the a7-g1 diagonal very weak."
14,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/5ppp/p2ppn2/1p6/3NP3/1BN5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"White attacks the centre without delay.  I find I'm slightly more successful with this than with immediate castling.

16,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/4bppp/p2ppn2/1p6/3NPP2/1BN5/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 9,"Possibly a wasted move as the B soon has to move again.  This move does prepare the possibility of Q-side castling and appears to reduce the exposure on the a7-g1 diagonal, but in some variations the B itself becomes a liability as it is unprotected.  The Nd4 can become pinned against it."

Qf3 but this ties the Q to the e-pawn's defence and pins the pawn against the Q, reducing its scope for involvement in attack."

If Black takes the e-pawn with his N, White retakes and has a dangerous attack on f7, so, if Black recaptures on f5, White penetrates deep into Black's position on f7, with plentiful attacking options.."

However, I decided that it was more important to follow the old adage of capturing towards the centre, allowing my c-pawn to contest control of the d3 square.  The move I should have considered in more detail than I did was 19. Bb6!?, skewering Q and R.  Would Black then have taken on a1 or moved the Q?"
