1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hello, I would like to annotate an enjoyable game that I recently played here on Gameknot. There are quite a few mistakes in the game, but I have tried to explain in a way that lower rated players can learn something."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"c5, the Sicilian defence. e4 is perhaps the most common opening move, so it is essential to learn a good response to it. I prefer to play c5 rather than e5 because it is more aggressive and gives black a more open game."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"d6 is the most common move here by black, but Nc6 is absolutely playable. The idea is to challenge the d4 square."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"d6 is the most common move here by black, but Nc6 is absolutely playable. The idea is to challenge the d4 square."
5,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,Bc4 is not a move I have seen often. The gameknot database suggests that it is slightly inferior to the more common move of d4 (initiating the pawn exchange by black). Bb5 and Nc3 also yield better results for white overall.
6,e6,e7e6,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,"Planning to play d5, driving back whites LSB, gaining tempo, space and control of the centre."
7,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,Developing the knight to a good square and preventing d5 for the moment.
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/2p5/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,Developing the knight to a good square and preparing again to play d5.
9,d3,d2d3,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/2p5/2B1P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,Activating the DSB and providing support.
10,d5,d7d5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2pp4/2B1P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"Finally I get to play d5, attacking whites bishop."
11,exd5,e4d5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2pP4/2B5/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,Pawn exchange.
12,exd5,e6d5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/2pp4/2B5/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"Retreat, and loss of tempo. At this point I lose access to the GK database, it shows that black has a reasonable advantage already, presumably due to blacks stronger central control and small space advantage."
13,Bb3,c4b3,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/2pp4/8/1BNP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,"Retreat, and loss of tempo. At this point I lose access to the GK database, it shows that black has a reasonable advantage already, presumably due to blacks stronger central control and small space advantage."
14,Bd6,f8d6,r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2nb1n2/2pp4/8/1BNP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 8,"I think this is a mistake, as it allows white to capture the pawn on d5. Without access the the DB and having just got back from several months hitch hiking in West Africa, where chess is almost unheard of, I am a bit rusty. Better moves would have been Be7 or Bg4."
15,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2nb1n2/2pp4/8/1BNP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 3 8,"Both sides get their king off the dangerous, open e file."
16,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2nb1n2/2pp4/8/1BNP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 4 9,"Both sides get their king off the dangerous, open e file."
17,h3,h2h3,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2nb1n2/2pp4/8/1BNP1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 9,"Stops any ideas of pinning whites knight with Bg4, but opens up other possibilities such as a sacrifice on h3. I think perhaps this move was a bit slow at this stage, with Bg5 or Nxd5 being better alternatives."
18,d4,d5d4,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2nb1n2/2p5/3p4/1BNP1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 10,"Threatens the N and prevents Nxd5, but whites bishop now has a strong diagonal, aiming at my king!"
19,Ne4,c3e4,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2nb1n2/2p5/3pN3/1B1P1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 10,"I think Nb5 is slightly better, but I am not sure."

21,Re1,f1e1,r1bq1rk1/pp3pp1/2nb1n1p/2p5/3pN3/1B1P1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQR1K1 b - - 1 11,"Contesting the crucial open e file. I later realised this to be a mistake. Nxe4, dxe4, then Re8 is a much better alternative, as will be explained."
22,Re8,f8e8,r1bqr1k1/pp3pp1/2nb1n1p/2p5/3pN3/1B1P1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQR1K1 w - - 2 12,"Contesting the crucial open e file. I later realised this to be a mistake. Nxe4, dxe4, then Re8 is a much better alternative, as will be explained."

The Queen cannot recapture on f6 because it would leave the rook on e8 attacked and undefended. After 12. Nxf6+, gxf6 13. Rxe8+, Qxe8, 14. Bxh6, giving white a huge advantage."
24,dxc3,d4c3,r1bqr1k1/pp3pp1/2nb1n1p/2p5/4N3/1BpP1N1P/PP3PP1/R1BQR1K1 w - - 0 13,The possibility of Nxf6+ is still there.
