However, white could easily play 9.a4 which should be better than the text."

White's position is rather cramped, as his b2-knight is unable to move for a while and there is no activity in white's camp.  Altough it must be said that white is still solid - I just thought during the game that I had somewhat failed the opening."

This bishop is merely sitting in a corner and doing nothing. 12.Nbd2 is more atractive, as it prevents the black knight landing into c4. 12...Nxb3 is nothing to be afraid of, because as I said, this bishop hasn't got great value any more. Now black sees that he is better co-ordinated and goes for an attack."

Desperately for some activity, he decides to recapture with the f-pawn to open the f-file, which should act as a barrier for black to manoeuvre his heavy pieces to the kingside.
