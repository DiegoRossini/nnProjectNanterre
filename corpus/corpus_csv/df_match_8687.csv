9,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/ppp3pp/2n1pp2/3pP3/3P1P2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"Really just winging it. I think I played this one since the GameKnot DB recommended it. I was eager to castle kingside and get my rook on the open f-file or, if white beats me to it, just put my rook on f8 and oppose white's claim of the open file. 6. ... Bb4  just seems to fail after 7. c3 and then white chases my bishop back to b6 (or a7 with an extra move or two), or back to e7, so I just played to e7 to begin with. In retrospect, since f6 is covered by white's pawn at e5, I might have wanted to play my king's knight here first."
