1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"An opening unfamiliar to me: the English Opening 1...Nf6 (Anglo-Indian Defense) (A15). I have a well placed knight at f6, preventing him from using 2.e4, unless he does 2.d3 first."

3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Question: Why did White go there? For my opponent, his next moves should not be pawn moves. 3.Nf3 is preferred."
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Developing my bishop and trying to develope my knight by protecting the d5 square.
5,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,Inaccurate. Correct play was 3.Nf3.
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n1pn2/8/2PP4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,It is impossible to attack by pawns. White's only hope is to develope his knights. It is too late for White to develope anything to save his pawn foretress.

11,f3,f2f3,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/3Pn3/8/4PP2/PP4PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,"What's with White's pawns? Couldn't White have developed at least one knight by now, preferrably his g-knight? This was more of a complete blunder."
12,Bb4+,f8b4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/3Pn3/1b6/4PP2/PP4PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 7,"Sure enough, after those greedy pawn moves, White looked weakened and his pieces look like a standstill army that had no experience. This is THE consequence for too much pawn movements. White overlooked this even position, and...resigned!? feel free to post any suggestions about this because I need to know whether this was even or not and how White could play better or how he could have continued this game."
