1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is the second game I played against humour.  In the first game, as white, I squandered an excellent position, accidentally got caught in a fork, and still would have salvaged a draw if I'd been just a tad more precise with my king.  Anyway, I wanted revenge!  So here's the second game.

Good, e4.  I'm most familiar with these systems."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I usually play the Sicilian or the King's Pawn game as a response to e4, but I figured my opponent is likely very familiar with those.  So I decided to play the center-counter (Scandinavian) defense as a kind of psychological juke, to get him out of a comfort zone."
3,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3pP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"?! Definitely not what I expected-- White's usual response is 2. exd5, which Black replies with either Qxd5 or Nf6 (the Marshall Gambit, which I prefer).  Maybe Black was also trying for a psychological ploy?"
4,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2ppP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"A good follow-up to d5, fighting for the center."
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2ppP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"My plan was to follow up Bf5 with e3, which creates a French Defense-esque setup, with the important difference of having the light-squared bishop outside the pawn chain.  As White, I <i>hate</i> playing against the French, and I would never consciously choose to play it as Black, but the position of the bishop definitely has potential..."

9,Ne2,g1e2,r2qkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/1BppPb2/3P4/8/PPP1NPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 4 5,"?! White's line of thought is pretty easy to follow here, I'm sure he intended to follow up with Ng3, attacking the bishop, which I can simply retreat to g6.  Nf3 would probably have been better in the long run."

I would use the pawn chain on the light squares, coupled with my light-squared bishop, to control the middle of the board, and eventually either force open files, or perhaps create a passed pawn on the queenside.  (As a bonus, I've trapped and forced the eventual exchange of White's own light-squared bishop!)"

Plus, my dark-squared bishop is the ""bad bishop"" here, while White's DSB is his ""good bishop"", so I think an exchange would be good.  One problem... if White declines (with Bd2 or Be3, perhaps), my undeveloped knight would have no decent prospects, which could turn into a weakness..."
