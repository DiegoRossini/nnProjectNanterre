1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

It is time for game number 3 which also ended in a loss.  This time, at least my opponent had to sacrifice material to get at Henry.  I took a free pawn because I could not see that there was any immediate mate threat.  However, taking the pawn led to an exchange sacrifice which I had to accept or be a piece for two pawns light.  After having this material deficit in my game against Janet and losing to her in the manner I did I decided to accept the sacrifice and make Dongoodman prove its soundness.  Unfortunately he did exactly that and Henry ended up ..... well ..... erm ..... you will just have to follow this link and find out! http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=18572637&fb=1&rnd=0.2366468098222443."
