1,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/2N5/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 1,"So today I let my sensitive nature get in my way after I got fired by a cheating accusation in the midgame. Basically, at around the 45th move, my opponent (who've I've redacted the name in order to avoid the ""naming and shaming game"", though I'm happy to edit it back if the accuser continues on) accused me of using a computer. I don't have the exact logs, which were deleted by him, but the conversation went something like this:
xxx: Your computer is very fast.
xxx: That's right, no response.
me: Wait what?
me: You think I'm cheating?
me: Why?
xxx: Don't lie, only weak players use computers.
me: I'm not cheating.
xxx: Liar.
me: Can you explain to me why you think I'm cheating.

At this point, my opponent deleted the chat even after I asked him for an explanation, as I wanted to sort it out with him. So there was nothing left to do but block him.

Anyway, I'm commenting this game, and I want to know from people whether my game looks like a computer, cause I sure as hell don't see it."
