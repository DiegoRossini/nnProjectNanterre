7,Bxc6,b5c6,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1B5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,"The Ruy Lopez exchange variation gives Black bad pawn structure but it 
 also gives Black a bishop matching pair but Black is also behind in 
 development."
8,dxc6,d7c6,r1bqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1p5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,White can also play 5. Nc3 or 5.c3

10,Bg4,c8g4,r2qkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1p5/4p3/4P1b1/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 6,"The International Master Hans Bohm is known in Dutch chess circles as a
 brilliant positional player. His very good handling of the Ruy Lopez 
 exchange variation has brought him a lot of victories, including a fine win 
 over the American chess giant Samuel Reshevsky in the main line 5.f6 
 6. d4 cxd4  7. Nxd4  c5  8. Nb3 Qxd1  9. Rxd1, where White's Kingside
 pawn majority battles against Black's Bishop matching pair, that is why 
 his opponent  avoided the main line. In the game Black hopes to stall the 
 d2-d4 central break."
11,h3,h2h3,r2qkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1p5/4p3/4P1b1/5N1P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 6,"!  This type of move is known as ""putting the question to the Bishop"" Black
    now faces a very hard decision. If he exchanges by 6. Bxf3 Qxf3  Black
   then gives up the advantage of the Bishop matching pair and still has the
   doubled c-pawns. If the Bishop retreats"

    thanks to the open h-file. Such of  these tactics are very important in 
   this variation of the Exchange Variation."

 pawns then White will go for a 11.f4 break and to undouble the pawns
 with an edge. But now Black wants to get his Knight on the g6 square 
 where it will control the f4 square."

     be ready, at last! to acually play 11. hxg4 hxg4  12. Nh2!  Qh4  13. Nfd1!
   blocking of the crucial h-file and winning a piece."

       and Rook battery down the h-file that he missed the point that 
      13. Qxg5  Ne2 is both  check AND Mate!"
