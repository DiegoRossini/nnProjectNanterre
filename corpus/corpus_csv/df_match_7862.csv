The Black knight on c6 prevents the painful 13.Nxf7 Rg8 14.Nxe5 Nxe5 15.Bxg8, but 13.cxb6 e.p. seems to allow White to pursue the same line only a move later.  Instead 12... Nd5 here, rather than later, puts pressure on White to prove his idea has merit.  Black ends up getting a break when white passes over the en-passant move."

This continued attack is not so fierce as it seems at first sight.  White's main problem is the lack of piece involvement in the attacks.  I think 20.Be3! develops a piece with tempo, but Black is likely to respond to it with the same idea that works so well against 20.Ne6."
