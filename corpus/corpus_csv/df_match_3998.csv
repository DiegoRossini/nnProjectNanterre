1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

This game started very slowly with little advantage to Yours Truly until late on in the middlegame white blundered a pawn.  I took full advantage but I still had to work hard for that win.  Thanfully Fou Leblanc with the aid of Henry managed to lure his counterpart onto a diagonal which led to an exchange down into a K & P ending and I then managed to get Henry right up into his arc.  Henry duly tucked in to his favourite nosh and it was inevitable that he was gonna help a pawn get to the 8th rank and inflict Glendadoom on his opponent.  Chris realised this and resigned on the grounds of Unavoidable Mate.  How did all this happen?  Well, Gameknot Analysis will shed some light on the matter: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17359307&fb=1&rnd=0.8334781184207715."
