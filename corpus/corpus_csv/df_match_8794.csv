1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone, this was a really awful game against Master Freddy.  In this I made a couple of beginner errors which spoilt things big time.  I thought this game would be worth annotating though because of the unusual opening that Freddy played, i.e. he plays h6 in response to my e4."

Nh5?? - the game is lost but I should not be making these sorts of errors - this move was to try to distract Fou Lenoir from the protection of the h6 pawn and at least pick up a booby prize.  The only consolation I had was that at least I could resign on the grounds of ruinous loss of material as Freddy had not yet announced mate on me and I did not wish to drag things out.  This game btw was played before the one called ""I thought Henry was as safe as houses"".  I am now playing another game with Freddy and I hope for better things from that."
