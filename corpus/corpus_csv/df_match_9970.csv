1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I decide to go with what I know best, and open e4."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Interesting; I've been learning just a little bit how to play the Evans Gambit after getting thrashed with it by rt4sm, so when I saw the response e5, I planned on steering towards that."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,...here we go!

8,Bxb4,c5b4,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/1bB1P3/5N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"So far, all standard stuff.  Dave has the choice between Ba5 and Be7 as the most common responses now.  White will try to get a big attack going and a lead in development for his sacrificed pawn."
9,c3,c2c3,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/1bB1P3/2P2N2/P2P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"So far, all standard stuff.  Dave has the choice between Ba5 and Be7 as the most common responses now.  White will try to get a big attack going and a lead in development for his sacrificed pawn."
10,Bd6,b4d6,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2nb4/4p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/P2P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 6,"!?  Odd, but very sound!  This is called the Stone-Ware variation, and it was played by Pillsbury quite frequently at the turn of the century.  He even beat Bird with it once... check it out at http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1028182"
11,d4,d2d4,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2nb4/4p3/2BPP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"I decide that the best response to this is to create space for myself.  Black's next few moves will determine what plan I should take; d4 contests black's pawn in the center, and also opens a line for the Bc2.  Note how much better this is than d3, which prevents Bd3 if black plays Na5."
12,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2nb1n2/4p3/2BPP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 7,"A standard, developing move.  But I decide to keep something in mind: if black moves his Nc6, I can play dxe5, forking his knight and bishop."
13,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2nb1n2/4p3/2BPP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 2 7,"Bird tried the flimsy Ng5, which was simply met by 0-0.  I decide to wait on the issue and castle, which will be a useful move no matter how black responds."
14,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2nb1n2/4p3/2BPP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 3 8,"A pretty good idea from Dave, and much better than grabbing another pawn with Nxe4 (always a bad idea when you're behind in development). He's playing this opening pretty well, perhaps hoping to destroy me the way Tigran Petrosian got destroyed just this month: http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1482599"
15,Nbd2,b1d2,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2nb1n2/4p3/2BPP3/2P2N2/P2N1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 4 8,"But I've decided on a plan as well.  This move protects both the loose bishop on c4 and the pawn on e4.  While it blocks the bishop in for now, the knight won't remain here for long..."
16,b6,b7b6,r1bq1rk1/p1pp1ppp/1pnb1n2/4p3/2BPP3/2P2N2/P2N1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 9,"According to the chessgames database, this has been played once in tournament play, at the super-GM tournament in Pune, India.  The game ended in a draw: http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1305841"
17,Re1,f1e1,r1bq1rk1/p1pp1ppp/1pnb1n2/4p3/2BPP3/2P2N2/P2N1PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - - 1 9,"In the GM game, white played Bd3 here.  Since black has committed himself to playing Bb7, I felt the need to defend the e4 pawn again.  Also, my knight on d2 would look better on g3, and I'll need to vacate the f1 square in order to get it there!"
18,Bb7,c8b7,r2q1rk1/pbpp1ppp/1pnb1n2/4p3/2BPP3/2P2N2/P2N1PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 2 10,"As expected.  Black basically decided to do this with his fifth move, when he blocked his d-pawn with his bishop.  Dave is, for all intents and purposes, even with me now.  White still has a slight edge in space and development, while black has a slight edge in material.

Take stock of this position now, because black is going to lose the game, *positionally*, in the next three moves."
19,Nf1,d2f1,r2q1rk1/pbpp1ppp/1pnb1n2/4p3/2BPP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/R1BQRNK1 b - - 3 10,I told you the plan; get that knight to g3!
20,Na5,c6a5,r2q1rk1/pbpp1ppp/1p1b1n2/n3p3/2BPP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/R1BQRNK1 w - - 4 11,"? This doesn't seem like a terrible move, why give it a question mark?  Because white doesn't want his bishop on c4, it's much better on d3.  Black basically forces white to move it there, as it's the only way to defend both the bishop and the e4 pawn other than moving the Nf1 back to d2.  But it puts black's knight in a far worse position, with nowhere to go except back to c6.  As white is already ahead in space and development, I don't think black can afford this."
21,Bd3,c4d3,r2q1rk1/pbpp1ppp/1p1b1n2/n3p3/3PP3/2PB1N2/P4PPP/R1BQRNK1 b - - 5 11,The only move.
22,c5,c7c5,r2q1rk1/pb1p1ppp/1p1b1n2/n1p1p3/3PP3/2PB1N2/P4PPP/R1BQRNK1 w - - 0 12,"?!  This is consistent, I suppose, otherwise Na5 looks purposeless.  But with the rook supporting the e4 pawn, can black's e5 pawn really be considered a threat to white's d4 pawn, and does it need the support of a pawn on c5?"
23,Bg5,c1g5,r2q1rk1/pb1p1ppp/1p1b1n2/n1p1p1B1/3PP3/2PB1N2/P4PPP/R2QRNK1 b - - 1 12,"!?  A very strong pin now, as it's going to be very hard for black to get out of this without either weakening his kingside or abandoning the e5 pawn with something like Be7.  Of course, I overlooked the simple dxe5!, which wins a piece immediately!"
24,Nc6,a5c6,r2q1rk1/pb1p1ppp/1pnb1n2/2p1p1B1/3PP3/2PB1N2/P4PPP/R2QRNK1 w - - 2 13,"?!  Not really a terrible move, but it does nothing to relieve the pressure on the f6 knight.  What's more, is that Dave mistakenly believes he has built up good pressure on the d4 pawn.  While that's true, it isn't going to be very useful."
25,Ng3,f1g3,r2q1rk1/pb1p1ppp/1pnb1n2/2p1p1B1/3PP3/2PB1NN1/P4PPP/R2QR1K1 b - - 3 13,"!  Simple, but strong.  Remember I told you to take stock after black's 9th move?  Well, now it's 3 1/2 moves later.  How have things changed?  White's knight moved from d2 to g3, his bishop moved from c4 to d3, and his other bishop moved from c1 to g5.  Black, on the other hand, has moved his c7 pawn to c5.  White has three pieces that are more active, black has one more pawn contesting the center on the queenside, where the action isn't.  Who made the better call here?  I have to conclude that Dave dug himself a big hole with his last three moves."
