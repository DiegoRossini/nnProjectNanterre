2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Vienna game.
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,Vienna game.
4,Nh6,g8h6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/7n/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,An unusual move.
5,Qh5,d1h5,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/7n/4p2Q/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 3 3,Black defends against the threat of QxPe5+.
6,d6,d7d6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p3n/4p2Q/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Black defends against the threat of QxPe5+.
7,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p3n/4p2Q/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 1 4,"Classic set up for the four move check mate, which black already foiled at the outset with Nh6.  White might better conceal ulterior motive with Pd3 first, and trading Bc1 for Nh6, which would also serve to double black's pawns.  Of course, black, perhaps wary of an early mate, would likely counter with some other appropriate action."
8,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2p1p/3p2pn/4p2Q/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 0 5,To continue pressing for an early game white should respond Qf3 (which is probably a stronger opening anyway--fewer wasted moves).
9,Qf3,h5f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2p1p/3p2pn/4p3/2B1P3/2N2Q2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 1 5,B-)

6. Pd4 exd4
7. BxNh6 BxBh6 (which would be bad for black because...)
8. QxPf7#"
11,d3,d2d3,rnbqkb1r/pp3p1p/2pp2pn/4p3/2B1P3/2NP1Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 0 6,B-)
12,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkb1r/pp3p1p/2pp2pn/4p3/2B1P1b1/2NP1Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 1 7,"This actually puts white up a pawn, provided black plays NxBf7 instead of Ke7.  Ke7 wouldn't be that great.  But Ke7, white must move the queen off the f column, withdrawing protection from the white bishop which black follows with KxBf7.  Then white must hold funeral services for the slain priest."
13,Bxf7+,c4f7,rn1qkb1r/pp3B1p/2pp2pn/4p3/4P1b1/2NP1Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 0 7,"This actually puts white up a pawn, provided black plays NxBf7 instead of Ke7.  Ke7 wouldn't be that great.
