5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 3,"Black breaks the book but his move, Bg4, does not seem very good to me.  I like playing with my Bishops against his Knights so if he wants to trade I will oblige him.  I will continue to develop my pieces in an attempt to gain space."
6,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/2B1P1b1/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 4,"Black breaks the book but his move, Bg4, does not seem very good to me.

12,Nf6,g8f6,rn1qkb1r/p4ppp/2pp1n2/1p2p3/4P1b1/1BNP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 7,Now to force him to exchange his Bishop for my Knight or retreat.

17,Qxf3,d1f3,rn1qkb1r/p4ppp/2p2n2/1p1pp3/4P3/PBNP1Q1P/1PP2PP1/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 0 9,He wants to trade so now I am gaining space.

19,Ne2,c3e2,rn1qkb1r/p4ppp/2p2n2/1p2p3/3pP3/PB1P1Q1P/1PP1NPP1/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 1 10,More odd pawn moves.  This opens the diagonal a2-g7 for my Bishop and my other Bishop is shooting down c1-h6.
20,Be7,f8e7,rn1qk2r/p3bppp/2p2n2/1p2p3/3pP3/PB1P1Q1P/1PP1NPP1/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 2 11,Bit of a threat on g7 but Black can easily counter it.
21,Bd2,c1d2,rn1qk2r/p3bppp/2p2n2/1p2p3/3pP3/PB1P1Q1P/1PPBNPP1/R3K2R b KQkq - 3 11,Bit of a threat on g7 but Black can easily counter it.

23,Qg3,f3g3,rn1qk2r/4bppp/2p2n2/pp2p3/3pP3/PB1P2QP/1PPBNPP1/R3K2R b KQkq - 1 12,Bit of a threat on g7 but Black can easily counter it.
24,O-O,e8g8,rn1q1rk1/4bppp/2p2n2/pp2p3/3pP3/PB1P2QP/1PPBNPP1/R3K2R w KQ - 2 13,Which he does but now my light Bishop is aimed at the King and my Queen aimed at g7.  His pawn structure on the Queen side is very strange to me.  Don't think that I have seen one like this before.   Now to mess with his King side pawn structure.
25,Bh6,d2h6,rn1q1rk1/4bppp/2p2n1B/pp2p3/3pP3/PB1P2QP/1PP1NPP1/R3K2R b KQ - 3 13,"A new threat of Qxg7#.  Again, keep Black on the defensive so that he can not develop an attack."
26,g6,g7g6,rn1q1rk1/4bp1p/2p2npB/pp2p3/3pP3/PB1P2QP/1PP1NPP1/R3K2R w KQ - 0 14,I would have moved Ne8.  g6 gives me a Rook for a Bishop.
27,Bxf8,h6f8,rn1q1Bk1/4bp1p/2p2np1/pp2p3/3pP3/PB1P2QP/1PP1NPP1/R3K2R b KQ - 0 14,Seems that Black is blocking his pieces in.  The Queen can only move down the diagonal f8-h6 or along the 8th row.  I would have taken the Bishop with the King and then developed the Knight and moved the Bishop to h4 to attack the White Queen.
28,Qxf8,d8f8,rn3qk1/4bp1p/2p2np1/pp2p3/3pP3/PB1P2QP/1PP1NPP1/R3K2R w KQ - 0 15,Seems that Black is blocking his pieces in.  The Queen can only move down the diagonal f8-h6 or along the 8th row.  I would have taken the Bishop with the King and then developed the Knight and moved the Bishop to h4 to attack the White Queen.
29,f3,f2f3,rn3qk1/4bp1p/2p2np1/pp2p3/3pP3/PB1P1PQP/1PP1N1P1/R3K2R b KQ - 0 15,"Now to add a bit of strength to my pawn structure.  I think that I can castle to the Kings side and have a good defense, depending on what Black does next.  After this I can start hacking my way through his pawns on the Queen side unless Black does something brilliant."
30,a4,a5a4,rn3qk1/4bp1p/2p2np1/1p2p3/p2pP3/PB1P1PQP/1PP1N1P1/R3K2R w KQ - 0 16,Not brilliant.
31,Ba2,b3a2,rn3qk1/4bp1p/2p2np1/1p2p3/p2pP3/P2P1PQP/BPP1N1P1/R3K2R b KQ - 1 16,Keep the Bishop aimed at the King.
32,b4,b5b4,rn3qk1/4bp1p/2p2np1/4p3/pp1pP3/P2P1PQP/BPP1N1P1/R3K2R w KQ - 0 17,Again with the odd pawn move.  This gives me a pawn and weakens his defense yet again.  I would have moved the Bishop to d6.
33,Qxe5,g3e5,rn3qk1/4bp1p/2p2np1/4Q3/pp1pP3/P2P1P1P/BPP1N1P1/R3K2R b KQ - 0 17,His pawns keep moving forward which gives me the opportunity to get behind them and cause problems.
34,c5,c6c5,rn3qk1/4bp1p/5np1/2p1Q3/pp1pP3/P2P1P1P/BPP1N1P1/R3K2R w KQ - 0 18,His pawns keep moving forward which gives me the opportunity to get behind them and cause problems.
35,O-O,e1g1,rn3qk1/4bp1p/5np1/2p1Q3/pp1pP3/P2P1P1P/BPP1N1P1/R4RK1 b - - 1 18,But first I need to protect my King a bit.
