1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Master X is a very strong player, and I have copped Old Matey from her in quite a few of her games.  However, Master X was to slip up in this game and allow a powerful mating attack and material winning sacrifice and give hope to all players under 2000 that beating them is not an impossible task.  You just have to capitalise on any error that they make when you are aware of it.  Ineedaname was aware of it and had done the necessary checks for king safety before making the sacrifice that prompted resignation on the grounds of Ruinous Loss of Material after white went for the jugular.  So how did this happen?  Well, here is the game: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=18603742&fb=1&rnd=0.3053444196581168"
