14,Qe8,d8e8,rnb1qrk1/ppp3pp/5n2/2bp4/8/3BPN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 2 8,"Occupaying the two open files. Black didn't want to play 7. ... Qe7 because if the queen and the rook have to be doubled at an early stage of the game, it's better to have the queen behind the rook. Furthermore, I thought that the h5 square could be a important place to control."
