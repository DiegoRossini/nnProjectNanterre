1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Interesting game for couple of reasons:
1) An early Q advantage that disappeared shortly thereafter
2) Maneuvering at the end that almost escaped me... You'll see why."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I haven't played this opening before. I am sure I followed some kind of weird DB moves, trying to explore some kind of unusual and interesting game. Well, it got interesting much faster than I anticipated. I don't like Knight on h and a line anyways. What was I thinking?"

7,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1p1pp/5p1n/3p4/3P3B/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"Here I decide to throw King side castling away. I see a Q attack on h5, but I also see a possibility to trap that same Q. He was 1600 level player, there was a good chance he will see it and get out of it, but I take a risk again and I go for it. We played pretty fast that night and the next few moves if taken quickly might cost him greatly."

9,Bg3,h4g3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1p2p/5p1n/3p2p1/3P4/4P1B1/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 5,He doesn't take the bate right then.
10,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppp1p1bp/5p1n/3p2p1/3P4/4P1B1/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 2 6,I still pretend like I don't see the Qh5 attack.
11,Qh5+,d1h5,rnbqk2r/ppp1p1bp/5p1n/3p2pQ/3P4/4P1B1/PPP2PPP/RN2KBNR b KQkq - 3 6,He goes for it. The next move was pretty crucial for the faith of the game. I am hoping he makes the wrong one.
12,Kf8,e8f8,rnbq1k1r/ppp1p1bp/5p1n/3p2pQ/3P4/4P1B1/PPP2PPP/RN2KBNR w KQ - 4 7,"The option to move the king and give up the castling allowed for a possibility of the Q trap. As for the castling at this point I really didn't care to try to preserve it. I have already given up on the King-side, by the time I clear the Queen side, it will be too late. His Q is already in my face. At this point I chose to risk it and leave Nh6 where it is, and try to go for the Q trap."
13,Bd3,f1d3,rnbq1k1r/ppp1p1bp/5p1n/3p2pQ/3P4/3BP1B1/PPP2PPP/RN2K1NR b KQ - 5 7,He didn't see it! The end!

In reality his only option is to make the game more about the position than material advantage.  I, on the other hand although ahead in material, am completely jammed up and underdeveloped, spending so many moves on setting up the trap. Who would have thought at that point that that would matter considering my significant material advantage."
20,e5,e7e5,rn1q1k1r/ppp3bp/5p1n/3pp1p1/3P4/2NBP1BP/PPP2PP1/R3K1NR w KQ - 0 11,"Trying to open up. Perhaps a Nc6, Nd7 would have been better. Don't know, didn't care at that time."
21,dxe5,d4e5,rn1q1k1r/ppp3bp/5p1n/3pP1p1/8/2NBP1BP/PPP2PP1/R3K1NR b KQ - 0 11,"I thought that f3 was a weak move and I can afford another pawn move. Wanted to make his Nc3 uncomfortable, advance the pawns, and/or open up his e-line, before he attempts to castle."
22,fxe5,f6e5,rn1q1k1r/ppp3bp/7n/3pp1p1/8/2NBP1BP/PPP2PP1/R3K1NR w KQ - 0 12,"I thought that f3 was a weak move and I can afford another pawn move. Wanted to make his Nc3 uncomfortable, advance the pawns, and/or open up his e-line, before he attempts to castle."

25,exd4,e3d4,rn1q1k1r/ppp3bp/7n/4p1p1/3P4/2NB1PBP/PPP3P1/R3K1NR b KQ - 0 13,"e-line opened, Nc3 forced to move. I gain tempo, advance the pawn and open up the e-line. Very effective I thought."
26,exd4,e5d4,rn1q1k1r/ppp3bp/7n/6p1/3p4/2NB1PBP/PPP3P1/R3K1NR w KQ - 0 14,"e-line opened, Nc3 forced to move. I gain tempo, advance the pawn and open up the e-line. Very effective I thought."
27,Ne4,c3e4,rn1q1k1r/ppp3bp/7n/6p1/3pN3/3B1PBP/PPP3P1/R3K1NR b KQ - 1 14,I have no pawns to attack Ne4 after the pin with Q on e-file. So his Ne4 was effective in protecting the King long enough for the castling.
28,Nf5,h6f5,rn1q1k1r/ppp3bp/8/5np1/3pN3/3B1PBP/PPP3P1/R3K1NR w KQ - 2 15,"Finally I am starting to reposition some of my stronger pieces and hopefully making them effective. Not sure that this was the best move either, however, there was still no sign of any danger."
29,Bf2,g3f2,rn1q1k1r/ppp3bp/8/5np1/3pN3/3B1P1P/PPP2BP1/R3K1NR b KQ - 3 15,He is still not castling. I have no problems with that.
30,c5,c7c5,rn1q1k1r/pp4bp/8/2p2np1/3pN3/3B1P1P/PPP2BP1/R3K1NR w KQ - 0 16,"Looking back now I see the problem. Too many darn pawn moves! But then again, does this white position still look dangerous? I thought that too."
31,Ne2,g1e2,rn1q1k1r/pp4bp/8/2p2np1/3pN3/3B1P1P/PPP1NBP1/R3K2R b KQ - 1 16,He continues to develop.
