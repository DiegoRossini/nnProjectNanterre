1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Normal
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,The sharp sicilian defense begins.
3,a3,a2a3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/P7/1PPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,2.a3? At first I looked at this move and thought it was a time wasting move so
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/4P3/P7/1PPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"I just play naturally. Although the pawn push a3 looks innocuous, it's actually part of a deeper plan."
5,b4,b2b4,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/1P2P3/P7/2PP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,Here is the gambit. White sacrifices his b pawn to be able to play c3 and d4 striking the centre. This is similiar to an evans gambit.
6,cxb4,c5b4,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/8/1p2P3/P7/2PP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,I accept it as it's really the only option.
7,axb4,a3b4,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/8/1P2P3/8/2PP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,Lures my bishop to b4 to be able to play c3
8,Bxb4,f8b4,rnbqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/8/1b2P3/8/2PP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,Lures my bishop to b4 to be able to play c3
9,c3,c2c3,rnbqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/8/1b2P3/2P5/3P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,A passive square but probably the best.
10,Be7,b4e7,rnbqk1nr/pp1pbppp/4p3/8/4P3/2P5/3P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,A passive square but probably the best.
11,d4,d2d4,rnbqk1nr/pp1pbppp/4p3/8/3PP3/2P5/5PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,Hitting the centre. White has open lines for easy development. I will have trouble.
12,d6,d7d6,rnbqk1nr/pp2bppp/3pp3/8/3PP3/2P5/5PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,Holds the e5 square and makes way for the LSB.
13,f4,f2f4,rnbqk1nr/pp2bppp/3pp3/8/3PPP2/2P5/6PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 7,White pushes another pawn.
14,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/3ppn2/8/3PPP2/2P5/6PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 8,Natural development.
15,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/3ppn2/8/3PPP2/2P2N2/6PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 8,Capturing would result in an massive pawn centre.
16,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2nppn2/8/3PPP2/2P2N2/6PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 3 9,Capturing would result in an massive pawn centre.
17,e5,e4e5,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2nppn2/4P3/3P1P2/2P2N2/6PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 9,Capturing would result in an massive pawn centre.
18,Nd7,f6d7,r1bqk2r/pp1nbppp/2npp3/4P3/3P1P2/2P2N2/6PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 10,Capturing would result in an massive pawn centre.
19,Ba3,c1a3,r1bqk2r/pp1nbppp/2npp3/4P3/3P1P2/B1P2N2/6PP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 2 10,Puts more pressure on the centre.
20,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp1nbppp/2npp3/4P3/3P1P2/B1P2N2/6PP/RN1QKB1R w KQ - 3 11,Here I make a blunder. I lose my bishop. I obviously didn't see it. A rather silly mistake.
21,exd6,e5d6,r1bq1rk1/pp1nbppp/2nPp3/8/3P1P2/B1P2N2/6PP/RN1QKB1R b KQ - 0 11,The bishop is won regardless.

23,g3,g2g3,r1bq1rk1/pp1n1ppp/2nPp3/8/3P1P1b/B1P2NP1/7P/RN1QKB1R b KQ - 0 12,Rather dubious. White now has an open H file to work with. I would have to somehow find a way to rip open the centre and attack along the e file.
24,Bxg3+,h4g3,r1bq1rk1/pp1n1ppp/2nPp3/8/3P1P2/B1P2Nb1/7P/RN1QKB1R w KQ - 0 13,Rather dubious. White now has an open H file to work with. I would have to somehow find a way to rip open the centre and attack along the e file.
