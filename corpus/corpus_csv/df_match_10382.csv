6,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk1nr/ppp1bppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,black play a very solid move. I have played 3. ..C5 adopting a tarracsh style of defence which leads to sharp positions.
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk1nr/ppp1bppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 4,This move is not black's best. Normally black plays Nc6.

9,cxd5,c4d5,r1bqk1nr/pppnbppp/4p3/3P4/3P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,Black goes down a pawn to gain rapid development and attacking chances.
10,Nb6,d7b6,r1bqk1nr/ppp1bppp/1n2p3/3P4/3P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,Black goes down a pawn to gain rapid development and attacking chances.
11,dxe6,d5e6,r1bqk1nr/ppp1bppp/1n2P3/8/3P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"A nice developing square for the bishop. However, this leaves the centre in white's control."
12,Bxe6,c8e6,r2qk1nr/ppp1bppp/1n2b3/8/3P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"A nice developing square for the bishop. However, this leaves the centre in white's control."

14,c6,c7c6,r2qk1nr/pp2bppp/1np1b3/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,black can not allow d5.
15,Bd3,f1d3,r2qk1nr/pp2bppp/1np1b3/8/3PP3/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 8,one of the ways to defeat a gambit is to develop normally and make calm moves that strengthen your positon. Bd3 is a very strong developing move that prepares for kingside attacks. As well it clears the kingside back rank so that white can castle.
16,Nf6,g8f6,r2qk2r/pp2bppp/1np1bn2/8/3PP3/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 9,White can also play Bf4 to prevent black from developing his queen to c7
17,O-O,e1g1,r2qk2r/pp2bppp/1np1bn2/8/3PP3/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 3 9,White can also play Bf4 to prevent black from developing his queen to c7

20,Qc7,d8c7,r4rk1/ppq1bppp/1np1bn2/8/3PP3/2NB1N2/PPQ2PPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 6 11,This allows my queen and bishop some room to move at the cost of allowing black to post a Knight at d5.
21,e5,e4e5,r4rk1/ppq1bppp/1np1bn2/4P3/3P4/2NB1N2/PPQ2PPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 0 11,This allows my queen and bishop some room to move at the cost of allowing black to post a Knight at d5.
22,Nfd5,f6d5,r4rk1/ppq1bppp/1np1b3/3nP3/3P4/2NB1N2/PPQ2PPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 1 12,Not 12. Nxd5 allowing black to free up his position. The advantage of this move is that I win a pawn and create a weakness in front of Black's king with tempo
23,Bxh7+,d3h7,r4rk1/ppq1bppB/1np1b3/3nP3/3P4/2N2N2/PPQ2PPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 0 12,Not 12. Nxd5 allowing black to free up his position. The advantage of this move is that I win a pawn and create a weakness in front of Black's king with tempo

41,Rfe1,f1e1,5rk1/ppq3p1/2pb4/3bB3/3P4/8/PPQ2PPP/R3R1K1 b - - 2 21,"This is the best move because if black captures on e5 then the Rook gets lifted to e5. By which, white maintains his positional superiority over black."
