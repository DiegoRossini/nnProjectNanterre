4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/3P1B2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,3. Nc3 eliminates the possibility of the Queen's Gambit so I was making moves on my own early in this one.

6,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1b1P1B2/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,I wanted to take advantage of the pin right away although this is a second move with my Knight when my Queenside pieces are still all locked up

Bb6 is the safe move here but I thought with White's Bishop blocked momentarily and my strong Knight on e4 I could force a favorable exchange or even a quick Mate if I could get my Queen into the attack. I also enjoy playing a true sacrifice now and again!

If I could have managed to fianchetto my light squared Bishop to b7 before White can do the same at g2 I think this game would have been mine but I'm always a move too slow. 10. g3 b6 11.
