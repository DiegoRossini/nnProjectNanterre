1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"In this game I, as an exception, use the real opponent's nick, since I think that he played very well, and in fact he had a won engame when he timeoutted. I hope he will see the game, and be somewhat proud of it. He fell into a nasty trap, true, but managed very well afterwards. And ""unbalanced"" games are always interesting."

That's Nc6 for (if Qb3, Na5 exchanges either Q or B)! Not ""just developing"": it's preventing white's battery."
