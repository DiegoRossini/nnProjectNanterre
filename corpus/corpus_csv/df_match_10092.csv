1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"What can I say? If you know me don't bother reading the rest of my rmablings on superiority of this move over all others because you will already know what I""m goiing to say. But for those of you who don't know me, here goes:

This is considered the main opening for the majority of GMs as White stakes out his claim to the centre. This is my normal opening, I decided not to change this as it is my fave and I'm not gonna try and do anything to drastic to bamboozle the computer until I've seen how good it is. 

I don't like boring openings which in my opinion is almost everything apart from 1.e4. After 1.e4 there are loads of fun and wild gambits! Other pawn pushes with no real drawbacks include 1. d4 and 1. c4. And for our hypermodern players, there is always 1. Nf3, controlling the center with pieces and not commiting to a set pawn structure.  Flamin' boring though!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,This is so White can't create a huge pawn centre unnopposed.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Developing a knight to its best square, attacking the pawn, controlling two center squares."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,The best move to defend. Also attacks two squares and develops a piece. I was interested to see what Jester's opening book was like so I decided to go into  something mainline.
5,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,"The Italian game. An old opening that is now thought to be rather dull and boring. Black now has two main options here 3....Bc5 the Giuoco Piano or 3... Nf6 The Two Knight's Defence. The Italian game can evolve into the romantic Evans Gambit if 3...Bc5 then 4. b4!?(This is a very nice gambit which I have a few annotated games of ""Naval Intelligence"" a very nice little game!.)"
6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,This is the two knights defence. A very pro active defence against the Italian game. Computers are normally very good at tactics so I think I'll tryb and mobve the game into a less sharp game and a nmore strategical /positional one. My choices that I didn't use were 4.d4!? 4.0-0!? or 4.Ng5!? I ofcourse wanted to play strategically. So I choose a boring option.
7,d3,d2d3,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,This is much more quiet than the previously mentioned moves. It opens a
8,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 5,Standard getting my king into a safe position.
9,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 2 5,Standard getting my king into a safe position.
10,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/ppppbppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 3 6,Same.
11,c3,c2c3,r1bq1rk1/ppppbppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 0 6,This move is a a preparation for a quick d4 creating a two-pawn abreast centre. jester needs to be very accurate in hid response or I will seize the intiative by the short and curlies. One of the downsides of this move is that it takes away the white knights most natural developing square c3. his mean sthe d4 push will have to be pre-empted by a move to defend the e4 pawn.
12,d6,d7d6,r1bq1rk1/ppp1bppp/2np1n2/4p3/2B1P3/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 0 7,This solidifies the centre and opens up a diagonal for the light squared bishop. So far i can't see anything wrong with Jesters opening moves they're solid and logical. Not surprising from a computer.
13,Bb3,c4b3,r1bq1rk1/ppp1bppp/2np1n2/4p3/4P3/1BPP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 1 7,"This move may seem a bit backwards, moving a piece in the opening twice is considered a cardinal sin however my plan was to bring it back to c2 to defend the e pawn after I have played d4. I'm not too concerned about the development issue I've got on my hands because Blacks position seems fairly passive at the moment and non-threatening for now."
14,Bg4,c8g4,r2q1rk1/ppp1bppp/2np1n2/4p3/4P1b1/1BPP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 2 8,A logical move: it develops a bishop and pins the knight.
15,Nbd2,b1d2,r2q1rk1/ppp1bppp/2np1n2/4p3/4P1b1/1BPP1N2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 3 8,This develops a piece and defends the knight.
16,Qd7,d8d7,r4rk1/pppqbppp/2np1n2/4p3/4P1b1/1BPP1N2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 4 9,"Logical, it develops the queen and connects the rook. I can't see much of anm attack building up. Maybe I can gather my forces and Jester may eep making passive/non aggressive moves."
17,Nc4,d2c4,r4rk1/pppqbppp/2np1n2/4p3/2N1P1b1/1BPP1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 5 9,This is a maneuvering move whereby I intend to move the knight to e3 attacking the g4 bishopand also preparing to go to d5 from there possibly.
18,Be6,g4e6,r4rk1/pppqbppp/2npbn2/4p3/2N1P3/1BPP1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 6 10,This seems a wasted move in my book. It doesn't do anything apart from un-pinning my knight wich I was quite happy about. I would suggest 9...Bh5 here as it holds the pin and dissapates the effect of my impending Ne3.
19,Ng5,f3g5,r4rk1/pppqbppp/2npbn2/4p1N1/2N1P3/1BPP4/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 7 10,I decided here that it was time for action. This responds blacks passive move with an attackling one. Now black will have to make a decision: Exchange on c4 or allow me to capture his bishop on e6.
20,Bxc4,e6c4,r4rk1/pppqbppp/2np1n2/4p1N1/2b1P3/1BPP4/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 11,"He chooses to exchange. I think better would have been 10...d5 counter-acting my attack on the wing with an attack in the centre, after 11.Ne3 Rad8 12.Nxe6 fxe6  and things are more or less equal."
21,Bxc4,b3c4,r4rk1/pppqbppp/2np1n2/4p1N1/2B1P3/2PP4/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 11,"If we analyse my position now we can see that I am about to play d4, and I have a more active position. jester has a defensive maybe even passive position."
