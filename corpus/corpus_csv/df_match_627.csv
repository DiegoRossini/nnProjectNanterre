1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I opened with d4. I've had the most success with this opening. In the first game, elyhim mentioned that most would argue playing d4 is done to avoid opening tactics and leads to closed equal positions. I haven't played it enough to recognize that fact yet. What I know is I win more with this opening than with e4."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"QP moves... the thing about this game you'll notice is the action that normally happens right over center, seems to be offset a bit towards the A file. Not sure if that is typical or not, but I noticed it halfway through the game."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"QP moves... the thing about this game you'll notice is the action that normally happens right over center, seems to be offset a bit towards the A file. Not sure if that is typical or not, but I noticed it halfway through the game."
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,We're both preparing to attack the center squares. Control of d5 seems to be the key here.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,So white adds pressure.
6,b6,b7b6,rnbqkb1r/p1pp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"I expected a d5 move.. however, I know the fianchetto is coming. He wants to apply flank pressure on d5 and aim his LSB at my future castle."
7,e4,e2e4,rnbqkb1r/p1pp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"more d5 defenders, but maybe to far up with the pawns. I feel like there's a lot of space behind the pawns right now."
8,d6,d7d6,rnbqkb1r/p1p2ppp/1p1ppn2/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"this move surprised me a little. I really expected the fianchetto. Now I see d4 as a bit weak, but I don't think c5 is coming. While c5 might open up the queen side a bit, that doesn't seem to be consistent with the d5 pressure."
9,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqkb1r/p1p2ppp/1p1ppn2/8/2PPP3/2NB4/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 5,"so I need to support the under defended e pawn, and prepare for castling."
10,Bb7,c8b7,rn1qkb1r/pbp2ppp/1p1ppn2/8/2PPP3/2NB4/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 2 6,there's the fianchetto I expected a while back.
11,Nf3,g1f3,rn1qkb1r/pbp2ppp/1p1ppn2/8/2PPP3/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 6,"defends the d pawn, opens up the castle."
12,Nbd7,b8d7,r2qkb1r/pbpn1ppp/1p1ppn2/8/2PPP3/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 4 7,"at this point, I'm thinking there's a c5 or e5 push coming..."
13,O-O,e1g1,r2qkb1r/pbpn1ppp/1p1ppn2/8/2PPP3/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 5 7,so I think I'll castle and worry about it later  :)
14,Be7,f8e7,r2qk2r/pbpnbppp/1p1ppn2/8/2PPP3/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 6 8,preparing to castle
15,Qe2,d1e2,r2qk2r/pbpnbppp/1p1ppn2/8/2PPP3/2NB1N2/PP2QPPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 7 8,"added a defender to e4. Elyhim has told me the queen is always happier when she stays close to home. I like the look of my bishops here, although I don't think I took advantage of them much."
16,O-O,e8g8,r2q1rk1/pbpnbppp/1p1ppn2/8/2PPP3/2NB1N2/PP2QPPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 8 9,castle
17,b4,b2b4,r2q1rk1/pbpnbppp/1p1ppn2/8/1PPPP3/2NB1N2/P3QPPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 0 9,"this particular move was a key learning move for me. It was an error. In a subsequent game I played in an MT, I noticed my opponent made this exact move and was able to take advantage of it based on elyhim's instruction. I wish I had the comments from the chat to share here, but they were erased."
18,d5,d6d5,r2q1rk1/pbpnbppp/1p2pn2/3p4/1PPPP3/2NB1N2/P3QPPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 0 10,so the attack begins!
19,c5,c4c5,r2q1rk1/pbpnbppp/1p2pn2/2Pp4/1P1PP3/2NB1N2/P3QPPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 0 10,"elyhim indicates a better move would have been a3. This move made the situation worse. Post game analysis shows this as an inaccuracy. I didn't see the pawn fork at e4. Again, I used a similar tactic in a game against someone else."
20,dxe4,d5e4,r2q1rk1/pbpnbppp/1p2pn2/2P5/1P1Pp3/2NB1N2/P3QPPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 0 11,yucky
21,Nxe4,c3e4,r2q1rk1/pbpnbppp/1p2pn2/2P5/1P1PN3/3B1N2/P3QPPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 0 11,moving the other knight into the center.
