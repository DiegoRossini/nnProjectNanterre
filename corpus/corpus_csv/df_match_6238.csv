1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hello everyone, and today I will annotate a very instructive game I picked out played on GK between a C and B level player. This game shows white blundering in the opening, but holding up to the endgame. When the result is likely a draw, white slips, and loses.

So first: e4."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,the open games. Development will matter more here.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"going into the four knights game, which is not the most promising opening for white,but perfectly playable."

If white tries 5.Bxf7ch?! which I remember playing 2 years ago, then 5...Kxf7  6.Nxe4 d5!  7.Ng5ch Kg8  and black had small advantage in Me(1100) vs. opponent in 2008. Black converted his advantage well, and almost won, but only drew."

1.Loses a central pawn
2.Moves a piece twice (to a worse square too)

This was probably intended to force through d4, but with terrible ""side effects"""

Now that white is down a pawn, he will go for the draw. White's material advantage is not big enough to stop playing tactically and making threats immediately. He will try to expand his advantage if possible. Black will want to be playing much more tactically and fogging the position."
