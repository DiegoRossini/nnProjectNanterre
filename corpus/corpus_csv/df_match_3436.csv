In the Grand Prix one should generally favour knights over bishops, because the position is quite closed (at least I assume that's the reason why White almost always exchanges his light-squared bishop for Black's knight after he's played Bb5)."

I admit, not one of the greatest moves I've ever made. But I didn't see a clear way to attack, so I just decided to consolidate my position. On 365chess.com I see that 10.Qg3 and 10.e5 are common in this position, moves which I both considered but of which I didn't see a clear merit. I also see that GM Epishin once had this position and played 10.b3, which is also the move suggested by the computer."

I guess the idea is to let the rooks participate in an attack on the kingside. The computer suggests 14...Qd7. I was totally surprised by this move, of course."

Obviously 15.Bxh6?? just loses the bishop due to the pin (15...Bf8). However, the queen is a bit misplaced here as well and does not have many squares. The computer suggests 15.Qe1, but it's clear that something has gone wrong with White's attack already and that Black is doing well. I felt during the game that I was stuck without a plan, but I thought I couldn't be worse due to the many pawn moves Black has made so far. But in a strange game as this one, those kind of guidelines don't count."

The computer suggests 16...Qh7, probably with the plan of pushing the h-pawn and putting the a-rook on g8. I was down by almost half an hour on the clock: 45 minutes vs. 1 hour and 13 minutes (plus increment) for the next 24 moves."
