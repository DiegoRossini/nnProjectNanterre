1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,My usual d4 queens pawn opening.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"black chooses an indian defence, an opening that is usually a waiting type opening, at least in my experience. Black wants to know what white is going to do next..."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Book move, really, continuing along the lines of the indian defence"
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,typical move in the indian...
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,Opening book move.
6,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,Getting into the nimzo-indian here.
7,a3,a2a3,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/P1N5/1P2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"I play a3 in an attempt to trap the bishop. A possible line here is 4. a3 Ba5  5. b4 Bb6 and finally, c5 traps the bishop"
8,Bxc3+,b4c3,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/P1b5/1P2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,Black plays along along a variation of the nimzo-indian. I personally like to see a move like this early in a game trading a bishop for a knight in a game that in most cases turns out to be fairly open where bishops have a slight advantage over knights...
9,bxc3,b2c3,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/P1P5/4PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"Still in opening book theory, I was actually surprised to see this move. Most players are not that schooled this deep in the Nimzo-indian (Samisch Variation). In fact, I have no idea what the response from white is supposed to be here."

11,d5,d4d5,rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2pP4/2P5/P1P5/4PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,"We are finally out of opening theory here, as my own knowledge of this opening is limited, so I played d5 not wanting to trade one of my central pawns for one of black's flankers."
12,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2pP4/2P5/P1P5/4PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQ - 1 7,Pins the knight...

15,Bh4,g5h4,rnbq1rk1/pp1p1pp1/4pn1p/2pP4/2P4B/P1P5/4PPPP/R2QKBNR b KQ - 1 8,"Maintaining the pin and hoping for perhaps g5, a further weakening of BLack's kingside. Makes the previous move (h6) seem a bit silly..."
