1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is an interesting companion to my other recent annotation http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/oswestry-v-telepost-shropshire-league?gm=62607
In that game, I had rook, knight and two pawns for the queen, and, on an open board, the queen was slightly better. In this game, I also have to give up my queen - but my two rooks are far better than the queen on the closed board."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Defence
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,The most common move.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"My usual, although 2....d6 is more popular, normally leading to the Najdorf_Variation or the Dragon_Variation"
5,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,"Rossolimo Variation - a well-respected alternative to 3.d4. It is named after Nicolas Rossolimo and is related to the Moscow Variation. White's usual intention is to play Bxc6, giving Black doubled pawns. Black's major responses are 3...g6 preparing ...Bg7, 3...d6 preparing ...Bd7 (a hybrid line that also arises from the Moscow Variation after 2...d6 3.Bb5+ Nc6), and 3...e6 preparing 4...Nge7. Sergei Rublevsky and Tomáš Oral both play this line as well as the Moscow Variation."
6,e6,e7e6,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,"This is my usual reply, although g6 is more common."
7,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 4,The usual move.
8,Nge7,g8e7,r1bqkb1r/pp1pnppp/2n1p3/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 5,In this way I prevent him from doubling my c pawns.
9,c3,c2c3,r1bqkb1r/pp1pnppp/2n1p3/1Bp5/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 5,Thematic - preparing to play d2-d4 with a good strong pawn centre.
10,a6,a7a6,r1bqkb1r/1p1pnppp/p1n1p3/1Bp5/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 6,So I attack his bishop.
11,Bxc6,b5c6,r1bqkb1r/1p1pnppp/p1B1p3/2p5/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 6,He takes.
12,Nxc6,e7c6,r1bqkb1r/1p1p1ppp/p1n1p3/2p5/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,I take back.
13,d4,d2d4,r1bqkb1r/1p1p1ppp/p1n1p3/2p5/3PP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,He gets his centre.
14,d5,d7d5,r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1n1p3/2pp4/3PP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,But I don't give him too much of a free hand there.
15,e5,e4e5,r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1n1p3/2ppP3/3P4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,"The position is a little like an advanced French here. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Defence#Advance_Variation:_3.e5
But compared to the Advanced variation of the French Defence, white's bishop has been exchanged for a black knight, so black is slightly less cramped. Having said that, in a blocked position like this, the knight is better than the bishop. Chances are about equal"
16,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/1p2bppp/p1n1p3/2ppP3/3P4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 9,So I develop.
17,Be3,c1e3,r1bqk2r/1p2bppp/p1n1p3/2ppP3/3P4/2P1BN2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 2 9,So does he.
