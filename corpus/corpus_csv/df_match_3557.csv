In response to Blitzkov-White can take the pawn on e5. The problem is that after 8...Qxd1+ 9.Kxd1 Ng4, black secures equality already, and perhaps is having the more comfortable game. Even if this could not be so, the move e5 for black would be almost forced, since white cannot be allowed to have that kind of domination."

15,d5,d4d5,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/5n2/3Pp3/2P1P3/P1N5/1P4PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 8,I believe my opponent spent about 20/30 minutes to play this move. It is a ridiculous amount of time.

However, *since black did not do anything wrong, his position cannot be worse!*. That is all I needed to know to play my next move-after white plays b4, then I will think about what to do. Don't get this mixed up with the beginner player who moves without checking the opponent's response and then, when the opponent makes a winning move, then he thinks for 10 minutes. I know that I have played moves that were all principled in an opening that is not tactical, and with strategic foundation."
