1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"My first match in the new ""Walking The Walk"" club pitting lower ranked players against 2000+ GK players. I was wary of playing 1. e4, the ""Open Game"" move against what is sure to be a better tactical player (and how right I was!) but then again they also say you have to play what you know so here we go :) GK analysis can be found here http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=16424407&rnd=0.6628477014601231"

22,Ne7,c6e7,r2qr1k1/pppbnppp/3p4/3N4/2P1n3/8/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 3 12,We're down to two games left in the GK database. Black doesn't want to leave the strong knight on d5 while White is ok to trade it since it will fix his pawn structure. That being said the pawn will not be well supported as it is a bit extended.
23,f3,f2f3,r2qr1k1/pppbnppp/3p4/3N4/2P1n3/5P2/PPP1B1PP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 12,"This still follows the GK database with a win for White. The other option, 12. Bf3 lead to a draw. I did  consider that move and probably should have played it, this move is a bit more aggressive but opening the structure around the king is certainly problematic."

The game we had been following so far continued with 14... Qf6 15. Bc3. The text move gives the queen some more mobility but I figured the main threat was still on d4 so continued the same.

GK engine recommends the very computer-like 15. Rf2 Re7 16. Ba5 but playing 15. Ba5 immediately also seems fine, that being said going back to move 15 it's still hard for me to find a good move or plan, Ba5 was never a move that I even considered."

Re1 but I was thinking at the time that I would be able to get the queens off the board early and perhaps hold on longer. I even toyed with 16. g3 Nc3 17. gh4 Nd1 18. Bd1 but then even I could see the cracks or shall we say grand canyon gaps in White's position.
