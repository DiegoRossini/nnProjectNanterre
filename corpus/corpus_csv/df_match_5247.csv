1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,The third game from this mini tournament I have annotated and the second against spglenn.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,After playing the Flohr variation last time I was hoping for a najdorf.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,The Canal-Sokolsky attack
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,The Canal-Sokolsky attack
5,Bb5+,f1b5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 3,The Canal-Sokolsky attack
6,Bd7,c8d7,rn1qkbnr/pp1bpppp/3p4/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 4,I played this not checking the Game DB or the opening explorer but because I didn't want to play Nc3 pinning the Knight or Nd7 blocking the Queen and Bishop and Qd7 is just ridiculous.
7,Bxd7+,b5d7,rn1qkbnr/pp1Bpppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,Still by the book and once again I choose not to go into the opening explorer or Game DB but played because I wanted the flexibality of playing Nc6 rather than Nxd2 which means I have to develop the queen on the a5-d8 diagonal and the Knight is forced into a more defensive square.
8,Qxd7,d8d7,rn2kbnr/pp1qpppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,Still by the book and once again I choose not to go into the opening explorer or Game DB but played because I wanted the flexibality of playing Nc6 rather than Nxd2 which means I have to develop the queen on the a5-d8 diagonal and the Knight is forced into a more defensive square.
