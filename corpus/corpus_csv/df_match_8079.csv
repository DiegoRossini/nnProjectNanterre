1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is my fifth annotation. I hope you like it. As always (if you've read my previous annotations), the king's pawn advances two squares. It's the only thing I feel comfortable with as with many other people."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,A common response.
3,Qh5,d1h5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p2Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"A move I used to pull a while ago, but learnt it is ineffective."
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p2Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Opens up the bishop on c8 and defending e5 from my queen.
5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p2Q/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 1 3,I don't think checkmate will be achieved so easily...
6,Be6,c8e6,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3pb3/4p2Q/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 2 4,Knew it was coming. Forces my bishop to retreat.
7,Bxe6,c4e6,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3pB3/4p2Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 0 4,I take it and look for another plan.
8,Qf6,d8f6,rn2kbnr/ppp2ppp/3pBq2/4p2Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 1 5,Moving the queen to h3 was probably not the best move. Moving the bishop would have been better. I lost the bishop in this case (obviously). Not great play by me.
9,Qh3,h5h3,rn2kbnr/ppp2ppp/3pBq2/4p3/4P3/7Q/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 2 5,Moving the queen to h3 was probably not the best move. Moving the bishop would have been better. I lost the bishop in this case (obviously). Not great play by me.
