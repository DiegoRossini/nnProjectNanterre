1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"In this light game both me and my opponent blundered, but the win was mine because of a psychological effect: I went on playing trying to create as many difficulties as I could for my opponent, and he wasn't accurate enough to properly defend / counterattack. So it went:"
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"? White gives me a free tempo. If he wanted to unbalance me, he's wrong, since I will go on just like planned, but with an extra tempo."
3,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3pP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"? White gives me a free tempo. If he wanted to unbalance me, he's wrong, since I will go on just like planned, but with an extra tempo."

8,a6,a7a6,rn1qkbnr/1pp2ppp/p3p3/3pPb2/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"I ""lose"" it preventing Bb4+. Not dangerous, but the idea is to restrict white."
9,c3,c2c3,rn1qkbnr/1pp2ppp/p3p3/3pPb2/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,A strong pawn chain I think I can attack. All this is calculated by experience through a number of games.
10,c5,c7c5,rn1qkbnr/1p3ppp/p3p3/2ppPb2/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,Attacking b7.

15,Qb3,d1b3,r3kbnr/1p3ppp/pqn1p3/2ppPb2/3P4/1QP1BN2/PP3PPP/RN2KB1R b KQkq - 5 8,The best.
16,Qxb3,b6b3,r3kbnr/1p3ppp/p1n1p3/2ppPb2/3P4/1qP1BN2/PP3PPP/RN2KB1R w KQkq - 0 9,"Now the game is all of it owns. A new situation for me. I am undeveloped, but I have to find the way to get meaningful developement. Be7 won't do. I have to be very aware of b5, since the a6's weakness will hurt me in the endgame."
17,axb3,a2b3,r3kbnr/1p3ppp/p1n1p3/2ppPb2/3P4/1PP1BN2/1P3PPP/RN2KB1R b KQkq - 0 9,"Now the game is all of it owns. A new situation for me.

20,Nb4,c6b4,r3kbnr/1p3ppp/p3p3/3pPb2/1n1P4/1P2BN2/1P3PPP/RN2KB1R w KQkq - 1 11,"Not the Bishop. Because this move is much more threatening for white. I can't allow him to play his way. Bg4+ was just covered and my B would have been doing almost nothing, in this situation. I have other tricks in my sleeve."
21,Kd2,e1d2,r3kbnr/1p3ppp/p3p3/3pPb2/1n1P4/1P2BN2/1P1K1PPP/RN3B1R b kq - 2 11,"! Sensible. No good way to defend. Ra5 loses it, sooner or later."

28,Nc2,b4c2,2r1kbnr/1p3ppp/p3p3/3pP3/3P4/1bNNB3/1PnK1PPP/R4B1R w k - 2 15,"NxBe6 could be a good idea, intending to use h6 as a dev square for my minors."
29,Be2,f1e2,2r1kbnr/1p3ppp/p3p3/3pP3/3P4/1bNNB3/1PnKBPPP/R6R b k - 3 15,??
30,Nxe3,c2e3,2r1kbnr/1p3ppp/p3p3/3pP3/3P4/1bNNn3/1P1KBPPP/R6R w k - 0 16,?? I was so sure he would have defended the R that I didn't consider he actually did not!
31,fxe3,f2e3,2r1kbnr/1p3ppp/p3p3/3pP3/3P4/1bNNP3/1P1KB1PP/R6R b k - 0 16,"Now the N is safely developed here, with a good position (Nf5...) and my B is safe on b3. I was now so glad I didn't play b5!"
32,Nh6,g8h6,2r1kb1r/1p3ppp/p3p2n/3pP3/3P4/1bNNP3/1P1KB1PP/R6R w k - 1 17,"Now the N is safely developed here, with a good position (Nf5...) and my B is safe on b3. I was now so glad I didn't play b5!"

34,Be7,f8e7,2r1k2r/1p2bppp/p3p2n/3pP3/3P2P1/1bNNP3/1P1KB2P/R6R w k - 1 18,"Now this move is sensible. I have to remember, though, that this bishop is condemned to take the WN should it jump to c5."
