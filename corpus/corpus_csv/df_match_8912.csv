1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This was the 7th and last round of the 2008 North American Open. I played in the U1700 section and had 3.5 points going in the last round. I was out of the money so the game was important to me for 2 reasons. (1) possible creative achievement.  (2) personal pride(The best I had done at a big national tournament was 3.5/7)
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I love playing both sides of the french.
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,This move was sort of a bluff. I had prepared somewhat to play the tarrash but if my opponent really knew his stuff I knew I could be in trouble.

7,Nxe4,d2e4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/3PN3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,Theory frowns on the queen capture here as white is supposed to take advantage of the position of blacks queen on f6. Theory reccomends taking with the g pawn.

13,Bd3,f1d3,rnb1kb1r/ppp2pp1/4pq1p/8/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,Just calmly developing my pieces.
14,Bd6,f8d6,rnb1k2r/ppp2pp1/3bpq1p/8/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 8,Making way for a possible rook lift.

19,dxe5,d4e5,rnb1k2r/ppp1qpp1/4p2p/4P3/7P/3B4/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 10,Now the bishop is stuck behind the pawn chain. It is natural to develop it on b7 but this lead to problems in the game. Perhaps it would have been better to play Bd7-Bc6.
