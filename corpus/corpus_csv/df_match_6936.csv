1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

In several of my recent games Glenda the Defender has found herself on h6 - wow that is in the enemy camp!  Well, her excursions into the enemy camp have brought me various types of outcomes.  This is the worst one so I will get this one out of the way now.  This is a mini-tournament which featured the International Master Beafyness, who I will remind you scored 1-1 against Coach Ion.  This game is a Sicilian Dragon.  Sicilian Dragons and Sicilian Naijdorfs can be quite hairy because they can involve white castling long and black castling short.  Pawn storms on both sides can ensue.  The question is, who will Cop Old Matey first?  I think you can guess the answer here....."
