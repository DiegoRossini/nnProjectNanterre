1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I am white in this fast time control game. It shows how having more mobility for development is more important than a stupid pawn.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"This is the most popular response in Grandmaster games, but 1...e5 is the most popular amongst amateur games."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Accurate developing move.
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,Committing to a plan too early in the game can be dangerous. Black is committing to fianchettoing his kingside bishop on only the second move.
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,Gaining more mobility for development.
6,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Slightly safer is b6, but it's also very passive and less exciting."
7,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/8/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"One thing about me is that I don't like to waste moves taking pawns. I develop another piece while Black has yet to develop.
One might think Qxd4 is a good move since it attacks Black's rook while centralizing the queen, but it's a risky move so if you want to play it, do it at your own risk."
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/8/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,"Black could've held onto the pawn with 4...e5, and I can't play Nxe5?? because of Qa5 ! winning the knight. But it's okay, I don't want to waste a move taking the pawn anyway."
9,c3,c2c3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/8/2BpP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"I am giving up a pawn for more central space and mobility for development, plus another developing move. This will transpose into a variation of the Morra Gambit (e4 c5 d4 cxd4 c3 dxc3 Nxc3) but where Black has played g6, and playing g6 isn't good in the Morra Gambit, as you'll see."
10,dxc3,d4c3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/8/2B1P3/2p2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"I have three very strongly placed pieces in the centre, plus a pawn and queen giving additional support. While all Black has is one piece developed and a cramped position. Playing this opening as White is risky because Black may recover and hold onto his extra pawn, but I love to take risks in chess since it makes it more fun."
11,Nxc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/8/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"I have three very strongly placed pieces in the centre, plus a pawn and queen giving additional support. While all Black has is one piece developed and a cramped position. Playing this opening as White is risky because Black may recover and hold onto his extra pawn, but I love to take risks in chess since it makes it more fun."
12,e6,e7e6,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1p1p/2n1p1p1/8/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"Controlling the d5 square, which I have four pieces attacking."
13,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1p1p/2n1p1p1/8/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 7,"All my moves have been for development, so as a result of my pawn sacrifice, I can complete my development easily and all my pieces will have active squares, while Black is cramped and has to struggle to develop."
14,d6,d7d6,r1bqkbnr/pp3p1p/2npp1p1/8/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,"Black needs to secure the squares on the third rank to make his position solid before he can comfortably complete development, but by then I'll have already launched an attack."
15,Qe2,d1e2,r1bqkbnr/pp3p1p/2npp1p1/8/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP2QPPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 1 8,Clearing way to bring my rook to the d-file. I shouldn't develop my queenside bishop yet since there isn't a clear place for it to be developed. I should develop my sharper pieces first and then a proper place for my bishop will come into play.
16,a6,a7a6,r1bqkbnr/1p3p1p/p1npp1p1/8/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP2QPPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 0 9,Securing more squares.
17,Rd1,f1d1,r1bqkbnr/1p3p1p/p1npp1p1/8/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP2QPPP/R1BR2K1 b kq - 1 9,"Black's main weakness in the Morra Gambit is having a weak d-pawn. If I can win Black's pawn, then material will be even and I'll retain a superior position."
18,Qc7,d8c7,r1b1kbnr/1pq2p1p/p1npp1p1/8/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP2QPPP/R1BR2K1 w kq - 2 10,"If Black leaves his queen on the original square, then I will have a lot of tactical threats on the d-file and dark squares, and Black's position will be even more cramped."
19,Bf4,c1f4,r1b1kbnr/1pq2p1p/p1npp1p1/8/2B1PB2/2N2N2/PP2QPPP/R2R2K1 b kq - 3 10,"Since my bishop doesn't have an active role yet, I decide to clear the way for my rooks to double on the d-file, while enticing Black to play e5, which will weaken the light squares in his position, especially d5."
20,Nf6,g8f6,r1b1kb1r/1pq2p1p/p1nppnp1/8/2B1PB2/2N2N2/PP2QPPP/R2R2K1 w kq - 4 11,"Black is barely starting to develop, while my already developed active pieces are reaching maximum attacking potential, and Black's position is cramped."
21,Rd2,d1d2,r1b1kb1r/1pq2p1p/p1nppnp1/8/2B1PB2/2N2N2/PP1RQPPP/R5K1 b kq - 5 11,Preparing to double.
