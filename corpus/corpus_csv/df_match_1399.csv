7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3P4/2P5/2N5/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,He does however not accept and with Nc3 I will start the trade.
8,exd5,e6d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/2P5/2N5/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,an in between check that in my opinion only allows me to develop my bishop early.

Qd7 also leads to Qxb7 and the loss of a rook as well. Bd7 leads to Qxd5 losing my knight and so the only decent option was..."

18,Bxd5,e6d5,r2qkb1r/pQ1n1ppp/2p5/3b4/8/8/PP1P1PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 0 10,That or d4 were his only moves as Nc5 locks the queen (10. Nf3 Nc5 11.Qb4 Nd3+ and the queen is mine).

He now has two options being 11.Qe2 and 11.Ne2 (as 11.Be2 leads to 11.... Bxg2 winning the rook)"
21,Ne2,g1e2,r3kb1r/p2nqppp/Q1p5/3b4/8/8/PP1PNPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 3 11,"He chose Ne2 which in my opinion is the least good, I would've opted for Qe2. And thus now I unleash my final blow:"

I would've taken the knight on b3 to get the active knight and bishop back for my queen."
28,Rxf8,h8f8,r3kr2/p4ppp/2p5/3b4/4q3/1n6/PP1PNPPP/R1BK1B1R w q - 0 15,"Taking a tempo before attaking my knight, it however bumps into the nice:"

30,Qg4+,e4g4,r3kr2/p4ppp/2p5/3b4/6q1/1nN5/PP1P1PPP/R1BK1B1R w q - 2 16,Qg4+ which wins another pawn with tempo as f3 is not an option (16.f3 Bxf3+ 17.gxf3 Qxg3 winning the rook) and 16. Ke1 Nxa1 and mating issues with Nc2.
