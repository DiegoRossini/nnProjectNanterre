1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"In this game, White challenged black (me) to a vigorous game of Chess. Unfortunately, it resulted in the systematic destruction of White's power.  Instead of crushing my opponent, I just picked White off before looking for opportunities to get a checkmate, while avoiding checkmate myself.  She had me at the ropes several times, but I managed to checkmate White in 26 moves. 

White opens with King Pawn opening (e4)."

In my experience with playing this player, she moves her a and h pawns in order to prevent the bishops from pinning her knights.  I respond as Black by deploying my gN to f6."

My target as Black was the undefended c2 pawn.  ...Nc2, Kd1, Nxa1. I had no interest in the Queen at that time, even though she would have been a tasty target if White moved Kd1."
