1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"White stakes an immediate claim, but the more I logically examine this claim, I have to wonder if the English opening claim amounts to unsound play because black can, should he elect, play d5 almost any time he wants.  An immediate d5 does fail to wrest control of d5, but consider 1.c4 d5 2.cxd5 Qxd5 3.Nc3 Qa5, and White retains control, but Black has an active game very similar to the center-counter games.  While the center-counter (1.e4 d5) may run in the face of common chess theory, it proves to be very resilient and has no clear refutation.  Its play funnels white and black down a strict line, which Andrew Martin, in The Essential Center Counter, believes is responsible for its relative lack of popularity among masters who prefer choice in defence and attack, but I see no real reason why its open and immediate defiance might not work against 1.c4."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"However, those who dislike the idea of 1.c4 d5 should consider 1.c4 Nf6.  The played move is standard fare especially followed by 2... Nf6, and is considered quite respectable and sound, but it proceeds on the idea of letting the White plan proceed,strong control of d5, while achieving a concession: strong black control of d4.  Should black attempt to claim d4 by either c5 or e5?  Whether e5 or c5 is best is probably a matter of taste, but consider playing flexibly with 1...Nf6.  Black also has the option with either c6 or e6 denying White the outpost at d5.  White nearly loses control of d5 while Black has retains the surprise advantage by having the capability to choose c6, c5, e6, or e5 as best fits White's successive setup decisions.  1.c4 Nf6 2.Nc6 d5 3.cxd5 Nxd5 4.e4 shows White with a slender control of d5, but his hold is weak owing largely to a later Black c6 or e6.  I have to wonder how many white moves would be well played to all of the potential Black variations that can follow.  However, one disadvantage of an early Nf6 is that it precludes the strong king-side attacks that follow a black f5.  Given the familiarity that English players develop with Flank attacks, I think that making an immediate attack in the center may be one of Black's strongest continuations because commonly-held chess generalizations hold that if you want to attack on the flank, the center must hold."
3,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"This realization of just how tenuous White's hold of d5 is prompted some play rather discouraged by Tony Kosten.  This move allows Black to rather strongly develop his bishop to a post controlling the a7-f2 diagonal.  It also fairly effectively cedes control of d4 to Black.  While d4 is not lost just yet and White may be able to secure it, it is a gamble.  I expected my familiarity with the ""Botvinnik-style"" position to aide me here, but Black has real and compelling advantages."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2P1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"Both Black and White would like nothing more than winning material while maintaining the advantages already present, but it never is so.  3.Nc3 allows Black to win the e pawn, but at the cost of control of d4.  I played 3.d3 because I quite often prefer to meet 3...Bb4+ with an offer of exact material equality on such an exchange.  The exchange of Bishop for Knight is trading an apple for an orange, and the knight-bishop exchange requires evaluating the position more accurately than a trade of bishop-for-bishop or knight-for-knight.  Later play suggests that this Knight move might be an error."

Nf3 blocks the white f pawn from joining in the king-side fight sould one occur, and it allows the pin brought by Bg4.  Nf3 first would allow h3 with temp, but what would white do after Bh5?  The response g4 commits to king-side expansion.  I had doubts that I should castle kingside because of the c5 bishop.  Yes, a3 prepared b4, but a6 discouraged an immediate b4 although with preparation the expansion is still playable.  6.a3 also prevents the bishop from coming to b4, although I did not believe that was a real threat.  I was more concerned with Bd4.  I was playing against a higher rated player and thought I would make generally useful moves until it was clear whether the king-side or queen-side thrust was most advantageous.  It also provides complications for black as he must prepare for both continuations too."

As long as these conditions are met, the White knight will not be dislodged without considerable cost.
