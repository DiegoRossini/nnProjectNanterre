e6 is a somewhat two edged sword for black in the Pirc. It can, combined with c5, help to break through... but it can also lead to a weakened king safety and unfavorable pawn structures for black."

I was not sure what to do in this situation, so my opponent at least confused me. e5 would block both our bishops. However one could aim for f5 and Bxf5 after an exchange. But since I'm no friend of that much closed up Positions..."

e.g. 9 Be3? Ng4! 
However the move is not that bad. Although it will ruin my pawn structure on the kingsside"
