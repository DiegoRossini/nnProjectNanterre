1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Hi everyone!  Here I missed out on getting my first win against Bob and ended up with my 5th low draw against him.  In the endgame I had the opportunity to win a piece but I missed it.  Just for the record I tried another c3 Sicilian.
