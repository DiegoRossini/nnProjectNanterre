1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi all, and here is a game from a nearby Longplay Cup, which I won, against all the odds, just after I completely blundered my own queen! Yes, you DID read that correctly: not sacrificed, not lost against a tricky tactic - just an out-and-out complete blunder! I could hardly believe it after I saw it! The title, if nothing else, should make this game interesting to comment on!"
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"My opponent opens with the King Pawn, so I reply with my characteristic French Defence."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"The usual move for White against 1...e6, as well as against 1...d6, 1...c6, 1...h6!? and anything else like that, is to occupy the centre with his central pawns, and play 2.d4. Clearly my opponent does not know the French Defence particularly well. Having said that, this move can sometimes transpose back into main line French Defence positions."
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"A crucial move in the French Defence: 2...d5 to strike back at White's central control. This should be easier, since he has not yet placed a pawn on the d4-square, to form a classical pawn centre."
5,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3P4/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"OH NO!!!!!! My opponent chooses the ghastly, boring Exchange Variation of the French Defence! This is a drawish, slow-moving, symmetrical variation in which the pawn-structure is fixed, and both sides develop normally - this often results in a draw. Given my ambitions to win (I wanted my initial ECF Longplay rating to be as high as possible) this was not good for me."
6,exd5,e6d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,Transposing straight back into a boring Exchange French position.

This would also lock White's bishop out of the game for the moment. I was more concerned with developing quickly, and hopefully livening up the position with a middlegame attack."
