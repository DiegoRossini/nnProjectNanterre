Theory dictates that ..b4 is inferior to ..bc, as it closes the position for black on the qs, leaving black's only opportunities on the kingside, while white retains options on both wings. However, this is the reason I wanted to try it: black can focus on the kingside, and does not need to deal with the myriad of additional threats white can make after the flexible ..bc. Black has an advanced f pawn, a semi-open g-file against the castled white king, an active light-square bishop, and is preparing moves like ..Rg8, ..h5,..h4, and even has the option to play ..f5 to increase the mobility of his central pawns. This game is interesting as it demonstrates the practical problems black has to hold his qs together after ..b5. The big problem of course is white's c-pawn, and on reflection I now think as a result of the game and the problems I faced from white playing c5 that it is better to play ..bc"
