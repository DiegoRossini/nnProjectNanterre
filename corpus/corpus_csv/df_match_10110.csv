Qc3 and that bringing out my queen was a mistake as the moves made by my queen were forced (which they were) He also pointed out that i was one of the  lower rated players and as such he wouldn't be playing me anytime soon as losing to me would stop him from getting into the 2000s maybe more...."

15,Qa4,d4a4,r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/1N6/Q3P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 2 8,thinking behind this is simple attack on a7 pawn after 9. Be3 as well as development. Queen in a very weak position though and whites opening is severely flawed.

Also last time i took a risk against this opponent i paid for it.
