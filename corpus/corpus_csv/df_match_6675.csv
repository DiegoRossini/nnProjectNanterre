14,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 1 8,"okay,this is how the yugoslav attack looks like,place your pieces exactly like i have done."

18,e6,e7e6,r1bq1rk1/pp3pbp/2nppnp1/8/2BNP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 10,"i dont like that move. i dont think it's good for black, he should maybe play the chinese dragon variation by playing Rb8,a6,b5 or Bd7,Rc8,Ne5,Qa5 etc."
19,O-O-O,e1c1,r1bq1rk1/pp3pbp/2nppnp1/8/2BNP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR3R b - - 1 10,now i started the attack with h4.
20,Bd7,c8d7,r2q1rk1/pp1b1pbp/2nppnp1/8/2BNP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR3R w - - 2 11,now i started the attack with h4.

23,Bb3,c4b3,r2q1rk1/pp1b1pbp/3ppnp1/4n3/3NP2P/1BN1BP2/PPPQ2P1/2KR3R b - - 2 12,planning the move Nc4

25,Bh6,e3h6,2rq1rk1/pp1b1pbp/3ppnpB/4n3/3NP2P/1BN2P2/PPPQ2P1/2KR3R b - - 4 13,"ok this is another move in the yugoslav attack,exchange the dark squared bishop and then open up the h-file somehow and move in with the queen to h6."
26,Nc4,e5c4,2rq1rk1/pp1b1pbp/3ppnpB/8/2nNP2P/1BN2P2/PPPQ2P1/2KR3R w - - 5 14,okey he wants to tackle the queen away and stop the yugoslav attack but i dont want that of course so i surrender my light squared bishop.
27,Bxc4,b3c4,2rq1rk1/pp1b1pbp/3ppnpB/8/2BNP2P/2N2P2/PPPQ2P1/2KR3R b - - 0 14,it's better for white if the black bishop takes his own bishop instead to gain tempo but you can play this move as well.
28,Rxc4,c8c4,3q1rk1/pp1b1pbp/3ppnpB/8/2rNP2P/2N2P2/PPPQ2P1/2KR3R w - - 0 15,it's better for white if the black bishop takes his own bishop instead to gain tempo but you can play this move as well.
29,Bxg7,h6g7,3q1rk1/pp1b1pBp/3ppnp1/8/2rNP2P/2N2P2/PPPQ2P1/2KR3R b - - 0 15,it's better for white if the black bishop takes his own bishop instead to gain tempo but you can play this move as well.
30,Kxg7,g8g7,3q1r2/pp1b1pkp/3ppnp1/8/2rNP2P/2N2P2/PPPQ2P1/2KR3R w - - 0 16,playing h5 immediately wouldn't help since he can just take the pawn with the knight so playing this move helps white a lot.
31,g4,g2g4,3q1r2/pp1b1pkp/3ppnp1/8/2rNP1PP/2N2P2/PPPQ4/2KR3R b - - 0 16,playing h5 immediately wouldn't help since he can just take the pawn with the knight so playing this move helps white a lot.
32,a6,a7a6,3q1r2/1p1b1pkp/p2ppnp1/8/2rNP1PP/2N2P2/PPPQ4/2KR3R w - - 0 17,a6 can be played earlier in the game but then it would be named dragjorf i think lol. you know instead of e6 he can play a6 and then b5.
33,h5,h4h5,3q1r2/1p1b1pkp/p2ppnp1/7P/2rNP1P1/2N2P2/PPPQ4/2KR3R b - - 0 17,okey now i played h5. i think it's better for black to open up the h-file than the g-file by letting me capture his pawn instead.
34,b5,b7b5,3q1r2/3b1pkp/p2ppnp1/1p5P/2rNP1P1/2N2P2/PPPQ4/2KR3R w - - 0 18,so now i opened up the h-file
35,hxg6,h5g6,3q1r2/3b1pkp/p2ppnP1/1p6/2rNP1P1/2N2P2/PPPQ4/2KR3R b - - 0 18,so now i opened up the h-file
36,fxg6,f7g6,3q1r2/3b2kp/p2ppnp1/1p6/2rNP1P1/2N2P2/PPPQ4/2KR3R w - - 0 19,since now the rook is supporting my queen i can finally move her to h6 just like in the yugoslav attack.
37,Qh6+,d2h6,3q1r2/3b2kp/p2ppnpQ/1p6/2rNP1P1/2N2P2/PPP5/2KR3R b - - 1 19,since now the rook is supporting my queen i can finally move her to h6 just like in the yugoslav attack.
38,Kf7,g7f7,3q1r2/3b1k1p/p2ppnpQ/1p6/2rNP1P1/2N2P2/PPP5/2KR3R w - - 2 20,Now i had like 4 mins left and i wasn't sure how to play but i think i played the best move here...
39,g5,g4g5,3q1r2/3b1k1p/p2ppnpQ/1p4P1/2rNP3/2N2P2/PPP5/2KR3R b - - 0 20,i think now white is having a winning position
40,b4,b5b4,3q1r2/3b1k1p/p2ppnpQ/6P1/1prNP3/2N2P2/PPP5/2KR3R w - - 0 21,well he had like 6 mins here and he wasn't sure how to play either but exchanging the knights make it more dangerous for black as you will see.
