5,d4,d2d4,rnb1kbnr/ppppqppp/8/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"Nc3 is usually a pretty popular response instead, since Nd5 is protected by Pe4 and can be followed by NxPc7+ which forks the king and rook.  Black has decent defenses against that, though."
6,a5,a7a5,rnb1kbnr/1pppqppp/8/p3p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,Black usually plays d6 or Nc6 or Nf6.  Pa5 is not really recommended.

36,Ne7,g8e7,3k3r/qpNbn3/5p2/p1bp2pp/7P/5NB1/PPP2PP1/R2Q1RK1 w - - 1 19,This was a good move on black's part.
