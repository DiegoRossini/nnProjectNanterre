1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Here is recent team game. It contains one of the more interesting endgames I've had in a while - six pawns vs. a bishop and three pawns. I have the white pieces, and set up a very formidable attack involving a dual rook lift in front of my own castled position.  Black counters the threat nicely, and ends up picking up a piece for three pawns. The endgame took some work, but white's pawns were able to carry the day. I felt this game was worthy of sharing, as the endgame was quite instructive. Enjoy:)"
