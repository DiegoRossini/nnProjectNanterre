9,Nd5,c3d5,r1b1kb1r/ppqppppp/2n2n2/1BpN4/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 7 5,"A good move, still deterring an early ...d5."

16,cxd4,c5d4,r1b1kb1r/ppqppppp/8/1B1n4/3p4/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 9,Consistent although a little risky.
17,Nxd4,f3d4,r1b1kb1r/ppqppppp/8/1B1n4/3N4/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 9,"Qxd4 developing the Q would be more consistent and I think slightly stronger, but this is ok."

19,c4,c2c4,r1b1kb1r/ppqp1ppp/4p3/1B1n4/2PN4/8/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 10,A good move. White drives the N back and deters d5.
20,Nf6,d5f6,r1b1kb1r/ppqp1ppp/4pn2/1B6/2PN4/8/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 1 11,This is the position Black sees as defensible. White has an edge in development but limited targets.

23,Qc2,d1c2,r1b1k2r/ppqpbppp/4pn2/1B4B1/2PN4/8/PPQ2PPP/R4RK1 b kq - 4 12,"?! Opposing Queens opens up the possibility of tactics and hampers the LSB retreat. Better was Qe2 and Rc1
."

25,Ba4,b5a4,r1b1k2r/1pqpbppp/p3pn2/6B1/B1PN4/8/PPQ2PPP/R4RK1 b kq - 1 13,Black castles and is now prepared to start undermining White's position.
26,O-O,e8g8,r1b2rk1/1pqpbppp/p3pn2/6B1/B1PN4/8/PPQ2PPP/R4RK1 w - - 2 14,Black castles and is now prepared to start undermining White's position.
27,g3,g2g3,r1b2rk1/1pqpbppp/p3pn2/6B1/B1PN4/6P1/PPQ2P1P/R4RK1 b - - 0 14,"?! My lower rated opponent sees that he could play Bf4 if the pawn protects the bishop. But a more skilled player does not create holes around the K unnecessarily. This move actually contributes to the final mating net. Here if Bf4, e5! anyway. So better was Rc1."
28,d5,d7d5,r1b2rk1/1pq1bppp/p3pn2/3p2B1/B1PN4/6P1/PPQ2P1P/R4RK1 w - - 0 15,Finally...d5 in one move! Black has freed his position and is a pawn to the good.
29,b3,b2b3,r1b2rk1/1pq1bppp/p3pn2/3p2B1/B1PN4/1P4P1/P1Q2P1P/R4RK1 b - - 0 15,?! This move supports the c pawn but blocks the bishop's retreat.
