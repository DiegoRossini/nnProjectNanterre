3,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"This is the queen's exchange variation. Of course black can try to avoid the exchange, and take advantage of the miplaced white's queen. But, in return, his own queen is misplaced and easily chased all around the board. Nc6, defending it, allows a tempo for Nd5, that black must avoid at any cost. And about Qa5, I can recommend it only in another line (where white plays d4 earlier)."

I've not played enough games to say which is better, provided that e6 sets a strong defence, though giving the dark squares (and betting white cannot do too much harm on them), or the tempting e5, that blocks white's dsb but sets a target for white, that in that case has developement advantage (by castling and Re1). So I decided to try something new, giving priority to my king's ""safety"" (I normally castle queenside in my Scandivian. White's attacks over the queenside are well known to me, and I still believe I can survive by attacking white's kingside (the kind of game I like :-). What about the lsb? Even if it seems bad, I assume it would be exchanged by the knight now in f3, and there is no problem at all, provided it makes me semi-open the h file..."

During the game, I thought that white feared Bxc2, but in fact this would have favoured him, by opening lines against my weak castled king. 
The played move gets me the chance to reverse my selflocked position with the thriumphant..."

White's move here was Rb1, and then try to exchange my annoying bishop. As always, it's easy to see afterwards."
