I'm trying to learn a bit more theory on openings and middle games, but to be honest, everyone is bound to develop their own strategies. So, hope you enjoy!"
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Ok, one thing i know is that this opening move 1.. c5 is supposed to unbalance the game, which is true. White now has stake of control over the d5 square (white square) and black now has stake on the d4 square (black). However, white's pawn on e4 pretty much seals that square but places it under future threat, for which white has to defend. I like to take the outside control approach."
