1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Not much to say about this one. Playing black I usually respond to e4 with some variation of the Sicilian. Here White plays to transpose into an English with 2. c4.  I formulated a plan early which consisted of aggressively posting my knight on d4 then bearing down on the Queen-side, both points I was able to do. There is little annotation as the game plays itself out."

This is possible without this move but some other moves could have prevented this. I thought that White may play Be2 and try to castle, then I would trade knights, take on f3, then post the knight. Although it played out slightly differently the end result was the same."
