1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,My standard opening move.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Having played jkedzie before (and if you look at her profile), she 'always' plays 1...c5. She knows my opening moves and I'm happy to play them for a second chance to see if I can play my opening better against her."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"I'm used to seeing 3. Bb5, 3. Bc4 or 3. d4 here."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"I'm used to seeing 3. Bb5, 3. Bc4 or 3. d4 here."
5,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 3,"I'm used to seeing 3. Bb5, 3. Bc4 or 3. d4 here."
6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 4 4,All four knights are out!
7,Nxe5,f3e5,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4N3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"The Halloween Gambit - I'm not sure how it gets the name, but I find it really scary."
8,Nxe5,c6e5,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4n3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Yay, I'm winning!?"
9,d4,d2d4,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4n3/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,Pushing back the knight and giving White the initiative to attack.
10,Ng6,e5g6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5nn1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,More pressure on my knight... and a critical juncture in the game.

12,Bb4,f8b4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/5nn1/4P3/1b1P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,"The obvious move is 6... Ng8 but having played my opponent several times before, I didn't like the idea of giving her time, space and the lead in development. My original thinking is that I can give up the knight to have three pieces active on the board."
13,exf6,e5f6,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/5Pn1/8/1b1P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,White happily accepts his piece back.
14,Qxf6,d8f6,r1b1k2r/pppp1ppp/5qn1/8/1b1P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,"In my previous game, these double bishops turn out to cause me a massive amount of trouble."
15,Bd3,f1d3,r1b1k2r/pppp1ppp/5qn1/8/1b1P4/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 8,"In my previous game, these double bishops turn out to cause me a massive amount of trouble."

17,a3,a2a3,r1b1k2r/ppp2ppp/5qn1/3p4/1b1P4/P1NB4/1PP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 9,Forcing the bishop to do something.
18,Bxc3+,b4c3,r1b1k2r/ppp2ppp/5qn1/3p4/3P4/P1bB4/1PP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 10,"9... Bd6 could be considered, I suppose, but Black gives up a pawn and gives up nice squares for the knight to operate in."
19,bxc3,b2c3,r1b1k2r/ppp2ppp/5qn1/3p4/3P4/P1PB4/2P2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 10,This is a problem for Black - not only does he have to contend with a double bishops but this half-open b-file causes him too many problems.
20,Nh4,g6h4,r1b1k2r/ppp2ppp/5q2/3p4/3P3n/P1PB4/2P2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 11,"Black's third problem in this opening is the lack of co-ordination of his pieces. This is an attempt to co-ordinate my pieces and, honestly, Nf4 looks much better for that now."

23,Qh5,d1h5,r3k2r/ppp2ppp/5q2/3p1b1Q/3P3n/P1PB4/2P2PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 4 12,Could probably have played 12. O-O but thought I was safe to play 12. Bxd3. I missed the weakness at...
