1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"1. e4 is very logical.  In terms of space, it occupies a center square (e4) and attacks another one (d5).  It also attacks f5 which can be considered part of the extended center.  In terms of development, it opens the f1-a6 diagonal for the bishop, and the d1-h5 diagonal for the queen.  Its drawbacks are few, but they do exist.  Pawns cannot retreat, so the e-pawn can never help secure the d4 or f4 squares.  Lastly, the e-pawn itself may come under attack."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,The Sicilian defense immediately introduces an imbalance into the game.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2P1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"In some ways this is an effort to restore symmetry.  The d4 square is seriously weakened, however, because no white pawn can fight for control over it.  This is a significant concession so early in the game."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/2P1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"Naturally, black develops with an eye towards securing d4 permanently."
5,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/2P1P3/5N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 3,"White might be mixing systems.  The king knight belongs on e2, if white wishes to play with pawns on c4, d3, and e4.  White would then fianchetto the king bishop.  That's the normal Nimzo-Botvinnik system."
6,g6,g7g6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/2p5/2P1P3/5N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Again, developing with an eye on d4."
7,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/2p5/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"The last chance to transpose into a ""normal"" Sicilian was 4. d4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 leading to a Maroczy bind.  Once a feared continuation, it has been fairly well established in modern theory that black has adequate defensive resources."
8,Bg7,f8g7,r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/2p5/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,"Now, white cannot play d4."
9,d3,d2d3,r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/2p5/2P1P3/2NP1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"As mentioned in a previous note, the king knight belongs on e2 in this pawn formation."
10,d6,d7d6,r1bqk1nr/pp2ppbp/2np2p1/2p5/2P1P3/2NP1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,Continuing to seek control of the dark center squares and opening the c8-h3 diagonal for the bishop.
11,Be3,c1e3,r1bqk1nr/pp2ppbp/2np2p1/2p5/2P1P3/2NPBN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,Seeking to contest Black's control over d4.
12,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/2p5/2P1P3/2NPBN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 7,Black is thinking about driving the bishop on e3 from its post by playing a timely Ng4.
13,h3,h2h3,r1bqk2r/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/2p5/2P1P3/2NPBN1P/PP3PP1/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"A possibility that white removes, but at the cost of a tempo."
14,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/2p5/2P1P3/2NPBN1P/PP3PP1/R2QKB1R w KQ - 1 8,"Black is ahead in development.  Now that he has castled kingside, he will try to secure a spatial advantage on the queenside."
15,Be2,f1e2,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/2p5/2P1P3/2NPBN1P/PP2BPP1/R2QK2R b KQ - 2 8,"The bishop is very passively placed on e2, but white needs to complete his development.."
16,a6,a7a6,r1bq1rk1/1p2ppbp/p1np1np1/2p5/2P1P3/2NPBN1P/PP2BPP1/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 9,Black wishes to advance on the queenside in order to secure more space.
17,O-O,e1g1,r1bq1rk1/1p2ppbp/p1np1np1/2p5/2P1P3/2NPBN1P/PP2BPP1/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 9,"Again, with the idea of expanding on the queenside with b7-b5."
18,Rb8,a8b8,1rbq1rk1/1p2ppbp/p1np1np1/2p5/2P1P3/2NPBN1P/PP2BPP1/R2Q1RK1 w - - 2 10,"Again, with the idea of expanding on the queenside with b7-b5."

20,b5,b7b5,1rbq1rk1/4ppbp/p1np1np1/1pp5/2P1P3/P1NPBN1P/1P2BPP1/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 11,"Black has secured a spatial advantage.  If the pawn gets to b4 it will also increase the range of the bishop on g7, which is already the best minor piece on the board."
21,cxb5,c4b5,1rbq1rk1/4ppbp/p1np1np1/1Pp5/4P3/P1NPBN1P/1P2BPP1/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 11,"It would be better to grin and bear the advance of black's queenside pawns.  The capture on b5 does nothing to stop the expansion, and only weakens white's control over d5."
