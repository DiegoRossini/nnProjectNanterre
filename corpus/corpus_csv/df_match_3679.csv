1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The key is to offer both sides plenty of positional troubles and goals to solve, while keeping tactics alive and well. That means there should be contact and tension between the forces, and the position needs some real imbalance to it positionally. If you turn it to a tactical melee, it is not really about safety check, but about calculation and tactical skills."

Also, the bishops are in contact with the white army, and could attack the weaknesses. White really has no tactic chances vs black. OK, black did have to sacrifice a pawn to do it, but so what? White cannot promote that extra pawn. The desciption fits the typical club player, who in this case is stronger than average. He likes material and highly values it, so subconsciously rejected ...Nd5 as being good for white, since he wins a pawn. He is willing to go through these troubles since he has the pawn. In my opinion, he is fighting a losing battle."

Some strong players may say so, but he is in the strong level if he were to play on the site, probably well in the 1900/2000 range if he takes his time, but it depends on how much time he uses, of course. The point is that white had to concentrate so hard on his positonal troubles, and failed to safety check the black ideas. This happens naturally to most club players. That is the reason for them to make these tactical blunders without being in a tactical position."
