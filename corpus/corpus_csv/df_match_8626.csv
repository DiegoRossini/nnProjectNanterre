1,h4,h2h4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/7P/8/PPPPPPP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Another futile duel with Freddy.  This time he kicks off with yet another unusual opening - 1. h4.  At one stage I end up being 2 pawns up, but with my kingside pawn structure it was only a matter of time before Freddy harvested the pawns like ripe apples.  Material was even for most of the game and even when I went behind I tried to make something out of the position.  Alas, the queenside became a death trap for poor ole King Henry.  Freddy crowned a pawn and on the next move delivered the coup de grace with a knight."
