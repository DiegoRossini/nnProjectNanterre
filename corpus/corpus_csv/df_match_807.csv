It is very active and tactical due to the open nature of the position. Naturally, there is the danger that White's big center will lead to a strong attack. Yet by sidestepping the pawn steamroller and attacking it, Black can feel relatively secure. White may have the center, but Black can chip away at it from the supports by playing ...Bg4, moving the Knight from f6, and acting on the Queenside. Enough small talk though, on with the action!"
