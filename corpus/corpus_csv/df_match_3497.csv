1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"When I first learned to play, I learned to start with e4. But there is so much material to learn for the Sicilian that I decided with my coaches encouragement to change to d4 and later to c4 as my opening. I do not like to play e4 against players rated over 1600, but I feel I must do so as a surprise sometimes."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,This move puts us either into the two Knights or four Knights and I am very comfortable with those. I am also comfortable with Bc5 and the the Evans Gambit. Too bad I didn't get to play that here.

7,d4,d2d4,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2BPP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,"I rarely play the Scotch, but my coach has encouraged me to do so, and I recently spent 4 hours of training on the opening with my coach, so I decided to play it for the experience."
8,exd4,e5d4,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"This is a  safer line, in my opinion than the Scotch Gambit."

I could certainly exchange the Knight on c6, but the pawn structure hasn't been settled yet, and it could open up. I will hold onto the Bishop pair just a bit longer, to see how things unfold."

I have taken us out of book with my mix-up, but Black must figure out what to do about the pawn on c6. I understand this move, but I think Nb8 is more accurate. It allows the Bishop to develop to a much better square. I think this Bishop stayed stuck for quite some time."

21,Nf5,d4f5,r2q1rk1/pbpnbppp/2p5/3pPN2/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQR1K1 b - - 2 11,"I considered Nc3 and Bf5, but I realized that the Bishop is already developed in this case. I am going to attack the King, and the Bishop can get there as easily from c1 as from any place else. I did not like Nc3 because it didn't support my idea of a King side attack. I think I missed the idea of Nd2, with Nf3 to follow, but it looked ugly to Block my Bishop and it seemed to take a long time for my attack to develop if I started with Nd2."

I am going to have a very strong attack, based on the calculation Nh6+, Kg7, Nxf7, Kxf7 e6+! Kg8, exd7 which opens the King up for an attack and wins a pawn. I don't think we need to calculate beyond Nh6+, Kh8 we all know the Black Queen would be lost."
