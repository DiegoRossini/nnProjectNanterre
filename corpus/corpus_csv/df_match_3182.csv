5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,I usually play this move instead of the more common 5. e3 or 5. Bg5. This way I can avoid most opening preparations by stronger players and get a playable position.

10,dxc4,d5c4,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/8/2pP1B2/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,Black accepts the gambit pawn.
11,a4,a2a4,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/8/P1pP1B2/2N2N2/1P2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,This is almost an automatic reaction. Otherwise Black consolidates the position with b5.
12,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/8/PbpP1B2/2N2N2/1P2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,Black wants to keep to c4-pawn while developing a piece. The knight is pinned so b5 works again.
13,e3,e2e3,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/8/PbpP1B2/2N1PN2/1P3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"The light-squared bishop needs to get out. Perhaps g3 was another option, because placing the bishop on the long diagonal makes sense after the eventual b5 by Black."
14,Nd5,f6d5,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3n4/PbpP1B2/2N1PN2/1P3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,Black wants to take advantage of the unusually bishop position. Now I must protect c3 once more.
15,Qc2,d1c2,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3n4/PbpP1B2/2N1PN2/1PQ2PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 2 8,"And Black takes the bishop. After this Black has the bishop pair an a better pawn structure, I think."
16,Nxf4,d5f4,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/2p1p3/8/PbpP1n2/2N1PN2/1PQ2PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 9,"And Black takes the bishop. After this Black has the bishop pair an a better pawn structure, I think."
17,exf4,e3f4,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/2p1p3/8/PbpP1P2/2N2N2/1PQ2PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 9,Now the c4 pawn is secure.
18,b5,b7b5,rnbqk2r/p4ppp/2p1p3/1p6/PbpP1P2/2N2N2/1PQ2PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 10,Now the c4 pawn is secure.
19,g3,g2g3,rnbqk2r/p4ppp/2p1p3/1p6/PbpP1P2/2N2NP1/1PQ2P1P/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 10,The light-squared bishop has no future on this diagonal so it will go to g2.
20,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/p4ppp/2p1p3/1p6/PbpP1P2/2N2NP1/1PQ2P1P/R3KB1R w KQ - 1 11,And Black plays his bishop on the same diagonal to oppose mine.
21,Bg2,f1g2,rnbq1rk1/p4ppp/2p1p3/1p6/PbpP1P2/2N2NP1/1PQ2PBP/R3K2R b KQ - 2 11,And Black plays his bishop on the same diagonal to oppose mine.
22,Bb7,c8b7,rn1q1rk1/pb3ppp/2p1p3/1p6/PbpP1P2/2N2NP1/1PQ2PBP/R3K2R w KQ - 3 12,And Black plays his bishop on the same diagonal to oppose mine.
23,O-O,e1g1,rn1q1rk1/pb3ppp/2p1p3/1p6/PbpP1P2/2N2NP1/1PQ2PBP/R4RK1 b - - 4 12,"This is a typical pawn formation for Black in the Slav Defence. After a6 comes to protect b5, the c6 pawn is ready for the central break move c5."
24,a6,a7a6,rn1q1rk1/1b3ppp/p1p1p3/1p6/PbpP1P2/2N2NP1/1PQ2PBP/R4RK1 w - - 0 13,"This is a typical pawn formation for Black in the Slav Defence. After a6 comes to protect b5, the c6 pawn is ready for the central break move c5."
25,Rfd1,f1d1,rn1q1rk1/1b3ppp/p1p1p3/1p6/PbpP1P2/2N2NP1/1PQ2PBP/R2R2K1 b - - 1 13,"Activating the rook. It seemed that the d4 pawn required extra protection, if I am to move my knight from f3."
26,Nd7,b8d7,r2q1rk1/1b1n1ppp/p1p1p3/1p6/PbpP1P2/2N2NP1/1PQ2PBP/R2R2K1 w - - 2 14,A good temporary square for the knight. From here it can go to f6 or in some variations to c5 or e5.
27,Ne5,f3e5,r2q1rk1/1b1n1ppp/p1p1p3/1p2N3/PbpP1P2/2N3P1/1PQ2PBP/R2R2K1 b - - 3 14,"I try to play actively. Otherwise I am lost, because I have one pawn less."
28,Qc7,d8c7,r4rk1/1bqn1ppp/p1p1p3/1p2N3/PbpP1P2/2N3P1/1PQ2PBP/R2R2K1 w - - 4 15,Black simply protects the c6 pawn one more time and connects the rooks.
29,Ne4,c3e4,r4rk1/1bqn1ppp/p1p1p3/1p2N3/PbpPNP2/6P1/1PQ2PBP/R2R2K1 b - - 5 15,Activating the other knight. I can already see a potential outpost at d6.
30,Nxe5,d7e5,r4rk1/1bq2ppp/p1p1p3/1p2n3/PbpPNP2/6P1/1PQ2PBP/R2R2K1 w - - 0 16,And Black exchanges. This goes according to my plans.
31,dxe5,d4e5,r4rk1/1bq2ppp/p1p1p3/1p2P3/Pbp1NP2/6P1/1PQ2PBP/R2R2K1 b - - 0 16,"16. fxe5 was an alternative, but the pawn on d4 seemed too weak to me then. Now the supported outpost at d6 is ready. Only the b4-bishop covers it."
