3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"I used to play the Advance Variation (3. e5), following a book I'd bought but didn't like the positions I got.  Nowadays, I like to invite The Winawer (3. ...Bb4), which can lead to wild variations with Black making a mess of White's queenside and White counter-attacking.  Black can either take up the challenge or play one of a number of other moves (eg 3. ...c5, 3. ...Nc6, 3. ...dxe4, 3. ...Nf6 (Classical))"

6,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/1b1PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,Black accepts the challenge ...
7,e5,e4e5,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3pP3/1b1P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"It's useful, but not essential, to play this, so as to preserve the threatened pawn before trying to push Black's B away."
8,c5,c7c5,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/1b1P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"Black's standard follow-up, opening a diagonal for his Q and applying pressure on White's centre."
9,a3,a2a3,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/1b1P4/P1N5/1PP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,White asks the B the question: swap or retreat?  Swapping is by far the most frequent response.
10,Ba5,b4a5,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/b1ppP3/3P4/P1N5/1PP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,"I have met this retreat before but couldn't remember how to respond, so had to have a think ..."
11,Bd2,c1d2,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/b1ppP3/3P4/P1N5/1PPB1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 2 6,?! This does feature in Nunn's Chess Openings as a rare sideline.  Nunn gives 6. b4 as the best move and 6. dxc5 as an unclear continuation.  Nunn seems to regard this move as acceptable if followed up correctly.
12,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/b2pP3/3p4/P1N5/1PPB1PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,"White having cut off support for the d-pawn, Black snaffles it and attacks White's N."
13,Nce2,c3e2,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/b2pP3/3p4/P7/1PPBNPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 1 7,"? Not considered by Nunn, who gives 7. Nb5 as the best response.  Although White threatens to recapture the pawn on d4 and attacks Black's B, the N blocks in White's kingside pieces."
14,Bc7,a5c7,rnbqk1nr/ppb2ppp/4p3/3pP3/3p4/P7/1PPBNPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 2 8,"Now Black attacks the loose pawn on e5.  If White captures on d4, the B captures on e5 and skewers the N against the pawn on b2.  White will have lost both his central pawns, leaving Black's solid centre unopposed."
15,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk1nr/ppb2ppp/4p3/3pP3/3p4/P4N2/1PPBNPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 3 8,"Now that I can swap pieces on d4 or e5 if necessary, I decide to take the pawn on d4 while I can, releasing my LSB for action."
16,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk1nr/ppb2ppp/2n1p3/3pP3/3p4/P4N2/1PPBNPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 4 9,"Now that I can swap pieces on d4 or e5 if necessary, I decide to take the pawn on d4 while I can, releasing my LSB for action."
17,Nexd4,e2d4,r1bqk1nr/ppb2ppp/2n1p3/3pP3/3N4/P4N2/1PPB1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 9,"Now that I can swap pieces on d4 or e5 if necessary, I decide to take the pawn on d4 while I can, releasing my LSB for action."
18,Nxd4,c6d4,r1bqk1nr/ppb2ppp/4p3/3pP3/3n4/P4N2/1PPB1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 10,"I'd expected Black to capture on e5 but this makes sense as well, removing White's most advanced piece and forcing White to relinquish e5 to boot."
19,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqk1nr/ppb2ppp/4p3/3pP3/3N4/P7/1PPB1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 10,"As predicted, Nd4 and pawn on b2 are skewered and I'm a serious pawn down with no compensation.  I'll have to play well to recover.  In trying to work out a plan, I now fell well behind on the clock."
20,Bxe5,c7e5,r1bqk1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/3pb3/3N4/P7/1PPB1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 11,"As predicted, Nd4 and pawn on b2 are skewered and I'm a serious pawn down with no compensation.  I'll have to play well to recover.  In trying to work out a plan, I now fell well behind on the clock."
21,Bc3,d2c3,r1bqk1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/3pb3/3N4/P1B5/1PP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 11,"I decided that this was the most active method of defending the N, with my DSB disputing the long diagonal.  I also considered 11. c3, giving my Q scope on the d1-a4 diagonal but didn't think there would be much benefit in trying to exploit that while Black could simply play ....Bd7 if I tried to check on the a4-e8 diagonal."
22,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/4pn2/3pb3/3N4/P1B5/1PP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 12,"Now every square on the long dark diagonal is occupied, Black is ready to castle and can then concentrate on exploiting his material advantage."
23,Be2,f1e2,r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/4pn2/3pb3/3N4/P1B5/1PP1BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 3 12,"I, too, prepare to castle.  I also considered 12. Bb5+, but didn't want to invite swaps while still a pawn down, and 12. Bd3, but didn't want to block off the Queen's defence of d4."
24,a6,a7a6,r1bqk2r/1p3ppp/p3pn2/3pb3/3N4/P1B5/1PP1BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 13,"Presumably to prevent 13. Nb5 or to support the pawn advance ...b5.  Now, with my B on e2 and the square b5 unavailable, I can't move my N and simultaneously provide a non-pawn defence of the Bc3.  I don't want the pawns on my queenside to be compromised if I can avoid it."
25,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk2r/1p3ppp/p3pn2/3pb3/3N4/P1B5/1PP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 1 13,"I proceed with my development as quickly as I can, aiming to get my pieces posted on good squares and then to attack wherever I can find a potential weakness."
26,Bd6,e5d6,r1bqk2r/1p3ppp/p2bpn2/3p4/3N4/P1B5/1PP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 2 14,"Unexpected ... I was surprised that Black seemed to be wasting tempi before he had castled.  As we didn't have the chance to analyse afterwards, I don't know the thinking behind this sequence of moves but I imagine he was looking to attack the Nd4 with his e-pawn and make an advanced salient with his central pawns."
