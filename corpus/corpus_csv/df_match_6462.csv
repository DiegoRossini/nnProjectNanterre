White is geared up for a kingside assault, while black is looking to use the room he has created and start busting it up down the queenside. I'm sure the position goes a lot deeper than that..."

Qxe4 reestablishing the b1-h7 diagonal, but it seemed that was going to open itsself up soon anyway and the lsb seemed far more valuable than a knight (even though it is nicely placed)."

Good longe range attacking lines for whites lsb and rook and a well placed knight (despite being on the edge of the board). The dsb is only a quick pawn move away from being in on the action too.
36,Qg7,e5g7,r1b2rk1/pp3pq1/2n1p2Q/3p2n1/2p3PN/2P1P3/PPB4P/R1B2RK1 w - - 1 19,The Black King is now surrounded by bodyguards.
