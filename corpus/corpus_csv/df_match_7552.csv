1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I've always like the English Opening. White will aim to control the light squares in the center of the board.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Black responds symmetrically. The game could easily transpose into a variation of the Sicilian at this point.
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"Black plays for a flank attack, keeping his center Pawns in reserve for the moment. Very Hypermodern-like."
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/2p5/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Black plays for a flank attack, keeping his center Pawns in reserve for the moment. Very Hypermodern-like."
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/2p5/2P5/2N2N2/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"I, too, hold back my center Pawns. Black follows up with the completion of the fianchetto."
6,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk1nr/pp1pppbp/6p1/2p5/2P5/2N2N2/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,"I, too, hold back my center Pawns. Black follows up with the completion of the fianchetto."
7,g3,g2g3,rnbqk1nr/pp1pppbp/6p1/2p5/2P5/2N2NP1/PP1PPP1P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"If Black were to develop his King Knight, the position would be entirely symmetrical. I'm not afraid of playing for a draw and trying to squeeze a win in the endgame."
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/2p5/2P5/2N2NP1/PP1PPP1P/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"If Black were to develop his King Knight, the position would be entirely symmetrical. I'm not afraid of playing for a draw and trying to squeeze a win in the endgame."
9,Bg2,f1g2,r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/2p5/2P5/2N2NP1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 5,"If Black were to develop his King Knight, the position would be entirely symmetrical. I'm not afraid of playing for a draw and trying to squeeze a win in the endgame."
10,e5,e7e5,r1bqk1nr/pp1p1pbp/2n3p1/2p1p3/2P5/2N2NP1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,The first center thrust...
11,e4,e2e4,r1bqk1nr/pp1p1pbp/2n3p1/2p1p3/2P1P3/2N2NP1/PP1P1PBP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,...and I parry. Black still has the option of going for symmetry.
12,Nge7,g8e7,r1bqk2r/pp1pnpbp/2n3p1/2p1p3/2P1P3/2N2NP1/PP1P1PBP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 7,"Now the game really begins, as symmetry is broken."
13,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk2r/pp1pnpbp/2n3p1/2p1p3/2P1P3/2N2NP1/PP1P1PBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 2 7,Black wants to seize a central advantage...

16,Nd4,c6d4,r1bqk2r/pp1pn1bp/6p1/2p1pp2/2PnP3/2NP1NP1/PP3PBP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 1 9,"Black offers to trade Knights. This would plant his Pawn at d4, but I feel I get sufficient compensation by being able to place my Queen Knight at d5 after the exchange."
17,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqk2r/pp1pn1bp/6p1/2p1pp2/2PNP3/2NP2P1/PP3PBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 9,This capture leaves me with a Queen-side advantage in the potential endgame. I would have used the e-pawn instead.
18,cxd4,c5d4,r1bqk2r/pp1pn1bp/6p1/4pp2/2PpP3/2NP2P1/PP3PBP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 10,This capture leaves me with a Queen-side advantage in the potential endgame. I would have used the e-pawn instead.
19,Nd5,c3d5,r1bqk2r/pp1pn1bp/6p1/3Npp2/2PpP3/3P2P1/PP3PBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 10,Black completes his development. The Knight on e7 is vulnerable to the pin...

22,Rf7,f8f7,r1bq2k1/pp1pnrbp/6p1/3NppB1/2PpP3/3P2P1/PP3PBP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 4 12,The best Black can do now is end up down the Exchange.
23,Nxe7+,d5e7,r1bq2k1/pp1pNrbp/6p1/4ppB1/2PpP3/3P2P1/PP3PBP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 12,"The logical follow-up. I was expecting 12...Rxe7 13 Bxe7 Qxe7, which would have left me with an exchange up but still some work to do to secure the win."
24,Kf8,g8f8,r1bq1k2/pp1pNrbp/6p1/4ppB1/2PpP3/3P2P1/PP3PBP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 1 13,Catastrophic. Now the killer discovery seals things quickly.
25,Nxg6+,e7g6,r1bq1k2/pp1p1rbp/6N1/4ppB1/2PpP3/3P2P1/PP3PBP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 13,"Black resigns, as he loses his Queen if he plays on."
