1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi all! This is my first finished game from the WTW Welcome Mini-Tournament Group 3. Obviously I'm not a Master or even Expert, but as I had the White pieces it's my honor to do the annotation, and if any Masters stop by to comment I'd definitely appreciate it. It's not a perfect game by any means but hopefully everyone can find something of use within. Here goes!"
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,The oldest[citation needed] of openings!
3,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"The King's Gambit is one of my favorite openings, on both sides of the board. I think it leads to fun and interesting play."
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Personally I think accepting the Gambit (2...exf4) is better. Then it's up to White to prove he can get something for the pawn!
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4PP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,Both sides begin quick development.
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/4PP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,Both sides begin quick development.
7,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/2B1PP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 4,Both sides begin quick development.
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4p3/2B1PP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 5,Both sides begin quick development.
9,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4p3/2B1PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 5 5,"? This blunders a pawn! Now White can play 6.fxe5 dxe5 7.Nxe5 and come out a clear pawn ahead, with a big central advantage and an attack on f7."
10,Nb4,c6b4,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/1nB1PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 6 6,"? This blunders a pawn! Now White can play 6.fxe5 dxe5 7.Nxe5 and come out a clear pawn ahead, with a big central advantage and an attack on f7."
11,d3,d2d3,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/1nB1PP2/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,White chooses to take the tempo rather than the material. Now Black should give up his central presence to maintain equality with 6...exf4 7.Bxf4 Be7.
12,b6,b7b6,r1bqkb1r/p1p2ppp/1p1p1n2/4p3/1nB1PP2/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"? Black's DSB could easily have been developed to g4, and his e-pawn is still hanging! As I said above, best was 6...exf4."
13,fxe5,f4e5,r1bqkb1r/p1p2ppp/1p1p1n2/4P3/1nB1P3/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,"White comes away a pawn to the good, and he's threatening a very disruptive check on f7."
14,dxe5,d6e5,r1bqkb1r/p1p2ppp/1p3n2/4p3/1nB1P3/2NP1N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"White comes away a pawn to the good, and he's threatening a very disruptive check on f7."
15,Nxe5,f3e5,r1bqkb1r/p1p2ppp/1p3n2/4N3/1nB1P3/2NP4/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,"White comes away a pawn to the good, and he's threatening a very disruptive check on f7."
16,Be6,c8e6,r2qkb1r/p1p2ppp/1p2bn2/4N3/1nB1P3/2NP4/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 9,This is essentially Black's only good move. There's no other way to adequately defend f7.
17,Bxe6,c4e6,r2qkb1r/p1p2ppp/1p2Bn2/4N3/1n2P3/2NP4/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 9,"White exchanges Bishops to give Black a weak, isolated e-pawn, and to further weaken the vulnerable light squares a6 and c6. It's worth mentioning that White is not devoid of weaknesses--his Ne5 is undefended and he has no claim at all to the d4 square."
18,fxe6,f7e6,r2qkb1r/p1p3pp/1p2pn2/4N3/1n2P3/2NP4/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 10,"White exchanges Bishops to give Black a weak, isolated e-pawn, and to further weaken the vulnerable light squares a6 and c6.

21,O-O,e1g1,r2qkb1r/p1p3pp/np2pn2/4N3/4P3/P1NP4/1PP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 2 11,"? Terrible! White hands over a significant material advantage. I think (the computer agrees) that the best choice was 11.d4, or perhaps 11.Be3. Black now has a simple tactic that wins a piece..."
22,Bd6,f8d6,r2qk2r/p1p3pp/np1bpn2/4N3/4P3/P1NP4/1PP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 3 12,"? But this isn't it! Correct was 11...Qd4+! 12.Kh1 Qxe5, coming away with a free Knight."
23,Nc6,e5c6,r2qk2r/p1p3pp/npNbpn2/8/4P3/P1NP4/1PP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 4 12,"? Again White overlooks Black's chances along the c5-g1 diagonal. Now 13...Bc5 pins the Knight to the White King, winning it for nothing!"
24,Qd7,d8d7,r3k2r/p1pq2pp/npNbpn2/8/4P3/P1NP4/1PP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 5 13,"? Again White overlooks Black's chances along the c5-g1 diagonal. Now 13...Bc5 pins the Knight to the White King, winning it for nothing!"
25,Nd4,c6d4,r3k2r/p1pq2pp/np1bpn2/8/3NP3/P1NP4/1PP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 6 13,"? Again White overlooks Black's chances along the c5-g1 diagonal. Now 13...Bc5 pins the Knight to the White King, winning it for nothing!"

He still has a weak e-pawn, but there's no direct threat at the moment and the file isn't open. He's also leading White in development. White, for his part, has far fewer pawn weaknesses (look at all the weak light squares around the Black King for comparison!) and slightly better central presence."

The thought behind this move is simple: White exchanges his Knight for the strong Bishop and draws the BQ to the center of the board, where she'll be easy to harass. Getting rid of the Bishop makes White's dark-square weaknesses easier to defend--important because he has yet to develop his dark Bishop!"
