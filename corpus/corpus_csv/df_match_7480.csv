1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

This game was even Steven until fairly late on in the middlegame where I found I had a tactical shot which won me the exchange.  This incident occurred the day after Black Friday (the day my rating dropped by 40 odd points).  Luckily I managed to find a way to convert the exchange advantage to a victory and kept my mits off that Offer Draw button!  In response to my 1. e4 black plays the French Defense with 1. e6."

I had just got out of bed on Saturday morning hoping Black Friday was just a bad dream.  It was not.  My new rating of 1809 (after it had been 1857 made ghastly reading).  Suddenly I saw how black's a5 knight and d8 rook lined up and also his d6 rook lined up then I thought .... Fou Lenoir ...... skewer ...... fork ...... exchange up!
