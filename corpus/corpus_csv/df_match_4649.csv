1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,".In this game all started with a quality sacrifice that removed a defender, and won several pieces, partly due to bad defences by white, yet black became a bit too ""hungry"" and garbed one too many of white pieces and ended up by losing the initiative to white's favour, white also scarified a quality, to increase the pressure over black's king, that had to play precisely to avoid mate, in the end, black managed to regain initiative and the material imbalance in his favour lead to a win."

a) a great outpost for my c6 knight at d4 if white captures the b pawn or advances the c pawn to c4, either way white can only challenge the knight location with a piece, which could lead to a new strategy of exchanging the dark squares bishop...
b) wining a pawn if white doesn't further defend the c pawn (bxc3 bxc3 Bxc3)
c) some x-ray tactics on the main diagonal or against the uncastled king"
