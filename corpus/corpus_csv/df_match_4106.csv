I was thinking after c3, my bishop will have to go back to c5 and I'm considering exd4. Of course exd4 is not a good move as it will block my attack on the f2 and my DSB will trap on the other half of the board from his king."

31,Bxg8,f7g8,r5Bk/ppp5/3p1p2/2b4p/3pP1b1/3P1N1P/PPP2P2/R4RK1 b - - 0 16,"He took the rook. Computer analysis showed that this is a blunder and suggested white to play hxg4. And computer analysis also suggested that I play Bxf3. But I was thinking, if I played that move, his bishop can retreat and guarded the g8 square. I want to bring my rook to g8. So, I decided to play another move."
