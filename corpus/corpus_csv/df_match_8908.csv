1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everybody!  It was time for Round 5 with Master Freddy and guess what, I lost!  Yup, this furry white kitten has taken another cattermauling.  It is sooo maddening and frustrating.  This time I decided to kick off with a d4 opening and Freddy decided to go Dutch with f5.  I chose what I thought were the best moves from the World DB, i.e. those which would get me a decent piece placement and pawn centre in the middlegame.  Then Freddy took me out of the database with a queen move.  Then Freddy handed my position some hemlock with this queen move.  Later on in the game, after dropping a couple of pawns I tried to break free with a few spite checks and a mate threat but all to no avail - it was only token resistance."
2,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"4. Bg2 - pretty standard play against the Dutch - white usually fianchettoes his/her bishop along the h1 - a8 diagonal.  Some nasty pins can occur as a result of this bishop's occupation.  In fact a few moves later I try a double fianchetto, taking a leaf out of Coach Ion's book - remember in our last game he used a double fianchetto against me which proved decisive in his favour!  So why not use it on Master Freddy, eh?"
