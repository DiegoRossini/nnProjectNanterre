1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

My buddy Bob Jacobs drew my attention to a victory he had obtained against a player of near-IM strength.  In fact he is currently an IM.  In this game, however, Bob's opponent slipped up big time and immediately resigned on the grounds of Ruinous Loss of Material.  So, how did all this happen?  Well, here is the Gameknot Analysis version of the game.  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17771714&fb=1&rnd=0.860014379173279.  Bob starts with his favourite opening, the Queen's Pawn Opening."

It just shows, Masters are human and they make chessic howlers, but they are not Masters for nothing - it is very rare that they do make oversights.  Bob should still take credit for this victory - first he must spot the hanging piece.  He must then decide whether it is a sacrifice or a mistake.  Firstly he must look at his king and check that he is not in Old Matey's shadow or that if he does take the hanging material he will not then cop Old Matey.  He must also ascertain that after the capture, his opponent does not have any other riposte or positional counterplay.  Black had none whatsoever and so, having just a pawn for his queen, resigned on the Grounds of Ruinous Loss of Material even though his opponent is 800 points south of him - it was just too much.  Anyhow, another known Master has slipped up big time and he will be joining Bob on my It Can Be Done Thread.  See you soon - Joanne"
