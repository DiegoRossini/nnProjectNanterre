1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"My name is Jason Capablanca and I am 9. I am going to make an analysis for you on my game against Strikerx. I do not make many analysis for you to read because now I am playing a lot of real hard players, and my games do not look so good any more. And I do not play e4 very much here any more because then I have to know a lot of different openings and I am going to a hard school, so I do not have time to study openings so much until summer time. I always do my best and I do not quit. I am writing this analysis because the French Defense is very hard to beat and I had to study with my coach Mr. Marble, a lot last year to know how to play it when I went to the Olympiad last year. Maybe this will help you."

3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Nd2 breaks a lot of rules. I learned this last year. Black is also breaking a lot of opening rules, so it is okay for White to break rules too. White can play 3. exd4 (exchange variation) 3. Nc3, or 3. e5. Nc3 and e5 are hard for White to hold onto the pawns in the middle and exd4 looks good but it does not get an advantage for White. It helps Black get his c8 Bishop out. Black wants White to play e5 so he can start attacking d4. My move is for the Tarrasch variation. Sometimes this Knight goes all the way to f3 so there are lots of pieces defending d4. That happened in this game."

6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3PP3/8/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"4. e5 I like this variation, because it makes Black waste another move with the Knight, and Black must decide where to put the Knight. It always should go to d7 so it can help Black play c5 to attack the pawn on d4. But the extra moves let me get my pieces out."

8,Nfd7,f6d7,rnbqkb1r/pppn1ppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/8/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,I only have one chance to get this Bishop out. After that Black will attack my pawn on d4 and I will not have time to take him out again.

11,c3,c2c3,rnbqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/2PB4/PP1N1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 6,"This is the best I think. When Black takes the pawn on d4, it will be replaced with another pawn. That is important to control the middle with pawns and to keep the extra space the e5 pawn has given me."

14,c4,c5c4,r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2n1p3/3pP3/2pP4/2PB4/PP1NNPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"7. ..., c4?! This is a mistake. It is not part of the opening. But it is not a mistake because of that. It is a mistake because all of the French Defense depends on Black taking the pawns in the middle. Do you see how all of Black's pieces are on the Queen side? I saw this and I was confused. How can Black get his pieces out in the game if they are trapped behind his pawns on the Queen side?"

So I will try to open up the pawns in front of Blacks King. He is not developed and his King is not safe. So maybe I can get him in the center."

That is why I made Nd2 at the beginning. See how both Knights defend d4? I do not need that now, but my Knight is in the way of the Bishop, and I am going to attack his King side, so It should go over there anyway."

But if he takes my pawn on c3, I will take with my pawn on b2 and I will be able to control the open b file because my Rooks and Queen are all working together now. So I did my best to find a move to help make him not want to take c3. But I think maybe Ng3 would be good."
23,Be3,c1e3,r1bqkb1r/3n1p1p/2n1p1p1/p2pP3/1ppP1P2/2P1BN2/PPB1N1PP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 1 12,"12. Be3 Maybe this is not so good a move.

I was trying my hardest but he has a rating over 1700 and he is a real good player. So I was afraid maybe I made this into a draw, and it would not help the team win the match."

Qc1 and he does not dare take my Bishop because my Queen will take back and I will be able to attack his King side. But this way he get's an open file for his Rook. And it will aim at my King."

When I was playing before, Knelica would let me play easier players and this would work, but now my tricks do not work. This is not so bad though. Now the Queen is really trapped behind her pawns on the Queen side."
