23,e4,e2e4,r2q1rk1/pb1nbppp/1p2pn2/2pp4/3PPBP1/P1N2N1P/1PP2PB1/R2QR1K1 b - - 0 12,"This move does not seem like a good tactical move to me.  Black has 3 pieces that can attack e4 while white has only two to defend it - including a rook which is more valuable than any of the black pieces aimed at e4.  I think Ne5 would have been better here than e4.  If 12. Ne5 followed by Nxe5, then dxe5 advancing white's d-pawn beyond a simple pawn exchange to where it can threaten black's remaining knight.  This also opens up the main diagonal for white's light-square bishop, which is better defended than black's light-square bishop."

It opens up a second attack on the black knight at e4 and moves the white knight up to the e5 square where it can threaten pieces on my side of the board.
28,Nxe5,d7e5,r2q1rk1/pb2bppp/1p2p3/2p1n3/3PnBP1/P6P/1PP2PB1/R2QR1K1 w - - 0 15,I take out the knight on e5 fully expecting Bxe5.

37,f4,f2f4,r2q1rk1/p3b1pp/1p3p2/4p3/3pRPP1/P6P/1PP4B/R2Q2K1 b - - 0 19,"White intends to weaken my pawn structure with this move.  If e5xf4 then Bxf4 and the black pawn on e4 is protected only by the queen.  If e5xf4, it's not wise for the white's rook to capture either the black pawn on either f4 or d4 because the black bishop can move to c5 or d6 to pin white's rook.  White's decision to advance the f-pawn has a major downside that will prove the undoing of white's entire game later - white's king no longer has any pawns near it and black can move the bishop to c5 for a later discovered check.  If white really needed to advance the f-pawn, white could have moved the king to h1 and then move the bishop to g1 to prevent any potential of a discovered check."
38,Bc5,e7c5,r2q1rk1/p5pp/1p3p2/2b1p3/3pRPP1/P6P/1PP4B/R2Q2K1 w - - 1 20,"I chose not to take the bait with e5xf4.  White's f-pawn is out of the way, and my bishop is ready for a discovered check later."
