3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Nf3?! is totally winning for Black, because after cxd4 Nxd4, Black has an extra pawn in the centre, my pawn on e5 is weak, and Black is ahead in development."

8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2ppP3/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"At first glance, Black's position may look better, since he already has a knight developed, and his pawn structure is more solid, but I like my position, because I have a lot of scope on the kingside for my bishops, and in the French, Black often gets a cramped position and can't do anything."

14,Bd7,c8d7,r3kbnr/1p1b1ppp/1qn1p3/p1ppP3/3P4/P1PB1N2/1P3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 8,"This stops a future Bb5  and threatens to win a pawn, however, I decide to finish developing while Black is busy winning a pawn or two."
