1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is the Budapest Defence (or Budapest Gambit, as it is also known). It was discovered in 1916 by Szigmond Barasz, a strong Hungarian master, and gained (chess)world fame a few years later by featuring in two Black wins against Rubinstein, regarded as possibly the strongest tournament player in the world at the time.

In February 1924 Hans Kmoch, a famous theoretician and chess critic, wrote this obituary on the defence:
""A counterattack that surfaced a few years ago, and quickly faded away. The sacrifice of a pawn or piece for an advantageous position proved too much of a handicap for almost any player. Even for someone as gifted as Lasker, who should find such a method ideal, it unmasked itself as illogical, inopportune and unfavorable.""

Black commonly plays either the stolid 4...Nc6, with something approaching equality, or goes for razor-sharp and occasionally rather wild complications with the outlandish 4...g5!?"
8,g5,g7g5,rnbqkb1r/pppp1p1p/8/4P1p1/2P2Bn1/8/PP2PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"Opinions differ as to whether this move is correct and playable or pure harakiri. But Kmoch is right about one thing: with this move, Black has burned his bridges. If he succeeds in this attack, he will probably win; if not, he will almost certainly loose. Draw is an outlandish result now!"
9,Bg3,f4g3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1p1p/8/4P1p1/2P3n1/6B1/PP2PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 5,White has to decide what to do with his bishop now. The game move is the stronger option; on 5.Bd2 Black can play 5...Nxe5 with a good game.
10,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/pppp1pbp/8/4P1p1/2P3n1/6B1/PP2PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 2 6,"This exposes the real point of the gambit: Black gains control of the powerful long diagonal and threatens the imminent recapture of the sacrificed pawn. The whole idea behind 2.e5 is not, as could otherwise be supposed, to quickly develop the bishop. But simply to break up White's pawn center and force him to defend the ensuing wreckage."
11,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk2r/pppp1pbp/8/4P1p1/2P3n1/5NB1/PP2PPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 3 6,Attacking with the h-pawn straight away would be premature: 6.h4 Nxe5 7.e3 g4 is quite ok for Black. On f3 the knight is well posted to take part in the action.

On the face of it, White's position isn't so good here: the e-pawn is doomed, and with it much of his center influence, and the bishop on g7 exerts a monstrous influence on the game. But if you take a closer look at Black's position, there is cause for concern there as well. Primarily there is the question: where do I place the king, longer-term? Will it be safe to castle short? Will I even be able to wait with castling until I can castle long? These are the undecided questions which will likely decide the fate of the game - unless White stumbles in the opening."
13,h4,h2h4,r1bqk2r/pppp1pbp/2n5/4P1p1/2P3nP/5NB1/PP2PPP1/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"And this is the critical line. White attempts to spike Black's K-side initiative, rob him of his space advantage there and get rid of the sheltering g-pawn. While Black is focused on gaining lines and influence in the center. The e-pawn is doomed, but the fate of the g-pawn hangs in balance. While the g-pawn is alive, Black will likely have the advantage. With the g-pawn gone, he will have sacrificed his king-side structure along with the pawn; a much more dubious sacrifice in the longer term. Many players will thus prefer the more quiet, long-term advantages of 4...Nc6 instead."

Black has regained the sacrificed material, has uncontested control of the long diagonal, is ahead in development, and has acute, tactical threats. Against this weighs the irreparable damage to his kingside structure. As long as he can keep the initiative, he will probably be fine. But how will White respond?"

Additionally, it helps prepare Black castling long.
In contrast to this, I rather misliked Black's position after 11...f5 12.e4 d6 13.Bd3 Qf6 as White has the powerful 14.Nb5! A theme also available to White after 11...d6 12.0-0-0 Qf6.
I did however, for some time, consider lines after 11...c6!?. But after 12.0-0-0 Qf6 13.Ne4 Qf5 14.Nd6+ Bxd6 15.Qxd6 Qe6 16.Qxe6 dxe6 Black is behind in development and will be lucky to claim equality."

However, it turns out to be surprisingly hard to take advantage of what ought to be a drastic weakening of White's kingside. The problem: White is ahead in piece development. Thus eg. 13.f3 Bf4 14.e3 Qe5 15.Ne4! and Black has nothing to show for his troubles as 15...Bxe3 16.Qxe3 f5 17.Bd3 fxe4 18.Bxe4 does not even give Black equality."
