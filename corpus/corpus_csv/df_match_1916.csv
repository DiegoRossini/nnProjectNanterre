1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I opened d3.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,Black opens bringing out his kingside Knight.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,I bring out another pawn in hopes to controlling the center. This is considered book.
4,e5,e7e5,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Black plays book and is attacking my pawn
5,dxe5,d4e5,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4P3/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,I take his pawn and am now attacking his knight. This is book. This is my third move and I have not developed a minor piece. Playing too many pawn moves could end up getting me doubled pawns in an exchange. So far I feel I have played book and am up a pawn.
6,Ne4,f6e4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/2P1n3/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,Black has to move his Knight again due my pawn.
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/2P1n3/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 4,I develop my first minor piece.
8,Nxc3,e4c3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/2P5/2n5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,Knight takes Knight.
9,bxc3,b2c3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/2P5/2P5/P3PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"I  retake the knight with my pawn and now have doubled pawns and a pawn on e5 that is unprotected. With this move I still have  all my pawns, neither of us have developed minor pieces."
10,Bc5,f8c5,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/8/2b1P3/2P5/2P5/P3PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,Black has developed his DSB and it has a nice look at my f2 pawn.
11,e3,e2e3,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/8/2b1P3/2P5/2P1P3/P4PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,"I play yet another pawn to e3 thinking this will protect me from the DSB. This is not the best move I could of played something better, developing a minor piece would have been better."
12,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1P3/2P5/2P1P3/P4PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 7,Black develops a Knight. I don't think he was too worried in castling just yet. Plus this way he attacks my unprotected hanging e5 pawn
13,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1P3/2P5/2P1PN2/P4PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 7,"I develop my Knight to protect my center pawn. I was about to f4 to protect the pawn, Could that of been a better move?"
14,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1P3/2P5/2P1PN2/P4PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 3 8,Now Black castles kingside.
15,Bd3,f1d3,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1P3/2P5/2PBPN2/P4PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 4 8,I bring out my LSB as far as it can go. My pawns on the c-file are doubled up and I am wondering if I will ever get  to move them in this game.
16,Qe7,d8e7,r1b2rk1/ppppqppp/2n5/2b1P3/2P5/2PBPN2/P4PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 5 9,Black's Queen peeks out to e7.
17,Be4,d3e4,r1b2rk1/ppppqppp/2n5/2b1P3/2P1B3/2P1PN2/P4PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 6 9,I have moved my LSB again. I wanted to develop my DSB but it had only 1 move. I think castling here would have been a better move.
18,Nxe5,c6e5,r1b2rk1/ppppqppp/8/2b1n3/2P1B3/2P1PN2/P4PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 10,Knight takes pawn.
19,Qd5,d1d5,r1b2rk1/ppppqppp/8/2bQn3/2P1B3/2P1PN2/P4PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 1 10,I decide it's time to introduce my Queen into the game. A better move was to exchange Knight's.
20,d6,d7d6,r1b2rk1/ppp1qppp/3p4/2bQn3/2P1B3/2P1PN2/P4PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 0 11,d6  protects the Knight.
