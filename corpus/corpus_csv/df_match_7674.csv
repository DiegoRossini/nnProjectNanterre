1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I recall that Kasparov's use of the English opening in this match was unexpected for me.  However, strange as it may seem, it was I who managed to produce a surprise at the start.  In any case, in the present game my opponent thought for almost one and a half hours over his 10th move!  It is interesting that the novelty, which had such an effect on Kasparov, was prepared by me as far as the end of the 70s for my match in Baguio.  But at that time it had remained unused."

Previously Black had automatically taken on f3; incidentally, I had played this in the 4th game of the match.  In principle, the point of the thrust e4-e3 lies in upsetting the harmonious development of White's pieces, driving a wedge into his position.  Though this idea is not original, I was convinced it had not been played before in the present situation.  
But how surprised I was one day, when, upon opening the Chess in the USSR magazine, I saw the game Berndt - Seitz, played nearly 10 years earlier in an international correspondence tournament... after 9...e3 White took the pawn 10 dxe, then ventured a desperate attack and quickly lost: 10...b6 11 f4?!
