1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was an interesting game, but it started with this common move."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,and a common response
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"I like the kings knight opening.  It develops a piece as well as results in me guarding 4 critical squares, one of which is occupied by that black pawn."
4,f6,f7f6,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"kings knight might result in a response like this, but it weakens kings side for black.  If black was worried about losing the pawn, Nc6, Qe7, or Bd6 would have done the job and developed a piece."
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"probably could have just taken that pawn and pull the queen out on that weak king side, but ill get there in a bit"
6,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/3p1p2/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,and now blacks queen and bishop are virtually trapped.
7,c3,c2c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/3p1p2/4p3/3PP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,so that might be a nice place to attack from
8,g5,g7g5,rnbqkbnr/ppp4p/3p1p2/4p1p1/3PP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,hmm... seems to weaken that side more
9,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp4p/3p1p2/4p1p1/2BPP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,"im dnoe with this pawn moving game, lets get this thing started.  I was thinking about creating a skewer with Qb3.  possibly getting his knight and rook for a bishop..."
10,Ne7,g8e7,rnbqkb1r/ppp1n2p/3p1p2/4p1p1/2BPP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 6,"but he beat me to it, and moved his first significant piece but it was only to the 2nd row."
11,Bxg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1n2p/3p1p2/4p1B1/2BPP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"now this may not have been the best plan, but here's my thought:  If he doesn't bite at the bishop than I take a free pawn,  If he does take it, read on..."
12,fxg5,f6g5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1n2p/3p4/4p1p1/2BPP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 7,he bit
13,Nxg5,f3g5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1n2p/3p4/4p1N1/2BPP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 0 7,set myself up for some dinner... anyone have a fork?
14,Nd5,e7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp4p/3p4/3np1N1/2BPP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 1 8,oh you want to take my knight?
15,Qh5+,d1h5,rnbqkb1r/ppp4p/3p4/3np1NQ/2BPP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RN2K2R b KQkq - 2 8,I have different thoughts
16,Kd7,e8d7,rnbq1b1r/pppk3p/3p4/3np1NQ/2BPP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RN2K2R w KQ - 3 9,the other option resulted in checkmate
17,Nf7,g5f7,rnbq1b1r/pppk1N1p/3p4/3np2Q/2BPP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RN2K2R b KQ - 4 9,Oh great a fork! let's eat!
18,Qf6,d8f6,rnb2b1r/pppk1N1p/3p1q2/3np2Q/2BPP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RN2K2R w KQ - 5 10,so he can take my knight...
19,Nxh8,f7h8,rnb2b1N/pppk3p/3p1q2/3np2Q/2BPP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RN2K2R b KQ - 0 10,still worth the trade.
20,Qxh8,f6h8,rnb2b1q/pppk3p/3p4/3np2Q/2BPP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RN2K2R w KQ - 0 11,no sweat... hey what's that horse doing outside of its corral?
