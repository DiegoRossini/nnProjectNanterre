1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"It starts with the Italian opening, or guioco piano."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"There are a few things black can do here. 3... Bc5, which was played, 3...Nf6 which follows by 4 Ng5 which is another aggresive opening worth for a study, 3...Be7 and some players play 3...h6 because they really don't like 4Ng5 but still want to play Nf6. Usually after those moves, I play 4d4 and open up the board."

6,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,This is a normal reply.
7,b4,b2b4,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/1PB1P3/5N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,This is the start of the Evan's gambit.
8,Bxb4,c5b4,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/1bB1P3/5N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,Black accepts the gambit. It is the most common reply. White will make up for the lost pawn for rapid expansion and a strong attack which we'll see later.
9,c3,c2c3,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/1bB1P3/2P2N2/P2P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"c3 with tempo. There are usually 3 moves that people play here. Ba5, which is the most common, Bc5 and Be7. All have its pro's and con's."
10,Ba5,b4a5,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/b3p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/P2P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 6,Ba5 is the most common in this position.
11,d4,d2d4,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/b3p3/2BPP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"This opens up the board. But if you never played the Evan's gambit and look at the board, you will see that the c-pawn is pinned and that the d-pawn is attacked two times. So black usually grabs it."
12,exd4,e5d4,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/b7/2BpP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,White is now down 2 pawns. But he will not retake this pawn.
13,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/b7/2BpP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 7,Black must feel really comfortable here. 70-0 almost looks like a desperation move. Black feels very well about this position. Black sees that he can take another free pawn.
14,dxc3,d4c3,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/b7/2B1P3/2p2N2/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,White takes the third free pawn and white is down 3 points and the queenside is wide open. But this move dxc3 is actually not that good. Nge7 is a lot better. I would advise to play that if you ever play this opening as black.
15,Qb3,d1b3,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/b7/2B1P3/1Qp2N2/P4PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 1 8,8Qb3 this looks like another desperate move to retake the pawn. However if you take a longer look there is a valid threat. Qe7 or Qf6 is called for. But black will just try to develop more.
16,d6,d7d6,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/b7/2B1P3/1Qp2N2/P4PPP/RNB2RK1 w kq - 0 9,8...d6 This move is a very bad move. It looks like a normal developing move and it would be a good move in different circumstances.
17,Bxf7+,c4f7,r1bqk1nr/ppp2Bpp/2np4/b7/4P3/1Qp2N2/P4PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 0 9,9Bxf7 check
18,Kf8,e8f8,r1bq1knr/ppp2Bpp/2np4/b7/4P3/1Qp2N2/P4PPP/RNB2RK1 w - - 1 10,"Ke7 was probably better, though it has the threat Bg5+ pinning the queen. But the knight can move in front of it."
19,Bxg8,f7g8,r1bq1kBr/ppp3pp/2np4/b7/4P3/1Qp2N2/P4PPP/RNB2RK1 b - - 0 10,"If black want to take back the bishop, he has to do it with the rook."
20,Rxg8,h8g8,r1bq1kr1/ppp3pp/2np4/b7/4P3/1Qp2N2/P4PPP/RNB2RK1 w - - 0 11,Rxg8
21,Ng5,f3g5,r1bq1kr1/ppp3pp/2np4/b5N1/4P3/1Qp5/P4PPP/RNB2RK1 b - - 1 11,Ng5 a devastating move. Now if black doesn't do anything he will get Qf7 checkmate.
22,Ne5,c6e5,r1bq1kr1/ppp3pp/3p4/b3n1N1/4P3/1Qp5/P4PPP/RNB2RK1 w - - 2 12,One of the ways to stop the mate.
23,Nxh7+,g5h7,r1bq1kr1/ppp3pN/3p4/b3n3/4P3/1Qp5/P4PPP/RNB2RK1 b - - 0 12,"Nxh7+ and black resigned! the black rook is lost, because the king cannot move to f7 to protect it. If he plays Ke7 there is another surprise Bg5+ losing the queen. If you ever come across this opening as black then I would advise to play differently but try to find the better moves for black."
