1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Ah the English. An opening that I am not all that accustomed to, so I was already feeling uncomfortable from the start."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,e5 and Nf6 are equally good alternatives. I chose the symmetrical English because I felt it would lead to a simpler position out of the opening.
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,!? The main line of the Symmetrical English is g6. My objective was to strike out at the center with d5 at some point.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,!? The main line of the Symmetrical English is g6. My objective was to strike out at the center with d5 at some point.
5,g3,g2g3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/2P5/2N3P1/PP1PPP1P/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,!? The main line of the Symmetrical English is g6. My objective was to strike out at the center with d5 at some point.
6,e6,e7e6,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/2P5/2N3P1/PP1PPP1P/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,!? The main line of the Symmetrical English is g6. My objective was to strike out at the center with d5 at some point.
7,Bg2,f1g2,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/2P5/2N3P1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 4,White does not want to allow black to play d4 which will force white's knight to retreat back to b1.
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/2p5/2P5/2N3P1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 2 5,White does not want to allow black to play d4 which will force white's knight to retreat back to b1.
9,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/2p5/2P5/2N2NP1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 5,White does not want to allow black to play d4 which will force white's knight to retreat back to b1.
10,d5,d7d5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2pp4/2P5/2N2NP1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,White does not want to allow black to play d4 which will force white's knight to retreat back to b1.
11,cxd5,c4d5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2pP4/8/2N2NP1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,White does not want to allow black to play d4 which will force white's knight to retreat back to b1.
12,exd5,e6d5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/2pp4/8/2N2NP1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,?! Surely Nxd5 was best. The d5 pawn will soon become a big target.
13,d4,d2d4,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/2pp4/3P4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,"This is why exd5 was not so good. This move threatens dxc5, which will create an isolated d5 pawn and open the d file for the queen."
14,Be6,c8e6,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1bn2/2pp4/3P4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 8,"This move seems ok to me as it develops a piece and supports d5. Be7 was likely best, however because it sets up castling the next move."
15,O-O,e1g1,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1bn2/2pp4/3P4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 2 8,Opening the d file for the queen.
16,Be7,f8e7,r2qk2r/pp2bppp/2n1bn2/2pp4/3P4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 3 9,Opening the d file for the queen.
17,dxc5,d4c5,r2qk2r/pp2bppp/2n1bn2/2Pp4/8/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 9,Opening the d file for the queen.
18,Bxc5,e7c5,r2qk2r/pp3ppp/2n1bn2/2bp4/8/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 10,This is a powerful pin because it is attempting to remove a defender from d5. White is now threatening after 10...O-O 11 Bxf6 Qxf6 12 Nxd5 Qxb2 13 Nc7 Rc8 14 Nxe6 fxe6. I rejected allowing white to play this line in the game even though this was probably best because the e6 pawn would be tough to defend.
19,Bg5,c1g5,r2qk2r/pp3ppp/2n1bn2/2bp2B1/8/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 1 10,This is a powerful pin because it is attempting to remove a defender from d5. White is now threatening after 10...O-O 11 Bxf6 Qxf6 12 Nxd5 Qxb2 13 Nc7 Rc8 14 Nxe6 fxe6. I rejected allowing white to play this line in the game even though this was probably best because the e6 pawn would be tough to defend.
20,Be7,c5e7,r2qk2r/pp2bppp/2n1bn2/3p2B1/8/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 2 11,?! Waste of time. I was too concerned about the pin. O-O was called for in this position.
21,Nd4,f3d4,r2qk2r/pp2bppp/2n1bn2/3p2B1/3N4/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 3 11,"Good move. White is aiming to play Nxe6, which will set up some king side attacks for white."
22,O-O,e8g8,r2q1rk1/pp2bppp/2n1bn2/3p2B1/3N4/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 4 12,"I can not play 11...Nxd4? 12 Qxd4 O-O 13 Rfd1, and white will capture the d5 pawn."
23,Nxe6,d4e6,r2q1rk1/pp2bppp/2n1Nn2/3p2B1/8/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 12,"! My first instinct was that this was an inaccuracy. I calculated 13...Nxe4 14 Bxe7 Qxe7 15. Nxe4 dxe4 16. Bxe4 Rad8 gave me a small edge. However, white had a better idea...."
24,fxe6,f7e6,r2q1rk1/pp2b1pp/2n1pn2/3p2B1/8/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 13,"! My first instinct was that this was an inaccuracy. I calculated 13...Nxe4 14 Bxe7 Qxe7 15. Nxe4 dxe4 16. Bxe4 Rad8 gave me a small edge. However, white had a better idea...."
25,e4,e2e4,r2q1rk1/pp2b1pp/2n1pn2/3p2B1/4P3/2N3P1/PP3PBP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 13,"! My first instinct was that this was an inaccuracy. I calculated 13...Nxe4 14 Bxe7 Qxe7 15. Nxe4 dxe4 16. Bxe4 Rad8 gave me a small edge. However, white had a better idea...."
26,Nxe4,f6e4,r2q1rk1/pp2b1pp/2n1p3/3p2B1/4n3/2N3P1/PP3PBP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 14,"! I had certainly not expected this. I began to think, and saw that after Bxg5 that the knight could hop over to c5 and fork my pawns. I quickly wrote that off though because if 15 Nc5 Qe7 protected everything... or so I thought."
27,Nxe4,c3e4,r2q1rk1/pp2b1pp/2n1p3/3p2B1/4N3/6P1/PP3PBP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 14,"! I had certainly not expected this. I began to think, and saw that after Bxg5 that the knight could hop over to c5 and fork my pawns. I quickly wrote that off though because if 15 Nc5 Qe7 protected everything... or so I thought."
28,Bxg5,e7g5,r2q1rk1/pp4pp/2n1p3/3p2b1/4N3/6P1/PP3PBP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 15,So I was confident that I was now up a pawn and that I had fair chances against Ipatov.
29,Nc5,e4c5,r2q1rk1/pp4pp/2n1p3/2Np2b1/8/6P1/PP3PBP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 15,Expected. White now has a good advantage because it will be difficult for black to properly defend the e6 pawn.
30,Qe7,d8e7,r4rk1/pp2q1pp/2n1p3/2Np2b1/8/6P1/PP3PBP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 2 16,? I had moved almost immediately because I thought that this was the best way to protect both b7 and e6. I missed a nice tactical shot though that loses 2 pawns. Best would have been Rf6. White could not immediately play Nxb7? after this because Qe7 traps the knight.
31,Nxe6,c5e6,r4rk1/pp2q1pp/2n1N3/3p2b1/8/6P1/PP3PBP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 16,! Taking advantage of a pin. If Qxe6?? then Bxd5 pins the queen to the king. There is no way for me to defend both the d5 pawn and the rook on f8.
32,Rf5,f8f5,r5k1/pp2q1pp/2n1N3/3p1rb1/8/6P1/PP3PBP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 1 17,It was either this or Re8. I preferred this because I wanted to drive out the bishop quickly from d5.
33,Bxd5,g2d5,r5k1/pp2q1pp/2n1N3/3B1rb1/8/6P1/PP3P1P/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 17,? Not sure what I was thinking here. Kh8 was necessary to avoid any dangerous discovered checks like Nc7+ which wins the exchange for white. I was probably too anxious to get rid of the bishop.
34,Qd6,e7d6,r5k1/pp4pp/2nqN3/3B1rb1/8/6P1/PP3P1P/R2Q1RK1 w - - 1 18,? Not sure what I was thinking here. Kh8 was necessary to avoid any dangerous discovered checks like Nc7+ which wins the exchange for white. I was probably too anxious to get rid of the bishop.
