1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was a team game I played recently. I lost my game as black due to misplaying the opening, combined with blundering a bishop, but I managed to recover with this attack. (I have realised that the vast majority of my annotated games are wins - I apologise for this, but bcause of my reckless style my wins tend to be rather more interesting than my losses)."

7,Nc3,b1c3,r1b1kbnr/ppppqppp/2n5/4P3/8/2N2N2/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 4 4,"This seems inferior to simply taking - while black has a slight development advantage, there does not seem to be much possibility of an immediate attack, and in the long term the pawn should be more useful. Besides, the development advantage will not last long as a tempo must be spent letting the f8 Bishop out."
