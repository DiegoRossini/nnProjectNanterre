4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/1P6/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"Considered to be a testing move of White's idea - shutting the b2 bishop out of the game to strike back with a properly timed pawn break (f5, d5, or b5) from a Botvinnik type of position. The other common line runs along, for example, (3...d6 4.Bb5 Bd7 5.f4 a6 6.Bxc6 Bxc6)."

25,exd5,e4d5,r2q1rk1/pp4bp/2n1p1p1/2pPp1Pn/7P/1PN2P2/PBPP4/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 13,Another positional mistake - it supports Black's broad pawn center. Better was to finish piece development (the light squared bishop) and to get the king to safety.

35,dxe4,d3e4,4rrk1/pp4bp/2nq2p1/2p3Pn/4P2P/1PN4R/PBP5/R2QKB2 b Q - 0 18,If instead 18.d4 then 18...Rxf1+ 19.Kxf1 Rf8+ with multiple threats. The pawn on e4 is pretty much the only brick left for White's King and guarded by Nc3 which can now be removed.
36,Bxc3+,g7c3,4rrk1/pp5p/2nq2p1/2p3Pn/4P2P/1Pb4R/PBP5/R2QKB2 w Q - 0 19,And White is lost.
