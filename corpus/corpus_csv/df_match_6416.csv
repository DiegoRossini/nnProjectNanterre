1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is Sicilian defence which is a popular response to White's 1. e4 and one of the openings which has made the King pawn opening percentage wins slightly lower than that of 1. d4. Louis Paulsen, a German, was one of the early practitioners of the Sicilian defence and was a defensive player who said that brilliant attacks would fail against correct defence. Paulsen could draw one game against Paul Morphy and his ideas influenced Wilhelm Steinitz who developed the art of defence in chess.
Black's idea here is to exchange his Bishop's pawn for White's central pawn on d5 and build a central pawn majority which will be pushed in the endgame for queening one of the central pawns. An endgame is favourable for Black. So White's strategy is to play for a win in the middle game by attacking Black's king whether it is castled or not. The tactical battle in the middle game is a minefield and either player can win or lose suddenly as happened in this game."
