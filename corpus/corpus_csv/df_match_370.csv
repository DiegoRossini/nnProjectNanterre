2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Sicilian defence, closed variant, instead of the more common Nf3."

4,a6,a7a6,rnbqkbnr/1p1ppppp/p7/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"A delay in development that is not required so early in the game. Nc6 is the regular line. From now on, we both move fast, but not according to the known (to me) lines. It will be a good and sad example on ""how not to take advantage of a delayed development."
5,d3,d2d3,rnbqkbnr/1p1ppppp/p7/2p5/4P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"Trying to follow the classic lines. But maybe, after 2...a6, this is also very slow and a stronger continuation, like Nf3 and then d4, is required. No a good tactician, so I cannot assure what it is the best here."
6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p3p3/2p5/4P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Aiming for a breakthrough on d5.

Black has still the possibility to do the long or the short castling, leaving white to decide to either attack on King's or Queen's flank. I was not sure what to do here, so I opted for a, I think, slow move, but safe."

But, as I said, I felt it is slow, and also allows black for a nice attack on my castling if pawn on h file advances fast enough."
