1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Here is the second instance where I thought I had a decent mating attack going against my opponent.  I intended to go right for the jugular here which is fairly rare for jstevens1!  However, in doing so, I overlooked a tactical shot.  I thought I could get out of it but then a knight move from my opponent gave me grim confirmation that I would remain a piece light.  Again, after that I waved the white flag.  So how did this happen?  Well read on.  Gameknot analysis link to follow:- http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17067335&fb=1&rnd=0.3711907782109783"
