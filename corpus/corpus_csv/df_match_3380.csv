1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I had noticed that my opponent was fond of playing Colle/CZ types of setups. They can be quite powerful if White is able to carry out his plan of development, so it was in Black's best interest to disturb the game immediately."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,The ever flexible and dependable.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 2,Intended either as part of a development scheme that does not include c4 or a simple postponement thereof (to avoid certain variations).
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"A simple development move - giving my opponent the chance to play a traditionally proper opening with c4, but with an insidious plan against e3."
5,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"A move to develop the typical scheme of 4.Bd3, and then either c3 or Nbd2 with a queenside fianchetto eyeing a possible e4 advance."
6,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,An immediate attempt the disturb the development scheme. If 4.dxc5 then 4... Bxd5 and Black has a great position.
7,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/3P4/3BPN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"White continues with his development plan, where Black typically has a choice between d5 or b6."
8,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/8/3p4/3BPN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"Undermining the center and intended development scheme - White will no longer be in familiar waters while Black will have an easy scheme of development. The plan will revolve around Be7, O-O, a queenside fianchetto, knight on either c6/d7 and fighting up the semi-open c-file."
9,exd4,e3d4,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/8/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"The only square that makes sense for the bishop, which helps to support the central pawn mass and knight."
10,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/pp1pbppp/4pn2/8/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 6,"The only square that makes sense for the bishop, which helps to support the central pawn mass and knight."
11,O-O,e1g1,rnbqk2r/pp1pbppp/4pn2/8/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 2 6,c4 would have been stronger to fight for the center.
12,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp1pbppp/4pn2/8/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 3 7,c4 would have been stronger to fight for the center.
13,Qe2,d1e2,rnbq1rk1/pp1pbppp/4pn2/8/3P4/3B1N2/PPP1QPPP/RNB2RK1 b - - 4 7,c4 would have been stronger to fight for the center.
14,b6,b7b6,rnbq1rk1/p2pbppp/1p2pn2/8/3P4/3B1N2/PPP1QPPP/RNB2RK1 w - - 0 8,"Nc6 was probably also fine, but it's clear where the bishop belongs, but not so the knight."
15,Nbd2,b1d2,rnbq1rk1/p2pbppp/1p2pn2/8/3P4/3B1N2/PPPNQPPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 1 8,"White looks to increase the tension between the pieces. By initiating the exchange, Black is able to gain a tempi on the queen."

23,Bf4,c1f4,r2q1rk1/p2pbppp/1pn1p3/8/3PQB2/5N2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - - 2 12,A strong square for the bishop to gain a stranglehold on e5 (and c7...)
24,d5,d7d5,r2q1rk1/p3bppp/1pn1p3/3p4/3PQB2/5N2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 13,"The c-file is half open, and a good file to fight through onto the queenside."

28,Bd6,e7d6,2rq1rk1/p4ppp/1pnbp3/3p4/3P1B2/2P2N2/PP2QPPP/R4RK1 w - - 1 15,"To double rooks on the c-file, the bishops need to be exchanged to gain c7. This has the added benefit of developing the queen."
