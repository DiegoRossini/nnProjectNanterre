1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,my usual opening
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,his usual opening (idk just saying)
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,he's probably going for d5 to put pressure on my e4 pawn so i press the initiative
4,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2p1p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,doubling up for e5 (maybe)
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2p1p3/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,so i triple it (i mean negate once) while developing the knight
6,Ne7,g8e7,rnbqkb1r/pp1pnppp/2p1p3/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,he also develops the knight though f6 might've been better since that keeps the diagonals for the queen and the black bishop open and also puts pressure on white's e pawn (but maybe he has a plan...gotta keep my eyes open and wits about ;)
7,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkb1r/pp1pnppp/2p1p3/8/2BPP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 3 4,i really want the d5 square (after all it's the best square in the whole board...lol)
8,d6,d7d6,rnbqkb1r/pp2nppp/2ppp3/8/2BPP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,not really sure what he was planning to do (that's always bad of course)...wasn't the d5 push i was expecting
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pp2nppp/2ppp3/8/2BPP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,so i figure maybe he's trying an e5 push and keep my pressure there
10,Ng6,e7g6,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2ppp1n1/8/2BPP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 6,"pretty good move in my opinion...though it's a bit late and he lost tempo

opens up the choked diagonals and attacks e5 (and f4...though i'm sure neither of us wanted that piece of barren land just yet)"
11,d5,d4d5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2ppp1n1/3P4/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,he didn't take the initiative so i did (sometimes i get a bit impulsive i guess)
12,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/2ppp1n1/3P4/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 7,doesn't take my bait :( ... of course i didn't really have any big plan at this point except trying to figure out his plan and foiling it
13,dxe6,d5e6,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/2ppP1n1/8/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,pawn exchange (yay) ... and then i realized my queen got a little stronger on the attack with the open file
14,Bxe6,c8e6,rn1qk2r/pp2bppp/2ppb1n1/8/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,develops the bishop and gets some attacking satisfaction in the process...also attacks the c4 bishop which is hanging out by itself
15,Qd3,d1d3,rn1qk2r/pp2bppp/2ppb1n1/8/2B1P3/2NQ1N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 1 8,i guess i thought moving the bishop was harder than moving the queen...or maybe i just thought the white bishop's indirect attack on f7 pawn might come in handy (of course if my opponent doesn't do the exchange)
16,Bxc4,e6c4,rn1qk2r/pp2bppp/2pp2n1/8/2b1P3/2NQ1N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 0 9,"oops...here's the exchange

perhaps black should have focused on developing his queenside knight b4 starting the attack especially since white's queen was stuck on defense duty (btw queen and rook don't like defense at all...they usually try to bully bishops and knights to do it for them)

personally i've found it useful to let queen and rooks defend lesser pieces and take advantage of opponent's greed for the less powerful pieces (effectively disabling the more powerful ones in many cases)"
17,Qxc4,d3c4,rn1qk2r/pp2bppp/2pp2n1/8/2Q1P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 0 9,getting back my material...pressure on f7 pawn (yeah right...with the queen alone...lol)
18,O-O,e8g8,rn1q1rk1/pp2bppp/2pp2n1/8/2Q1P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 1 10,"aha...usually when people castle i start planning...more often than not my plans get foiled by untimely castling (timely for my opponents i guess)

so yeah...he's castled, undeveloped knight and rook...since i'm not castled perhaps i can start the attack on his castle and keep my king safe on the other side of the board...so i go"
19,h4,h2h4,rn1q1rk1/pp2bppp/2pp2n1/8/2Q1P2P/2N2N2/PPP2PP1/R1B1K2R b KQ - 0 10,"hoping for him to open up the h file for my rook...if not, then the ICBM is on it's way to his castle"
20,Nxh4,g6h4,rn1q1rk1/pp2bppp/2pp4/8/2Q1P2n/2N2N2/PPP2PP1/R1B1K2R w KQ - 0 11,yay it's open...of course gotta make sure i don't get nuked back
