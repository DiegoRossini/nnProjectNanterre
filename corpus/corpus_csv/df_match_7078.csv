9,Ng5,e4g5,r1bqkbnr/pp1npppp/2p5/6N1/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 5,"The most aggressive line made famous by Zatiev and Karpov. In my opinion, white should play Bc4 before playing Ng5. 

The point of Ng5 is that it punishes black for playing the haste ...h6"
10,Ngf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1npppp/2p2n2/6N1/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 3 6,I have no problem with leaving the knight on g5.
11,Bd3,f1d3,r1bqkb1r/pp1npppp/2p2n2/6N1/3P4/3B4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 4 6,The bishop can be developed here or to c4 with good chances for white
12,e6,e7e6,r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/6N1/3P4/3B4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 7,free the dark bishop and increases control of d5
13,Ng1f3,g1f3,r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/6N1/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,!? a premature move that leads to difficult play for black. Normal is 7. ...Bd6 followed by 8. ...h6
14,h6,h7h6,r1bqkb1r/pp1n1pp1/2p1pn1p/6N1/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,!? a premature move that leads to difficult play for black. Normal is 7. ...Bd6 followed by 8. ...h6
15,Nxe6,g5e6,r1bqkb1r/pp1n1pp1/2p1Nn1p/8/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,a great scarifice that really mucks up blacks pawn structure and creates serious weaknesses along the light squares in front of the king
16,fxe6,f7e6,r1bqkb1r/pp1n2p1/2p1pn1p/8/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,"8. .Qe7 is bad because of 

9. 0-0 fxe6 10. Bg6+ Kd8 11. Bf4! and White is dominating"
17,Bg6+,d3g6,r1bqkb1r/pp1n2p1/2p1pnBp/8/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 9,this move is why ...h6 without proper preparation is a bad move
18,Ke7,e8e7,r1bq1b1r/pp1nk1p1/2p1pnBp/8/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 2 10,Ugh I am packed in here like a can of sardines.
19,O-O,e1g1,r1bq1b1r/pp1nk1p1/2p1pnBp/8/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 3 10,"White has a dangerous attack for the knight sacrifice. Although it remains to be seen if it is enough to win. I think Black is ok what do you think?

10. Bf4! gives black the most problems to solve as far as I can see black's best defence is 

10. ...Nd5 11. Bg3 Qa5+ 12. c3 Kd8 13. 0-0 Ne7"
20,Qc7,d8c7,r1b2b1r/ppqnk1p1/2p1pnBp/8/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 4 11,developing the queen to her natural square and creating breathing room for the king to escape. This also prevents white from playing Bf4
21,Re1,f1e1,r1b2b1r/ppqnk1p1/2p1pnBp/8/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - - 5 11,"At first glance it looks like Black has hung the e6 pawn. However, the pawn is poisoned. If white plays

12. Rxe6 then 12. ...Bd6! 13. Re1 Nf8! and black has driven off the attack"
22,Kd8,e7d8,r1bk1b1r/ppqn2p1/2p1pnBp/8/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 6 12,"At first glance it looks like Black has hung the e6 pawn. However, the pawn is poisoned. If white plays

12. Rxe6 then 12. ...Bd6! 13. Re1 Nf8! and black has driven off the attack"
23,c4,c2c4,r1bk1b1r/ppqn2p1/2p1pnBp/8/2PP4/5N2/PP3PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - - 0 12,"12. Qe2 is also a good move for white if white does play it then

12. ...Bd6! and black is ok"
24,Bb4,f8b4,r1bk3r/ppqn2p1/2p1pnBp/8/1bPP4/5N2/PP3PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 1 13,"This is better than 12. ...Bd6 because it denys White Queen use of the e2 square. If white tries:

13. Re3 then 13. ...Nf8 14. Bd3 b2 and black on the verge of attacking"
25,Re2,e1e2,r1bk3r/ppqn2p1/2p1pnBp/8/1bPP4/5N2/PP2RPPP/R1BQ2K1 b - - 2 13,This move is more active than Nf8 which is also playable.
26,Rf8,h8f8,r1bk1r2/ppqn2p1/2p1pnBp/8/1bPP4/5N2/PP2RPPP/R1BQ2K1 w - - 3 14,This move is more active than Nf8 which is also playable.

28,Ba5,b4a5,r1bk1r2/ppqn2p1/2p1pnBp/b1P5/3P4/5N2/PP2RPPP/R1BQ2K1 w - - 1 15,preparing to save the bishop via c7
29,a3,a2a3,r1bk1r2/ppqn2p1/2p1pnBp/b1P5/3P4/P4N2/1P2RPPP/R1BQ2K1 b - - 0 15,anticipating B4
30,Qb8,c7b8,rqbk1r2/pp1n2p1/2p1pnBp/b1P5/3P4/P4N2/1P2RPPP/R1BQ2K1 w - - 1 16,anticipating B4
31,Rxe6,e2e6,rqbk1r2/pp1n2p1/2p1RnBp/b1P5/3P4/P4N2/1P3PPP/R1BQ2K1 b - - 0 16,"if white is going to take the pawn then this is the time to do it. However, Black is slowly increasing the influence of his peices. Notice that Black has almost completed his development while White has half his army still on their orginal squares. 

If I were white I would play 16. b4 instead to grab a lion share of the space on the queen side"
