7,Nf3,e5f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,Its better in this opening as black to kick the Knight before taking the pawn

11,Nfd2,f3d2,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3Pn3/8/PPPN1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,This is one of the times you shouldn't move a piece twice in the opening. I think Bc4 or Nbd2 were better.
12,Nxd2,e4d2,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPPn1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"This time it's not so much moving the same piece twice that is bad, because the first was a capture, but this closes the e file, and puts his Bishop in a bad place. If he really wants the file closed, I prefer moving the Bishop or Queen to e2."
