7,Ba4,b5a4,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,The Berlin defence Black develops a knight and put immediate impedance on white to defend e4.
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,The Berlin defence Black develops a knight and put immediate impedance on white to defend e4.
9,Qe2,d1e2,r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPPQPPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 3 5,Of course the usaully Nc3 is good but this queen move has the advantage that it can assist in the fight for light square dominance on the queen side. It can also act as a superise weapon that can be jsut enough to take your opponent out of book. In this idea black must be careful to not develop as normal with Be7 and d6. Or he will get crushed on f7.
10,b5,b7b5,r1bqkb1r/2pp1ppp/p1n2n2/1p2p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPPQPPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 6,There is a lot of debate in Roy Lopez circles as to the usefulness of black's b5. Some contest that ...b5 only serves to drive the LSB to where it really wants to go and exposes black to light square attacks from the queen side. Then there those who contest that ...b5 is a must if black does not want to be crushed in the centre. Also if propertly used b5 can be a powerful wedge into white's position. It also give black the powerful c5 square for either his knight or bishop.
11,Bb3,a4b3,r1bqkb1r/2pp1ppp/p1n2n2/1p2p3/4P3/1B3N2/PPPPQPPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 1 6,There is a lot of debate in Roy Lopez circles as to the usefulness of black's b5.

12,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/2ppbppp/p1n2n2/1p2p3/4P3/1B3N2/PPPPQPPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 2 7,This is a modest developing move that is often played in the Berlin defensive system. the idea is that after the captures on e4 and e5 black can drive the e5 knight away by improving the position of his to f6. Of course Be7 is not the only option for the DSB development. If he chooses he can transpose into the tricky Archangel defence system setup of Bc5 and Bb7. In that system black's bishops are very active.
13,a4,a2a4,r1bqk2r/2ppbppp/p1n2n2/1p2p3/P3P3/1B3N2/1PPPQPPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 7,This is the more spirited move that has the idea of forcing black to play ...b4 at which point the b4 pawn is very vulnerable. In level positions the main task is to create a weakness. Black just can not play 7. ..Bxa4?  8. Rxa4 will give white tremdious power on the A- file. Also good but slower is the powerful deferred centre idea that follows from 7. c3. The idea in the closed centre idea is to push in the centre with d4 and transferr the B knight to g3 or e3 via d2 and f1.

17,Qc4,e2c4,r1bqk2r/2p1bppp/p1np1n2/4p3/PpQPP3/1B3N2/1PP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 1 9,!! wins. Black does not take care to protect his light squares so now he pays the price. If Black had played within well known theory this attack on f7 is childs play to defend.
