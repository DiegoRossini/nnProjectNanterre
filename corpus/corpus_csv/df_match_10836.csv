1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Here is a really exciting game from the second round of the GameKnot #32 Advanced section. I have been playing in these site-wide tourneys for three years, and always in the Intermediate section. After the first round was completed, I was bumped up to the Advanced section because my rating had increased past the 1500 mark. I knew that I was going to be in a world of hurt, and was just hoping not to get shut out. My dilemma was best characterized by a simple question - Play it safe? Or go for the gold? I opted to get aggressive and slug it out, and was rewarded by a very satisfying attack early on. My opponent and new friend bly_garcia defended extremely well and was able to launch a deadly counter-attack that threatened mate in short order. The endgame was very exciting, with some really cool tactical possibilities for both sides. Down in material, my opponent proved why he is the stronger player, and salvaged a very nice draw. I hope you enjoy the game!"
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"As white has opted for the most popular first move of 1. e4, I of course respond with my favorite - the Scandinavian. I know, I know....I just can't get away from the Scandi - it's an addiction!"
3,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3pP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Advance variation, where white declines the ""gambit"" pawn and plays to establish a big center."
4,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2ppP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Claiming space on the queenside and clamping down on d4.
5,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2ppP3/5P2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"?! White announces his intentions of a kingside push very early. This is a risky endeavor if not played correctly, as black's light squared bishop has now become more powerful and the real estate surrounding the white king has been weakened."
6,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2ppPb2/5P2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,With the intentions keeping the light squared bishop outside of the pawn chain after black plays e6.
7,Qe2,d1e2,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2ppPb2/5P2/8/PPPPQ1PP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 2 4,"?! This move confused me a little. I was expecting 4. g4 with tempo as white has already signaled his intention of kingside play. This play does threaten the weak b5 square with check, but it also restricts whites light squared bishop."
8,a6,a7a6,rn1qkbnr/1p2pppp/p7/2ppPb2/5P2/8/PPPPQ1PP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"Probably not worthy of an exclamation, but very solid none the less. Black's lowly a pawn now successfully defends the b5 square against whites queen and bishop battery."
9,d3,d2d3,rn1qkbnr/1p2pppp/p7/2ppPb2/5P2/3P4/PPP1Q1PP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"? I considered this move a mistake. While it does open up a line for whites dark squared bishop, it further restricts the queen/bishop line that white just established. Perhaps Nf3 or Nc3 was better."
10,e6,e7e6,rn1qkbnr/1p3ppp/p3p3/2ppPb2/5P2/3P4/PPP1Q1PP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 0 6,As planned. Black can now develop the dark squared bishop while reinforcing the pawn chain on the white squares.
11,h4,h2h4,rn1qkbnr/1p3ppp/p3p3/2ppPb2/5P1P/3P4/PPP1Q1P1/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 0 6,"? White lashes out on the kingside, but with the wrong pawn. Again, 6. g4 with tempo was much stronger. It could then be followed by playing h4. White has now opened up some juicy lines of attack for black on the kingside. At this point, the beginning of some attacking themes started crossing my mind. I felt that the white pawns on the kingside may be vulnerable to attack if I could only develop my pieces in that direction."
12,Be7,f8e7,rn1qk1nr/1p2bppp/p3p3/2ppPb2/5P1P/3P4/PPP1Q1P1/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 1 7,A developing move which hits the h pawn twice. Notice that from the h4 square black can deliver a check with either the dark squared bishop or the queen.
13,g3,g2g3,rn1qk1nr/1p2bppp/p3p3/2ppPb2/5P1P/3P2P1/PPP1Q3/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 0 7,"White simply defends his weak h pawn. I felt pretty good here, as I had a lead in development and space was roughly equal. As white has opened up space around his king, my plan was to exploit that fact quickly."
14,h5,h7h5,rn1qk1nr/1p2bpp1/p3p3/2ppPb1p/5P1P/3P2P1/PPP1Q3/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 0 8,A counter thrust on the kingside which negates the pesky tempo gaining move white would have if allowed to play g4. This play will also support an attack on the enemy queen by putting the light squared bishop on g4.
15,Bd2,c1d2,rn1qk1nr/1p2bpp1/p3p3/2ppPb1p/5P1P/3P2P1/PPPBQ3/RN2KBNR b KQkq - 1 8,"White hurries to catch up in development. He probably sees the dangers of 0-0, and wants to play 0-0-0."
16,Bg4,f5g4,rn1qk1nr/1p2bpp1/p3p3/2ppP2p/5PbP/3P2P1/PPPBQ3/RN2KBNR w KQkq - 2 9,Posting the bishop nicely and attacking the queen. White must now move her and use time better spent developing.
17,Qf2,e2f2,rn1qk1nr/1p2bpp1/p3p3/2ppP2p/5PbP/3P2P1/PPPB1Q2/RN2KBNR b KQkq - 3 9,"Best, as this move allows the light squared bishop some developing room."
18,Nh6,g8h6,rn1qk2r/1p2bpp1/p3p2n/2ppP2p/5PbP/3P2P1/PPPB1Q2/RN2KBNR w KQkq - 4 10,"!? While developing to the edge is not always wise, in this case black sees two potential posts for this knight on either f5 or g4."
19,Be2,f1e2,rn1qk2r/1p2bpp1/p3p2n/2ppP2p/5PbP/3P2P1/PPPBBQ2/RN2K1NR b KQkq - 5 10,"White correctly assesses that his light squared bishop is weak, and offers it up for exchange."
20,Bxe2,g4e2,rn1qk2r/1p2bpp1/p3p2n/2ppP2p/5P1P/3P2P1/PPPBbQ2/RN2K1NR w KQkq - 0 11,"Black accepts the deal, as space on g4 will be created for a righteous posting of the knight currently residing on h6."
