1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Not many people play e5 now.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Yes, the origanal is c5 or e5"
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2P1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,A very nervous hedgehog system (English)
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/2P1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,Is this the correct knight?
5,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/2P1P3/2N5/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 3,"I don't like d6/d3 if the bishop is not out, otherwise its fine."
6,d6,d7d6,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/2p5/2P1P3/2N5/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"I don't like d6/d3 if the bishop is not out, otherwise its fine."
7,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/2p5/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,White quite likes developing.
8,g6,g7g6,r1bqkbnr/pp2pp1p/2np2p1/2p5/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,Black is already starting to weaken his kingside if he ever castles kingside (O-O)
9,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pp2pp1p/2np2p1/2p5/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,This move is fine but the is a little scent of danger/pressure.
10,f5,f7f5,r1bqkbnr/pp2p2p/2np2p1/2p2p2/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,Black is simply starting to rot his kingside.
11,dxc5,d4c5,r1bqkbnr/pp2p2p/2np2p1/2P2p2/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,Now White's structure is a little bit better.
12,fxe4,f5e4,r1bqkbnr/pp2p2p/2np2p1/2P5/2P1p3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"Well, now white can reply with Nxe4, also protecting his c5 pawn. Whatever black does, white will be a pawn up."
13,Nxe4,c3e4,r1bqkbnr/pp2p2p/2np2p1/2P5/2P1N3/5N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,Exactly.
14,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp2p2p/2np1np1/2P5/2P1N3/5N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,This sounds strange.
15,Nxf6+,e4f6,r1bqkb1r/pp2p2p/2np1Np1/2P5/2P5/5N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,"Now black has got a weak castling side whichever way he castles, he will end up in a weak side,"
16,exf6,e7f6,r1bqkb1r/pp5p/2np1pp1/2P5/2P5/5N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 9,Now black has two weak pawns (or 3).
17,cxd6,c5d6,r1bqkb1r/pp5p/2nP1pp1/8/2P5/5N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 9,I would think white needs to capture.But Qe2+ is maybe better.
18,Qxd6,d8d6,r1b1kb1r/pp5p/2nq1pp1/8/2P5/5N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 10,"If a player is stronger than you, I think it is good to exchange queens. White should not exchange queens just yet and keep attacking."
19,Qe2+,d1e2,r1b1kb1r/pp5p/2nq1pp1/8/2P5/5N2/PP2QPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 1 10,That seems just right.
20,Qe7,d6e7,r1b1kb1r/pp2q2p/2n2pp1/8/2P5/5N2/PP2QPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 2 11,I knew it. Black wants to exchange.
21,c5,c4c5,r1b1kb1r/pp2q2p/2n2pp1/2P5/8/5N2/PP2QPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 11,??/!? Why make this move while White has other brilliant attacking plans like Be3/f4?
