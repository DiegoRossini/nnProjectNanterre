1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"My favourite. I can be attacked, but I move the game under known ground... at least, I thought it. 
If he goes for the bishop (Nh5), I can choose between three moves (Bg3, Bg5 or even Qd2)."

7,h3,h2h3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3P1B2/5N1P/PPP1PPP1/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"This is ""not"" a loss of tempo. Because my plan is to shield with c3 and push g4 early. A risky plan I like."

12,Bd7,c8d7,r2qk2r/pppbbppp/2n1pn2/3p4/3P1BP1/4PN1P/PPP2P2/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,"Nothing special, black is playing conservatively. Normally, this means I will attack trying to avoid him to castle longside, which normally I cannot avoid. But some moves has to be played still before we get to that point."

15,Bd3,f1d3,r2qk2r/pppbbppp/2n1p3/3p4/3PnBP1/3BPN1P/PPPN1P2/R2QK2R b KQkq - 4 8,Good. Now white is tangled.
