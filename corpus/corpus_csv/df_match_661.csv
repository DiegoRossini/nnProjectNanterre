8,Bxe6,c8e6,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4bn2/8/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"In my experience, not the best if I go for the Qe7 attack, but even so white can defend with accurate play. So I went for..."
9,Nf3,g1f3,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4bn2/8/8/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"In my experience, not the best if I go for the Qe7 attack, but even so white can defend with accurate play. So I went for..."
10,Bc5,f8c5,rn1qk2r/ppp2ppp/4bn2/2b5/8/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,"Prepared to be rejected by d4, but keeping an eye on a strong diagonal in case white would want to anvance the d pawn to d5. The problem with c5 now is that it leaves a dangerous hole on the Qside white squares (b5 for W's N or B at some point). So I went for this one."
11,d4,d2d4,rn1qk2r/ppp2ppp/4bn2/2b5/3P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"As foreseen. I grant white the possession of d4, and a farily strong pressure against it."
12,Bb6,c5b6,rn1qk2r/ppp2ppp/1b2bn2/8/3P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,"Ok, I lost a tempo. And that I should have played Bg5. Was I ready to exchange my dsb for the Nc3? No! I sensed that my bishop pair is my strenght here. I won't waste it for a N, unless absolutely necessary."
13,Be2,f1e2,rn1qk2r/ppp2ppp/1b2bn2/8/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 7,As good as any other. Bg5 is coming - I know - but I won't spend any tempo in a profilactyc move... even a some cost.
14,c6,c7c6,rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/1bp1bn2/8/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"Controls b5 and e5, allowing me to save my dsb in case of Na4 (Bc7). A little cramped, but holdable - I think."
15,O-O,e1g1,rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/1bp1bn2/8/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 8,"I always say that castling is a loss of time etc. etc. I can recognize the smell of a position where black has to think it twice trying the Qside castling, as usual. Or simply I wanted to try something different from Qd6!?"
16,O-O,e8g8,rn1q1rk1/pp3ppp/1bp1bn2/8/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 2 9,"I always say that castling is a loss of time etc. etc. I can recognize the smell of a position where black has to think it twice trying the Qside castling, as usual.

17,Na4,c3a4,rn1q1rk1/pp3ppp/1bp1bn2/8/N2P4/5N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 3 9,"A voice whispered: ""keep your B at all cost!"""
18,Ba5,b6a5,rn1q1rk1/pp3ppp/2p1bn2/b7/N2P4/5N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 4 10,"If Nc5, I was considering Bc8 (I have to defend b7 and I don't want to exchange B's."
19,c3,c2c3,rn1q1rk1/pp3ppp/2p1bn2/b7/N2P4/2P2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 10,"My opponent went for this other plan instead. Now, b4, Bc7, Nc5, and I am squeezed in and b7 would fall. I have to parry that."
20,Bc7,a5c7,rn1q1rk1/ppb2ppp/2p1bn2/8/N2P4/2P2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 11,"This move anticipates white's plan, but it takes the black diagonal, preventing W's dsb to go to f4 (a good square for it, as g5)."
21,Bg5,c1g5,rn1q1rk1/ppb2ppp/2p1bn2/6B1/N2P4/2P2N2/PP2BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 2 11,This pin will be a real pain for me. I knew I had to play with a lot of care in order to handle it.
22,Nbd7,b8d7,r2q1rk1/ppbn1ppp/2p1bn2/6B1/N2P4/2P2N2/PP2BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 3 12,"First step to ensure f6's integrity. I can't allow BxN, g7xB unless very sure about assessing it. It's easy to see a power on the semiopen g column, but I couldn't be sure white won't have found some counterplay based on my Kside messed pawns. Of course, here white has Ne5, and my answer would have been Qb8. A weird square for the Q, but it defends b7 and controls f4, eyeing h2... some strong point to exploit."
23,Nc5,a4c5,r2q1rk1/ppbn1ppp/2p1bn2/2N3B1/3P4/2P2N2/PP2BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 4 12,"This clearly let me no other choice, since b7 is threatened, and I don't want NxBe6. The white's pin gets stronger, without my other N's support."

26,Qe7,d8e7,r4rk1/ppb1qppp/2p1bn2/2P3B1/8/2P2N2/PP2BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 1 14,"Virtually forced, unless I want to allow gxf6. I wasn't sure. I smelled a danger in it."
27,b4,b2b4,r4rk1/ppb1qppp/2p1bn2/2P3B1/1P6/2P2N2/P3BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 14,"It's ok, because it consolidates a nice pawn's structure, and I can't easily attack it due to Nf3 (preventing Be5). But not necessary, because I won't have gone for Qxc5, BxNf6, gxB. As white, I would have preferred Re1!"
28,a5,a7a5,r4rk1/1pb1qppp/2p1bn2/p1P3B1/1P6/2P2N2/P3BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 15,"? See: I thought that I was not in a hurry to solve the pin issue, if I could grab some initiative, delaying white in his plans (Re1). White has nothing concrete still. The price of this would have been 15. b5. Against it, I would have not exchanged, even at the cost of b6, Bb8. Not a good square, but I hoped only temporary. But I had to keep control of b5 against White's lsb."
29,Qc2,d1c2,r4rk1/1pb1qppp/2p1bn2/p1P3B1/1P6/2P2N2/P1Q1BPPP/R4RK1 b - - 1 15,"A quiet move, probably envisaging Bd3, preparing a carabine on h7."
