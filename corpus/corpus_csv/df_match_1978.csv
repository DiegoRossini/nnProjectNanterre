The main ideas of the Rossolimo are rapid development and seizing the initiative.  I have seen several games by Rossolimo himself and have come to admire this variation of the Sicilian.  When Rossolimo originally started playing 3.Bb5 he wanted to castle as early as move four and then go on the attack.

Tempo is not a term we higher rated players throw around. We must move 1 or 2 pawns, develop all minor pieces (Bishops and Knights) off of the back rank, and castle the king to safety. Of course, we must parry any threats along the way put forth by our opponent. The pawns should either occupy the central squares, or allow for the development of our minor pieces to influence it (as when we fianchetto a bishop for example to g2, g7 or b2, b7). I do commend stealth-invader for putting forth a valiant effort, and some of his moves do indicate he is capable of being a great player."
