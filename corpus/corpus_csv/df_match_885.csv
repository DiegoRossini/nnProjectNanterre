But in my experience; the further from the centre you begin the higher your rating must be to develop well. A 1500, then, probably shouldn't be bothered with this!"

Thus I do similar as Black. This game was played whilst I was overseas, no FCO at my side, so might as well stick to what (little) I know! :)"

Now, as an avid Ruy Lopezer, it might stand that I'd be loth to offer up the R-L like 4. Bb5 option to White. But, with 4...Bd7, should White plunge on and take that knight, 5 Bxc6 Bxc6 it's pressure time for White with his g pawn under threat and pinned. Lines such as 


5.	Bxc6	Bxc6

7.	g3	O-O-O


spring up or, after 6f3, Black can just turn their attention to other things. Point is, Black would definitely be dictating terms to White, or at least that was my impression at the time, so on with the show and the knight movement!"

Since he's seemingly generously wasted a move, I can afford to lose tempo by getting my Q out of the way for castling.

Drunk logic perhaps but if it wasn't for that, I'd have no logic at all! :)"

Try not to then go ahead and weaken his fortress by idly moving a pawn one space! :O Actually....in general....try to avoid idly moving pawns one space at all times! :) Anyway it's here I decide to execute an esoteric 9 move sequence starting with 9...h5 to win position.

(As an aside, thanks to rmannstaedt for his scathing GotM judgement where he chided me for needlessly dissolving the centre after solid development....after which he then proceeded to award me GotM!  http://gameknot.com/club-fm.pl?club=659&th=17218)"
