It's all very well having a material advantage, but not much help when the material is stuck at home. White has a lead in development, and will probably aim to improve this as quickly as possible. The way I see it, I need to be aiming to swap pieces off. Bg7 activates the bishop, eyeing the b2 pawn and the rook behind, whilst giving my rook and queen a bit more space."
