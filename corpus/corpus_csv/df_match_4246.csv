6,g6,g7g6,rnbqk1nr/pppp1p1p/6p1/2b1p2Q/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 0 4,"A very bad move, Nh6 was better but I still win the e5 pawn"
7,Qxe5+,h5e5,rnbqk1nr/pppp1p1p/6p1/2b1Q3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 0 4,"Yes, a fork"
8,Be7,c5e7,rnbqk1nr/ppppbp1p/6p1/4Q3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 1 5,But not a very good responce
9,Qxh8,e5h8,rnbqk1nQ/ppppbp1p/6p1/8/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQq - 0 5,"Whopee, six points up"
10,Kf8,e8f8,rnbq1knQ/ppppbp1p/6p1/8/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQ - 1 6,Fine
11,d4,d2d4,rnbq1knQ/ppppbp1p/6p1/8/2BPP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQ - 0 6,"You can see what I'm up to, or can you?"
12,d6,d7d6,rnbq1knQ/ppp1bp1p/3p2p1/8/2BPP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQ - 0 7,That stops mate in 3 but it doesn't fit well in development. White is winning anyway.
13,Bh6+,c1h6,rnbq1knQ/ppp1bp1p/3p2pB/8/2BPP3/8/PPP2PPP/RN2K1NR b KQ - 1 7,"Even though the knight can take me, it's pinned to the king, so it can't."
14,Ke8,f8e8,rnbqk1nQ/ppp1bp1p/3p2pB/8/2BPP3/8/PPP2PPP/RN2K1NR w KQ - 2 8,So now you know why I said d6/d5 foiled my plan. Now there's an escape square for the king.
15,Qxg8+,h8g8,rnbqk1Q1/ppp1bp1p/3p2pB/8/2BPP3/8/PPP2PPP/RN2K1NR b KQ - 0 8,But who cares.
16,Kd7,e8d7,rnbq2Q1/pppkbp1p/3p2pB/8/2BPP3/8/PPP2PPP/RN2K1NR w KQ - 1 9,Who want's an exchange of queens when white's this powerful. Of course not. So I end up..
17,Qxf7,g8f7,rnbq4/pppkbQ1p/3p2pB/8/2BPP3/8/PPP2PPP/RN2K1NR b KQ - 0 9,...just taking the pawn.
18,Nc6,b8c6,r1bq4/pppkbQ1p/2np2pB/8/2BPP3/8/PPP2PPP/RN2K1NR w KQ - 1 10,Fine
19,Bg5,h6g5,r1bq4/pppkbQ1p/2np2p1/6B1/2BPP3/8/PPP2PPP/RN2K1NR b KQ - 2 10,"The bishop is pinned twice. Once by the queen on f7, pinning it to its king, and the bishop and g5, pinning it to its queen. The world of pins arrive. And the king can't move."
20,Nxd4,c6d4,r1bq4/pppkbQ1p/3p2p1/6B1/2BnP3/8/PPP2PPP/RN2K1NR w KQ - 0 11,Bad move as it loses protection on the bishop.
21,Nc3,b1c3,r1bq4/pppkbQ1p/3p2p1/6B1/2BnP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R3K1NR b KQ - 1 11,Devolping there.
