On the surface, this move looks a little questionable as it is pretty early for a queen move and blocks development of the dark squared bishop.  However, the story behind this move is kind of interesting.  In the previous game between us, I, while doing opening study using the GameKnot database stumbled across a game itking had lost to another player after being forced to move his bishop off of the h7-b1 diagonal to retake a rook on move 24.  Looking at the game, I realized that the other available move would allow a winning exchange sacrifice.  So I played the game for that line, made the exchange sacrifice, and won.  Itking must have realized that I had seen that game, so this time he took an early opportunity of getting away from any database lines."
