1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game is a training match with a teammate.  By no means am I perfect and I still miss plenty, so please feel free to add your own commentary so we can all learn together."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"As Black I prefer the Petrov defense (mostly because I dislike playing in Ruy Lopez), and there are several variations: Nxe5 - French attack, Nc3 - Three Knight game, and d4 - modern attack"
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"As Black I prefer the Petrov defense (mostly because I dislike playing in Ruy Lopez), and there are several variations: Nxe5 - French attack, Nc3 - Three Knight game, and d4 - modern attack"
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"As Black I prefer the Petrov defense (mostly because I dislike playing in Ruy Lopez), and there are several variations: Nxe5 - French attack, Nc3 - Three Knight game, and d4 - modern attack"
5,d3,d2d3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"This move (Petrov's defense) shores up the e4 pawn, and opens an egress route for the DSB."
6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3pp3/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Another option is to develop a knight at c6, but I prefer aggressive moves in training games."
7,Nxe5,f3e5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3pN3/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"going in early for the pawn grab... In this circumstance I prefer exd5 more as White, because Black must retake with the queen, allowing White Nc3 with tempo.  Other options worthy of consideration are Bg5 and Nbd2.  I don't like this play as much because it opens up White to an unfavorable queen trade to retain pawn parity."
8,Bd6,f8d6,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/3b1n2/3pN3/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"I played this move to see how White would respond.  I looked at dxe4 instead, but liked the tactical challenges this posed for White more.  This move gives White more challenges and I think allows Black a good chance at a free pawn or forcing a queen trade with White giving up the castle.  I anticipated d4, Nc3, or maybe even f4 in response."
9,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/3b1n2/3pN1B1/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,Unforced errors make it harder to win games.  This move coughs up the knight at e5 for free.  I think d4 is the top play.
10,Bxe5,d6e5,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3pb1B1/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"When you are down you should trade pawns, not pieces.  A more interesting play would have been d4 or perhaps exd5."
11,Bxf6,g5f6,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/5B2/3pb3/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"When you are down you should trade pawns, not pieces.  A more interesting play would have been d4 or perhaps exd5."
12,Qxf6,d8f6,rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/5q2/3pb3/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"No reason not to bring the queen out instead of taking with the bishop.  Whenever you have the chance to retake and develop a piece at the same time, you should almost always take it, provided there aren't any defensive considerations."
13,c3,c2c3,rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/5q2/3pb3/4P3/2PP4/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"To protect against Bxb2, winning a pawn and a rook."
14,d4,d5d4,rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/5q2/4b3/3pP3/2PP4/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,"with an eye towards cxd4, Bxd4"
15,c4,c3c4,rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/5q2/4b3/2PpP3/3P4/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,"A wise counterplay, preventing my bishop from getting a dangerous post middle of the board."
16,O-O,e8g8,rnb2rk1/ppp2ppp/5q2/4b3/2PpP3/3P4/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQ - 1 9,Instead of castling I could have continued development of my power pieces...
17,b3,b2b3,rnb2rk1/ppp2ppp/5q2/4b3/2PpP3/1P1P4/P4PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQ - 0 9,Far more important to get the king to safety.  Be2 or g3 are far better moves.
18,c5,c7c5,rnb2rk1/pp3ppp/5q2/2p1b3/2PpP3/1P1P4/P4PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQ - 0 10,Giving support to the d pawn and giving a space for the knight to come out to c6.
19,Be2,f1e2,rnb2rk1/pp3ppp/5q2/2p1b3/2PpP3/1P1P4/P3BPPP/RN1QK2R b KQ - 1 10,"Good, going for king safety and hoping to connect the rooks."
20,Qd6,f6d6,rnb2rk1/pp3ppp/3q4/2p1b3/2PpP3/1P1P4/P3BPPP/RN1QK2R w KQ - 2 11,"This move is the beginning of an assault of White's Kingside.  My bishops, queen, and rook will soon come into play."
21,g3,g2g3,rnb2rk1/pp3ppp/3q4/2p1b3/2PpP3/1P1P2P1/P3BP1P/RN1QK2R b KQ - 0 11,To prevent Bxh2.
22,f5,f7f5,rnb2rk1/pp4pp/3q4/2p1bp2/2PpP3/1P1P2P1/P3BP1P/RN1QK2R w KQ - 0 12,"Another move I considered was Bh3, to prevent a castle, but saw that Bg4 would be a strong counterplay.  This move attacks his center pawns and lets my rook get into the game.  White's position is beginning to look precarious."
23,f3,f2f3,rnb2rk1/pp4pp/3q4/2p1bp2/2PpP3/1P1P1PP1/P3B2P/RN1QK2R b KQ - 0 12,"I was expecting Bf3, f4, or Nb2.  This move gives up a bit of the defensive structure of White's pawns, and will allow for some nice attacks by Black.  Losing that knight early was costly.  I think Nb2 was the better play."
