2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,Flank vs flank.
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 2,"This move looked strange the first time I saw it, but attacking d5."
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"So I'm thinking black may Fianchetto his bishop, but I have been fooled here before. I am wondering if black will move d5 and cause me to change plans."
5,e4,e2e4,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2P1P3/2N5/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"Normally, I would move g3 and prepare my fortress, but I'm suspicious of a d5 pawn move, which I am not sure how to handle, so I take the initiative. I do really prefer to be on the assertive side."
6,d6,d7d6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/2P1P3/2N5/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,
7,Be2,f1e2,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/2P1P3/2N5/PP1PBPPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 4,Reducing the chance of a black Bd4 queen threat and preparing the castle.
8,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p1np1/2p5/2P1P3/2N5/PP1PBPPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,Now that is a nice looking pawn chain black has. My pawns look a little weak.
9,d3,d2d3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p1np1/2p5/2P1P3/2NP4/PP2BPPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,"Remedied the weak pawns. I like this configuration as well. Opens up both sides. However, the rear pawn requires constant defense with those pesky knights roaming about."
10,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2p5/2P1P3/2NP4/PP2BPPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 1 6,
11,Bd2,c1d2,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2p5/2P1P3/2NP4/PP1BBPPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 2 6,"Additional defense of the knight and opening up the possibility of the long castle. Although with the black pawn chain, I don't think I'll castle queen side."
12,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk2r/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/2p5/2P1P3/2NP4/PP1BBPPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 3 7,Black must really like d4.
13,Qa4,d1a4,r1bqk2r/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/2p5/Q1P1P3/2NP4/PP1BBPPP/R3K1NR b KQkq - 4 7,Temporary fix for the growing pressure on d4.
14,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/2p5/Q1P1P3/2NP4/PP1BBPPP/R3K1NR w KQ - 5 8,"Well, I did say temporary. White queen is not thrilled about that, but I guess it's to be expected."
15,Nf3,g1f3,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/2p5/Q1P1P3/2NP1N2/PP1BBPPP/R3K2R b KQ - 6 8,"Didn't like blocking in my LSB, but I thought the black Kd4 move would not be fun either."
16,Rb8,a8b8,1rbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/2p5/Q1P1P3/2NP1N2/PP1BBPPP/R3K2R w KQ - 7 9,Not sure what Rb8 signaled. Black b5 to threaten queen? ... or a future LSB move?
17,O-O,e1g1,1rbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/2p5/Q1P1P3/2NP1N2/PP1BBPPP/R4RK1 b - - 8 9,Seems like a good time.
18,Bg4,c8g4,1r1q1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/2p5/Q1P1P1b1/2NP1N2/PP1BBPPP/R4RK1 w - - 9 10,"Not sure what this is called, but looks like he pinned my knight."

20,a6,a7a6,1r1q1rk1/1p2ppbp/p1np1np1/2p5/Q1P1P1b1/2NP1N2/PP1BBPPP/4RRK1 w - - 0 11,"b5 appears imminent. Must move queen, must move queen."
