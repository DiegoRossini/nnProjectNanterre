1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"So here we are at the start of my game against lougri. I felt like I could conquer the whole world, well, at least every chessplayer on Gameknot, having won my first 7 games on the server (including a mate in 7!). I'm an e4-player, but try to experiment with some openings on gameknot, exploring whether 1d4 might be a good choice in real games."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"So of course I am not familiar with this opening. I sank into thoughts (which no-one notices on gameknot). I was wondering about 3.dxe5,dxc4 4.Qd8:,Kd8: and expected to have a small plus. However, after for example 5.e4,Nc6 6.f4 (or Nf3),Nb4 I wasn't able to find my plus anymore. It seemed that black was ok because he wins a tempo on my e5-pawn or something. And besides that, 3...,dxc4 isn't even forced. So an alternative."
