9,Bd3,f1d3,rn1qkbnr/1pp2ppp/p3p3/3pPb2/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,"Here black has to think on Ne7, but it comes that the N on f5 is easily kicked out with g4, starting a pawn storm on the kingside. I don't really like a N on f5. And if White doesn't take, I'm self-closing me in. Why not BxB? This just gives white ""all"" and to me ""nothing"". Bg4 is anoher idea, but after h3, we'll reach a position similar to the game's."

Black's game is in keeping the tension ""on"" in order to control the game with a constant threat on the center, pressure on the c column and intelligent use of Nb4... and I am throwing it all out with this move! In addition, I have no support against a future b3 because of my previous tempo loss allowing a5. And now I would struggle to develop. A very bad move for sure!"
