1,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

I know some of you think I take my rating too seriously.  I must plead guilty to that.  For a long, long, time, ever since that Battle of the Wings game against Coach Ion I have harboured dreams of getting to Expertdom.  Well, I got as far as 1857 before Black Friday which put me back to 1809.  Fortunately, due to several timeouts from a 1950+ opponent and this victory I still manage to stay in the 1800s, although there are some losses just around the corner.  I must confess that though I have been trying to get my games level down I was invited to a mini-tournament where an IM was playing in it.  It is not very often I get a chance to play someone at that level so I joined the MT along with Freddy's Traxler MT.  Because that MT contains fast players I really am struggling, but I have only myself to blame.  So, this victory helps take the pressure off just that little bit ....."
