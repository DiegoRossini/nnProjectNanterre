1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Here I am, playing black in my Sneaky Knights Group 3 Team Mini-tournament.  Towards the latter part of the middlegame/early endgame I find myself in big bother again.  I end up a pawn down in a knight ending but incredibly I win it!  How, well, there is the little matter of the outside passed pawn.  I find myself playing the Schelecter Variation of the Goring Gambit after a double king pawn opening (e4, e5)."
