1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"e4. Ah, my favorite opening. *cough* stupid d4... *cough*"
2,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I think this is hypermodern. But the more normal response would have been 1. ... b6.
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Gain central space.
4,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,Fianchetto-ing the bishop. All standard play here.
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 3,"Developing normally. A lot of times in hypermodern stuff, they try to pin the knight or something and pick up a central pawn."
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk1nr/ppppppbp/2n3p1/8/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 3 4,"I thought about d5, because then after  4. d5 Ne5 5. Nxe5 Bxe5 6. f4 I would have a lot of board control, but in doing so I would weaken my king side, and open up the long diagonal for his dark squared bishop. This maily develops, protects e4 for the future, and just gain more central space."
7,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqk1nr/ppppppbp/2n3p1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 4 4,"I thought about d5, because then after  4. d5 Ne5 5. Nxe5 Bxe5 6. f4 I would have a lot of board control, but in doing so I would weaken my king side, and open up the long diagonal for his dark squared bishop. This maily develops, protects e4 for the future, and just gain more central space."
8,e6,e7e6,r1bqk1nr/pppp1pbp/2n1p1p1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Now d5 isn't really an option unless I did some weird line that I thought about at the time, but can not remember it at all right now. It had something to do with Qd2 then d5, then after exd5 i play exd5 winning the knight and/or bishop."
9,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqk1nr/pppp1pbp/2n1p1p1/8/2BPP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,"After this move, i knew that ... d5 would come sooner or later."
10,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/pppp1pbp/2n1pnp1/8/2BPP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 6,"? At the local tournaments I go to, there is a person who plays hypermodern pretty much all the time. He is the only one there who ever does play it by the way. Whenever i play him, he always develops his knight on the fianchettoed side to the seventh rank. By going Nf6, he blocks his bishops and loses a tempo."
11,e5,e4e5,r1bqk2r/pppp1pbp/2n1pnp1/4P3/2BP4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"Poor knight, e8 and d7 weren't even options. =( the knight must be all sad face. Now i have both of his bishops kind of boxed in, although he can always fianchetto his LSB."
12,Ng8,f6g8,r1bqk1nr/pppp1pbp/2n1p1p1/4P3/2BP4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 7,"Poor knight, e8 and d7 weren't even options. =( the knight must be all sad face. Now i have both of his bishops kind of boxed in, although he can always fianchetto his LSB."
13,Be3,c1e3,r1bqk1nr/pppp1pbp/2n1p1p1/4P3/2BP4/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 2 7,"Preparing Qd2 with standard kingside pawn attack. however, he could always castle queenside, but then i would still have the minority pawn push."
14,d5,d7d5,r1bqk1nr/ppp2pbp/2n1p1p1/3pP3/2BP4/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq d6 0 8,Saw it coming.
15,Bb3,c4b3,r1bqk1nr/ppp2pbp/2n1p1p1/3pP3/3P4/1BN1BN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 8,"I thought about Bd3 or e2, but figured this would be better. I kinda didn't notice the knight."
16,Na5,c6a5,r1bqk1nr/ppp2pbp/4p1p1/n2pP3/3P4/1BN1BN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 9,Woops.
17,Ba4+,b3a4,r1bqk1nr/ppp2pbp/4p1p1/n2pP3/B2P4/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 3 9,"? No real point of this, just moved instinctively, hoping that maybe, just maybe he would block with his knight or his bishop. this just loses a tempo."
18,c6,c7c6,r1bqk1nr/pp3pbp/2p1p1p1/n2pP3/B2P4/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 10,best option
19,Bb3,a4b3,r1bqk1nr/pp3pbp/2p1p1p1/n2pP3/3P4/1BN1BN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 10,"Now i lose a tempo. i probably should have gone Qd2 and then after b5 go Bb3, but then his pawns would be threatening my queen side, where i planned to castle."
20,Ne7,g8e7,r1bqk2r/pp2npbp/2p1p1p1/n2pP3/3P4/1BN1BN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 11,"Now his knight gets the right idea. My LSB isn't going anywhere, so he can ignore it for the time being."
21,Qd2,d1d2,r1bqk2r/pp2npbp/2p1p1p1/n2pP3/3P4/1BN1BN2/PPPQ1PPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 3 11,Moving to a more useful square? Trying to trade off the bishop? No idea.
22,Nf5,e7f5,r1bqk2r/pp3pbp/2p1p1p1/n2pPn2/3P4/1BN1BN2/PPPQ1PPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 4 12,Moving to a more useful square? Trying to trade off the bishop? No idea.
