11,Bb5+,c4b5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/nB1Pp1N1/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 6,? My opponent missed this and I got away with it. Theory is the much better Be2.

16,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk2r/p4ppp/2p2n2/n1b1p1N1/B7/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 9,Better was h6 and if Nf3? e4 Ne5 (No better is Nh4 g5 and it drops)  (Ng1 must be played and black then plays Bg4 with pressure on white) Bd6 (wins the knight because) f4?? Bg4!! Wins the queen! So Nh3 is the move when Bg4 f3 Bxh3 gxh3 cripples White's kingside with an interesting game in progress.
