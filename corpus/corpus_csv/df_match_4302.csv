1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game in few words: 
- crazy sharp opening, 
- fast exchanges in the middle game, 
- slow maneuverability on the endgame. 

I eventually created a passed and well advanced c pawn, but white had enough counterplay to prevent me from promoting it, even threatened promoting his own pawn with check, so I forced a three fold repetition to end in a safe draw (white could only prevent this by playing a weakening move), and sent a draw offer..."

a) 9. Nb3 Bg4 10. Nbxd4 O-O-O, I'm hoping for this one, yet I think the other two are more likely to be played...
b) 9. Nb3 Bg4 10. Qxd4 Bxf3 11. Qxf6 gxf6 12. gxf3 O-O-O, with almost completed development and open lines on white's king
