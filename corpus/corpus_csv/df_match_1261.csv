1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I play this a lot - I play 1. d4 against players >1300 and 1. e4 against players <1300 as you may have seen against my previous annotations.
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,1. ... d5.
3,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,e3 - rather seen with stronger players that don't mind blocking their DSB.
4,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p1b2/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,My bishop surges into the game.
5,Bd3,f1d3,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p1b2/3P4/3BP3/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 3,"This is a really annoying move - if Bxe3 then Qxd3 and white has developed more than I had, and if my bishop moves, then I lose a tempo - white's bishop is perfect on d3."
6,Bxd3,f5d3,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/3bP3/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 4,"Not much of a choice, but I choose to exchange."
7,Qxd3,d1d3,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/3QP3/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 0 4,He takes with the queen - the best move to avoid doubled pawns.
8,Nf6,g8f6,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/3QP3/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 1 5,Knight surges into centre - I am preparing Ne4 perhaps.
9,Qb5+,d3b5,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/1Q1p4/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 2 5,"Seeing this, this early queen check also forks the b-pawn."
10,Nc6,b8c6,r2qkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/1Q1p4/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 3 6,"Though this develops a piece, I actually think that c6 would have been better and if Qxb7 then Nbd7."
11,Qxb7,b5b7,r2qkb1r/pQp1pppp/2n2n2/3p4/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 0 6,He greedily nabs the pawn.
12,Na5,c6a5,r2qkb1r/pQp1pppp/5n2/n2p4/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 1 7,Probably not that great - I try to force him back.
13,Qb5+,b7b5,r2qkb1r/p1p1pppp/5n2/nQ1p4/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 2 7,"Looking like a deadly queen fork - even when I looked at this, first-sight, a bead of sweat came towards me, but I can wriggle."
14,c6,c7c6,r2qkb1r/p3pppp/2p2n2/nQ1p4/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 0 8,The pawn blocks the check and the queen protects the knight - perfect!
15,Qd3,b5d3,r2qkb1r/p3pppp/2p2n2/n2p4/3P4/3QP3/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 1 8,The queen heads home.
16,e6,e7e6,r2qkb1r/p4ppp/2p1pn2/n2p4/3P4/3QP3/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 0 9,Trying to give my DSB a path.
17,Bd2,c1d2,r2qkb1r/p4ppp/2p1pn2/n2p4/3P4/3QP3/PPPB1PPP/RN2K1NR b KQkq - 1 9,"Developing, and targeting my knight."
18,Bd6,f8d6,r2qk2r/p4ppp/2pbpn2/n2p4/3P4/3QP3/PPPB1PPP/RN2K1NR w KQkq - 2 10,I develop my bishop.
19,Nh3,g1h3,r2qk2r/p4ppp/2pbpn2/n2p4/3P4/3QP2N/PPPB1PPP/RN2K2R b KQkq - 3 10,"Flanky knight - as I call it. It has two other perfectly fine squares to go to, so why not go to them?"
20,O-O,e8g8,r2q1rk1/p4ppp/2pbpn2/n2p4/3P4/3QP2N/PPPB1PPP/RN2K2R w KQ - 4 11,Castling from both sides.
