Strategically, removing the rook from the long diagonal, preparing to re route the Queens knight, is a sound idea. However, you have to be able to check Black's initiative in the center and Queenside, at the same time preparing an attack on the Kings wing. In my book this is just too slow. The more popular main line with Be3, prepares a central advance and also prepares to swap dark squared bishops with Qd2 and Bh6."

Isolated pawns create outposts for your opponents pieces on the square directly in front of the pawn.
