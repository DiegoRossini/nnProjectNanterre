2,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"swiss gambit ! He opens the dangerous h5 e8 diagonal, as i do BUT white has a tempo more ! so i will attack that whith e4, like if i whould atack a white king gambit if i where black ..."
3,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,he will take it and then i wil offer a dangerous d3 paw for dessert in order to develp LSB and prepare queen h4+ ..etc
4,fxe4,f5e4,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/8/4pP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,poisoned paw offered

6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppppp1pp/5n2/8/4pP2/3P4/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"ho, he is resisting to the trap ! so i will take it. It is not the best answer becaus it will result a knight in e4"
7,dxe4,d3e4,rnbqkb1r/ppppp1pp/5n2/8/4PP2/8/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"well, unconfortable position for blacks ...4. ... Kxe4 5.Qh5+ g6 6. Qe5 Rg8 and i win the knight"
8,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp2pp/4pn2/8/4PP2/8/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"well, unconfortable position for blacks ...4. ... Kxe4 5.Qh5+ g6 6. Qe5 Rg8 and i win the knight"
9,e5,e4e5,rnbqkb1r/pppp2pp/4pn2/4P3/5P2/8/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,now he is regreting to use the suiss gambit. I will prepare Qh5 with Bd3 first.
10,Nd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/pppp2pp/4p3/3nP3/5P2/8/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,now he is regreting to use the suiss gambit. I will prepare Qh5 with Bd3 first.
11,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqkb1r/pppp2pp/4p3/3nP3/5P2/3B4/PPP3PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 6,that was the blunder : he should play Ke7 to defend g6
12,Bc5,f8c5,rnbqk2r/pppp2pp/4p3/2bnP3/5P2/3B4/PPP3PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 3 7,that was the blunder : he should play Ke7 to defend g6
13,Qh5+,d1h5,rnbqk2r/pppp2pp/4p3/2bnP2Q/5P2/3B4/PPP3PP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 4 7,maybe it whould be better for black to move the king ...
14,g6,g7g6,rnbqk2r/pppp3p/4p1p1/2bnP2Q/5P2/3B4/PPP3PP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 0 8,"classical, i prepared this with my LSB"
15,Bxg6+,d3g6,rnbqk2r/pppp3p/4p1B1/2bnP2Q/5P2/8/PPP3PP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 0 8,so now he has to move the king or loose the rook
16,Kf8,e8f8,rnbq1k1r/pppp3p/4p1B1/2bnP2Q/5P2/8/PPP3PP/RNB1K1NR w KQ - 1 9,"at this moment i didnt knew exactly how to mate him. The good move for blacks was g8, but he blunder again and move Ke7, so it was mate !"
17,Qh6+,h5h6,rnbq1k1r/pppp3p/4p1BQ/2bnP3/5P2/8/PPP3PP/RNB1K1NR b KQ - 2 9,"at this moment i didnt knew exactly how to mate him. The good move for blacks was g8, but he blunder again and move Ke7, so it was mate !"
18,Ke7,f8e7,rnbq3r/ppppk2p/4p1BQ/2bnP3/5P2/8/PPP3PP/RNB1K1NR w KQ - 3 10,the moral of the story is that bird opening is dangerous if you dont know how to play it as black. And second moral of the story is that swiss gambit definitively doesnt work !
19,Qg7#,h6g7,rnbq3r/ppppk1Qp/4p1B1/2bnP3/5P2/8/PPP3PP/RNB1K1NR b KQ - 4 10,the moral of the story is that bird opening is dangerous if you dont know how to play it as black. And second moral of the story is that swiss gambit definitively doesnt work !
