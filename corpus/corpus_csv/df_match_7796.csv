Well done, on removing the center pawns from the board you have created a lot of open lines to develop your pieces quickly. I am very happy to see that you have the right idea of developing your pieces toward the center. However, playing ...Qe7 is CORRECT move for you because you don't lose a pawn. 

After 5. ...Qe7

a) 6. QxQ BxQ black is ok. (you just continue your development as normal)
b) 6. Nf3 Nc6! 7. QXQ(white is not forced to take the queen) BxQ 8. Black is better than ok (you are better than white because of a major lead in development)"
