1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,The Caro-Kann very solid.
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,The Caro-Kann very solid.
3,a4,a2a4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/P3P3/8/1PPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"? Ok so we are out of book now, I look poorly on this move. There is an unspoken rule to think about here. Every Pawn move should be considered a waste of 3 tempo. the reason is very simple it takes in general 3 moves before that pawn becomes a threat. 2ndly this Pawn does nothing for the center. REMBER: Every pawn move also leaves a weakness in front and behind it."

I was here that I paused...and took a Deep look at my opponent. You can learn a much from your Opponents from his games. What pieces he prefers... the tact..and strategies...and most of all what he knows and doesn't. This character holds back his knights til the end game doesn't know how to use his Bishops...and dislikes trading pawns...Prefers closed games to open ones... rarely castles. Trades Queens. and always plays this weird line!!!! I began to Assess my Basics and deeply.Chaos was a comming.^-^So first I gave reason for the bishop (who is Pinning a ghost at the moment a reason to be there.

What I now, see is Lite Squared weaknesses All for white the dark sqaures are very important and it's plain that the queenside and the center is the place to focus and I'll have to defend this ugly pawn storm. So, first My bishop goes to e6 where it will Eye the center of the board. My DSB is Bad But active. Protecting the e5 square."
