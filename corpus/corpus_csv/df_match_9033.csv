1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Another two interesting tactical situation, one in the middle game and another in a pretty uncommon ending, that I handled very, very badly."
2,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"A good but not very frequently seen answer. I like it, since it makes more difficult my favorite London attack."
3,Bf4,c1f4,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/3P1B2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"I can advance inmediately this pawn because if Nh5, Be5. If Bg7, I exchange bishops and the game can go on. If Ng7, my bishop will be pushed away eventually with d6, but black development will also resent. Interesting but I think it is playable. If Rg8, I made him loose the castilng rights for the kingside."

Better would have been Bc4, I realized later. But, in black's shoes, I would have played d5. He loses a tempo, but I will, also, so it is playable. I thought my Bc4 plan will go nowhere unless I have much more attacking power."

If NxRa8, e5xBf4 is dangerous for me, and I am not sure I can hold the knight without major problems against my king. Maybe o-o is enough to hold the position, but who wants a king's castling with the pawn in h5? And, after f4xe3... I was very doubious about white's position. So I preferred the ""clean""..."
