1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,He starts classically.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I opt for the Sicilian.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,He plays the main line.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,And I do likewise.
5,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,He goes for the open variation.
6,cxd4,c5d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,So I take.
7,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,He takes back.
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,I hit his e pawn.
9,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,He protects.
10,d6,d7d6,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,This is a very normal position.
11,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"The Richterâ€“Rauzer Attack (ECO codes B60 et seq). The move 6.Bg5 was Kurt Richter's invention, threatening to double Black's pawns after Bxf6 and forestalling the Dragon by rendering 6...g6 unplayable."
12,e6,e7e6,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2nppn2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,I prevent him doubling my pawns.
13,Qd2,d1d2,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2nppn2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPPQ1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 1 7,This is usual development for white. Vsevolod Rauzer introduced the modern plan of Qd2 and 0-0-0 in the 1930s.
14,a6,a7a6,r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1nppn2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPPQ1PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 8,"Usual again, preventing a white knight from coming to b5 and also preparing b7-b5."
15,O-O-O,e1c1,r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1nppn2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPPQ1PPP/2KR1B1R b kq - 1 8,He continues with his plan.
16,Bd7,c8d7,r2qkb1r/1p1b1ppp/p1nppn2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPPQ1PPP/2KR1B1R w kq - 2 9,"Protecting Nc6, so preparing b7-b5."
17,Nb3,d4b3,r2qkb1r/1p1b1ppp/p1nppn2/6B1/4P3/1NN5/PPPQ1PPP/2KR1B1R b kq - 3 9,This is an interesting move. If now Be7 10. Bxf6 and if I take back with the bishop my pawn on d6 falls. So I decided to continue with my queen-side play.
18,b5,b7b5,r2qkb1r/3b1ppp/p1nppn2/1p4B1/4P3/1NN5/PPPQ1PPP/2KR1B1R w kq - 0 10,"I am now threatening b5-b4 and after Nc3 moves, I can play Nf6xe4 and if he plays Bg5xQd8 then I have Ne4xQd2."
19,f3,f2f3,r2qkb1r/3b1ppp/p1nppn2/1p4B1/4P3/1NN2P2/PPPQ2PP/2KR1B1R b kq - 0 10,"So he protects against that threat. Now one of my team mates said he thought f3 was a bit passive, but in fact accoridng to my on-line opening databases, it is the most popular move in this position."
20,Rc8,a8c8,2rqkb1r/3b1ppp/p1nppn2/1p4B1/4P3/1NN2P2/PPPQ2PP/2KR1B1R w k - 1 11,"10.... Rc8 doesn't seem to be in my opening databases, but it seems to me to be a fairly logical follow-up to my previous play."
