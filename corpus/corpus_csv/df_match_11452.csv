4,exf4,e5f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"King's Gambit Accepted. In studying this opening a little, I have learned that this is usually the best response for black. We must have SOME King's Gambit players out there, and I would love to play against you to become more familiar with this opening:)"
5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 3,King's Bishop Gambit. My research shows that 3. Nf3 is a much more standard response.
6,Qh4+,d8h4,rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1Pp1q/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 4,Bryan's Counter-Gambit. Named for American ameteur Thomas Jefferson Bryan who studied it extensively in Paris and London in the 19th century. It aims to gambit a pawn while harrassing white's light squared bishop. This kind of play is WAAAAY over my head. I think most of us would agree that black needs to accelerate his development. But what do I know?

15,Nh4,f3h4,rnb1kb1r/p1pp1ppp/7q/1B5n/4Pp1N/3P4/PPP3PP/RNBQ1K1R b kq - 2 8,Does anyone else notice a seemingly non-chalant attitude by Anderssen about his piece development? I have no idea what would prompt such a move. There are PAGES of analysis about this move that have been published.
