2,b6,b7b6,rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/1p6/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Owens defence, I think. The plan is to develop first and then to attack in the centre with d5 and c5. However black plays extremely passivly."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/1p6/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,This knight should only go here after black plays c5 or it may be better supporting c5 from d7. Here it's a target for the white pawns to attack.

8,Ba6,b7a6,r2qkbnr/p1pppppp/bpn5/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,The c4 pawn is already guarded so it may be better to play Bb7.
9,Be3,c1e3,r2qkbnr/p1pppppp/bpn5/8/2PPP3/2N1B3/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 2 5,"Again, a tagret for the white pawns."
