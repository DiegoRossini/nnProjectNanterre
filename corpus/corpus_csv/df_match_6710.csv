1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was great fun for me but must have been torture for my poor opponent.  Our grades were much closer at the start of the match, so it's not a case of a simple crushing by a better player, just a case of an unfortunate series of opening errors that were duly punished."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The Scandinavian, or Centre-Counter, is a tricky opening, so both players have to be on the ball."
3,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,All standard stuff so far.

6,Qe4+,d5e4,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/3Pq3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,? but this is not recommended by the books.
7,Be2,f1e2,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/3Pq3/8/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 4,Black goes chasing material at the cost of development.

9,Bf3,e2f3,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/3P4/5B2/PPP2PqP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 5,? Another unnecessary Queen move when all his other pieces are still at home.
10,Qg6,g2g6,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/6q1/8/3P4/5B2/PPP2P1P/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 6,? Another unnecessary Queen move when all his other pieces are still at home.
11,Ne2,g1e2,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/6q1/8/3P4/5B2/PPP1NP1P/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 6,? Another unnecessary Queen move when all his other pieces are still at home.
12,Qf5,g6f5,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/5q2/3P4/5B2/PPP1NP1P/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 7,? Another unnecessary Queen move when all his other pieces are still at home.
13,Ng3,e2g3,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/5q2/3P4/5BN1/PPP2P1P/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 5 7,"The Q is chased away, the B protected and the g-file covered all in one move."
14,Qa5+,f5a5,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/q7/3P4/5BN1/PPP2P1P/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 6 8,"Once again, the Q provides White with a tempo for development."

16,Qb5,a5b5,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/1q6/3P4/5BN1/PPPB1P1P/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 8 9,This at least prevents castling and again threatens to win material with ...Qxb2
17,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/1q6/3P4/2N2BN1/PPPB1P1P/R2QK2R b KQkq - 9 9,Black is welcome to expend another tempo for the insignificant b-pawn.  White's minor pieces are gaining control of the board.
18,Qxb2,b5b2,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/3P4/2N2BN1/PqPB1P1P/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 10,White completes his development and Black still only has his Queen out.  9 out of Black's first 10 moves have been Queen moves.
19,Rb1,a1b1,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/3P4/2N2BN1/PqPB1P1P/1R1QK2R b Kkq - 1 10,White completes his development and Black still only has his Queen out.  9 out of Black's first 10 moves have been Queen moves.

22,c6,c7c6,rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/3P4/q1N2BN1/P1PB1P1P/1R1Q1RK1 w kq - 0 12,"and then this non-Queen move is a pawn move that doesn't help develop any pieces.  In fact it deprives the Nb8 of its best square.  While this is a standard move in the Scandinavian, it is usually several moves earlier as part of a plan to preserve the Q.  Now there were far more relevant moves to be made."
23,Re1,f1e1,rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/3P4/q1N2BN1/P1PB1P1P/1R1QR1K1 b kq - 1 12,White takes aim at the centrally stranded King.
24,e6,e7e6,rnb1kbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/8/3P4/q1N2BN1/P1PB1P1P/1R1QR1K1 w kq - 0 13,"This saves the Q for the time being but deprives King, Bishop and Knight of a useful square."

27,Nf5,g3f5,rnb1kbnr/pp2qppp/2p1p3/5N2/3P4/1RN2B2/P1PB1P1P/3QR1K1 b kq - 3 14,The N takes advantage of the pin on the pawn to attack the Q again.
28,g6,g7g6,rnb1kbnr/pp2qp1p/2p1p1p1/5N2/3P4/1RN2B2/P1PB1P1P/3QR1K1 w kq - 0 15,?! or ?? depending on whether it was deliberate.  Black ignores the attack on the Q and belatedly starts to provide the space to develop his pieces.  Having invested so many tempi in the Q it seems strange to give it up now.  Perhaps it was just a blundering oversight.
29,Nxe7,f5e7,rnb1kbnr/pp2Np1p/2p1p1p1/8/3P4/1RN2B2/P1PB1P1P/3QR1K1 b kq - 0 15,White immediately heads for the holes at f6 and d6.

33,Bg5,d2g5,rnb1kb1r/pp3p1p/2p1p1p1/3n2B1/3PN3/1R3B2/P1P2P1P/3QR1K1 b kq - 3 17,Now the second N reinforces the defence of f6.  It's a pity Black has lost his Q as his pawns look solid but draughty.  White can have a party on the black squares.
34,Nd7,b8d7,r1b1kb1r/pp1n1p1p/2p1p1p1/3n2B1/3PN3/1R3B2/P1P2P1P/3QR1K1 w kq - 4 18,Now the second N reinforces the defence of f6.  It's a pity Black has lost his Q as his pawns look solid but draughty.  White can have a party on the black squares.
