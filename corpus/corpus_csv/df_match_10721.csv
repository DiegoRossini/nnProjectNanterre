1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Being an unrated game against an opponent of what I perceive as equal or greater strength, I throw caution to the wind and open with my king's pawn, knowing an open tactical game will most likely ruin me."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"As expected. I have a long history of facing (and losing to) Sicilians, so I'm already planning my niche Sicilian response."
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"The closed Sicilian has been an efficient weapon of ""ambidextrous"" players like Spassky and Karpov, as well as the great precision champion, Smyslov."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,I figure I'm in for a drawn out battle. My opponent knows his theory. This is black's most common response.
5,g3,g2g3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/2N3P1/PPPP1P1P/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,I'm merely interested in seeing how much theory my opponent knows. This was a favorite continuation of Smyslov's.
6,g6,g7g6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/2p5/4P3/2N3P1/PPPP1P1P/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,No surprise here. Black hopes to put immediate and long-lasting pressure on d4. The trade-off is my almost indominatable control of e4.
7,d3,d2d3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/2p5/4P3/2NP2P1/PPP2P1P/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"Here I break well-established theory. In previous games (my own theory, as it were) once the black king's bishop is fianchettoed the knight at c3 becomes an immediate target for the purposes of doubling my pawns on the c-file and rendering my queen's side indefensible (which is where most of the coming action is likely to take place). As a closed system, I still have plenty of time to develop my bishops and castle, though I must be careful of ...Nd4 which, after the exchange, would place a pawn on the powerful center square."
8,Bg7,f8g7,r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/2p5/4P3/2NP2P1/PPP2P1P/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"Here I break well-established theory.

9,Nge2,g1e2,r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/2p5/4P3/2NP2P1/PPP1NP1P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,"Here I break well-established theory.

10,d6,d7d6,r1bqk1nr/pp2ppbp/2np2p1/2p5/4P3/2NP2P1/PPP1NP1P/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,He continues development normally.
11,Be3,c1e3,r1bqk1nr/pp2ppbp/2np2p1/2p5/4P3/2NPB1P1/PPP1NP1P/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"A mistake, if only a small one. Now the black knight can safely traverse to the d4 square without fear of exchange, lest I fork my own pieces in the process."
12,e5,e7e5,r1bqk1nr/pp3pbp/2np2p1/2p1p3/4P3/2NPB1P1/PPP1NP1P/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,A common move to hinder the e2 knight and to make room to develop black's own king's knight.
13,Bg2,f1g2,r1bqk1nr/pp3pbp/2np2p1/2p1p3/4P3/2NPB1P1/PPP1NPBP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 7,? Not sure about this move as it blocks the bishop and gives the knight minimal options from which to advance. This is the first indication to me that my opponent has not faced many positions like this one in the closed Sicilian.
14,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/pp3pbp/2np1np1/2p1p3/4P3/2NPB1P1/PPP1NPBP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 8,? Not sure about this move as it blocks the bishop and gives the knight minimal options from which to advance. This is the first indication to me that my opponent has not faced many positions like this one in the closed Sicilian.
15,Qd2,d1d2,r1bqk2r/pp3pbp/2np1np1/2p1p3/4P3/2NPB1P1/PPPQNPBP/R3K2R b KQkq - 3 8,"Assuming (rightly so, as we'll see in a second) that my opponent intends to advance his knight to one of the scant few squares available: g4. My text move here indicates that I'm prepared to exchange the bishop rather than save it (although I exchange it with my pawn structure intact, ha ha!), and I certainly am prepared. In closed positions knights are often more valuable than bishops and this game eventually proves to be no exception."
16,Ng4,f6g4,r1bqk2r/pp3pbp/2np2p1/2p1p3/4P1n1/2NPB1P1/PPPQNPBP/R3K2R w KQkq - 4 9,My confidence always builds in a game when I have correctly guessed my opponent's next move :-)
17,a3,a2a3,r1bqk2r/pp3pbp/2np2p1/2p1p3/4P1n1/P1NPB1P1/1PPQNPBP/R3K2R b KQkq - 0 9,"I won't call this a key move, but I do think it necessary. Once e3 is exchanged, my queen will be delayed there briefly, leaving c2 unguarded and ripe for attack by the black queen's knight. This slight touch of prophylaxsis is to insure that my queen's side is aired of any immediate intruders."
18,Nxe3,g4e3,r1bqk2r/pp3pbp/2np2p1/2p1p3/4P3/P1NPn1P1/1PPQNPBP/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 10,Necessary to justify the sorte to g4.
19,Qxe3,d2e3,r1bqk2r/pp3pbp/2np2p1/2p1p3/4P3/P1NPQ1P1/1PP1NPBP/R3K2R b KQkq - 0 10,Kingside pawn structure is preserved.
20,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp3pbp/2np2p1/2p1p3/4P3/P1NPQ1P1/1PP1NPBP/R3K2R w KQ - 1 11,"Black should be feeling comfortable right now. King is safely tucked away, bishops have good diagonals to work with, Queen has options, rooks will soon be connected. It is my job to dispel this feeling of comfort."
21,Nd5,c3d5,r1bq1rk1/pp3pbp/2np2p1/2pNp3/4P3/P2PQ1P1/1PP1NPBP/R3K2R b KQ - 2 11,"My intention is simple, to show the power of my knights in a closed position."
22,Be6,c8e6,r2q1rk1/pp3pbp/2npb1p1/2pNp3/4P3/P2PQ1P1/1PP1NPBP/R3K2R w KQ - 3 12,I relished this move only because I now have my justification for 5.Ng-e2 :-)
23,Nec3,e2c3,r2q1rk1/pp3pbp/2npb1p1/2pNp3/4P3/P1NPQ1P1/1PP2PBP/R3K2R b KQ - 4 12,I relished this move only because I now have my justification for 5.Ng-e2 :-)
24,Nd4,c6d4,r2q1rk1/pp3pbp/3pb1p1/2pNp3/3nP3/P1NPQ1P1/1PP2PBP/R3K2R w KQ - 5 13,! It seems now that a2 may have given too much away. My opponent finds his opening to strike at c2 after all.
