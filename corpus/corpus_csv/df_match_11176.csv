2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,good book reply but my recent studies have shown c5 to be a little better but then again there is nothing wrong with e5 in fact I play that my self
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Still in book
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,I don't understand d6 here.  Nc6 is better or even d5  or c5 but d6 is too passive and in this case proved a mistake
