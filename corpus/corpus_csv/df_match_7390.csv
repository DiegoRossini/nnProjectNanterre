6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 4,A weak move. too easy to defend. I think he missed my next move. Better is a move like 4. Nc3 or 4.0-0
7,Ng5,f3g5,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/2p3N1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 4,A weak move. too easy to defend. I think he missed my next move. Better is a move like 4. Nc3 or 4.0-0

10,Nxc4,e5c4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/2p3N1/2n1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,Now you can see what I mean with the holes. Pawn on c4 is weak because after b3 is the diagonal for the bishop on g7 open to the rook.

13,Nf3,g5f3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp2/6pp/2p5/2P1P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,"Maybe was 7. Nh3 better, because it can go to f4 followed by Nd5. The knight doesn't do anything here. g5 will be met by f4!"
14,Bg7,f8g7,r1bqk1nr/pp1pppb1/6pp/2p5/2P1P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 8,On 8.. Nf6?! follows the strong 9. e5!

21,Nc3,b1c3,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppb1/3p1npp/2p5/2P1P3/2N2N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQR1K1 b - - 4 11,A very strong move. On 12. Nd5 follows the strong 12.. Nxd5 13. cxd5 b5! with control and bishop pair for black
22,a6,a7a6,r1bq1rk1/1p2ppb1/p2p1npp/2p5/2P1P3/2N2N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQR1K1 w - - 0 12,A very strong move. On 12. Nd5 follows the strong 12.. Nxd5 13. cxd5 b5! with control and bishop pair for black

24,Nxe4,f6e4,r1bq1rk1/1p2ppb1/p2p2pp/2p5/2P1n3/1PN2N1P/P1P2PP1/R1BQR1K1 w - - 0 13,"Very strong combination. The knight on c3 was indirectly pinned by the bishop on g7 and now the knight on f6, which was blockading the bishop, has gone away with a pawn. Now white has to play 13. Rxe4 which is met by 13.. Bxc3. Black has a pawn more and an enormous advantage because the standings of the pieces. The bishop on c1, queen on d1, rook on a1 and the knight on f3 aren't standing good. Black has the same, but can bring them active much faster with moves like b5, Bb7, Dd7 and if white has taken on b5, which is quite logical Rfc8. Black has still to defend h6. White first has to play Rb1. Then isn't there a good field for the bishop. Black hasn't weak points. There can't come knights on d5, the queen hasn't a good place. I should already say, but maybe it's too fast, black is won"
