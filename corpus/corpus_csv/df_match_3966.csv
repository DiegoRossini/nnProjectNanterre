8,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"A Tarrash-like move, enabling white to give black an isolated d pawn."

19,Na3,b1a3,3rkb1r/pp3ppp/4bn2/8/1n6/N4NP1/PP2PPBP/R1B1K2R b KQk - 3 10,"It is important to mention that an ""a"" pawn isn't exactly the same as a ""d"" pawn, plus it's clear that black went out of his way to take it - just look at the light bishop and knight. Black is neglecting castling a bit too much, which white will demonstrate it to be a (potentially, perhaps you see a way to defend) decisive mistake."

22,a6,a7a6,3rkb1r/1p3ppp/p4n2/8/1n6/N4NP1/bP2PPBP/R1B2RK1 w k - 0 12,"Black should play Be7 and castle immediately but instead delays it to protect the b5 square. In reality, if after Be7 Nb5 and castle white decides to take the a7 pawn, Bc5! The knight can't get out easily, the e2 pawn is threatened, and if white protects it with Re1, Nc2 fork!"
23,Bg5,c1g5,3rkb1r/1p3ppp/p4n2/6B1/1n6/N4NP1/bP2PPBP/R4RK1 b k - 1 12,A natural move.

25,Nc2,a3c2,3rk2r/1p2bppp/p4n2/6B1/1n6/5NP1/bPN1PPBP/R4RK1 b k - 3 13,Black should just take on c2 and be happy to live without a bishop pair (the knight could go back to c6 later).
