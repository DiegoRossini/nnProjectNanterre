6,dxc4,d5c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/2pP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,accepted.  Black is now up by one pawn but is at risk of becoming distracted by protecting his pawn advantage and falling behind in developing is primary pieces.
7,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/2pPP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,Strong centre attack with two pawns.  Also unmasks attack on black's pawn on c4.
8,b5,b7b5,rnbqkbnr/p1p2ppp/4p3/1p6/2pPP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Black tries to keep his pawn advantage, but at the cost of giving up the centre and development.  White has one piece in play, black has none."
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/p1p2ppp/4p3/1p6/2pPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,! Develops another piece and places further pressure on black's pawn advance.
10,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk1nr/p1p2ppp/4p3/1p6/1bpPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,"Pin Knight to King to prevent it moving.  At least this is a developing move, but with the bishop out so far it can easily be deflected by p-a3."
11,a3,a2a3,rnbqk1nr/p1p2ppp/4p3/1p6/1bpPP3/P1N2N2/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,Force black to move his bishop again.
12,Bxc3+,b4c3,rnbqk1nr/p1p2ppp/4p3/1p6/2pPP3/P1b2N2/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,Black goes for the exchange!
13,bxc3,b2c3,rnbqk1nr/p1p2ppp/4p3/1p6/2pPP3/P1P2N2/5PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,And now black can bring a piece into play.
14,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqk2r/p1p2ppp/4pn2/1p6/2pPP3/P1P2N2/5PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,And now black can bring a piece into play.
15,Ne5,f3e5,rnbqk2r/p1p2ppp/4pn2/1p2N3/2pPP3/P1P5/5PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 8,? White pushes into the centre although this may be a bit premature with no other pieces developed yet.
16,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/p1p2ppp/4pn2/1p2N3/2pPP3/P1P5/5PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 3 9,Protects the King and allows a rook some freedom.
17,Qf3,d1f3,rnbq1rk1/p1p2ppp/4pn2/1p2N3/2pPP3/P1P2Q2/5PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQ - 4 9,"? White elects to protect the pawn with his Queen instead of breaking his 3 castle side pawn rank.
White's early advance of his Knight is coming back to bite him.  If his Knight was still on f3 then p-e5 would have forced black to move his Knight."
18,Bb7,c8b7,rn1q1rk1/pbp2ppp/4pn2/1p2N3/2pPP3/P1P2Q2/5PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ - 5 10,"! Black's ""fianchetto"" bishop is pinning white's pawn on e4 to his queen (it's only protecting at present).  This pawn is unprotected"
19,Qd1,f3d1,rn1q1rk1/pbp2ppp/4pn2/1p2N3/2pPP3/P1P5/5PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQ - 6 10,? White retreats but probably not to the best place (too far).  He has lost the developing advantage and another pawn!
20,Nxe4,f6e4,rn1q1rk1/pbp2ppp/4p3/1p2N3/2pPn3/P1P5/5PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 0 11,Counter attack and re-develops his queen with a line on h7 - a possible early mate square.
21,Qc2,d1c2,rn1q1rk1/pbp2ppp/4p3/1p2N3/2pPn3/P1P5/2Q2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQ - 1 11,Counter attack and re-develops his queen with a line on h7 - a possible early mate square.
22,Bd5,b7d5,rn1q1rk1/p1p2ppp/4p3/1p1bN3/2pPn3/P1P5/2Q2PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ - 2 12,"Black takes more control of the centre now, despite white's more advanced pawn."
23,Nf3,e5f3,rn1q1rk1/p1p2ppp/4p3/1p1b4/2pPn3/P1P2N2/2Q2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQ - 3 12,? Why not develop another piece (eg black square bishop).  White was perhaps nervous now he is 2 pawns down.
24,c6,c7c6,rn1q1rk1/p4ppp/2p1p3/1p1b4/2pPn3/P1P2N2/2Q2PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ - 0 13,"Black's bishop is hemmed in, but this is ok as he is pawn supported and can't be attacked by a pawn."
25,h4,h2h4,rn1q1rk1/p4ppp/2p1p3/1p1b4/2pPn2P/P1P2N2/2Q2PP1/R1B1KB1R b KQ - 0 13,"White is going for an early mate.  His queen needs protection, eg by a Knight on g5, but this would need to be pawn supported due to his queen covering that square."
