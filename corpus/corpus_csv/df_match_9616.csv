1,b3,b2b3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I illustrate this game to emphasise- never give up. 
On move 26  I lost a bishop due to sloppy playing. After that I concentrated on attacking his king by advancing a pawn right up and by getting my queen and 2 rooks over. Sure, a player of 1700 rating would have seen through it, but for some of us whose rating hovers between 1550 and 1600 will enjoy this game.
(More entertainment than education )"
