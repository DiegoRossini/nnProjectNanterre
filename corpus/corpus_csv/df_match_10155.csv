White has several options available.  Evans Gambit (4. b4) and the Italian Gambit (4. d4) are aggressive options.  Guicco Pianissimo (4. d3) is a tender approach where both sides rely on middle-game creativity.  Main line (4. c3) prepares to control the center on d4."

One disadvantage in this move is that it weakens a relatively clumsy white c3 pawn.  Initially pushed in order to support the d pawn's march to d4, the c-pawn now has to protect the b-pawn from the black knight while receiving little protection itself (presuming that white wants to develop the queenside knight)."
