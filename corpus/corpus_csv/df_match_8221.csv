13,Bxf7+,c4f7,rn1qkb1r/pp2pBpp/8/2p3N1/4pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 7,White now has the initiative while black has the material advantage.  Blacks game will most likely transpire into a waiting game where he tries to trade down and keep his king safe.  Whites plan will be to force a minor piece attack and try to win back some of the lost material if not the game.

18,Qb6,d8b6,rn3b1r/pp2p1pp/1qk5/2p3N1/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 1 10,Qb6?! Qe8 is more likely better because Qb6 cuts off Kb6 a6 Ka7 trying to hide away.  This was an experiment I wanted to try out just waiting and keeping my queen away from the action to focus on defense.  Other possibilities are e6 trying for activation.  g7 which is an attempt to be very active trying to trade off quickly.  I wouldn't suggest Qb6 mostly because if white can get off Nc3 Nf7 Ne5+ the king and queen are going to get forked.

22,Kc7,c6c7,rn3br1/ppk1p1pp/1q6/2p1N3/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 5 12,e6 stops the fork for the moment but has a down side of giving white a passed pawn.  Kd8 or Qa6 are other options to look into but I kinda liked this one because it gave me some time.  Though probably not the best choice because that pawn will be very hard to stop.
23,Nc3,b1c3,rn3br1/ppk1p1pp/1q6/2p1N3/4pPB1/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 6 12,e6 stops the fork for the moment but has a down side of giving white a passed pawn.
