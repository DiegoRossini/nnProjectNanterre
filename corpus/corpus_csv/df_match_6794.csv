basically, I think that not following the main lines in openings is not so good - especially for low rated players. I think one should go with the rules that grater has seen and annotated before. In a game of low rated players it will be hard to prove ones strength in positional play when you go out of theory so early in the game."

6,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2pp4/3PP3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 4,I dont know the theory says here but it seems to me that d:e4 B:e4 Kf6 makes the Bishop move another move and that's 3 moves with the same piece in the early opening. that can't be good for white.
7,Bb5+,d3b5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/1Bpp4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 4,second move with the same piece. exd5 exd5 dxc5 Bxc5 and to play against the isolated pawn seems reasonable.
