1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This is a move I don't like. I'm not very familiar with the Sicilian and I often find myself in a tough spot when opponents use it... (It is intentional to say it out loud in this annotation... I want people to use it against me so I'll practice it and since then I got to play the Sicilian quite a few times)
