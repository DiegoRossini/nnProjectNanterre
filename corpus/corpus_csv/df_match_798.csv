5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2pP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"This is an odd move. It stops Bg5, but it felt unnecessary at this point. Black should get going with developing his minor pieces - he will be behind in development soon."
6,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/2pP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"This is an odd move. It stops Bg5, but it felt unnecessary at this point. Black should get going with developing his minor pieces - he will be behind in development soon."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/2pP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"This is an odd move. It stops Bg5, but it felt unnecessary at this point. Black should get going with developing his minor pieces - he will be behind in development soon."
8,h6,h7h6,rnbqkbnr/pp2ppp1/2p4p/8/2pP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"This is an odd move. It stops Bg5, but it felt unnecessary at this point. Black should get going with developing his minor pieces - he will be behind in development soon."
9,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pp2ppp1/2p4p/8/2pPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"I seize the centre while black has no pawns nor minor pieces control the central squares. Furthermore, this opens up a diagonal to c4 to win back the gambited pawn."
10,b5,b7b5,rnbqkbnr/p3ppp1/2p4p/1p6/2pPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"?! dubious. Black chooses to defend his pawn instead of staking a claim to the centre. Another move gone without developing a minor piece. If black does not play correctly now, he could easily find himself on the back foot."
11,h4,h2h4,rnbqkbnr/p3ppp1/2p4p/1p6/2pPP2P/2N2N2/PP3PP1/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"?! - I felt in an aggressive mood, and I thought I would get a pawn storm marching since black has not moved a single minor piece!"
12,a6,a7a6,rnbqkbnr/4ppp1/p1p4p/1p6/2pPP2P/2N2N2/PP3PP1/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"? - This is a truly terrible move in my opinion. Black already had a pawn supporting b5, and this closes the option of Na6. After 6 moves, black has still not moved any pieces! I probably would have considered Nf6 or even Bg4. Any ideas on the best course of action here for black?"
13,Ne5,f3e5,rnbqkbnr/4ppp1/p1p4p/1p2N3/2pPP2P/2N5/PP3PP1/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 7,"?! - the aggression continues. This targets the c6 pawn should black move his knight, and opens up paths for the f pawn to continue my planned pawn storm. This is probably not the best move in this position. However, it certainly is aggressive!"
14,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/5pp1/p1p1p2p/1p2N3/2pPP2P/2N5/PP3PP1/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,"Black blocks in his LSB, which now becomes a weak bishop. I assume he wanted to start developing kingside to castle and get out of danger. However, I already have a pawn storm brewing."
15,g4,g2g4,rnbqkbnr/5pp1/p1p1p2p/1p2N3/2pPP1PP/2N5/PP3P2/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,"! - Black chooses not to develop, so I continue the plan to rip away black's kingside defences and start an attack. I would give myself a slight edge at this point, considering black's lack of a single developed piece."
16,Nd7,b8d7,r1bqkbnr/3n1pp1/p1p1p2p/1p2N3/2pPP1PP/2N5/PP3P2/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 9,"Black loses his c6 pawn, but the pawn can be won back, and black can uncramp his position slightly. I didn't see the variation of black winning back the pawn."
17,Nxc6,e5c6,r1bqkbnr/3n1pp1/p1N1p2p/1p6/2pPP1PP/2N5/PP3P2/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 9,"Black regains his pawn and is not looking terrible at the moment, but not great either."
18,Qc7,d8c7,r1b1kbnr/2qn1pp1/p1N1p2p/1p6/2pPP1PP/2N5/PP3P2/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 10,"Black regains his pawn and is not looking terrible at the moment, but not great either."

24,Qc5,e5c5,r1b1kbnr/5pp1/p3p2p/1pq5/2p1PPPP/2N5/PP6/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 13,"I develop my bishop, eyeing a discovered attack on black's a8 rook. I'm considering kingside castling if I can drive away the queen at this point, but in retrospect, the kingside is terribly exposed if black can mount a counter challenge."
25,Bg2,f1g2,r1b1kbnr/5pp1/p3p2p/1pq5/2p1PPPP/2N5/PP4B1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 13,"I develop my bishop, eyeing a discovered attack on black's a8 rook.

27,Qe2,d1e2,2b1kbnr/r4pp1/p3p2p/1pq5/2p1PPPP/2N5/PP2Q1B1/R1B1K2R b KQk - 4 14,The aim here was to skewer queen and rook with Be3.
28,Rd7,a7d7,2b1kbnr/3r1pp1/p3p2p/1pq5/2p1PPPP/2N5/PP2Q1B1/R1B1K2R w KQk - 5 15,Black gets away and seizes the open file.

30,Qc7,c5c7,2b1kbnr/2qr1pp1/p3p2p/1p6/2p1PPPP/2N5/PP1BQ1B1/R3K2R w KQk - 7 16,Not sure what the point of this move is. Any thoughts?
31,O-O-O,e1c1,2b1kbnr/2qr1pp1/p3p2p/1p6/2p1PPPP/2N5/PP1BQ1B1/2KR3R b k - 8 16,Completing development while black still has 3 undeveloped minor pieces!
