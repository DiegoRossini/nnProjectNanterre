3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Not very enterprising. Most of the time d4 is played or Nc3.

6,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pp1p/3p2p1/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPPBPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,?! Nc6 is most of the time a must before doing the fianchietto. Now black is entering into a lot of complications.
7,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pp1p/3p2p1/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,?! cxd4 then Qxd4 lead to a lot of complications. I'm trying something different.
8,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk1nr/pp2ppbp/3p2p1/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 5,?! cxd4 then Qxd4 lead to a lot of complications. I'm trying something different.

10,dxc5,d6c5,rnbqk1nr/pp2ppbp/6p1/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,Qa5+ then Qxc5 could have been a solution to prevent the exchange of the queens. But I would have lost a lot of tempo.
11,Qxd8+,d1d8,rnbQk1nr/pp2ppbp/6p1/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 6,"Now white have a big advantage but he has everything to prove. Without the queens, the game turns into slow maneuvers like some variations of the berlin defense in the ruy. In this position, white have some tempo and black must quickly defend his position. The threats will come fast. I don't think that this opening is any good for black finally."
