1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,The game begins with a king pawn opening which can lead to early tactics.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Black replies with a Sicilian, an opening which creates the most opportunity to unbalance the game and offers black counter attacking chances."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,White responds with an out of sequence move. The usual move is 2.Nf3 which prepares the move d4.
4,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3pP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Black follows through with the normal response to d4 of ...cxd4, which in this case will draw attention to d4 until the black pawn is captured."
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"White continues with the out of sequence, main line move of Nf3 which prepares Nxd4, the next move in sequence from this point. Black can not successfully save the pawn due to the double attack on it presently."
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,"Black continues with a normal developing move. The intention is not to recapture as in [4.Nxd4 Nxd4  5.Qxd4]. The idea is to maintain central pressure of N vs N, and influence on e5 and d4. Another reason for not wanting to recapture with the knight is because is takes a tempo that is better spent on further development."
7,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,Black develops a pawn with tempo. White is forced to move the knight.
8,e5,e7e5,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n5/4p3/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,Black develops a pawn with tempo. White is forced to move the knight.
9,Nxc6,d4c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2N5/4p3/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,White makes the choice of exchanging knights instead of a retreat to f3. This move regains the tempo because black is forced to recapture the knight to maintain material and to remove the threat on the queen.
10,bxc6,b7c6,r1bqkbnr/p2p1ppp/2p5/4p3/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Capturing towards the center. This choice avoids an early exchange of queens which would put black at a disadvantage because the king is the only piece that could recapture, thus losing castling rights. A line for the c8 bishop is opened, and an ideal placement of ...Bb7 is considered for later."
11,a3,a2a3,r1bqkbnr/p2p1ppp/2p5/4p3/4P3/P7/1PP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"White plays to prevent ...Bb4 , but this move costs some development time. Better was [6.Bd3] to be followed by 0-0. If black plays [6...Bb4 ] then [7.Nc3] or [7.c3] will suffice."
12,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/p2p1ppp/2p2n2/4p3/4P3/P7/1PP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,Black develops with castling in mind. The move also attacks e4.
13,Bd3,f1d3,r1bqkb1r/p2p1ppp/2p2n2/4p3/4P3/P2B4/1PP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 7,White develops the bishop to protect the pawn and also prepare 0-0.
14,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/p2pbppp/2p2n2/4p3/4P3/P2B4/1PP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 3 8,"Black continues to develop in preparation for 0-0. The bishop is not developed to c5 where it is a target of b2-b4, and also not to d6 where it blocks the d7 pawn advance. The bishop also covers the knight in case of [8.Bg5]."
15,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqk2r/p2pbppp/2p2n2/4p1B1/4P3/P2B4/1PP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 4 8,"This is a move favored by Kasparov in some Sicilians. In this position it does not seem to offer much pressure due to the bishop and queen protection of the knight, but it could be used in an attempt to lure the move h7-h6, weakening the castle - although that move is not forced and the f6 knight can simply be moved to apply a counter attack on the g5 bishop."
16,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/p2pbppp/2p2n2/4p1B1/4P3/P2B4/1PP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQ - 5 9,Black has almost completed back rank development. The king is safe and all that is needed is to move the bishop and queen from the back rank at some point so the rooks will be tied. The position is about equal.
17,O-O,e1g1,r1bq1rk1/p2pbppp/2p2n2/4p1B1/4P3/P2B4/1PP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b - - 6 9,White also has just to develop the queen and knight from the back rank to complete back rank development.
18,a5,a7a5,r1bq1rk1/3pbppp/2p2n2/p3p1B1/4P3/P2B4/1PP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - - 0 10,"Black seeks to play positionally against queenside development, in which the move b2-b4 is expected. If [10.b4] then [10...axb4] and now [11.axb4 is not possible due to the unprotected rook at a1."
19,c4,c2c4,r1bq1rk1/3pbppp/2p2n2/p3p1B1/2P1P3/P2B4/1P3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b - - 0 10,White plays against the center while black is playing against the flank. The key square of focus is d5.
20,Bb7,c8b7,r2q1rk1/1b1pbppp/2p2n2/p3p1B1/2P1P3/P2B4/1P3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - - 1 11,Black develops the bishop from the back rank in a diagonal that targets d5.
21,f4,f2f4,r2q1rk1/1b1pbppp/2p2n2/p3p1B1/2P1PP2/P2B4/1P4PP/RN1Q1RK1 b - - 0 11,White switches to a kingside flank attack on the unprotected e5 pawn. If no pawn exchange occurs then f4-f5 will be uncomfortable for black as it seeks to cut off the black pieces from the king side of the board.
