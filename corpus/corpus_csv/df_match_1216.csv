1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"My opponent starts with d4, so I expect a more positional response to my opening."
2,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,This is my way of entering Philidor's Defense without the annoying Bc4 variations.  I will play Nf6 in response to the move e4.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Instead of e4, my opponent goes with a more positional option.  He reserves the opportunity to move the e pawn to e3 or e4."
4,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2pp4/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Another part of my opening setup, allowing the queen to go to c7 and guarding the d5 square."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2pp4/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,Continuing his development and targeting both e4 and d5.
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2pp1n2/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,I respond with the same idea.  It is still possible for him to play e4 if he wants to.
7,g3,g2g3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2pp1n2/8/2PP4/2N3P1/PP2PP1P/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"Instead he opts to fianchetto the bishop.  This doesn't seem to me like the best setup against a pawn on c6 and a queen on c7, but maybe he counted on pressure on the long diagonal."
8,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bqkb1r/pp1npppp/2pp1n2/8/2PP4/2N3P1/PP2PP1P/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,I continue to prepare for an e5 push.
9,Bg2,f1g2,r1bqkb1r/pp1npppp/2pp1n2/8/2PP4/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 2 5,"He completes the fianchetto, and looks ready to castle on the kingside."
10,e5,e7e5,r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2pp1n2/4p3/2PP4/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,"The e5 break is finally here, and it is up to white whether to exchange the pawn or let it remain there."
11,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2pp1n2/4p3/2PP4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,White adds pressure to e5 and is ready to castle.
12,Qc7,d8c7,r1b1kb1r/ppqn1ppp/2pp1n2/4p3/2PP4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 7,I add defense to e5 and have the queen well placed to guard c6 as well.
13,O-O,e1g1,r1b1kb1r/ppqn1ppp/2pp1n2/4p3/2PP4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 3 7,White castles and retains a slight lead in development.
14,a5,a7a5,r1b1kb1r/1pqn1ppp/2pp1n2/p3p3/2PP4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,"I was concerned about a b4 push and a queenside attack on the c6 pawn.  This move is thematic in this opening, but it is not always good as it leaves a hole on b6 that can be reached by the c3 knight via a4."
15,b3,b2b3,r1b1kb1r/1pqn1ppp/2pp1n2/p3p3/2PP4/1PN2NP1/P3PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,Preparing a queenside fianchetto and possibly preparing a queenside advance.
16,g6,g7g6,r1b1kb1r/1pqn1p1p/2pp1np1/p3p3/2PP4/1PN2NP1/P3PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 9,"This move is a bit unusual for my system, as the bishop usually goes on e7.  But I felt that it would be stronger on g7 to counter his fianchetto."
17,Bb2,c1b2,r1b1kb1r/1pqn1p1p/2pp1np1/p3p3/2PP4/1PN2NP1/PB2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 1 9,He completes his fianchetto.
18,Bg7,f8g7,r1b1k2r/1pqn1pbp/2pp1np1/p3p3/2PP4/1PN2NP1/PB2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 2 10,And so do I.
19,e3,e2e3,r1b1k2r/1pqn1pbp/2pp1np1/p3p3/2PP4/1PN1PNP1/PB3PBP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 10,This secures the d4 pawn and frees up white's queen.
20,O-O,e8g8,r1b2rk1/1pqn1pbp/2pp1np1/p3p3/2PP4/1PN1PNP1/PB3PBP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 1 11,I take the opportunity to castle.  Development is about even except for my c8 bishop which is trapped at the moment.
