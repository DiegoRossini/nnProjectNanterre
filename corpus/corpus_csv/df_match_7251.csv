9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 5,"Curiously, the world DB recommends 5. c3 even though Black has not attacked the pawn. Presumably the reasoning is that the move will have to be played sooner or later anyway. In any case, the next two moves by each side are obvious, and we reach the same position regardless of the order they are played in."

If White exchanges on f6, the bishop will be poorly placed whichever capture Black chooses; and if the intention behind this move was to avoid gxf6, then surely Black ought to be glad of the chance to add a rook on a half-open file to his accumulating pressure on White's kingside? However, Black's subsequent play reveals that this move was part of a consistent plan."
