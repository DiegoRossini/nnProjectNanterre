But White opts for a different approach and just as in the Ruy Lopez, White pins my Knight to my King with one small difference..."
16,O-O-O,e8c8,2kr1b1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/qB5b/3P4/2N2N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R w KQ - 5 9,The LSB and Queen are not in the way so I opt to castle Queen-side and prepare for a pawnstorm once White eventually castles King-side.
17,Bxc6,b5c6,2kr1b1r/ppp1pppp/2B2n2/q6b/3P4/2N2N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 9,"White takes the Knight and in doing so, disrupts my pawn structure protecting my King. Although White surrenders the bishop pair in doing so."

22,Nd7,f6d7,2kr1b1r/p1pnpppp/2p3b1/q7/3P2P1/2N2N1P/PPP2P2/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 3 12,A defensive measure hindering Ne5

29,a3,a2a3,2kr1b1r/p1pn1pp1/2p1p1b1/q7/3P2P1/P1N2N2/1PP1QP2/1RB2RK1 b - - 0 15,"This is where the game starts to get interesting, who's plan will come to fruition first? With a3 White prepares for b4 attacking the Black Queen while at the same time starting his pawnstorm.

I feel that Bf4 was probably the best move here, it would have hindered Bd6(which leads to an eventual checkmate)."
30,Bd6,f8d6,2kr3r/p1pn1pp1/2pbp1b1/q7/3P2P1/P1N2N2/1PP1QP2/1RB2RK1 w - - 1 16,With this I align another piece towards the King-side. After this move with the h8 rook already aiming down the h file hindering the White King's movement  I get the first inklings of a brilliant combination.
