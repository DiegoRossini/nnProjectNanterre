1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Here is a game which ended in a Low Draw for Yours Truly.  I got greedy in the middlegame with some pawn grabbing that backfired on me.  Under normal circumstances, 3 pawns for the piece is enough compo. and indeed the material count is zero.  However, if the extra piece is a bishop and there is a pair of them, and you have a knight, then heaven help you!  I found myself in that very position and thankfully Heaven did save me 10 rating points but boy it was a struggle.  So how did all this happen? Well, read on ......."
