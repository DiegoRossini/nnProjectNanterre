Your Comments upon my games are always welcome. Or Questions, if I can answer them. But if I can't, then that's Interesting ... & I'll probably learn something then~!

BTW 2 days after, I find there are still admissions to be made. Things I didnt see then and not decided on now. But he has some good moves. Probably I do to. I hope someone points them out quick, so i can just say ... yes I missed that one ...and that one. But its okay, I can take it. (Don't tell anyone this, but I've missed things Before! So I know I can live thru it. That is also the wonderful thing about a terrible loss. To paraphrase Neitche and add my own interpretation, ""If it does not kill you it only makes you Stronger"" ... if it does not also make you a bit crazy in the end, as they've said of Mr N :)) It has also been said, ""Let me entertain you"", Shirley Temple."
