1,g4,g2g4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/6P1/8/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The Grob Opening. Coincidentally I had just about finished ""King's Gambit: The Story of a Father, a Son and the World's Most Dangerous Game"" By Paul Hoffman. Hoffman spent an entire chapter on the practitioners of the Grob and had some unsavory opinions of them. Swindlers would be a common theme. So I was hot to beat this guy."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/6P1/8/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Reinforcing the pawn. A weak move in retrospect. c6 appears better now. I as a practitioner of the Nimzo Larsen am aware that his goal is to fianchetto the rook on a8 (at least for now later I forget this) so delaying the attack on d5 is what I need to do.
