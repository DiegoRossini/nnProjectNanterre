1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,These moves are just standard. Nothing really special about them.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,These moves are just standard. Nothing really special about them.
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 2,"A bit of a mistake on my opponents part. This move allows me to develop my Queen's Pawn without disruptions, also blocking out the opponents e-pawn. Better would be 2.c4, which stalls development for black and increases development speed for white, or 2.Nf3, which does not block the c-pawn from advancing, but still develops a knight."
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Reverse Giuoco Piano is my name for this, but I think this transposed into a Blackmar-Diemer Gambit."
5,Bf4,c1f4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P1B2/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"Reverse Giuoco Piano is my name for this, but I think this transposed into a Blackmar-Diemer Gambit."
6,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p1b2/3P1B2/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"Reverse Giuoco Piano is my name for this, but I think this transposed into a Blackmar-Diemer Gambit."
7,h3,h2h3,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p1b2/3P1B2/2N4P/PPP1PPP1/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"I think this move is pretty pointless, unless they want to try and drive my bishop away with g4, which isn't really a good idea. Also, I probably would have never moved my bishop to g4 anyways."
8,e6,e7e6,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p1b2/3P1B2/2N4P/PPP1PPP1/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,Continuing with basic development.
9,a3,a2a3,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p1b2/3P1B2/P1N4P/1PP1PPP1/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"I was planning to do 5...Bb4, but I guess this move stops it. Either 5...Nc6 or 5...Bd6 are good as Nc6 adds development and also make enables e5 if my opponent chooses not to take the Bishop when I move it to d6. Bd6 is more rushed and has a slightly worse line, but can gain development faster."
10,Nc6,b8c6,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/3p1b2/3P1B2/P1N4P/1PP1PPP1/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,I decide to do Nc6 because it has more options in the long run. It also frees up more options with Bd6.
11,Nf3,g1f3,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/3p1b2/3P1B2/P1N2N1P/1PP1PPP1/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 2 6,Development.
12,Bd6,f8d6,r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2nbpn2/3p1b2/3P1B2/P1N2N1P/1PP1PPP1/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 3 7,"This bishop is basically useless now, considering the only other place my dsb can go other than d6 is e7, which is absolutely useless, because Be7 would do absolutely nothing. So, Why not exchange it? It also lets my queen free through the c-file. Plus, his dsb is really annoying me for some reason."
13,Bxd6,f4d6,r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2nBpn2/3p1b2/3P4/P1N2N1P/1PP1PPP1/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"Personally, I think this move should have been played earlier. He could try 9. Bd3, with a attempt to mimic me, but I have a pawn on e6 protecting my bishop, so I have no need to capture."
14,cxd6,c7d6,r2qk2r/pp3ppp/2nppn2/3p1b2/3P4/P1N2N1P/1PP1PPP1/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,"Personally, I think this move should have been played earlier. He could try 9. Bd3, with a attempt to mimic me, but I have a pawn on e6 protecting my bishop, so I have no need to capture."
15,e3,e2e3,r2qk2r/pp3ppp/2nppn2/3p1b2/3P4/P1N1PN1P/1PP2PP1/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,"Personally, I think this move should have been played earlier. He could try 9. Bd3, with a attempt to mimic me, but I have a pawn on e6 protecting my bishop, so I have no need to capture."
16,O-O,e8g8,r2q1rk1/pp3ppp/2nppn2/3p1b2/3P4/P1N1PN1P/1PP2PP1/R2QKB1R w KQ - 1 9,I am practically done with development.
17,Bb5,f1b5,r2q1rk1/pp3ppp/2nppn2/1B1p1b2/3P4/P1N1PN1P/1PP2PP1/R2QK2R b KQ - 2 9,What was the point of this move? It does absolutely nothing!
18,Ne4,f6e4,r2q1rk1/pp3ppp/2npp3/1B1p1b2/3Pn3/P1N1PN1P/1PP2PP1/R2QK2R w KQ - 3 10,"You see, if the opponent takes with his knight, then I take back, there is the threat of 11... Qa5+, which forks the bishop and king."
19,Nxe4,c3e4,r2q1rk1/pp3ppp/2npp3/1B1p1b2/3PN3/P3PN1P/1PP2PP1/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 10,"Not sure if Bxe4 is better, it probably was."
20,dxe4,d5e4,r2q1rk1/pp3ppp/2npp3/1B3b2/3Pp3/P3PN1P/1PP2PP1/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 11,"Not sure if Bxe4 is better, it probably was."
21,Nd2,f3d2,r2q1rk1/pp3ppp/2npp3/1B3b2/3Pp3/P3P2P/1PPN1PP1/R2QK2R b KQ - 1 11,"This is necessary, blocking Qa5+."
22,Qg5,d8g5,r4rk1/pp3ppp/2npp3/1B3bq1/3Pp3/P3P2P/1PPN1PP1/R2QK2R w KQ - 2 12,Threatening to rip apart white's kingside.
23,g4,g2g4,r4rk1/pp3ppp/2npp3/1B3bq1/3Pp1P1/P3P2P/1PPN1P2/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 12,"Umm... g3 is better, right? Well, I wanted to see Rg1(?!). I haven't figured out all the lines with Rg1, but, I think its the worst of the 3 listed moves."
24,Bxg4,f5g4,r4rk1/pp3ppp/2npp3/1B4q1/3Pp1b1/P3P2P/1PPN1P2/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 13,"First time you see this, you see a blunder. Looking at it again, you see black has snagged a extra pawn. (Qxg4/hxg4, Qxb5!)"
25,Qxg4,d1g4,r4rk1/pp3ppp/2npp3/1B4q1/3Pp1Q1/P3P2P/1PPN1P2/R3K2R b KQ - 0 13,"Was hxg4 better? NO! This way, White can create a higher threat with this, and also, the White queen would be trapped in."
26,Qxb5,g5b5,r4rk1/pp3ppp/2npp3/1q6/3Pp1Q1/P3P2P/1PPN1P2/R3K2R w KQ - 0 14,"Right or Wrong time to castle? Both. White can create a stronger attack now, but white can also be attacked with more force. It's more of a bad time to castle, because the queen can be driven back now and deprived of the move Qxe4."
27,O-O-O,e1c1,r4rk1/pp3ppp/2npp3/1q6/3Pp1Q1/P3P2P/1PPN1P2/2KR3R b - - 1 14,"Right or Wrong time to castle? Both. White can create a stronger attack now, but white can also be attacked with more force. It's more of a bad time to castle, because the queen can be driven back now and deprived of the move Qxe4."
