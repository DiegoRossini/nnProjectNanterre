1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Ethan's typically been rated in the high 1700s/low 1800s...
2,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"While tag's been between 1400 and 1550 for most of that time.  However, his rating topped 1700 for the first time recently, and was 1712 at the start of this game.

This is also the first time I've ever played 1. e4 against him and he *hasn't* responded 1... d5.  Interesting."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"If he's content to play on the flanks, I'm simply going to take over the center."
4,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"And if I can grab an even bigger center, why not?  More space and more board control leads to more chances later in the game."

6,b6,b7b6,rnbqk1nr/p1ppppbp/1p4p1/8/2PPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Playing for the double fianchetto?!  I'll take the great classical position any day.
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk1nr/p1ppppbp/1p4p1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,"So black's got his bishops in the towers like snipers.  His position is looking cramped, but with lots of counterattacking possibilities.

At this point, I start thinking about the Saemisch Variation of the King's Indian.  Black has the extra disadvantage of having played b6 and Bb7, so if I can shore my king away on the queenside, point my pieces at the kingside and eventually advance the g- and h-pawns, I'll have a great attack going!  I'm hoping he complies."

10,d6,d7d6,rn1qk1nr/pbp1ppbp/1p1p2p1/8/2PPP3/2N1B3/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"...and now I see the problem with fianchettoing both bishops!  Normally, whichever center pawn you advance first also opens a line for a bishop on its home square.  Having already spent 4 moves working on the bishops, this move lacks some of its usual punch."
11,Bd3,f1d3,rn1qk1nr/pbp1ppbp/1p1p2p1/8/2PPP3/2NBB3/PP3PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 1 6,Continuing to control the center and point at the kingside.
12,Nd7,b8d7,r2qk1nr/pbpnppbp/1p1p2p1/8/2PPP3/2NBB3/PP3PPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 2 7,"Seems like it justifies d6, but this is still slow and passive.  Black will have a difficult time finding good squares for his pieces on a board like this."
13,Nge2,g1e2,r2qk1nr/pbpnppbp/1p1p2p1/8/2PPP3/2NBB3/PP2NPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 3 7,"Nf3 was tempting, I'm not going to lie.  But Nge2 also allows for f3 followed by g4 down the road, which looks great for a kingside storm."
14,Ngf6,g8f6,r2qk2r/pbpnppbp/1p1p1np1/8/2PPP3/2NBB3/PP2NPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 4 8,"Of course.  Now, 0-0 is tempting (and probably recommended), but why do that?  Black's probably going to castle kingside and that's where my pieces are poised to go after him.  Why not just..."
15,f3,f2f3,r2qk2r/pbpnppbp/1p1p1np1/8/2PPP3/2NBBP2/PP2N1PP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 8,"Play f3.  It shores up e4, frees up the Nc3 and the Bd3 to move if necessary, and supports a future g4."
16,O-O,e8g8,r2q1rk1/pbpnppbp/1p1p1np1/8/2PPP3/2NBBP2/PP2N1PP/R2QK2R w KQ - 1 9,"?!  I'm not saying it isn't defensible or reasonable, but with a view to what happens later, it's hard to say this move is very good."
17,Qd2,d1d2,r2q1rk1/pbpnppbp/1p1p1np1/8/2PPP3/2NBBP2/PP1QN1PP/R3K2R b KQ - 2 9,"On the other hand, things are starting to look easy for white.  White's plan is clear: point your pieces at the black king, play 0-0-0, push the pawns up the g- and h-files, bust open the defenses, and checkmate that king.  

Qd2 helps nicely, as the queen defends all the minor pieces, clears the way for 0-0-0, and forms a great battery along the c1-h6 diagonal."
18,Re8,f8e8,r2qr1k1/pbpnppbp/1p1p1np1/8/2PPP3/2NBBP2/PP1QN1PP/R3K2R w KQ - 3 10,"I start to think, now.  Black must see the kingside attack coming.  He must know the only hope is a counterattack, either on the queenside or in the center.  So I start thinking what I'll do if black plays e5 next, or possibly c5..."
19,O-O-O,e1c1,r2qr1k1/pbpnppbp/1p1p1np1/8/2PPP3/2NBBP2/PP1QN1PP/2KR3R b - - 4 10,"And I conclude that this will be a good move no matter what.  The rooks are connected, the king is relatively safe, and I'm ready to push those pawns.  The rest will have to be a balance of offense and defense..."
20,e6,e7e6,r2qr1k1/pbpn1pbp/1p1ppnp1/8/2PPP3/2NBBP2/PP1QN1PP/2KR3R w - - 0 11,"?!  This was unexpected.  Rather than challenging white in the center, black steps tentatively.  Is he preparing to play d5?  And if he plays d5, would I be better served by responding e5 or cxd5?

Either way, I already have a great plan..."
21,h4,h2h4,r2qr1k1/pbpn1pbp/1p1ppnp1/8/2PPP2P/2NBBP2/PP1QN1P1/2KR3R b - - 0 11,"Of course.  Rdg1 looks pretty good, as does g4.  In hindsight, g4 may have been a little better, because h5 wouldn't be quite the same in that instance."
22,Qe7,d8e7,r3r1k1/pbpnqpbp/1p1ppnp1/8/2PPP2P/2NBBP2/PP1QN1P1/2KR3R w - - 1 12,"But black plays Qe7, the only move other than d5 that's really consistent with 12. e6."
23,g4,g2g4,r3r1k1/pbpnqpbp/1p1ppnp1/8/2PPP1PP/2NBBP2/PP1QN3/2KR3R b - - 0 12,"Now, we're in business.  White's attack looks like it's coming fast and furious (and it's only move 12)!  Why can't I play this well all the time?"
