1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The following is an interesting encounter in the Queen's Indian. White abandons his natural central play (e3-e4) to contest Black along the a1-h8 diagonal. This is a clear instance of White becoming too ""caught up"" with one-move attacks and countering Black's plans while losing sight of his own ideas."

This allows Black a free hand to develop (again, he has more space to maneuver his pieces)."

9,g3,g2g3,rnbqkb1r/p2p1ppp/1p2pn2/2p5/2PP4/4PNP1/PP3P1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"'?' - Now White's passivity is becoming an issue. His bishop would have been well-positioned on d3 (the best move), where it immediately eyes e4 and gives White attacking possibilities. The decision to fianchetto contests Black along the long diagonal, but it creates massive light-square weaknesses around his kingside. If White loses his light-square bishop, this formation will be especially weak. This plan is also slow."

If the knights don't accomplish anything concrete or establish more permanent outposts (specifically the b5 knight), they will lose a tempo in retreat, which may allow Black to improve his position with tempo. Also, shouldn't White be worrying about his c1 bishop, which is blockaded by pawns? It seems White has abandoned the natural, freeing plan of e3-e4 (supported by pieces), in favor of this (dubious) knight-harassment scheme. A better plan is cxd4 followed by Re1, aiming at e3-e4."
