But white's knight on a8 is remote, and might get trapped after moves like Nd7 or Bc5, or, in some lines, after the simple b5. The bishop on e3 is also a problem. on the other hand, Black's king is in the centre and the presence of the white pawn on f6  make it dificult to develop and coordinate the pieces. on a more ""long term"" perspective, the nice pawn centre might fall, togheter with the f6 pawn, leading to a drawish engame. 
White has the plan to head for the draw as soon as possible, before Black clears a way for his king. The theme idea is to capture in d4, using the lack of squares of the opponent king, for instance: 18. Bd4 ed4 19. Rd4 Nd7 (forced, Re8 Nc7 # Rc8 Bh3) 20. Bh3 Bc6 21. Nb6. The problem is now, however, 21. Bc5, and Black is winning. Since White could not see a way to make this work (although THERE IS ONE!) he decides to try and better his chances by playing an intermediate move, that seems to lead to an even more forced and beautiful draw, involving, as we will see, the same idea. 
Now let us torn to the position after the sacrifice, to show the missed continuation that would have lead to complete equality. After 18. Bd4 ed4 19. Rd4 Nd7 20. Bh3 Bc6 white has 21. b4!
