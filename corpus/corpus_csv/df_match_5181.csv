1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Second clash against Joanne. Soon, as usual, we fall into tactics, with surprises and tricks jumping out form any corner. To me, to have fun with chess means to enter into wild tactic positions. In on-the-board games, I'm far too poor at it. With time to analyze, I get often so overwhelmed with possibile lines that I can spend days on them. My work don't allow me to do it. Even so, my question is: ""How to manage complex situations like this one?"" Which is the right pattern to follow? I remember what Bent Larsen said in his book about Korchnoi - Karpov's match: Korchnoi loses so much time looking for incredibly deep combinations that, sometime, just don't exist at all. That's why he fells for time trouble so often""."
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Not the more usual answer. The good thing about this is that opens the way for the queen to b6, that is normally a good move against the scheme I am used to play. I have to be ready to defend b2."
3,c3,c2c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3P4/2P5/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"This is the normal move for the scheme I play. I can defend b2 with both Qc2 or Qb3. Of course c4 is good, but it is overplayed and overstudied. I want to shield my queenside in order to proceed with an attack on the kingside. 
I know it is too soon for a plan, but this is the way I play."
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3P4/2P5/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Normal.
5,Bf4,c1f4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3P1B2/2P5/PP2PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"Now that b2 is not a concern, I can go for my favorite line. I could have played Nf3 first, but this assures me the best place for my bishop."
6,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p1b2/3P1B2/2P5/PP2PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,Now I laughted. So we are playing for simmetry... aren't we?
7,e3,e2e3,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p1b2/3P1B2/2P1P3/PP3PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"I was so tempted to try the sideline f3!?, with an inmediate g4 etc. advance, but it really makes difficult for me to develop my kinside. Let's be serious..."
8,Nf6,g8f6,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p1b2/3P1B2/2P1P3/PP3PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"Ah, well, so now I go for Nf3 and it is still symmetry. By the time, I spent a lot wondering about BxN, Qb3 and Qa4... or combinations of there ones, but nothing catched my eye."
9,f3,f2f3,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p1b2/3P1B2/2P1PP2/PP4PP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"So I decided to go for the ""weird one"", against my previous idea. Let's start thinking. This advance is against my way of playing, which keeps open the white diagonal for the queen or bishop (after Be2). But it was obvious I couldn't go for ""my"" usual piece settings, and I had to go for something ""better"" (?). This is an experiment..."
10,e6,e7e6,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p1b2/3P1B2/2P1PP2/PP4PP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"I would have played h5, being black. Jo is more conservative. And my f3 move does mean I don't have my knight on f3, so if she plays ""normally"", I will just be inferior. I ""have"" to demostrate f3 had a purpose."
11,g4,g2g4,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p1b2/3P1BP1/2P1PP2/PP5P/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,"Well aware of the offside of this. Nxg4, fxNg4 and Qh4+, Bxg4. Did Jo give it some consideration? It is too much a ""daring"" move? Opinions welcomed! :-)"
12,Bg6,f5g6,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pnb1/3p4/3P1BP1/2P1PP2/PP5P/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 1 7,"Trying to save the bishop normally provides me with a ready-made pawn storm. But it is dangerous, because I am not developed."
13,h4,h2h4,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pnb1/3p4/3P1BPP/2P1PP2/PP6/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 7,"This is not much of a threat, it is to stop any idea of Qh4 check, that is usually deadly for white. But it makes black think about h6 or h5. Jo went for another surprising idea."
14,Bxb1,g6b1,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/3P1BPP/2P1PP2/PP6/Rb1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 8,"Oh my! So she gambled me! Never, no one had taken the knight before (in a similar position)!
So the first hard choice. My idea is to castle queenside, so RxB seems to leave my king wihtout a cave to hide in. On the other side, my plan is to control the white squares, and my queen is not doing much at the time, blocked by my own pawns. So, once again, I'll try to be coherent with my original idea."
15,Qxb1,d1b1,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/3P1BPP/2P1PP2/PP6/RQ2KBNR b KQkq - 0 8,"I didn't fear Qa5 or Qb6 anymore. The black's best move, in my opinion, is c5."
16,Bd6,f8d6,rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/2pbpn2/3p4/3P1BPP/2P1PP2/PP6/RQ2KBNR w KQkq - 1 9,"Now my ""regular"" Ne5 is not possible. Of course, not BxB, since I have a hole in g3, and f4 is not possible due to Nxg4. The normal one, Ne2, keeps my lsb trapped. Nh3 was the move, but..."
17,Bd3,f1d3,rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/2pbpn2/3p4/3P1BPP/2PBPP2/PP6/RQ2K1NR b KQkq - 2 9,"I told I wanted to take advantage from the white squares, so I have to build my pressure over them. If Nh3, BxB, NxB, and my knight is doing nothing over there."
18,Bxf4,d6f4,rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/3P1bPP/2PBPP2/PP6/RQ2K1NR w KQkq - 0 10,"This way, a kinside pawnstorm is set. Of course, I didn't expect this to make me win. In fact, I have the horrible feeling that I will lose this :-)))"
19,exf4,e3f4,rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/3P1PPP/2PB1P2/PP6/RQ2K1NR b KQkq - 0 10,"This way, a kinside pawnstorm is set. Of course, I didn't expect this to make me win. In fact, I have the horrible feeling that I will lose this :-)))"
20,h6,h7h6,rn1qk2r/pp3pp1/2p1pn1p/3p4/3P1PPP/2PB1P2/PP6/RQ2K1NR w KQkq - 0 11,"This, now, appears to be too much ""fearing"" my attack. It doesn't help to prevent g5, since I can retake with f4. But I won't do it anyway, not while the black knight can jump to h4, for instance. Anyway, this also opened me ideas of some Bg6 sac, but it is not enough, so I stopped my hand. I should have gone for developement in sight of a possible o-o-o. But..."
21,f5,f4f5,rn1qk2r/pp3pp1/2p1pn1p/3p1P2/3P2PP/2PB1P2/PP6/RQ2K1NR b KQkq - 0 11,"Let's go for the white squares, then. Too soon, I know. I keep telling Jo she is not enough aggressive, but I am too much of it. But it seemed to me that if I allowed black to develop, I would be lost - my king is trapped in an open middle."
