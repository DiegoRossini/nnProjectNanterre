Out of about 3,000 games in the World DB, for white's 3rd move he chooses one that has only been played 37 times but seems to give the best game to white, according to that DB. And he's way out of my book and also out of my references, so I guess we're just in some obscure line of the Reti, English Variation. I follow the DB's advice and pick the only move that plays better for black, also the move that the highest rated GMs chose, taking a piece of the center without losing a pawn on e5 or inviting exchanges on d5."
