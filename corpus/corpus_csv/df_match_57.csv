24,Be7,f8e7,1r2k2r/2pqbppp/p2p1n2/2p2P2/8/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B1R1K1 w k - 5 13,Black wants to castle but that would leave the bishop on e7 vulnerable.  The pawn on f5 is defended indirectly because the capture on e7 would be mate and white also can now take the pawn on a6.

26,Ng8,f6g8,1r2k1nr/2pqbppp/p2p4/2p2P2/8/2N5/PPP1QPPP/R1B1R1K1 w k - 7 14,Black perhaps wants to take on f5 and he also wants to increase the protection for the bishop on e7.  However 14. Nd5 keeps the pressure up.
27,Nd5,c3d5,1r2k1nr/2pqbppp/p2p4/2pN1P2/8/8/PPP1QPPP/R1B1R1K1 b k - 8 14,Black perhaps wants to take on f5 and he also wants to increase the protection for the bishop on e7.  However 14. Nd5 keeps the pressure up.
28,c6,c7c6,1r2k1nr/3qbppp/p1pp4/2pN1P2/8/8/PPP1QPPP/R1B1R1K1 w k - 0 15,If the rook were on a7 this move would have solved all his problems earlier.  But hindsight is always wonderful.
29,Nxe7,d5e7,1r2k1nr/3qNppp/p1pp4/2p2P2/8/8/PPP1QPPP/R1B1R1K1 b k - 0 15,Taking with the queen allows 16. Qd1 (or Qd2) winning the queen for a rook so he has to recapture with the knight.
30,Nxe7,g8e7,1r2k2r/3qnppp/p1pp4/2p2P2/8/8/PPP1QPPP/R1B1R1K1 w k - 0 16,Taking with the queen allows 16. Qd1 (or Qd2) winning the queen for a rook so he has to recapture with the knight.
31,f6,f5f6,1r2k2r/3qnppp/p1pp1P2/2p5/8/8/PPP1QPPP/R1B1R1K1 b k - 0 16,This is obvious.  By threatening the pinned knight black must take and give up any hopes of a safe castled position.
32,gxf6,g7f6,1r2k2r/3qnp1p/p1pp1p2/2p5/8/8/PPP1QPPP/R1B1R1K1 w k - 0 17,White could take on a6 but keeping the pressure on e7 and focusing the bishop on f6 is the priority.

At first I thought black might trying to start a king side attack, but actually he wants to protect his f pawn and get out of the potential fork."

39,Rad1,a1d1,1r1k2nr/3q1p2/Q1pp1p2/2p4p/8/1P6/PBP2PPP/3RR1K1 b - - 1 20,Closing off the bishop's diagonal is a good idea.  I think he should have played this a move earlier.

41,Qa4,a6a4,1r1k2nr/3q1p2/2p2p2/2pp3p/Q7/1P6/PBP2PPP/3RR1K1 b - - 1 21,"This indirectly prevents d4 since 21. ..., d4, 22, Bxd4, c5xBd4, 23. Rxd4  pins the queen to the king and wins the queen and two pawns for the bishop and rook."
