22,Qa5,d8a5,2r2rk1/pp1bppbp/2np1np1/q7/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPPQB1PP/2KR3R w - - 9 12,? This is the first mistake of the game.  Re8 would have been better here.  Which keeps the dragon bishop on g7.  This allows whites knight to come to d4 with tempo.

The reason for this move is because I don't want f4 to come with tempo.  I had a plan for Bxd2 Rc7 seems better for white as he has the chance to play f4 in the future.

However black can play against it I had d5 in mind so I played it here as well since it is the only move that seems to give black any activity.  I think white would have been better with Re1.
