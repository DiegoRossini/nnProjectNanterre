1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,e5 is a nice starting move.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I play this move not only because it is my favorite, but because zeque probably sees more ...e5 than anything else."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,This move develops the piece to the logical spot and protects e4.
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"Standard Sicilian development, this protects e5, opens lines."
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,Opening up lines for white's dark bishop and queen.  Offers up trade of pawns which will result in white gaining a temporary advantage in the center.
6,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,Playing back at the lone pawn and developing at the same time.

This move is a mistake.  Why not protect it with your knight?  When you develop your Nb1 to c3 it will be protecting the pawn, accomplishing 2 things with one move.  By using your bishop, you reduce the potential of that piece which should be attacking the black pieces.  For some time, the bishop will be dedicated to that pawn.  Later, you will move the knight out to c3 and be able to reposition the bishop to another square, in which event you have wasted one move.

Additionally, the knight on d4 is now undefended.  This becomes a problem later in the game.

Zeque said he was in a hurry to castle and this move supports that.  True, but what is the rush?  Especially in a game like this, castling queenside may be a good idea."
10,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p1np1/8/3NP3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"This move decides that black's dark bishop will fianchetto kingside and own the a1-h8 diagonal.

This move may create dicey scenarios if white decides to castle queenside and pawnstorm the kingside, but by appearances, white wants to castle kingside."
11,O-O,e1g1,rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p1np1/8/3NP3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 6,"Now the knight develops and protects the e-pawn, freeing the bishop."
12,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/3NP3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 7,"Now the knight develops and protects the e-pawn, freeing the bishop."

14,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/3NP3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 4 8,"Maybe kind of early to make this move.  Yes, the rook is more ""active"" on the e-file, but there is not much use to this right now.  The only thing this gets going is backup to pushing the e-pawn to e5, but to do that requires repositioning the knight to f3 first.  The knight at d4 is still undefended."

17,Be3,c1e3,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/3NP3/2NBB3/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 b - - 7 9,"Again a bishop is brought out to defend a piece in the middle.  Better moves are Nf3, Nxc6.....Nf3 probably the best."
18,Ng4,f6g4,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np2p1/8/3NP1n1/2NBB3/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 w - - 8 10,"Now white is forced to make a key decision.  The knight is attacked twice and defended once.  The black knight on g4 is attacking the lone defender of the white knigh on d4.  Trading knights is probably the best move:
10. NxN  PxN"

With this move, white either loses material or has a messed up pawn structure after NxB."

Should have been PxN, where just a pawn will be lost."

There is now a threat of losing some positional advantage if black goes BxN, where white has to recapture PxB and white's pawns are doubled and disconnected."

The move here is to advance queenside attack and limit the white bishop and knight, preparing to move b5, also opening up the long diagonal to put the white bishop in play."
