1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"GM Mihai Suba is an excellent GM who's played a lot of strange ideas, and frequently pulls out oddly spectacular victories.  In this game he takes black against GM Raicevic.  He begins the game with a speculative gambit and quickly gains a developmental advantage.  His pieces find ingenious ways to march forward, and he wins in nice style.  I recommend flipping the board as Suba plays black and having a board at your side while watching this so that you can analyze variations."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Suba played the English as white to great success.  While most of his finds are for white, this is a great game against his favorite first move.  I'm going to skim over the opening."
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,Normally this move seems a little weak as the pawn will (and does in this game) grow weak on e4.  However Suba is prepared to give up the pawn.
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,Normally this move seems a little weak as the pawn will (and does in this game) grow weak on e4.  However Suba is prepared to give up the pawn.
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2P5/2N2N2/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 3,Normally this move seems a little weak as the pawn will (and does in this game) grow weak on e4.  However Suba is prepared to give up the pawn.

7,Ng5,f3g5,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/6N1/2P1p3/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,White targets the weak pawn.
8,b5,b7b5,rnbqkb1r/p1pp1ppp/5n2/1p4N1/2P1p3/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"This is Suba's idea, the Bellon gambit.  If white takes black will get a good game via 5.cxb5 d5 or 5.Nxb5 I think is met by 5... c6 with ...d5 to follow, but maybe 5... Bb7 is a more natural continuation.  I think white's best response is 5.d3 where white is solid and black's pawns will soon look weak.

I initially wrote the awful idea of 5.Nxb5 d5?! 6.cxd5 Qxd5?? but that hangs a queen to 7.Nxc7 .  I got a bad rating off this, and I apoligize as it was a silly mistake to make.  I hope others won't rank it as harshly for one silly (but now corrected) blunder in the analysis."

13,Nxf6+,e4f6,rn1qkb1r/pbpp1ppp/5N2/8/2p5/2N5/PPQPPPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"A reasonable move as black cannot defend c4, however, maybe white does better to play the solid 8.e3."

22,Qd6,f6d6,rn3rk1/pbpp1ppp/1b1q4/3N4/2Q5/4P3/PP1P1PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ - 3 12,"Black does not want to trade his light squared bishop for black's knight, the light one is better than the dark, because the dark squared bishop's diagonal has been blunted by the pawn one e3."
23,Nf4,d5f4,rn3rk1/pbpp1ppp/1b1q4/8/2Q2N2/4P3/PP1P1PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQ - 4 12,"White is forced to make a decision with the knight, but I think this is a bad choice.  I think white should trade, getting rid of one of black's bishops.  Maybe I'm wrong though, as white will have an awful time developing and black has a great a file."
24,Re8,f8e8,rn2r1k1/pbpp1ppp/1b1q4/8/2Q2N2/4P3/PP1P1PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ - 5 13,Black continues development and adds a little pressure to the knight on f4.
