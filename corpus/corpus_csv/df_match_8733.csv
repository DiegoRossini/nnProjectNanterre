1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Inviting an open, cut and thrust game."
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The Caro-Kann, a counter-attacking defence that has a good drawing reputation."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,White's standard response.
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"The advance Variation.  I have an excellent book by the Greek GM, Kotronias, on this opening.  I tend to play the wildest line, which gives me plenty of entertainment but not a very good percentage..."

6,c5,c6c5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2ppP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"! Black takes me into unknown territory, though thanks to the after-game analysis, more familiar now."
7,c3,c2c3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2ppP3/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"? Loses a pawn after the sequence that follows.  John recommended either 4. dxc5 or 4. c4, both being complicated and potentially wild."
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/2ppP3/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,increasing the pressure on d4.  dxc5 is no longer such a good option for White because Black's N could then take the pawn on e5.
9,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/2ppP3/3P4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,Not the best way to defend the pawn.  5. Be3 would have been better.
10,cxd4,c5d4,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/3pP3/3p4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"pinning the N and threatening to take it, depriving the d-pawn of its cover."
11,cxd4,c3d4,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/3pP3/3P4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"pinning the N and threatening to take it, depriving the d-pawn of its cover."
12,Bg4,c8g4,r2qkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/3pP3/3P2b1/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,"pinning the N and threatening to take it, depriving the d-pawn of its cover."
13,Be2,f1e2,r2qkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/3pP3/3P2b1/5N2/PP2BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 7,Perhaps pinning Black's N might have been better.
14,e6,e7e6,r2qkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/3pP3/3P2b1/5N2/PP2BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"a normal developing move, releasing the other bishop."
15,h3,h2h3,r2qkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/3pP3/3P2b1/5N1P/PP2BPP1/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,"? a wasted tempo, forcing the B to do what it was planning to do anyway.  Be3 was still needed"
16,Bxf3,g4f3,r2qkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/3pP3/3P4/5b1P/PP2BPP1/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,This B is now out of position and the d-pawn is under-protected in view of Black's next move.
17,Bxf3,e2f3,r2qkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/3pP3/3P4/5B1P/PP3PP1/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 9,This B is now out of position and the d-pawn is under-protected in view of Black's next move.
18,Qb6,d8b6,r3kbnr/pp3ppp/1qn1p3/3pP3/3P4/5B1P/PP3PP1/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 10,"! forking b2 and d4.  White's DSB is required in two places at once.  The d-pawn looks much more important than the b-pawn, so I opt to save it but the respite is only temporary."
19,Be3,c1e3,r3kbnr/pp3ppp/1qn1p3/3pP3/3P4/4BB1P/PP3PP1/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 2 10,The R had to be defended.  Unfortunately the N interferes with White's Q's defence of d4.
20,Qxb2,b6b2,r3kbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/3pP3/3P4/4BB1P/Pq3PP1/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 11,The R had to be defended.  Unfortunately the N interferes with White's Q's defence of d4.

22,Nxd4,c6d4,r3kbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/3pP3/3n4/4BB1P/Pq1N1PP1/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 12,"White's one advantage is his advanced development.  Getting the K to safety is the best option at this stage.  Unusually for me, I'm hoping that Black will swap his good N for my bad B.  With Black's K trapped in the centre (or exposed on the c-file if he castles Q-side), White has good counter-chances with potential pins and skewers on the open lines."
23,O-O,e1g1,r3kbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/3pP3/3n4/4BB1P/Pq1N1PP1/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 1 12,"White's one advantage is his advanced development.  Getting the K to safety is the best option at this stage.

24,Nc6,d4c6,r3kbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/3pP3/8/4BB1P/Pq1N1PP1/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 2 13,Now double-attacking the pawn on e5.
25,Qa4,d1a4,r3kbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/3pP3/Q7/4BB1P/Pq1N1PP1/R4RK1 b kq - 3 13,"Finally, a counter-attacking move, pinning the N, but too late."
26,Qxe5,b2e5,r3kbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/3pq3/Q7/4BB1P/P2N1PP1/R4RK1 w kq - 0 14,"I actually started to feel good about my prospects.  John offered a draw again. ""Fancy an early bath?"" ""If you're offering a draw, no thanks, let's play on a bit, it's just getting interesting.""  I think I was somewhat over-optimistic!"
27,Rfe1,f1e1,r3kbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/3pq3/Q7/4BB1P/P2N1PP1/R3R1K1 b kq - 1 14,"I actually started to feel good about my prospects.  John offered a draw again. ""Fancy an early bath?""
