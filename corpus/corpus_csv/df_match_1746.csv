1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I have picked up the Tarrasch as white in the French, as I feel it offers white better chances since it allows the pawn to move to c3. Plus, it avoids the Winawer, which has some annoying and somewhat drawish lines."

6,Nd7,b8d7,r1bqkbnr/pppn1ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"?! Allows white to transpose. As black ended up exchanging on e4 next move, now would have been the time to do it in the Rubenstein."
7,Bd3,f1d3,r1bqkbnr/pppn1ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/3B4/PPPN1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 3 4,"In my mind the most flexible response. With the black knight on d7, there's no doubt that the white bishop belongs on d3 since there is no way to harass it."
8,dxe4,d5e4,r1bqkbnr/pppn1ppp/4p3/8/3Pp3/3B4/PPPN1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,"When I used to play the Rubenstein, I found that b6 early on weakened the light squares considerably. Moves like Ngf6 or Be7 are more common to strike at the center."
9,Nxe4,d2e4,r1bqkbnr/pppn1ppp/4p3/8/3PN3/3B4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,"When I used to play the Rubenstein, I found that b6 early on weakened the light squares considerably. Moves like Ngf6 or Be7 are more common to strike at the center."

11,Bf4,c1f4,r1bqkbnr/p1pn1ppp/1p2p3/8/3PNB2/3B4/PPP2PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 1 6,"Aiming to discourage c5. Black has little control of the center at the moment and this seals both of his breaks: e5 and c5, at least for the moment. Maybe not the best square for the bishop but it can be moved later when I know where it belongs."
12,Bb7,c8b7,r2qkbnr/pbpn1ppp/1p2p3/8/3PNB2/3B4/PPP2PPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 2 7,"The computer recommends Qf3!? here, with the threat of Nf6+ ... Qxb7 to weaken the light squares on the queenside even more. However Nf3 surely cannot be bad, and as shown later in the game maybe the queen belongs elsewhere."
13,Nf3,g1f3,r2qkbnr/pbpn1ppp/1p2p3/8/3PNB2/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 3 7,"The computer recommends Qf3!? here, with the threat of Nf6+ ...

14,Ngf6,g8f6,r2qkb1r/pbpn1ppp/1p2pn2/8/3PNB2/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 4 8,Simply begging for a later c4.
15,Qe2,d1e2,r2qkb1r/pbpn1ppp/1p2pn2/8/3PNB2/3B1N2/PPP1QPPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 5 8,Simply begging for a later c4.

17,Bg3,f4g3,r2qkb1r/pbpn1ppp/1p2p3/3n4/3PN3/3B1NB1/PPP1QPPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 7 9,"?! Dubious. Black should be aiming for 2 things here: central control and development, both of which he is severely lacking in. Plus, black is no closer than 2 moves from castling either way."
18,Qc8,d8c8,r1q1kb1r/pbpn1ppp/1p2p3/3n4/3PN3/3B1NB1/PPP1QPPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 8 10,"?! Dubious. Black should be aiming for 2 things here: central control and development, both of which he is severely lacking in. Plus, black is no closer than 2 moves from castling either way."
19,O-O,e1g1,r1q1kb1r/pbpn1ppp/1p2p3/3n4/3PN3/3B1NB1/PPP1QPPP/R4RK1 b kq - 9 10,"Perhaps c4 ... d5 would have been good, but after O-O and Re1 white is undoubtedly ready to attack"
20,h6,h7h6,r1q1kb1r/pbpn1pp1/1p2p2p/3n4/3PN3/3B1NB1/PPP1QPPP/R4RK1 w kq - 0 11,"?! According to the computer, c4 ... d5 is good for white, but not winning. Re1 is solid and allows for more aggressive play since Black cannot escape the center anyways. The intention of the move is to stop Ng5xe6 sacrifices, but it is way too slow right now. Black probably should have just played Be7 and dealt with sacrifices when they happened."
21,Rfe1,f1e1,r1q1kb1r/pbpn1pp1/1p2p2p/3n4/3PN3/3B1NB1/PPP1QPPP/R3R1K1 b kq - 1 11,?! Missing the opportunity to seize the initiative with c4 ... d5. One of my only inaccuracies the whole game.

27,Nc3,e4c3,r1q2rk1/pbpnbpp1/1p2pn1p/8/2PP4/2NB1NB1/PP2QPPP/3RR1K1 b - - 2 14,"!? The knight is better placed on c3 where it aims at b5 and d5, and vacates the e-file for the queen and rook, increasing the power of d5."

32,exd5,e6d5,r1qbr1k1/pbpn1pp1/1p3n1p/1N1p4/2P5/3B1NB1/PP2QPPP/3RR1K1 w - - 0 17,"Note that 17. Qxe8+ Nxe8 18. Rxe8+ Nf8 has chances for white, but being down the queen for the rook + minor piece is a tough exchange to get compensation for."

So, technically speaking, for temporarily being a pawn down white has de-activated all of black's pieces, and activated all of his own."
