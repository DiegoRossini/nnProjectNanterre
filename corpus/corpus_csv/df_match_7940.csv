However, many of those pawn moves were made with tempo, attacking black's minor pieces, and as a result, black has moved his knight three times and his bishop twice, and neither are on great squares, and development is even, though white controls significantly more space and has greater freedom and scope for his pieces. Sad to say, since Alekhine is my favorite champion, that the defense that bears his name is not worthy of his eminence. This move, 9. b3?! is a dubious move at best, sure to lose a pawn, but hoping to gain sufficient compensation to justify it as a gambit of sorts."

I decided to gambit the d4 pawn, thinking white would get more than enough of a developmental and attacking compensation for it. Having played out the moves, I'm not so sure that I got as much compensation as I had hoped for. 10. Nf3? just loses the pawn on g4 and there really isn't anywhere else for the knight to go. The real miscalculation might have been 9. b3?! leaving myself in this mess. I briefly considered 10. c5 to counterattack, but I think that just ends up losing a pawn anyway. So, of all the pawn-losing options, 10. Nd3 seems the best of the bunch. This may turn out to be a dubious gambit indeed."
