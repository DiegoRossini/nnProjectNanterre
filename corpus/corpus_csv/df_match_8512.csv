1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Here is a team game which I lost just now. A very accurate kingside attack by Black, coupled with some less-than-perfect manoeuvring by White (me!) creates its own conclusion."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Black replies to my Queen Pawn with the Old Benoni; this is in contrast to the more usually played Benoni, which goes 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5. Naturally the two may well transpose."
3,d5,d4d5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2pP4/8/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,I play the main line of all Benonis (Benonae?) : to advance the d-pawn and claim some of Black's space.
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2pP4/8/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"And already we have transposed back into a Benoni, although the GameKnot database, which does not really understand transpositions, still calls this position an Old Benoni. Although, having said that, it may well be the Benoni transposing back into the Old Benoni!"
5,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2pP4/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"And already we have transposed back into a Benoni, although the GameKnot database, which does not really understand transpositions, still calls this position an Old Benoni. Although, having said that, it may well be the Benoni transposing back into the Old Benoni!"
6,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppp1p/5np1/2pP4/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"!? An interesting move, clearly aimed at fianchettoing the kingside bishop to prevent it from being blocked in by pawns on d6 and c5. The theory behind this move seems natural; nonetheless, it is less popular on the GK database than 3...b5, the Benko Gambit, and the natural Benoni moves 3...e6 and 3...d6, in that order."
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppp1p/5np1/2pP4/2P5/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,"This seems natural and is typical to White's side of the Benoni: naturally, to shore up the d5-pawn and prepare for the central thrust 5.e4."
8,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/pp1pppbp/5np1/2pP4/2P5/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 5,"Black continues with his house-building on the kingside. Soon, I assume, he will castle and only then turn his attentions to the centre."
9,e4,e2e4,rnbqk2r/pp1pppbp/5np1/2pP4/2P1P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"The central push, solidifying White's advantage in central space."
10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp1pppbp/5np1/2pP4/2P1P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQ - 1 6,"The database suggested this move. I can see its logic, preventing Black from exchanging with ...Bg4. 5.h3 is the main line of the Czech Benoni; I hadn't thought to see it here. I suppose this is a good time, on a different note, to mention one of my main long-term errors in this game: my attitude to the position. I still saw it as a blocked and slow Benoni position: I had failed to change my style of play to correspond with the transposition into the much sharper King's Indian Defence."
11,Nf3,g1f3,rnbq1rk1/pp1pppbp/5np1/2pP4/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQ - 2 6,"The database suggested this move.
