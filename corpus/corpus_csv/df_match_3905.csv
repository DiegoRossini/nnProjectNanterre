1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I was playing black in this second of training matches with a friend for the U 1700 section of the Chicago Open 2012.  I am a caro kann player and had let my friend borrow my theory notes for lots of variations to test me in some lines.  This game features the fantasy variation.

9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2p5/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,A good move to support the center and allow potential tricks for white. dc is possible but not recommended if white is trying for an edge.
