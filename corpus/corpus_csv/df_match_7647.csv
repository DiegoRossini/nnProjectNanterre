1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

This draw seems a bit of a let down after the high one against Expert dynamic_dv.  But in life you sometimes have to take the rough with the smooth.  I have to say that my opponent did once have a gameknot rating of 1883 so he was a former Class A player before he suffered from timeoutitis which brought his rating down to what it is now.  I got into trouble in the middle game and lost a pawn.  Luckily I somehow got it back but unfortunately Henry found himself in perpetual thrall to the Wicked Witch of the West so there seemed nothing better than to concede a low draw and as a result a 7.8 point rating penalty.  Anyhow my opponent kicks off with a d4 opening."
