1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is an interesting game with careful moves on both sides. Black had a mate opportunity at move 53, did not see it. Black deserved a win but lost probably because he was ""dizzy with success"" as russians would put it and made an impulsive mistake at the end.
Queen's pawn to d4, my favorite move, leading to Queen's gambit. I enjoy this move because back when I was first learning the basics (very long time ago), I guess I took this as a habit because this opening leads to a closed game with slow maneuvering. In contrast, e4 is a good move but it leads to an open game and at the beginning, I had more chance of giving away material due to forks by knights and bishops."
