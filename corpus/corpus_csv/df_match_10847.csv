1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is a game I played in a mini-tournament. It was a hard game, and at that time, our rating difference was 201 ELO points.

4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"The Philidor Defense. ""Named after the 18th century player Francois-Andre Danican Philidor, it has the reputation of being solid if somewhat unambitious."" I don't like the Philidor - it's way too soft. I see loads of people playing Philidor on the Internet, and it annoys me all the time, because it leads to boring positions."
