1,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"A game played a little while ago v's Jullian. 

One of my first games and I think I caught him a little cold and got in a sneaky fork.

I am sure he hasn't and wouldn't miss it again & therefore I'm quite lucky to rack this one up as a victory.

I was soundly beaten in the away leg so he more than made up for it :)"

17,Bxg4,e6g4,rn1q1b1r/ppp1p2p/2k3p1/6N1/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 0 9,(After the 2nd game Jullian mentioned that as blacks King is out in the open & white still retains both Knights & both Bishops Black (presuming that there Queen will be out as well) has to tred carefully due to a massive number of Forks & Pins that could easily lead to a lost Queen)
18,e5,e7e5,rn1q1b1r/ppp4p/2k3p1/4p1N1/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 0 10,"I've seen this move in a few other games. I noticed a nice little combination played in other game. (so I nicked it!).

To be fair I've played this as White in the past few games, I know some of the better players prefer to put there DSB on g7 and Queen on g8, personally I feel to trapped and haven't the know how to break free."
19,Nf7,g5f7,rn1q1b1r/ppp2N1p/2k3p1/4p3/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 1 10,"Wins the pawn and puts in a check to boot.

Also leaves blacks e pawn hanging."

Also leaves blacks e pawn hanging."
22,Kb6,c6b6,rn3b1r/ppp1q2p/1k4p1/4N3/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 1 12,Fork (King & Queen) on d5 with Knight if I can get there quick enough.
23,g3,g2g3,rn3b1r/ppp1q2p/1k4p1/4N3/4pPB1/6P1/PPPP3P/RNB1K2R b KQ - 0 12,But 1st wanted to protect against Qh4+ and loosing my bishop. Hopefully this will keep Queen sat where she is.
24,Bg7,f8g7,rn5r/ppp1q1bp/1k4p1/4N3/4pPB1/6P1/PPPP3P/RNB1K2R w KQ - 1 13,Putting pressure on my advanced knight.
25,Nc3,b1c3,rn5r/ppp1q1bp/1k4p1/4N3/4pPB1/2N3P1/PPPP3P/R1B1K2R b KQ - 2 13,Develop my 2nd knight.
26,Bxe5,g7e5,rn5r/ppp1q2p/1k4p1/4b3/4pPB1/2N3P1/PPPP3P/R1B1K2R w KQ - 0 14,Black is too occupied with advanced Knight & misses the fork. Presume he feels he can exchange & win a pawn with a centralized Queen.
27,Nd5+,c3d5,rn5r/ppp1q2p/1k4p1/3Nb3/4pPB1/6P1/PPPP3P/R1B1K2R b KQ - 1 14,Killer blow? not yet but hopefully will go a long way towards it.
28,Kc6,b6c6,rn5r/ppp1q2p/2k3p1/3Nb3/4pPB1/6P1/PPPP3P/R1B1K2R w KQ - 2 15,"Is this wrong? 

I understand he wants to come back towards the center but if that was the case then surely c5 was better as isn't forced to move King..

Although if the King was going to be the key piece to rewin the knight maybe the forced move doesn't matter?

Does mean that I'll beable to win the DSB & pass a pawn. 

Maybe black would have been better to cut loses and head to a6?

Any thoughts?"
29,Nxe7+,d5e7,rn5r/ppp1N2p/2k3p1/4b3/4pPB1/6P1/PPPP3P/R1B1K2R b KQ - 0 15,Gives me more time & loses black more tempo with the check
30,Kd6,c6d6,rn5r/ppp1N2p/3k2p1/4b3/4pPB1/6P1/PPPP3P/R1B1K2R w KQ - 1 16,There is no way I can keep my knight but I don't want to give him away for free so must cause as much trouble as poss.
31,Nc8+,e7c8,rnN4r/ppp4p/3k2p1/4b3/4pPB1/6P1/PPPP3P/R1B1K2R b KQ - 2 16,Also means I might beable to hang on to my passed pawn which if nothing else may give black more cause for concern.
32,Kd5,d6d5,rnN4r/ppp4p/6p1/3kb3/4pPB1/6P1/PPPP3P/R1B1K2R w KQ - 3 17,"Pawn looks like he won't beable to hang on. 

Blacks King is central, hopefully this makes him an easy target, although he maybe hard to pin down and I'm figuring Black wants to use him to attack?"
33,fxe5,f4e5,rnN4r/ppp4p/6p1/3kP3/4p1B1/6P1/PPPP3P/R1B1K2R b KQ - 0 17,Pick up my free bishop.
34,Nc6,b8c6,r1N4r/ppp4p/2n3p1/3kP3/4p1B1/6P1/PPPP3P/R1B1K2R w KQ - 1 18,Again I think black was better taking pawn here as my knight wasn't going anywhere.
35,Ne7+,c8e7,r6r/ppp1N2p/2n3p1/3kP3/4p1B1/6P1/PPPP3P/R1B1K2R b KQ - 2 18,Decide that this is my best move. It maneuvers blacks Knight backwards into a less favourable position and lose a bit of forward momentum. He was going to go anyway so figured there was little else to do.
