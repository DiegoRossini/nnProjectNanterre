12,e5,e7e5,rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/3p1np1/4p3/2P5/2NP1NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 7,Not sure this is best.  Perhaps I should have gone symmetrical with 6...c5.
13,Bg5,c1g5,rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/3p1np1/4p1B1/2P5/2NP1NP1/PP2PPBP/R2QK2R b KQ - 1 7,"White was still moving instantaneously, which made me stop to ponder what he was planning and might have missed.  I decided to release my N from its pin, preparing a plan that was doomed to failure."

18,Ng4,f6g4,r1b1qrk1/pppn1pbp/3p2pB/4p3/2P3n1/2NP1NP1/PP2PPBP/R1Q1K2R w KQ - 6 10,? I think this was the start of my woes.  the N merely encourages White to do what he'd planned to do anyway and provides a target for White's attack.
19,Bxg7,h6g7,r1b1qrk1/pppn1pBp/3p2p1/4p3/2P3n1/2NP1NP1/PP2PPBP/R1Q1K2R b KQ - 0 10,?  This compounded the error.  The idea was to support the typical KID thrust of ...f5 but the N quickly becomes a liability here.  It would have been better to admit my folly immediately and return to f6.
20,Kxg7,g8g7,r1b1qr2/pppn1pkp/3p2p1/4p3/2P3n1/2NP1NP1/PP2PPBP/R1Q1K2R w KQ - 0 11,?  This compounded the error.  The idea was to support the typical KID thrust of ...f5 but the N quickly becomes a liability here.  It would have been better to admit my folly immediately and return to f6.
21,h3,h2h3,r1b1qr2/pppn1pkp/3p2p1/4p3/2P3n1/2NP1NPP/PP2PPB1/R1Q1K2R b KQ - 0 11,?  This compounded the error.  The idea was to support the typical KID thrust of ...f5 but the N quickly becomes a liability here.  It would have been better to admit my folly immediately and return to f6.
22,Nh6,g4h6,r1b1qr2/pppn1pkp/3p2pn/4p3/2P5/2NP1NPP/PP2PPB1/R1Q1K2R w KQ - 1 12,?  This compounded the error.  The idea was to support the typical KID thrust of ...f5 but the N quickly becomes a liability here.  It would have been better to admit my folly immediately and return to f6.

24,f5,f7f5,r1b1qr2/pppn2kp/3p2pn/4pp2/2P4P/2NP1NP1/PP2PPB1/R1Q1K2R w KQ - 0 13,Consistent but merely weakening Black's defences further.
25,h5,h4h5,r1b1qr2/pppn2kp/3p2pn/4pp1P/2P5/2NP1NP1/PP2PPB1/R1Q1K2R b KQ - 0 13,! White prepares to expose the Nh6 to the full fury of his KR and Q.
26,f4,f5f4,r1b1qr2/pppn2kp/3p2pn/4p2P/2P2p2/2NP1NP1/PP2PPB1/R1Q1K2R w KQ - 0 14,? Another consistent but useless move.  White's QN now has a choice of beautiful squares.

29,Nd5,c3d5,r1b1qr2/pppn2kp/3p2pn/3N3P/2P2p2/3P1N2/PP2PPB1/R1Q1K2R b KQ - 1 15,"! White forks f4 and c7, threatening a further fork from there, as well as taking closer order to Black's exposed King."
30,Nc5,d7c5,r1b1qr2/ppp3kp/3p2pn/2nN3P/2P2p2/3P1N2/PP2PPB1/R1Q1K2R w KQ - 2 16,"? After my longest think of the game, I decided to counter-attack, hoping to fork White's K and Q by exploiting the pin on e2 but I'd overlooked the strength of my opponent's coming combination."
31,Qc3+,c1c3,r1b1qr2/ppp3kp/3p2pn/2nN3P/2P2p2/2QP1N2/PP2PPB1/R3K2R b KQ - 3 16,! I'd seen this but under-estimated it.
32,Kg8,g7g8,r1b1qrk1/ppp4p/3p2pn/2nN3P/2P2p2/2QP1N2/PP2PPB1/R3K2R w KQ - 4 17,"Nothing could usefully be interposed and 16...Kf7 just invited 17. Ng5+, when White's Ns looked horrible."
33,hxg6,h5g6,r1b1qrk1/ppp4p/3p2Pn/2nN4/2P2p2/2QP1N2/PP2PPB1/R3K2R b KQ - 0 17,!  I'd seen this too but missed the most salient point of the position.
34,Qxg6,e8g6,r1b2rk1/ppp4p/3p2qn/2nN4/2P2p2/2QP1N2/PP2PPB1/R3K2R w KQ - 0 18,"?? Just awful, though I was probably already lost anyway.  What was shocking was that, with so many threats around, I missed the biggest one.  A quick sense check of ""What can White's Ns do?"" should have stopped me from making this blunder.  Though what else I could have done that didn't lose quickly, I don't know."
35,Ne7+,d5e7,r1b2rk1/ppp1N2p/3p2qn/2n5/2P2p2/2QP1N2/PP2PPB1/R3K2R b KQ - 1 18,"!  White applies the coup de grace, forking K and Q.  I'd had enough and resigned immediately.  Sorry to my teammates."
