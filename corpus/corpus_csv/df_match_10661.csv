1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Here is another beautiful win by Suba as black against his own preferred opening, the English.  I recommend flipping the board.  I've been debating for a while how to annotate this game.  I think it shows a beautiful sacrifice, and I thinks it's a pity that in retrospect it doesn't work.  I'm going to attempt to show the power of the sacrifice, the power of it's complications and the strength of the compensation.  I also hope to show why it loses (though it wins the actual game), why it doesn't get quite enough.  Enjoy!"

a) The most direct reason for the sacrifice is to connect the black rooks, now that the rooks are connected white will play ...axb4 (attacking white's queen with the now defended rook) followed by ...bxa3 again winning tempo, the pawn will be adequately defended and the b2 bishop will be attacked.  This gives black a passed a pawn, and he will soon get a passed e pawn as well with a timely d3.

b) By diverting the light squared bishop off the h1-a8 diagonal white wins control over the e4 square, his knight or queen can use it to great effect.

There are also various tactical threats based on the squares white's pieces will soon find themselves but I'll explain that later.

Now to explain the reasons for failure.  As with all failed sacrifice, the sacrificer doesn't get enough for the material.  In this case a bishop is a huge amount to give up.  Black gets two passed pawns, but if white can survive then those two pawns will prove weak and difficult to defend, especially when white has an extra piece.  The other potential problem is that white's pieces are almost completely sidelined, and the following moves open up the game, allowing white's pieces to have just enough coordination to defend."
