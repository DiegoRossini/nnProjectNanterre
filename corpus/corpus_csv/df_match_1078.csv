1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"i like posting games with the nimzowitsch defense, i dont think ive faced a black oponent who used it once in my 200 games on this site. it also allows me to save some of the games i want to remember possible lines since im a free to play player ><"
2,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"why i decided to post this game is this is a very Uncommon response i get to my opening which i think lead me to having a great game, since im used to playing vs the 3 most common/aggressive responses (d4 or nf5 or bb5 or even a rare Qf3)"
3,a3,a2a3,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/P7/1PPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"why i decided to post this game is this is a very Uncommon response i get to my opening which i think lead me to having a great game, since im used to playing vs the 3 most common/aggressive responses (d4 or nf5 or bb5 or even a rare Qf3)"
4,d5,d7d5,r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3p4/4P3/P7/1PPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,i saw it as an opening to grab the middle bring my queen out and other knight and start rolling with 3 pieces developped over his a3 pawn
5,exd5,e4d5,r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3P4/8/P7/1PPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"the white doesnt know the classic ""to take is a mistake"" plays into what i planned."
6,Qxd5,d8d5,r1b1kbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3q4/8/P7/1PPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,after seeing i was coming out aggressive i think he planned for a more defensive game.
7,d3,d2d3,r1b1kbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3q4/8/P2P4/1PP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,after seeing i was coming out aggressive i think he planned for a more defensive game.
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1b1kb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3q4/8/P2P4/1PP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,going on with my plan
9,Nc3,b1c3,r1b1kb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3q4/8/P1NP4/1PP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 5,was sorta expecting the knight o move 4 was happy he let me take out my knight first
10,Qe5+,d5e5,r1b1kb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/4q3/8/P1NP4/1PP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 3 6,"i always love offering the check here lol instead of retreating the queen, i am a gambler at heart and the games where my oponent blocks with either bishops is the ones i love."
11,Be3,c1e3,r1b1kb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/4q3/8/P1NPB3/1PP2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 4 6,"i have to say i face Queen most of the time.  white bishop block the other times. rarely a block with the knight and even rarer with the black bishop, this delighted me cause now he had no way of immediately blocking my knight on the c6 from coming up."
12,Bg4,c8g4,r3kb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/4q3/6b1/P1NPB3/1PP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 5 7,this guy was full of surprises. usually id face a bishop block or a knight development. obviously he cant promote the pawn cause my queen would take the black bishop (its what i was hoping he would do though lol) but this move was even more fun for me
13,Qd2,d1d2,r3kb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/4q3/6b1/P1NPB3/1PPQ1PPP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 6 7,this guy was full of surprises. usually id face a bishop block or a knight development. obviously he cant promote the pawn cause my queen would take the black bishop (its what i was hoping he would do though lol) but this move was even more fun for me
14,Nd4,c6d4,r3kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/4q3/3n2b1/P1NPB3/1PPQ1PPP/R3KBNR w KQkq - 7 8,heres a bit more gambler in me was wondering if he would do bishop or knight but was still hoping pawn. the objective is the black bishop all along i was hoping i could achieve it without a cost on my previous move but that wasnt hidden enough.
15,f3,f2f3,r3kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/4q3/3n2b1/P1NPBP2/1PPQ2PP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 0 8,time to cause some disruption break his pawn line and get the bishop at a cost of my knight and im breaking this board open so thats perfect to trade knights out for his bishops.
16,Nxc2+,d4c2,r3kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/4q3/6b1/P1NPBP2/1PnQ2PP/R3KBNR w KQkq - 0 9,i dont think he expected this lol
17,Qxc2,d2c2,r3kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/4q3/6b1/P1NPBP2/1PQ3PP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 0 9,objective complete!
18,Qxe3+,e5e3,r3kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/8/6b1/P1NPqP2/1PQ3PP/R3KBNR w KQkq - 0 10,objective complete!
19,Be2,f1e2,r3kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/8/6b1/P1NPqP2/1PQ1B1PP/R3K1NR b KQkq - 1 10,yet more surprises. he doesnt decided to cut the bleeding and maybe trade out queens he blocks with what i love the bishop!
20,Bf5,g4f5,r3kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/5b2/8/P1NPqP2/1PQ1B1PP/R3K1NR w KQkq - 2 11,no need to waste my bishop and this diagonal is by far my favorite for my white bishop
21,Nd1,c3d1,r3kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/5b2/8/P2PqP2/1PQ1B1PP/R2NK1NR b KQkq - 3 11,"i felt my oponent had a very retreating playstyle it was time to also retreat and i wanted to finish development, allow my black bishop out and possibly castle"
22,Qb6,e3b6,r3kb1r/ppp1pppp/1q3n2/5b2/8/P2P1P2/1PQ1B1PP/R2NK1NR w KQkq - 4 12,im always used to this kind of pressure and the defensive position hes adopted doesnt really allow him any development. im pretty sure opening his pawns at this stage is a weakening move
23,Qd2,c2d2,r3kb1r/ppp1pppp/1q3n2/5b2/8/P2P1P2/1P1QB1PP/R2NK1NR b KQkq - 5 12,im always used to this kind of pressure and the defensive position hes adopted doesnt really allow him any development. im pretty sure opening his pawns at this stage is a weakening move

26,Bg6,f5g6,r3kb1r/ppp2ppp/1q2pnb1/8/6P1/P2P1P2/1P1QB2P/R2NK1NR w KQkq - 1 14,i love my pawn disruption earlier makes for this knights new safe home
27,g5,g4g5,r3kb1r/ppp2ppp/1q2pnb1/6P1/8/P2P1P2/1P1QB2P/R2NK1NR b KQkq - 0 14,i love my pawn disruption earlier makes for this knights new safe home
