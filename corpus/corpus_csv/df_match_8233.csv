7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk1nr/ppp1ppbp/3p2p1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,i thought this was weak because it allows e4 which removes the knight and blocks the bishop in

15,Bg5,c1g5,rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/4pnp1/4N1B1/2BP4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 1 8,now anchoring that knight in place adding to the threats
