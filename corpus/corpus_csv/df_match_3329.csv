2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,The classical variation; I believe 1...e5 is more popular. Now White will seek to prevent Black's ...e5.

He only has one piece with any influence, whereas Black's three developed pieces are all contributing to the war effort. The goals at this stage of the game are simple: Black should finish developing and take advantage of his huge activity, and White needs to defend as best he can while trying to untangle his forces."
