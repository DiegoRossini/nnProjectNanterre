1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,(game info on previous page).
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I recommend you stick with this until you have become well acquainted with the open game. IMHO only then should you consider branching out.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Ruy Lopez, aka 'Spanish Torture'. Playing against this regularly will teach you good defensive skills, but be prepared for some steady, agonizing pain if you don't know what you are doing (hence the name)!"
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"Ruy Lopez, aka 'Spanish Torture'. Playing against this regularly will teach you good defensive skills, but be prepared for some steady, agonizing pain if you don't know what you are doing (hence the name)!"

6,Nge7,g8e7,r1bqkb1r/ppppnppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,"Cozio Defense. The least popular known response. Probably, mainly because it doesn't put WT under any pressure to develop and form a plan. Bent Larsen occasionally used it, but saying that he can play just about any old opening and make it work, because he is who he is."
7,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkb1r/ppppnppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 5 4,"? Too passive for my tastes. Controls g5 maybe? Ng6 had to be considered, as is  
the usual plan with The Cozio Defense."

11,d4,d2d4,r1bqkb1r/1pppn1pp/p1n2p2/4p3/B2PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 6,"In most Ruy Lopez variations c3 is needed as preparation for d4. A lot of people in the GK database stuck with this usual plan, probably because faced with a new Black 3rd move. However in most Cozio lines d4 can be played straight away."
12,b5,b7b5,r1bqkb1r/2ppn1pp/p1n2p2/1p2p3/B2PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,I'm uncertain about this move. d6 was another option.
