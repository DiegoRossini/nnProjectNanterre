1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"1.e4 probably one of the strongest moves on the board and played in terry's good style of play.Takes control of the center straight away,allowing further development of the f1 bishop to c4 to hit the black f7 square,also allowing the famous mate possibility if the white queen lands on f3 unhindered,a trap many beginners fall into."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"2..e5 a good response by black,holds the pawn firm in the center.with similar development possibility's as white."
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,2.Nc3 adds a defender to the e4 pawn and covers the vital d5 square if black try's to advance his d7 pawn to d5.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,2..Nc6 just mirror's whites plans here.
5,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 3 3,3.Bc4 hitting f7 square if white queen gets to f3 a later mate to follow on the f7 square if unhindered.
6,d6,d7d6,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 4,"3...Nf6 here is the best move,blocks the f7 file from the white queen if she was on f3 later,attacks the e4 pawn as an idle threat yet keeps the white Nc3 knights eye on the e4 defence.Also lends support to the d5 square.and is over all a good developing move."
7,d3,d2d3,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/2B1P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 4,"I would of played 4.Nf3 here why? well Nf3 would lend support to the weak d4 square and prevent black from playing Nd4 at some point gaining an outpost, all be it temporary,also the knight if on f3 can enjoy the possibility of a later Ng5 with white having 2 minor pieces hitting the black f7 square.In the form of the white c4 bishop and the knight on g5 at some point."
8,h6,h7h6,r1bqkbnr/ppp2pp1/2np3p/4p3/2B1P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,"A wasted move here you should not move more than 2 or 3 pawns in the opening with out good reason.
This move played is faulty logic what does it achieve? it weakens the kings position if he were to castle later that side.there was no threat from the black squares bishop on c1 and the knight on g1 is still in his stable.better to have played a DEVELOPING move instead with 4...Nf6"
9,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/ppp2pp1/2np3p/4p3/2B1P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,"At last the knight is out of his box,"
10,Bg4,c8g4,r2qkbnr/ppp2pp1/2np3p/4p3/2B1P1b1/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 6,Better here would of been 5...Na5 putting the question to the white c4 bishop.See a knight on the rim is not always dim especially if he is feisty.This would of given Terry a slight plan problem.
11,h3,h2h3,r2qkbnr/ppp2pp1/2np3p/4p3/2B1P1b1/2NP1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,Puts it to the bishop here.
12,Bh5,g4h5,r2qkbnr/ppp2pp1/2np3p/4p2b/2B1P3/2NP1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 7,Better to have retreated to Bd7 giving white a slight advantage.
13,Nxe5,f3e5,r2qkbnr/ppp2pp1/2np3p/4N2b/2B1P3/2NP3P/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,"A killer tactical shot a keen eye terry has to spot the mating net,"
14,Bxd1,h5d1,r2qkbnr/ppp2pp1/2np3p/4N3/2B1P3/2NP3P/PPP2PP1/R1BbK2R w KQkq - 0 8,Ahh greed a fool and his money is soon parted.What else i here you ask.The saving move 7...Nxe5 8.Qxh5-Nf6 still an advantage to white with these moves but black lives to fight and make life difficult for white.
15,Bxf7+,c4f7,r2qkbnr/ppp2Bp1/2np3p/4N3/4P3/2NP3P/PPP2PP1/R1BbK2R b KQkq - 0 8,
