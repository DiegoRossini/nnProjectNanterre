7,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkb1r/ppppnppp/8/8/2B1Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 4,"d5 is protected, and Black concentrates on the struggle in the center - avoiding weakening pawn moves to hold on to the extra pawn. White still maintains the initiative."

11,O-O,e1g1,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3n4/2B2p2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 6,White wisely looks to keep the King safe and develop.
12,Be6,c8e6,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4b3/3n4/2B2p2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 7,Further protects the Knight to free up the Queen and blocks the e-file to the King.
13,Bxd5,c4d5,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4b3/3B4/5p2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,Bishop takes wouldn't have gained anything - the Queen is safe to come out and then duck behind to defend the extra pawn.

19,d5,d4d5,rn2kb1r/pp3ppp/2p1b3/3P1q2/5p2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 10,A mistake - allowing Nb5 with multiple threats. Better was Bc4 first and then to take to allow a quick castling to take the sting out of how the game continues.

33,Nd4,b5d4,2r2rk1/pp3ppp/n3q3/2bp4/3N1B2/2P5/PP4PP/R2Q1R1K b - - 2 17,Trading would have just helped him bring the queen out and connect the rooks. I felt e4 was a nicely active square for the Queen where she couldn't easily be dislodged (for example if Re1 then Qxf4) without perhaps a trade (and the trade of knight for bishop now works better for Black).
