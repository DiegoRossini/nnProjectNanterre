1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"Hi everyone!  I received a challenge from Tony-de-Torre who is an avid reader of our annotations including my own.  Well, I will now annotate this one.  It ended in a draw.  I was subjected to a mating attack on the kingside beginning with a central lock-up and then a pawn storm with the heavies behind it (there was just one pair of minor pieces on the board).  Glenda, defending the e pawn, lodged herself on Henry's home square, as close to her other half as she could get.  My opponent apparently decided that Glenda did enough to rebuff the attack and offered me a draw.  Was Glenda's defence watertight though - you the jury decide!  Joanne"
