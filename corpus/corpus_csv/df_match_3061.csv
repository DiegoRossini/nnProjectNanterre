1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Black develops the King's knight to deter e4 and indirectly contest the center.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,Black develops the King's knight to deter e4 and indirectly contest the center.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Generally agreed to be the most assertive move for White, c4 contests the vacant d5 from the wing and infers a plan to develop the knight behind it to support a potential e4."
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Pushing the pawn out one square to resume control over d5 and freeing the King's bishop. The plan is to play either the Nimzo-Indian (3.Nc3) or transpose to the Benoni (3.Nf3 where the f-pawn is blocked - of course, the QID is also possible)."
5,a3,a2a3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/P7/1P2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"?! A somewhat dubious move. White is obviously anticipating and looking to prevent the Bb4 pin, but this allows Black to equalise easily. Developing either knight was the stronger option."
6,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/2PP4/P7/1P2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Punching back in the center, asking White to decide upon a plan for his center. (A benoni-type position is still possible with 4.d5 exd5 5.cxd5 d6 but Black is gaining control over the initiative, if 4.dxc5 then 4...Bxc4 and Black can be quite pleased with the position, and if 4.Nf3 then 4...cxd4 5.Nxd4 Nc6 and Black can still be content.)"
7,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/2PP4/P3P3/1P3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"White instead opts to play e3 to open the bishop and reinforce the d-pawn, although with c5 already on the board the exchange will give up the central e-pawn."
8,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/8/2Pp4/P3P3/1P3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,Exchanging the wing pawn to gain the stronger core center and the semi-open c-file to fight through.
9,exd4,e3d4,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/P7/1P3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"The stronger way to gain back on material (If 5.Qxd4? then 5...Nc6 and Black is quite far ahead in development), but White's central pawn position is now potentially susceptible to exchange and isolation through a supported and well-timed d5 thrust."
10,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/pp1pbppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/P7/1P3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,"We know the bishop is going here - it's the only square available (or that doesn't block a central pawn advance), we're looking to castle kingside, and it's a decent square to ""support the support"" (and if the Knight on f6 moves, can always shift to f6 where it nicely controls the center and hits some weak pawns/squares)."
11,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk2r/pp1pbppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/P1N5/1P3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 6,"These next few moves are quite natural development - Nc3 to develop the Queen's knight to increase control in the center, castling, and Bd3 to get the bishop to an open diagonal and allow for castling."
12,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp1pbppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/P1N5/1P3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQ - 3 7,"At this point, the d5 thrust was certainly viable but I felt no rush to play it and instead waited to first set up the queenside fianchetto with the bishop cutting down the open diagonal to the kingside."
13,Bd3,f1d3,rnbq1rk1/pp1pbppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/P1NB4/1P3PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQ - 4 7,"At this point, the d5 thrust was certainly viable but I felt no rush to play it and instead waited to first set up the queenside fianchetto with the bishop cutting down the open diagonal to the kingside."
14,b6,b7b6,rnbq1rk1/p2pbppp/1p2pn2/8/2PP4/P1NB4/1P3PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQ - 0 8,"At this point, the d5 thrust was certainly viable but I felt no rush to play it and instead waited to first set up the queenside fianchetto with the bishop cutting down the open diagonal to the kingside."
15,h3,h2h3,rnbq1rk1/p2pbppp/1p2pn2/8/2PP4/P1NB3P/1P3PP1/R1BQK1NR b KQ - 0 8,?! I'm calling this one dubious as there were no threats prevented and no gains made that I can see - it only serves to delay finishing development. Nf3 was the best move. (8.Nf3 Bb7 9.O-O d5 10.cxd5 Nxd5)
16,Bb7,c8b7,rn1q1rk1/pb1pbppp/1p2pn2/8/2PP4/P1NB3P/1P3PP1/R1BQK1NR w KQ - 1 9,"And now I felt the timing was right to begin the attack with the d5 thrust, expecting to isolate the pawn."
17,Nf3,g1f3,rn1q1rk1/pb1pbppp/1p2pn2/8/2PP4/P1NB1N1P/1P3PP1/R1BQK2R b KQ - 2 9,"And now I felt the timing was right to begin the attack with the d5 thrust, expecting to isolate the pawn."
18,d5,d7d5,rn1q1rk1/pb2bppp/1p2pn2/3p4/2PP4/P1NB1N1P/1P3PP1/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 10,"And now I felt the timing was right to begin the attack with the d5 thrust, expecting to isolate the pawn."
19,O-O,e1g1,rn1q1rk1/pb2bppp/1p2pn2/3p4/2PP4/P1NB1N1P/1P3PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 10,"White castles as it is imperitive to get the King to safety when things are opening up. If instead 10.cxd5 Nxd5, or if 10.c5 bxc5 11.dxc5 Bxc5/Nbd7 and possibly 12.b4 for nice complications for both sides."
20,dxc4,d5c4,rn1q1rk1/pb2bppp/1p2pn2/8/2pP4/P1NB1N1P/1P3PP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 11,"The Queen's pawn has now been isolated to provide a target to play against. I'm quite content with Black's position here - open c-file and semi-open d-file to the isolani for the rooks, the bishops cutting out through those open files, no major pawn weaknesses, and no major concession to the center. The Queen's knight is obviously not developed (yet), but there was no rush as it could operate effectively from a few squares in these types of positions - of course with an isolated pawn on d4, Nc6 will be best now."
21,Bxc4,d3c4,rn1q1rk1/pb2bppp/1p2pn2/8/2BP4/P1N2N1P/1P3PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 11,White captures to even up material.
22,Nc6,b8c6,r2q1rk1/pb2bppp/1pn1pn2/8/2BP4/P1N2N1P/1P3PP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 12,"Not where I normally like the play the knight with the queenside fianchetto, but the short term plan is to grab the open lines and load up on and win the isolated pawn, which is pretty much already fixed by e6 (eg 12.d5 Na5 13.Bd3 Nxd5)."
23,Be3,c1e3,r2q1rk1/pb2bppp/1pn1pn2/8/2BP4/P1N1BN1P/1P3PP1/R2Q1RK1 b - - 2 12,"White develops his bishop to defend the pawn (currently at two attackers, three defenders)."
24,Rc8,a8c8,2rq1rk1/pb2bppp/1pn1pn2/8/2BP4/P1N1BN1P/1P3PP1/R2Q1RK1 w - - 3 13,Grabbing the open file and creating the threat of a discovered attack on the (currently) hanging bishop.
25,Bd3,c4d3,2rq1rk1/pb2bppp/1pn1pn2/8/3P4/P1NBBN1P/1P3PP1/R2Q1RK1 b - - 4 13,"White retreats the bishop to a fairly strong square that can battery up in front of a Queen on c2 hitting h7 in case the King's knight moves, however it cuts the communication with one of the isolani's defenders."
