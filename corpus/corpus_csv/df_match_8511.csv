1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

This is another game in my 1700-1800 mini-tournament group.  Just imagine, you are a pawn up, you are in a 2 piece ending, surely the game is in the bag.  But not always, sometimes the pawn structures can be as such that a gridlock ensues.  It did in this game.  I had the pawn plus but could not seem to be able to do anything with it so I held out the olive branch and my opponent accepted it.  Please bear in mind that epblue's rating was not 1584 at the start, it was 1755 so I only lost 0.4 points out of the low draw.  He kicks off with 1.e4."
