6,Nge7,g8e7,r1bqkb1r/ppppnppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,"This is the Modern Steintitz variation, not very popular, because it blocks in the dark squared bishop and developes the knight to a less agressive square than the more popular Berlin and Morphy Variations."

10,b5,b7b5,r1bqkb1r/2ppnppp/p1n5/1p2p3/B3P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"Not the best move as it chases the bishop onto a very strong diagonal, better may have been d6, or even d5. Though this move does have the benefit of readying black's bishop for fianchettoing, if I play d3 at any time, his Bishop will be biting on granite."
11,Bb3,a4b3,r1bqkb1r/2ppnppp/p1n5/1p2p3/4P3/1BN2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,Blocking the bishop and knight out of the strong g5 square and severely limiting the bishop's scope. Probably the best way to meet the threat of Ng5 because of the knight sitting on e7. Atleast it's better than f6 which allows white's light squared bishop to aim deep into the black kingside.
12,h6,h7h6,r1bqkb1r/2ppnpp1/p1n4p/1p2p3/4P3/1BN2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,Blocking the bishop and knight out of the strong g5 square and severely limiting the bishop's scope.

14,exd4,e5d4,r1bqkb1r/2ppnpp1/p1n4p/1p6/3pP3/1BN2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"Capturing the pawn. Not forced but 7...d6 will end with an unpleasant Queen trade, 7...f6 will weaken the Kingside and 7...Ng6 looks bad after    8. dxe5 Ngxe5 9. Nxe5 Nxe5 10. Qd5 which forks the Knight and Rook, and should the Knight move, it threatens mate on f7."
15,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkb1r/2ppnpp1/p1n4p/1p6/3NP3/1BN5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,"It was probably not best to trade the knights, because this gives up Black's only well developed piece and brings the White queen out. Normally you want to keep your queen safe and out of the center at the beginning of the game, but here Black doesn't have enough pieces to really threaten the Queen. And with the Queen out, it may be able to work with the Bishops to get a powerful attack. Better I think was 8...Ng6 9. 0-0 Nge5."

Better I think was 9...Nc6 10. Qd5 Qf6 followed by Bb7 and Bd6 or Bc5 and Black's game is fine."

Qxa8 was also playable, but now Black has no isolated c-pawn, as you shall seem him get in the game."
