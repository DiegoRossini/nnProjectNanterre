1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I've used 1. e4 for the most part in my chess games but I'm starting to appreciate this move as well. I just need to find something good against the Nimzo. But I guess that's why so many players have turned to playing The Catalan or the QID.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"Since this is a thematic tournament, with The Gruenfeld or the KID as the main defenses to choose from, I was a little more relaxed to playing closed games. Needless to say, I had already chosen what I was going to play against my favorite defense. I'm still experimenting with the KID, but I'm going to settle on something soon. The problem is the exact opposite of the Nimzo, too many good lines to choose from."

White asks the Black Bishop where does he go now? The center was much to cozy for comfort and now Black must decide, go back to the K-side and give White a free hand in the center, or switch to the Q-side to pressurize c3 and hope White's attack won't come very soon on his weakened castle."
