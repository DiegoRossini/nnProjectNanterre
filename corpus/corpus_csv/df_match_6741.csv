1,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

I have forgotten to annotate a couple of games in the Annotations Project Part 2. Both of these were against Class C Opposition.  I will remedy that right now.  The first one is against Graham (Goatfodder) who is a bit like The Dentist, i.e. ok up to late/middlegame and will then make a mistake that will let me into the game big time and then go on to win it.  I will start the commentary on Move 9 as the previous moves are fairly standard to this particular opening."
