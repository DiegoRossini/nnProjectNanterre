Instead, it goes for a slow variant, if I may say so (haven't played this since I was ten...many moons ago), but safe and solid. It gives time for black to develop quietly, if properly done."

Now, it is important for the amateur here to keep an eye on this set up on the board, since it reproduces a very common position/situation in this opening (as well as with some Spanish variants). e5 is held by Nc6, but white now threats to hit the Bc5 and then the Nc6, therefore potentially gaining on e5. And thus, it is again making the point on how important is not only know the moves, but the basis, why it may or may not be advantageous going in that direction (gaining a pawn), and most importantly, how to reply adequately to those (weak or not) attacks. In this case, I find myself int rouble because I couldn't reply with energy, so you will see blacks position is not that good as it should have been (as I think it should after the incoming exchange). Judge by yourselves."

Therefore, a run for development and defence has started. I must say I did not see any clear line here to play, everything looked quite jammed, but I guess binging my rook into my king's aid should be done promptly, or at least to the center."

Since the g1-a7 diagonal is mine, it is worth thinking on attacking f2 an put some pressure off the center and flank. And there I went."

White now is not only developing but also keeping the aforementioned momentum, is pinning d6 and therefore bringing some pain to my defence. Black needs to be very careful now (not that I was though). Bb6 needs to be released some how, maybe with either a6 or c6. I opted for a6 since it does not wakens the support on d6."
