1,g3,g2g3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/6P1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I guess this is called the Benko opening (g3 that is). I had studied a few of gnitnaws games before I joined his game. I saw he favored queens pawn games (as white he seemed to prefer a queens gambit game) and as black he favored variations that began with d5.

3,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/6P1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,"1.g3 2.Bg2 are very common sequences for me in the beginning. I love opening like this. It fits my style of play and I'm able to develop into so many different openings from here.
Black I'm assuming is going for a french defense here. 

I generally aim for a quick king side castle in most games."

5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3P4/6P1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 3,I played d4 here. Not a bad move but I would probably play Nf3 here instead if I were playing this game over.

7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/4p2p/3p4/3P4/5NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,Simple development. I honestly don't know what this opening is called at this point. At the time I started this game I hadn't been playing g3 openings long. I've really just begun exploring the king side fianchetto. Now I prefer to begin with e4 though my general goal is to fianchetto king side. I'm a big fan of the Kings Indian Attack.
