6,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,This is the move for the Evans Gambit. You give away this pawn for a chance to develop faster.
7,b4,b2b4,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/1PB1P3/5N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,This is the move for the Evans Gambit. You give away this pawn for a chance to develop faster.
8,Bxb4,c5b4,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/1bB1P3/5N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,With this move he must move his Bishop a third time in 5 moves.
9,c3,c2c3,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/1bB1P3/2P2N2/P2P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,With this move he must move his Bishop a third time in 5 moves.
10,Ba5,b4a5,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/b3p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/P2P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 6,This is not the only place the Bishop can go. Black can put this Bishop on e7 to and that is a different line. And I can't write that much so all I will say is the the Bishop does not do good to go back to c5 because you play 6. d4 and he will have lots of trouble.
11,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/b3p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/P2P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 2 6,I castle. But you can play d4 right away if you like. I just do not like pins and my coach says that castling is still a good move.
12,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/b3p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/P2P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 3 7,"Black must race to develop. This move attacks my e4 pawn. But he must not take it. His King is still in the middle and I can attack his King through his Knight if it is on e4, and his pawn on e5. This would be bad for Black."
13,d4,d2d4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/b3p3/2BPP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,Now I attack the center. There is no pin on the c3 pawn and the Knight on b1 is a good bodyguard for it.
14,d6,d7d6,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/b3p3/2BPP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,"d6 is not a good move He should take my pawn on d4. Now I can make him work real hard, because every time I take a pawn with my pawn he must decide what he can do about it. And now I can open the center for my pieces."
15,dxe5,d4e5,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/b3P3/2B1P3/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,Now he should take with his pawn. This makes trouble for Black because I can do anything I want with my Queen. I can trade Queens and his King will be stuck in the middle because the King is the only bodyguard for her. But I find a better place for my Queen.
16,Nxe5,c6e5,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/b3n3/2B1P3/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 9,Now he should take with his pawn. This makes trouble for Black because I can do anything I want with my Queen. I can trade Queens and his King will be stuck in the middle because the King is the only bodyguard for her. But I find a better place for my Queen.
17,Nxe5,f3e5,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/b3N3/2B1P3/2P5/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 9,You can only put your Queen on b3 if Black can not put a Knight on a5 or d4. This is another reason Nxe5 was not a good plan. My coach Mr. Marble says that the most important square to keep track of is f7 for Black and f2 for White at the beginning of a game and the Evans Gambit always attacks f7.
18,dxe5,d6e5,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/b3p3/2B1P3/2P5/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 10,You can only put your Queen on b3 if Black can not put a Knight on a5 or d4. This is another reason Nxe5 was not a good plan. My coach Mr. Marble says that the most important square to keep track of is f7 for Black and f2 for White at the beginning of a game and the Evans Gambit always attacks f7.
19,Qb3,d1b3,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/b3p3/2B1P3/1QP5/P4PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 1 10,You can only put your Queen on b3 if Black can not put a Knight on a5 or d4. This is another reason Nxe5 was not a good plan. My coach Mr. Marble says that the most important square to keep track of is f7 for Black and f2 for White at the beginning of a game and the Evans Gambit always attacks f7.
20,Qd7,d8d7,r1b1k2r/pppq1ppp/5n2/b3p3/2B1P3/1QP5/P4PPP/RNB2RK1 w kq - 2 11,This is Blacks mistake. Black should castle and then White only has a little advantage. Now you will see why the Evans Gambit is mean.
21,Rd1,f1d1,r1b1k2r/pppq1ppp/5n2/b3p3/2B1P3/1QP5/P4PPP/RNBR2K1 b kq - 3 11,I give this two exclamation points because I thinked of it for a long time. And I want to take the King away from the Queen when she is on f7. The Rook has a body guard from my Queen on b3 and I do not give Black time to castle any more because I will take the Queen. I no he will put his Queen on f7 because of my plan.
22,Qe7,d7e7,r1b1k2r/ppp1qppp/5n2/b3p3/2B1P3/1QP5/P4PPP/RNBR2K1 w kq - 4 12,Black thinks I made a mistake and that I will lose my Bishop for the pawn. But I made a good plan and he did not see it.
23,Bxf7+,c4f7,r1b1k2r/ppp1qBpp/5n2/b3p3/4P3/1QP5/P4PPP/RNBR2K1 b kq - 0 12,Black thinks I made a mistake and that I will lose my Bishop for the pawn. But I made a good plan and he did not see it.
24,Qxf7,e7f7,r1b1k2r/ppp2qpp/5n2/b3p3/4P3/1QP5/P4PPP/RNBR2K1 w kq - 0 13,This is the reason from my plan! My coach calls this a decoy. If Black takes the Rook then he will leave the Queen and I can take it. If he goes to e7 then that will not work because I can play Ba3+ and he will have to take the Rook anyway.
25,Rd8+,d1d8,r1bRk2r/ppp2qpp/5n2/b3p3/4P3/1QP5/P4PPP/RNB3K1 b kq - 1 13,This is the reason from my plan! My coach calls this a decoy. If Black takes the Rook then he will leave the Queen and I can take it. If he goes to e7 then that will not work because I can play Ba3+ and he will have to take the Rook anyway.
26,Kxd8,e8d8,r1bk3r/ppp2qpp/5n2/b3p3/4P3/1QP5/P4PPP/RNB3K1 w - - 0 14,I win the Queen and now his pieces do not work good together.
27,Qxf7,b3f7,r1bk3r/ppp2Qpp/5n2/b3p3/4P3/2P5/P4PPP/RNB3K1 b - - 0 14,I win the Queen and now his pieces do not work good together.
28,Rg8,h8g8,r1bk2r1/ppp2Qpp/5n2/b3p3/4P3/2P5/P4PPP/RNB3K1 w - - 1 15,The Knight is the only thing keeping Black from losing the Rook. So set a pin so it can not move so I can take it on my next turn.
29,Bg5,c1g5,r1bk2r1/ppp2Qpp/5n2/b3p1B1/4P3/2P5/P4PPP/RN4K1 b - - 2 15,The Knight is the only thing keeping Black from losing the Rook. So set a pin so it can not move so I can take it on my next turn.
30,Re8,g8e8,r1bkr3/ppp2Qpp/5n2/b3p1B1/4P3/2P5/P4PPP/RN4K1 w - - 3 16,"A person said he thinks it is checkmate in 2 moves but Black can play many moves that make it not checkmate. I think Bd7 is probably best. But Black decided that it was to hard to win with this position and he resigned.

I hope you liked my game. Thank you Cenarius. You are a good player and you will win lots of games."
31,Qxg7,f7g7,r1bkr3/ppp3Qp/5n2/b3p1B1/4P3/2P5/P4PPP/RN4K1 b - - 0 16,"A person said he thinks it is checkmate in 2 moves but Black can play many moves that make it not checkmate. I think Bd7 is probably best. But Black decided that it was to hard to win with this position and he resigned.
