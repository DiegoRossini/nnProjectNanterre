1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

This is my third loss in the Jo against The Titans MT in which I am playing the top rated player in it.  Again, Henry is subjected to a kingside mating attack, only, this time at least you will get to see a king hunt, preceded by sacrifices, which was fun even though I was on the receiving end of it!  So, I will give you the gameknot analysis version of the game (which started out as a Queen's Gambit Accepted) before I start the commentary.  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15887004&fb=1&rnd=0.40403936277600444"
