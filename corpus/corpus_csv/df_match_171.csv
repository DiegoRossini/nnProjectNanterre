1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was a lucky draw. I grabbed a pawn, but it resulted in my queen being lost for rook, knight and two pawns. In theory that material imbalance is favourable to me, but in practice in the open board his queen is  much stronger, and I am fortunate to escape with a draw."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,It looks like he will play an Indian Defence.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,I continue with my usual.
4,e5,e7e5,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"He picked up his e pawn, twirled it in the air, and I though he was going to play a Nimzo-Indian Defence, but he put it down on e5 - the Budapest Defence. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Gambit"
5,dxe5,d4e5,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4P3/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,Taking is by far the most popular move.
6,Ng4,f6g4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/2P3n1/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"After 3.dxe5 Black can try the Fajarowicz variation 3...Ne4 which concentrates on the rapid development of pieces, but after 4. a3! white has an advantage."
7,e4,e2e4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/2P1P1n1/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"I switched to this, after I learned how white can't hang onto the extra pawn safely. This move attacks the black knight."
8,Nxe5,g4e5,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4n3/2P1P3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,So he takes the pawn.
9,f4,f2f4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4n3/2P1PP2/8/PP4PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,I attack the knight again.
10,Nec6,e5c6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/2P1PP2/8/PP4PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,"The most sensible move, although Nb-c6 is an interesting piece sacrifice, but black doesn't get quite enough."
11,Be3,c1e3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/2P1PP2/4B3/PP4PP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 2 6,Preventing 6.....Bc5 and white can't castle.
12,Bb4+,f8b4,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/1bP1PP2/4B3/PP4PP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 3 7,This is the most common move.
13,Nd2,b1d2,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/1bP1PP2/4B3/PP1N2PP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 4 7,"This seemed to me to be the most logical, preventing black from doubling my c pawns if I had played Nc3. I was surprised to learn afterwards than 7. Nc3 is in fact more usual."
14,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/1bP1PP2/4B3/PP1N2PP/R2QKBNR w KQ - 5 8,7....Qe7 threatening the pawn on e4 is more common.
15,Bd3,f1d3,rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/1bP1PP2/3BB3/PP1N2PP/R2QK1NR b KQ - 6 8,So I protect the e pawn.
16,d6,d7d6,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2np4/8/1bP1PP2/3BB3/PP1N2PP/R2QK1NR w KQ - 0 9,He develops.
17,Ngf3,g1f3,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2np4/8/1bP1PP2/3BBN2/PP1N2PP/R2QK2R b KQ - 1 9,"So do I - I am keen to get my king out of the centre, away from possible pressure down the e file, and also breaking the pin on Nd2."
18,Bg4,c8g4,rn1q1rk1/ppp2ppp/2np4/8/1bP1PPb1/3BBN2/PP1N2PP/R2QK2R w KQ - 2 10,He pins my other knight.
19,O-O,e1g1,rn1q1rk1/ppp2ppp/2np4/8/1bP1PPb1/3BBN2/PP1N2PP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 3 10,As planned.
20,Nd7,b8d7,r2q1rk1/pppn1ppp/2np4/8/1bP1PPb1/3BBN2/PP1N2PP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 4 11,"And he completes the development of his minor pieces. I found out afterwards that this position has occurred in a couple of Gameknot games, both times white played a3 and black won, although this position is very level still, and in both games white made mistakes later."
