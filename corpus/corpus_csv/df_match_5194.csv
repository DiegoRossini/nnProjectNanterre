1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"My favorite first move, personally, although 1. d4 gives White statistically better results."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Not a bad response, avoiding the Sicilian."
3,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,"The Bishop's Opening - uncommon but a favorite of Bent Larsen, among others.  I use this to avoid Petrov's Defense, which I deplore, Ruy Lopez, which I've never had good luck with, and the Scotch Game, which I enjoy immensely but tend to play badly with."
4,Nh6,g8h6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/7n/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 3,A truly bizarre move which unnerves White a bit.
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/7n/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,"A normal move, attacking Black's hanging e-pawn."
6,Bc5,f8c5,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/7n/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,Black makes this move to get his bishop out but is leaving the pawn undefended and giving up the center - what can he be planning?
7,Nxe5,f3e5,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/7n/2b1N3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,White takes what he's been given.
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n4n/2b1N3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 5,Perhaps Black has no master plan - as it is this is not a bad move though.
9,Nxc6,e5c6,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2N4n/2b5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"White's first real mistake.  Yes, it forces Black into doubled pawns, but takes White's powerful knight off the board.  Suspect."
10,bxc6,b7c6,r1bqk2r/p1pp1ppp/2p4n/2b5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"Both captures (this one and dxc6) can be derided as bad moves.  This one leaves the queenside weak, and 5...dxc6 basically surrenders the center.  One of them, of course, must be made, and Black picks this one."
11,c3,c2c3,r1bqk2r/p1pp1ppp/2p4n/2b5/2B1P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"Setting up, evidently, for 7. d4, with control of the center."
12,Qe7,d8e7,r1b1k2r/p1ppqppp/2p4n/2b5/2B1P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 7,"The queen's out, and she's now attacking the e-pawn.  Time to retool White's defensive strategy."
13,f3,f2f3,r1b1k2r/p1ppqppp/2p4n/2b5/2B1P3/2P2P2/PP1P2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,White still has plans for his d-pawn and is looking good right now.
14,f5,f7f5,r1b1k2r/p1ppq1pp/2p4n/2b2p2/2B1P3/2P2P2/PP1P2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"A good move, on the whole - White's pawn is pinned and thus can't take the f-pawn.  White must defend."
15,d3,d2d3,r1b1k2r/p1ppq1pp/2p4n/2b2p2/2B1P3/2PP1P2/PP4PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,White's hopes for twin pawns on the fourth rank will have to wait.
16,d5,d7d5,r1b1k2r/p1p1q1pp/2p4n/2bp1p2/2B1P3/2PP1P2/PP4PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,"Uh oh.  The e-pawn is looking bad. But the bishop is also attacked, and White has his priorities."
17,Bb3,c4b3,r1b1k2r/p1p1q1pp/2p4n/2bp1p2/4P3/1BPP1P2/PP4PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 9,Overall not the best move - White should have dealt with the loss of the bishop instead of the impending loss of the center.
18,dxe4,d5e4,r1b1k2r/p1p1q1pp/2p4n/2b2p2/4p3/1BPP1P2/PP4PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 10,The opening salvo.
19,Kf1,e1f1,r1b1k2r/p1p1q1pp/2p4n/2b2p2/4p3/1BPP1P2/PP4PP/RNBQ1K1R b kq - 1 10,"White is without all that many good moves, to be honest.  This is not a good one but there really aren't any.  Note the rapid momentum shift."
20,exf3,e4f3,r1b1k2r/p1p1q1pp/2p4n/2b2p2/8/1BPP1p2/PP4PP/RNBQ1K1R w kq - 0 11,"Continuing his one-man wrecking ball, the pawn keeps wreaking havoc on White's formation."
