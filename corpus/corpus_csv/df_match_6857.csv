1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,An opening I have very little experience with...
2,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,An opening I have very little experience with...
3,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 2,"...so I just focus on my main moves - e4, Nf3, Bc4..."
4,d6,d7d6,r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2np4/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,yup - definitely out of anything I've had experience with
5,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2np4/8/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 3,"! Both sides seemed to be focusing on developing, but now Black launches an attack... but didn't he just give up his knight?!?!"
6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2np1n2/8/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 4,"! Both sides seemed to be focusing on developing, but now Black launches an attack... but didn't he just give up his knight?!?!"
7,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2np1n2/8/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 4,"! Both sides seemed to be focusing on developing, but now Black launches an attack... but didn't he just give up his knight?!?!"
8,Nxe4,f6e4,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2np4/8/2B1n3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"! Both sides seemed to be focusing on developing, but now Black launches an attack... but didn't he just give up his knight?!?!"
9,Nxe4,c3e4,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2np4/8/2B1N3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"'course not! Black has just reintroduced me to a tactic that I had not encountered for a long, long time. Personally, I really hate it when this happens!"
10,d5,d6d5,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n5/3p4/2B1N3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"'course not! Black has just reintroduced me to a tactic that I had not encountered for a long, long time. Personally, I really hate it when this happens!"
11,Ng3,e4g3,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n5/3p4/2B5/5NN1/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"!? White could maintain material equality with 6.Bxd5 Qxd5 7.Nc3 Qa5 [this might have been better, but I'm not really sure] but I didn't see that line when I played this move. As for why I decided to save the knight instead of the bishop, there are two reasons for that; 1) after Bb3, dxe4 White has to waste an extra tempo moving the knight again, and 2) I didn't want the pawn in the centre of the board"
12,dxc4,d5c4,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n5/8/2p5/5NN1/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"advanced pawns this early in the game always end up being a bit of the bother for me, so I decide to do something about it as soon as possible...."
13,b3,b2b3,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n5/8/2p5/1P3NN1/P1PP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,"advanced pawns this early in the game always end up being a bit of the bother for me, so I decide to do something about it as soon as possible...."
14,cxb3,c4b3,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n5/8/8/1p3NN1/P1PP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"...but what would I have done if Black hadn't gone through with the capture? if he had advanced the pawn to c3, I would have castled, then taken the pawn, and if Black had not done anything....then I'm not sure what I would have done (bxc doesn't look pretty because of the doubled pawns)"
15,axb3,a2b3,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n5/8/8/1P3NN1/2PP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,"looks like the better of the two pawn captures, opening up a file for my rook as well"
16,Bg4,c8g4,r2qkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n5/8/6b1/1P3NN1/2PP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 9,"Both sides develop their bishop - White with a fianchetto, Black with a pin"
17,Bb2,c1b2,r2qkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n5/8/6b1/1P3NN1/1BPP1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 2 9,"Both sides develop their bishop - White with a fianchetto, Black with a pin"
18,Nb4,c6b4,r2qkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/8/1n4b1/1P3NN1/1BPP1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 3 10,"?! There is a purpose in this - provoking 10.c3? Nd3+! 11.Ke2 Nxb2, picking up the bishop. [12.Qc2 Nd3 13.Qxd3 Qxd3 14.Kxd3 gets back the piece, but Black is definitely better, an example is 14...0-0-0+] However, Black has just violated one of the opening rules - 'never move a piece twice in the opening'"
19,O-O,e1g1,r2qkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/8/1n4b1/1P3NN1/1BPP1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 4 10,White prevents the trick with a simple developing move...
20,Qd7,d8d7,r3kb1r/pppqpppp/8/8/1n4b1/1P3NN1/1BPP1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 5 11,and Black prepares his own castling
21,c3,c2c3,r3kb1r/pppqpppp/8/8/1n4b1/1PP2NN1/1B1P1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 11,"?! this move was made because of the lack of other obvious moves in this position [the c2 square seems preferable to e1 to break the pin on the f3 knight, and h3 could be met with Bxh3] but, as I explained back at move 9...."
22,Nd3,b4d3,r3kb1r/pppqpppp/8/8/6b1/1PPn1NN1/1B1P1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 1 12,the knight had this square to jump to! now the fianchettoed bishop is threatened with capture!
23,Ba3,b2a3,r3kb1r/pppqpppp/8/8/6b1/BPPn1NN1/3P1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 2 12,"not as good as the a1-h8 diagonal, of course, but this is still a good diagonal for the bishop"
24,O-O-O,e8c8,2kr1b1r/pppqpppp/8/8/6b1/BPPn1NN1/3P1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 3 13,opposite-side castling! let's see how this plays out! :)
25,Qc2,d1c2,2kr1b1r/pppqpppp/8/8/6b1/BPPn1NN1/2QP1PPP/R4RK1 b - - 4 13,Breaking the pin on the knight
26,Qc6,d7c6,2kr1b1r/ppp1pppp/2q5/8/6b1/BPPn1NN1/2QP1PPP/R4RK1 w - - 5 14,"hmmm....not too sure what the purpose of this move is about.... better might have been e6 or g6 to open up lines for the dark-square bishop [or Bxf3, now that the queen can't capture back]"
27,Ne1,f3e1,2kr1b1r/ppp1pppp/2q5/8/6b1/BPPn2N1/2QP1PPP/R3NRK1 b - - 6 14,"White decides that Black's knight have overstayed its welcome on the d3 square, and chases the knight off. The knight is defended once and twice attacked so..."
