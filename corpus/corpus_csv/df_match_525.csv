3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"White play the Centre game (C21). It is not meant to give white any advantage, as it opens up the game too early."
4,exd4,e5d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3pP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,So Jeremy takes.
5,c3,c2c3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3pP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,White offers a pawn sacrifice.
6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3pP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Black counters in the centre. This is the recommended reply.
7,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pP3/3p4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,White advances.
8,dxc3,d4c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pP3/8/2p5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,Black now takes the offered pawn.
9,Nxc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pP3/8/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,White recaptures and attacks the pawn on d5.
10,d4,d5d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/3p4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,So black advances and counter-attacks the knight.
11,Nb5,c3b5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/1N2P3/3p4/8/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 6,"And now the pawn on d4 is attacked twice, by queen and knight, but only protected once."
12,a6,a7a6,rnbqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p7/1N2P3/3p4/8/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,"Black gives the pawn back, as a rather nasty check is in the air."

14,Bb4+,f8b4,rnbqk1nr/1pp2ppp/p7/4P3/1b1N4/8/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 8,"But this check comes in. If white blocks with the bishop, the knight on d4 falls, so white is forced to play a very unnatural move."
