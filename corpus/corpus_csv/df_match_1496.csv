1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Like so many, I was an avid chess player in high school and college, but gave it up entirely until later in life. In my younger days, I played 1. e4 exclusively. Back then I had time to keep track of the myriad defenses that Black can use. At this stage of life, its just not worth the effort. It is true that there are a lot of defenses to 1. d4 but the positions tend to be more similar and morph into one another more easily than the 1. e4 games."

I have not faced the Grunfeld enough to feel confident yet that I know how to deal with it.

7,e4,e2e4,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"My first attempt with the Saemisch. This move never made much sense to me; White neglects development to make yet another pawn move and takes away the most logical square for his King's Knight. Initially I tried the seemingly more natural 5. Nf3 against the K's Indian, but I was not satisfied with the resultant positions. Black seems able to complete his development unproblematically and eventually play ... e5 or ...c5, chipping away at White's pawn center and thus achieve the main goal of the K's Indian. So for a while I switched to 5. f4 which got better results, but only through luck in my opinion. 5. f3 supports the center better than 5. f4 and while it is not a developing move, it aims at hindering Black's natural development by taking away the g4 square from the King's Knight (should White decide to play Be3) or the Queen's Bishop (should White decide to play Nf3)."

Amazingly, my computer tells me that Black can survive to an endgame, albeit a piece down via this route: … Ke8 27. Qg6+ Kd8 28. Rh7 Bf8 29. Rxd6+ Kc7 30. Rxe7+ Kxd6 31. Rd7+ Kc5 32. e7 Bxe7 33. Rxe7 Qf4+ 34. Kb1 Rd8 35. Nc3 Rd2 36. Na4+ Kd4 (not ... Kb4 as Black gets mated). I find it hard to believe that there isn't an improvement for White in this line."
