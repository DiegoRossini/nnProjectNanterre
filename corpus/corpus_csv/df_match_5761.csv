1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

This is only my second win of the tournament so far.  I did not think that I was gonna win, especially down bucket loads of material against a Class C Player called Steve - he is an opponent to watch as he has an Expert Draw against a 2100+ player under his belt.  Then I decided to sacrifice a second rook for a knight, luring the enemy bishop away from Steve's defense.  He took the rook and then I took a pawn, opening up a line for Glenda.  Now how did my Good Witch of the North take advantage of this line opener?  Well, read on!"
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,6. Kf1 - the first unforced move.

I do feel a bit leery of putting Henry on the f file where the Wicked Witch of the West can get at him when I play the white pieces but here I am playing black.  We follow the DB until Steve deviates with 16. Kf1.

Steve has no other legal move than to capture Fou Leblanc than NXN.  Now Glenda can deal death on e2.  Having found myself in a hopelessly lost position against a 1900+ player and having the possibility of losing 5.5 rating points to him I decided to resign that game and then set up Qxe2# in response to NXN as a conditional move before going to bed.  I woke up the next morning and gameknot confirmed that I had got most of those lost points back - nice.  Commiserations to Steve, in this line of the Traxler, Old Matey can strike out of a blue sky!  I must watch out as I have the white pieces against Steve and I must ensure that he does NOT get his revenge!"
