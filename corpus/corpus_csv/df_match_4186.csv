1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This is a game were I finally get exposed to a more positional match. Hope you enjoy!
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Trying to assure Ng5 never happens. In my humble opinion there were better moves to be made; although my opponent was probably wary of Ng5 because I utilized it in our previous game.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Trying to assure Ng5 never happens. In my humble opinion there were better moves to be made; although my opponent was probably wary of Ng5 because I utilized it in our previous game.

7,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1pp1/2n4p/4p3/2BPP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,Applying pressure on e5. Now my opponent is faced with a decision; does he attack or defend? He chose...
8,Qe7,d8e7,r1b1kbnr/ppppqpp1/2n4p/4p3/2BPP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 5,to defend with the Queen. 4...d6 would have been advantageous by allowing both Bishops freedom as opposed to the restrictive Qe7.
9,d5,d4d5,r1b1kbnr/ppppqpp1/2n4p/3Pp3/2B1P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,Being  by nature someone who likes playing open positions you would've thought I would have preferred dxe5 but I didn't cherish the thought  of his Queen being on e5 pointing at b2. This also saves me a tempo because he has to deal with his Knight now....
10,Nb8,c6b8,rnb1kbnr/ppppqpp1/7p/3Pp3/2B1P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 6,After five moves White clearly has the upper hand. Better developed? Check. More space? Check. But can White convert this into something substantial?
11,b3,b2b3,rnb1kbnr/ppppqpp1/7p/3Pp3/2B1P3/1P3N2/P1P2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"?! I remember vaguely wanting to get some support for the bishop while preparing to go fianchetto with the other thereby exerting pressure on the center and e5. In hindsight Bd2-Be3 were better moves, serving to hit two diagonals and adding to my spatial advantage."
12,a6,a7a6,rnb1kbnr/1pppqpp1/p6p/3Pp3/2B1P3/1P3N2/P1P2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,Trying desperately not to develop.
13,Bb2,c1b2,rnb1kbnr/1pppqpp1/p6p/3Pp3/2B1P3/1P3N2/PBP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 1 7,My (faulty) plan achieved. Now my e5 attackers out number his Queen in the struggle for the center.
14,d6,d7d6,rnb1kbnr/1pp1qpp1/p2p3p/3Pp3/2B1P3/1P3N2/PBP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 8,Adding more support for e5 and finally giving the Bishop and his Knight some room. Notice his Knight can only go to d7 while his Bishop can only go to d7 and f7.
15,O-O,e1g1,rnb1kbnr/1pp1qpp1/p2p3p/3Pp3/2B1P3/1P3N2/PBP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 1 8,Being I was gearing up for more of a positional battle and not the tactical fireworks (usually lobbed by my opponents) I was used to I decided to get this out of the way.
16,Nf6,g8f6,rnb1kb1r/1pp1qpp1/p2p1n1p/3Pp3/2B1P3/1P3N2/PBP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 2 9,Looking for a Knight outpost on f5 to attack the Queen and cramp Black even further. Better would have been to develop my other Knight to protect e4 which I clearly overlooked.Re1 would have done the trick.
17,Nh4,f3h4,rnb1kb1r/1pp1qpp1/p2p1n1p/3Pp3/2B1P2N/1P6/PBP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 3 9,Looking for a Knight outpost on f5 to attack the Queen and cramp Black even further. Better would have been to develop my other Knight to protect e4 which I clearly overlooked.Re1 would have done the trick.

19,Nd2,b1d2,rnb1kb1r/1pp1qp2/p2p1npp/3Pp3/2B1P2N/1P6/PBPN1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 1 10,Chose Nd2 over the more conventional Nc3 because I was eying f3 to put pressure on e5. Also there weren't that any good squares Queen-Side to place it on after I hit c3.
20,Ng4,f6g4,rnb1kb1r/1pp1qp2/p2p2pp/3Pp3/2B1P1nN/1P6/PBPN1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 2 11,"Protected from Qxg4 with his light square Bishop. Black has removed the threat from e4 allowing me to play Nf3 as planned. Although Black probably was trying to attack Nh4 with his Queen I was grateful; I wanted my Knight there anyways. Synopsis after ten moves: White is still ahead in development and space, although Black has narrowed the gap."
