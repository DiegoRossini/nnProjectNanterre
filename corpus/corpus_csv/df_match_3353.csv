7,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 5 4,"Probably White's most circumspect answer, though it does offer Black the chance to transpose back into a Giuoco Piano.  Instead, White could try 4.d4, striking at the centre, 4.d3, transposing into the Bishop's Opening (1.e4 e5  2.Bc4 Nf6  3.d3 Nc6  4.Nf3).  Probably still the most controversial line is 4.Ng5!?, which can lead, after 4...d5  5.exd5 Nxd5?? (Best - certainly safer - is 5...Na5)  6.Nxf7! ... into the toils of the frumious Fegatello Attack, a.k.a. the Fried Liver.  Surprisingly in this line, Black can at move 4 ignore the threat to his f7 and develop by 4...Bc5!? - the Wilkes-Barre (or Traxler) Variation, which can lead to some very wild and woolly play."
8,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 6 5,Effectively transposing into a Giuoco Piano.
9,c3,c2c3,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 5,Planning to establish a broad centre (of pawns) at d4 and e4.
10,d6,d7d6,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 6,"(?!)  White's having left his e-pawn unguarded, Black would have done best to grab it:  5...Nxe4  6.Bd5  Nf6  7.Bxc6 dxc6  though after 8.Nxe5 0-0  9.d4 Bd6  10.Bg5 White gets his pawn back and the game remains fairly even.  Black would have the bishop pair, very much an  asset on a fairly open board."

12,exd4,e5d4,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/2b5/2BpP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,Black does best to exchange at d4 before retreating the Bishop.

14,Bb6,c5b6,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/1bnp1n2/8/2BPP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 8,"Feasible was 7...Bb4, but White would probably have chased the Bishop back to b6 anyhow by 8.a3 and 9.b5, and then brought his rook to e1."
15,Ng5,f3g5,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/1bnp1n2/6N1/2BPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 2 8,"(?!) It becomes clear that White played this with a particular idea in mind.  However, it is ill-advised, and better would have been 8.Nc3."
16,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/1bnp1n2/6N1/2BPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 3 9,The best way to stymie White's strike at f7.
17,Bxf7+,c4f7,r1bq1rk1/ppp2Bpp/1bnp1n2/6N1/3PP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 0 9,"(?!) In my early days I used to do this sort of thing myself, in order to unbalance the game.  It certainly does that, but in the exchange of White's B and N for Black's R and P, Black gets the better of the bargain in terms of the greater flexibility and mobility.  At Master and Expert level, this would be a mistake; at Grade level - perhaps 'dubious' is a better description.  Knowing how to make best use of these advantages is the trick, and in my view it is worthwhile, at some early stage in one's development, to try out this kind of exchange and discover for oneself the 'truth and consequences' of this decision."
18,Rxf7,f8f7,r1bq2k1/ppp2rpp/1bnp1n2/6N1/3PP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 0 10,"Correct.  Black realises that although he loses a major piece (and a pawn as well), the two minor pieces are likely to be worth more.  It's certainly better that allowing White to get away with a pawn for nothing."
19,Nxf7,g5f7,r1bq2k1/ppp2Npp/1bnp1n2/8/3PP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 0 10,"The King is not seriously discommoded by this move to f7.  If the need arises, he can always duck back to g8."

27,Bg5,c1g5,r7/ppp1qkpp/1b1p1n2/3Pn1B1/4P1b1/2N5/PPQ2PPP/R4RK1 b - - 6 14,Probably hoping to relieve the pressure by exchanges?
28,h6,h7h6,r7/ppp1qkp1/1b1p1n1p/3Pn1B1/4P1b1/2N5/PPQ2PPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 15,"(!) Fine!  It is often the case that the best time to play this sort of pawn advance is when you can a tempo by hitting a minor piece, with the prospect of an aggressive advance by the g-pawn subsequently.  This sort of thing isn't always good, but when it is, it is very strong.  Now if the Bishop retreats, Black has gained some momentum for a K-side attack."
