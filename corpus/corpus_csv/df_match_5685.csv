1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,[Fun bit of trivia; the title of this annotation was inspired by this short song; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzy1MQPErOs - it was supposed to encourage graciousness with Singaporeans on the public transport system - Singapore's really big on that kind of stuff!]
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"[Also, as you'll discover very quickly, White is definitely not a beginner! He is at the 1500+ range at the very least - probably even higher!]"
3,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"It has been a long time since I've seen the King's Gambit played against me as Black, and from what I can tell about White's ongoing and past games, he plays the King's Gambit often."
4,exf4,e5f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Bc4!? is also playable here.
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,Bc4!? is also playable here.
6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"!? Other options here are 3...g5 [possibly leading to the Muzio gambit - after a crushing loss once in that line, I wasn't keen to try it again!] and 3...d6 [the Fischer Defence] but I wanted to play a move that perhaps White had rarely seen before, though to be honest, I didn't know this line either! A quick look at the Gameknot Database calls this Abbazia Defence"
7,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3P4/5p2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"White accepts the pawn, and should Black recapture with the queen White can chase it with Nc3"
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3P4/5p2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"Instead, Black develops a piece and attacks the pawn again - I would much rather prefer the knight capture!"
9,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3P4/2B2p2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 5,"Nope! If Black wants to win the pawn, his queen must come out!"
10,Nxd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3n4/2B2p2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"After a bit of thought, I decided that that was fine with me - I can acquire the bishop pair, even if my queen does get chased off!"
11,Bxd5,c4d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3B4/5p2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,Naturally...
12,Qxd5,d8d5,rnb1kb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3q4/5p2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,Naturally...
13,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1kb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3q4/5p2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,Naturally...
14,Qe6+,d5e6,rnb1kb1r/ppp2ppp/4q3/8/5p2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 8,...but I get to throw in a check with my retreat!
15,Ne2,c3e2,rnb1kb1r/ppp2ppp/4q3/8/5p2/5N2/PPPPN1PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 8,"!? I was fully expecting Qe2 here [developing another piece - White would be up three pieces to Black's one] but I'll take a guess that White wasn't willing to see the queens exchanged so early [I wasn't either, but White didn't know that! ;)] There's nothing wrong with this move, however."
16,Be7,f8e7,rnb1k2r/ppp1bppp/4q3/8/5p2/5N2/PPPPN1PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 4 9,"Bishop development. Bb4 doesn't really threaten anything, Bc5 is instantly rebuffed by d4 and Bd6 means that my own f4 pawn blocks its scope. That left the option Be7, and though I was thinking about a future Bh4+ at the time [with the f3 knight, that wasn't likely to happen!] it does help me with my next move..."
17,d4,d2d4,rnb1k2r/ppp1bppp/4q3/8/3P1p2/5N2/PPP1N1PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 9,"! good move - pawn thrust into the centre while discovering an attack on my f4 pawn, and now my Be7 helps..."
18,g5,g7g5,rnb1k2r/ppp1bp1p/4q3/6p1/3P1p2/5N2/PPP1N1PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 10,...by supporting this pawn thrust to g5!
19,O-O,e1g1,rnb1k2r/ppp1bp1p/4q3/6p1/3P1p2/5N2/PPP1N1PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 10,"Though there is no f-pawn to protect the king now, this castled position has proved to be very stable many times! [to my amateur mind, at least :)] Plus, White prepares Re1, threatening a discovered attack!"
20,Bd7,c8d7,rn2k2r/pppbbp1p/4q3/6p1/3P1p2/5N2/PPP1N1PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 11,"Black can't play g4 just yet because of the tempo attack White can get on the queen, but I was also concerned that White might try a Muzio-type sacrifice to get a big lead in development. Here's an example; 10...g4 11.Nxf4 Qa6 12.Bd2!? gxf3 13.Qxf3 and White has a scary lead in development! [Diagram can be found in comments] Would that have been sufficient compensation? I don't know..."
21,b3,b2b3,rn2k2r/pppbbp1p/4q3/6p1/3P1p2/1P3N2/P1P1N1PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 11,"! White starts setting up a trap -if Black fails to see it, then 12.Bb2 followed by 13.d5! wins material. Of course, this also sets up a fianchetto, though it never happens in this game!"
22,Rg8,h8g8,rn2k1r1/pppbbp1p/4q3/6p1/3P1p2/1P3N2/P1P1N1PP/R1BQ1RK1 w q - 1 12,"Pre-empting the threat early, while supporting the g5 pawn. I didn't know it yet, but this proves to be extremely helpful later on!"
23,Re1,f1e1,rn2k1r1/pppbbp1p/4q3/6p1/3P1p2/1P3N2/P1P1N1PP/R1BQR1K1 b q - 2 12,"! White keeps the initiative, threatening a discovered check on the queen."
