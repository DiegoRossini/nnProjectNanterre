1. e4 c5
I come here to say that this is all for all.. I'll play Sicilian Defense and I'm here to win!"

3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,Closed Sicilian.. In some way I really didn't expect this movement.
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Sicilian Kan Defense
5,g3,g2g3,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/4P3/2N3P1/PPPP1P1P/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"fianchetto? Really? Well, surely I didn't expect that movement. From now on I play myself, I mean, without knowing the theory or main line in this position. Something I know here, it's a good plan to play e5, so his white Bishop can't play well because of his own pawn on e4."
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/4P3/2N3P1/PPPP1P1P/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,Nc6 controling d4 and e5
7,Bg2,f1g2,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/4P3/2N3P1/PPPP1PBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 2 4,"Chess is played developing pieces.. I don't want to make more pawn moves until see how white develops, plus Knights must play through the center."
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/2p5/4P3/2N3P1/PPPP1PBP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 3 5,"Chess is played developing pieces.. I don't want to make more pawn moves until see how white develops, plus Knights must play through the center."
9,d3,d2d3,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/2p5/4P3/2NP2P1/PPP2PBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,"Ok.. i really hate this. My opponent plays e4 and now I feel that I'm playing a closed opening (it doesn't looks like a common e4 opening). Now white has showed his plan: King side castle, and an attack to the king side (I know this because of the pawn chain structure). But this position has something peculiar.. the f2 bishop. That piece covers somehow d5 and attacks the queen side. Now I have to decide how I'm going to play, what will be my plan."
10,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/pp1pbppp/2n1pn2/2p5/4P3/2NP2P1/PPP2PBP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 1 6,"Not decided to do d5 before putting my king on safe, I develop my Bishop. The common battery of Qc7 and Bd6 to pressure h6 in some Sicilian Games clearly doesn't make any sense in this position, and a fianchetto in the king side is a little bit slow, I want to gain some space, or at least put my king on safe to start measures in centre."
11,f4,f2f4,r1bqk2r/pp1pbppp/2n1pn2/2p5/4PP2/2NP2P1/PPP3BP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 6,"f4!? an interesting move that I allowed playing Be7 instead of d5, White has seen that he can gain space and attach the king side, putting pressure in e5 and f5."
12,d6,d7d6,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2nppn2/2p5/4PP2/2NP2P1/PPP3BP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 7,"d6!. Almost any other move is bad here, I know as a Sicilian player that I can not allow e5 advance in this position."
13,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2nppn2/2p5/4PP2/2NP1NP1/PPP3BP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,"Castling? Not any more with f4. As white has hurried to pressure the king side, now I hurry to queen side attack, meanwhile I speculate with the castle.. maybe I'm going to King side castle, or maybe queen side, or maybe I'm going to leave the king in the centre! .."

Qb6 is other interesting option here, as h5!? could be (an attack with the white bishop on b7, h5, Ng4, h4, is very common to see in GM as Karpov in this kind of positions."

I know that white will mount an attack in the king side, while I plan to Queen-side attack, maybe mixing my attack with some center attack. I do this because I know his Knights and pawn structure in the king side are not well positioned, so I should be able to survive his attack, and in some point I hope my attack will be faster than his (I'm counting that in this king of attacks, as White throws his king pawns, the King is exposed to many checks)."
