1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The Sicilian Defense. It's the best scoring response to 1. e4 at master level. Here, Black fights for victory. Normally, White focuses in the Kingside and Black looks for counterplay in the Queenside."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The Sicilian Defense. It's the best scoring response to 1. e4 at master level. Here, Black fights for victory. Normally, White focuses in the Kingside and Black looks for counterplay in the Queenside."
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"A natural but uncommon move. Other choices are 2. d4 or 2. Nf3, that lead to extensively studied positions."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,"A very weak move. There is one opening principle that is almost always true : one should never move the same piece in the opening twice in a row.
It would be better 2.g3, the Closed Sicilian ( in wich White can consider fianchettoing his Bishop in g2), or 3. Nf3, wich transposes to the Open Sicilian."
5,Nd5,c3d5,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2pN4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 3 3,"A very weak move. There is one opening principle that is almost always true : one should never move the same piece in the opening twice in a row.

6,e6,e7e6,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2pN4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Black devellops one pawn and White loses one tempo, because he's forced to move awy his Knight."
7,Nf4,d5f4,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/4PN2/8/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,"Black fights for the center. Another important opening principle : in the opening, the players must focus on occupying the center or undermine it. But fighting for the center is rather important."
8,d5,d7d5,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2pp4/4PN2/8/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"Black fights for the center. Another important opening principle : in the opening, the players must focus on occupying the center or undermine it. But fighting for the center is rather important."
9,exd5,e4d5,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2pP4/5N2/8/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"By move 5, Black is better, because he has opened the lines for both Bishops and the Queen and has develloped a Knight, not mencionning the two hanging pawns. White only has one develloped Knight that is hanging in the centre."
10,exd5,e6d5,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n5/2pp4/5N2/8/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"By move 5, Black is better, because he has opened the lines for both Bishops and the Queen and has develloped a Knight, not mencionning the two hanging pawns.

11,Qe2+,d1e2,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n5/2pp4/5N2/8/PPPPQPPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 1 6,"Another weak move, that reminds us another chess principle : only give check if it gives you some advantage."
12,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk1nr/pp2bppp/2n5/2pp4/5N2/8/PPPPQPPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 2 7,"Black covers the check, prepares castling and devellops one minor piece."
13,Nh5,f4h5,r1bqk1nr/pp2bppp/2n5/2pp3N/8/8/PPPPQPPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 3 7,"Another weak move. The Knights are stronger in the centre of the board ; in the a or h files, they are weak because they only cover 4 squares, instead of the usual eight."
14,g6,g7g6,r1bqk1nr/pp2bp1p/2n3p1/2pp3N/8/8/PPPPQPPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 0 8,A move that makes White lose another tempo.

18,Bf5,c8f5,r2qk2r/pp2bp1p/2n2np1/2pp1b2/5N2/3Q4/PPPP1PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 4 10,A development move that forces White to lose another tempo ( the third one).

24,d4,d5d4,r2qr1k1/pp2bp1p/2n2np1/2p2b2/3p1N2/2QPB3/PPP2PPP/R3KBNR w KQ - 0 13,! A strong move. The d-pawn forks the Queen and the Bishop ; White starts to lose material.
25,Bxd4,e3d4,r2qr1k1/pp2bp1p/2n2np1/2p2b2/3B1N2/2QP4/PPP2PPP/R3KBNR b KQ - 0 13,"With the white Bishop gone, the discovered check is now possible. It is also a double attack, since the bishop threatens to smash the white horse."
26,cxd4,c5d4,r2qr1k1/pp2bp1p/2n2np1/5b2/3p1N2/2QP4/PPP2PPP/R3KBNR w KQ - 0 14,"With the white Bishop gone, the discovered check is now possible. It is also a double attack, since the bishop threatens to smash the white horse."
