I did in full confidence of winning the game with a breakthrough my opponent has no chance to stop... when failing to go on with it this exchange could have proven itself to be a key error. However, there are some circumstences that save the situation and give a good ground for this move. Black cannot take back with the g-pawn because that closes up his own bishop badly. Moreover after 16.Bxf6 he has to make another move to make that bishop active and to give way to his f-pawn.
