1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The King's Pawn opening move is both popular and logical. It controls the center, opens lines for both the Queen and the Bishop, and usually leads to an open game in which tactics, rather than slow maneuvering, predominates."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,The Sicilian defense immediately stakes a claim at d4 and prepares an unbalanced challenge for control of the game.

White is now free to play Nd5 because taking the knight forces Black to to cede the bishop pair.  After 8.Nd5, if black plays 8... Bxd5, then the probable continuation 9.exd5 Ne7 (9...

Delaying Nc6 would not expedite the battery enough because white can and will play Kh2.  After g3, black must play d6, e5, Be6, and Qd7 before white is able to play Bg2, O-O, h3/h4, Kh2."

After 9... Nd4, 10. Nxd4 cxd4 holds no terror for White because of Nd5.  The other option is the possibility of d4 once white plays Be3 with the threat of an immediate d5, but these plans are mutually exclusive.  If black plays d4, d5, he cannot play Nd4 and vice versa."
