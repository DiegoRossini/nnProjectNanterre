1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Here is a short French Alekhine-Chatard attack finished recently.  There are some interesting educational themes in this game.  The attack against solitary king, the trapped piece and weaknesses in the castled position.  Feel free to leave comments."
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The French is a counter-punching opening.  A favorite of mine in the recent past, I now exclusively play 1...c5."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,White opts for the main line French instead of the Kings Indian Attack with 2. d3.
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,The central counter-strike.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"The Classical set up against the French is probably the most testing.  White avoids extending the center with 3. e5 and prepares to develop actively with 4. Bg5, among others."
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"Another very interesting possiblity is 3...Nc6!?, which transposes to a line of the Nimzowitch, also known as the Hecht-Reefshlager."
7,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p2B1/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 3 4,Another interesting line is the Modern Classical with 4. e5 Nfd7; 5 Nce2!?
8,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p2B1/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 4 5,Breaking the pin.
9,e5,e4e5,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3pP1B1/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"This is a typical strategy for the Classical French.  White wants to exchange his bad dark-squared bishop for Black's good bishop.  This will leave Black with the problem light-squared bishop to deal with, while White's light-squared bishop will find an active role to play very early."
10,Nfd7,f6d7,rnbqk2r/pppnbppp/4p3/3pP1B1/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,5...Ne4 is dubious.
11,h4,h2h4,rnbqk2r/pppnbppp/4p3/3pP1B1/3P3P/2N5/PPP2PP1/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,"An interesting move that offers a pawn to start an immediate attack on the Black kingside.  In the days of romanticism, where gambits were always accepted, this led to some spectacular defeats for the second player.  Today, with defensive technique much stronger, this variation is almost extinct."
12,Bxg5,e7g5,rnbqk2r/pppn1ppp/4p3/3pP1b1/3P3P/2N5/PPP2PP1/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,The best way to refute a gambit.
13,hxg5,h4g5,rnbqk2r/pppn1ppp/4p3/3pP1P1/3P4/2N5/PPP2PP1/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 7,"White hopes the open h-file will help him to attack the Black kingside.  Of course, only someone with a deathwish would castle kingside at this point."
14,Qxg5,d8g5,rnb1k2r/pppn1ppp/4p3/3pP1q1/3P4/2N5/PPP2PP1/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 8,
15,Nf3,g1f3,rnb1k2r/pppn1ppp/4p3/3pP1q1/3P4/2N2N2/PPP2PP1/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 8,"8. Nh3 is interesting, intending to play a later Nf4, when sacrificial possibilities (especially on d5) abound."
16,Qe7,g5e7,rnb1k2r/pppnqppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/2N2N2/PPP2PP1/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 9,This keeps the queen available for the defense of the kingside if needed.
17,Bd3,f1d3,rnb1k2r/pppnqppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/2NB1N2/PPP2PP1/R2QK2R b KQkq - 3 9,"Immediately targeting the pawn on h6, but this is of no consequence as Black should continue developing and wait for White to commit his king before castling himself."
18,Nc6,b8c6,r1b1k2r/pppnqppp/2n1p3/3pP3/3P4/2NB1N2/PPP2PP1/R2QK2R w KQkq - 4 10,"Not 9...c5, when 10. Nb5 is annoying."
19,a3,a2a3,r1b1k2r/pppnqppp/2n1p3/3pP3/3P4/P1NB1N2/1PP2PP1/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 10,"White wants to keep the bishop on d3 without the ...Nb4 swat, however, this move weakens the White king's soon-to-be shelter.  Notice on move 16 how this weakness will become the target of my attack."
20,Nb6,d7b6,r1b1k2r/ppp1qppp/1nn1p3/3pP3/3P4/P1NB1N2/1PP2PP1/R2QK2R w KQkq - 1 11,c4 will make a nice outpost for my knight.
