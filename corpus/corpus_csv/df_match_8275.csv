2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I usually play 1...Nf6 and head for the Kings Indian Defense.
3,Bf4,c1f4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P1B2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"White plays the Neo-London.  The London system originally developed as a way for Black to meet the Reti opening in the 1920s.   The London system was then played from the White side.  In the London White plays Nf3 before Bf4.   In the Neo-London White plays Bf4 and Nd2.  Both the London and the Neo-London White usually forms the ""Slav Triangle"" with his pawns at e3, d4, and c3.   This makes the London a cousin of the Colle, where White also adopts the ""Slav Triangle"" but keeps the bad bishop inside the pawn chain.   There are pros and cons to both approaches, but a misconception some players have is that developing the bad bishop outside the pawn chain solves the problem of the bad bishop.  Outside the pawn chain the bishop is still bad and his absence cause a weakness on the queenside."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P1B2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,"White can get away with breaking Lasker's principle that at least one knight should be developed before a bishop, but Black cannot.   By playing the Neo-London White abandons his initial edge in the opening and allows Black to equalize.  White is basically playing a reverse Black defense with a move in hand, and hoping to outplay Black in the middle game.  The theory behind the Neo-London was developed in the 1980s by  Kovacevic."

At the time, I thought the key to Black's position was to exchange the Queens.

Post Morten analysis with Fritz showed that White queen's position is a liability.  Fritz recommended 12...a6 13 Qb6 Na7 followed by ...Nc8 and the White queen has to make a hasty retreat back to it's own lines.  Black would have a clear advantage.

Generally the side that is forced to resolve the tension suffers a disadvantage.   For instance if Black were to play exd, after Nxd4 White would have a fine outpost for his knight.   If White were to play dxe, after fxe, White's e5 and d5 pawn dual would form a mobile center which should work well with his bishop pair.    Although it would drive the knight back, I don't feel that Black should play e5 since it would close the position, and after a regrouping by the White pieces, White could mount an attack on the queenside without worrying about Black striking back in the center.  Although it would create temporary disorganization amongst the White minor pieces, the resulting closed position might well favor the knights over the bishops.    Still, if at some point Black can come up with a strong follow up to e5, its a possible future threat White has to watch out for."
