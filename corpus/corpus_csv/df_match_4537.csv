Computer analysis here http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=16424431&rnd=0.01421505631878972"
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Starting the sequence for a possible French, an opening I hate playing against and score very low against."
3,Qe2,d1e2,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPPQPPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"While I do not exactly heed my own advice playing (I've never played this line either OTB or online) I am aiming for more comfortable positions. I've experiment with many different responses to the French, none of which I've been very successful with; sometimes here I'll play 2. b3, a gambit line, or just stick to traditional classical or tarrasch lines. The Chigorin defense has almost 2,000 games in the world database (compared to 90,000 with the book d4), it discourages the typical 2...d5 from black in the french since after the pawn exchange black's e-pawn is pinned and he must capture with the queen. Black's typical response is 2...c5 after which the games resemble closed sicilian positions, a board position that I would be much more comfortable in, typically avoiding open sicilians when I play 1.e4"
4,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2p1p3/8/4P3/8/PPPPQPPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"My opponent however does not go for typical play, c6 supports the d5 push as black would not forced to re-capture with the queen. This does hinder the queen-side development though, and indeed black does not develop these pieces until move 14 with Ra7! The pieces are perfectly at home on these squares for almost the entirety of the game."
