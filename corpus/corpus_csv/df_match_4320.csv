1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

At least I have had some success in the Love Conquers All MT.  This game was against a Class C player called Paul.  When I first played him after joining The Coaching Club (now alas extinct) my rating was similar to his - we were both rated in the 1520s.  A lot has happened since then.  So how did I win this?  Well, after kicking off with 1. e4 and my opponent responding with the Nimzowich Defense (named after GM Aeron Nimzowich) here is the Gameknot Analysis:- http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17043614&rnd=0.8169159996991752"
