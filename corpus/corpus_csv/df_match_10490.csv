Leaving it and getting on with normal development seems more logical. A pawn retake, if I capture the knight, is going to produce a doubled pawn and if I meant to withdraw the bishop I wouldn't have made that move. More on this.."

Ok its ""capturing towards the center"" but it is capturing a bishop. It seems to me that an argument can be made for white to go for a wide open game giving his bishop-pair better mobility. Or?"
