17,Nd2,f3d2,rnbq1rk1/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4PB2/2N5/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 5 9,A very common move in the Bf4 and Bg5 lines. The white knight is headed to c4 where it can aid in the attack of the d6 point. The d6 point is traditionally the weakest point in black's defense.
18,a6,a7a6,rnbq1rk1/1p3pbp/p2p1np1/2pP4/4PB2/2N5/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 10,Two relatively unexplored alternatives for black are 9...Ng4 and 9...Ne8. Both are IMO better than the game move. After 9...a6 black has not had much success in top play. Mostly because black does better when he resolves the pressure on d6 quickly.
19,a4,a2a4,rnbq1rk1/1p3pbp/p2p1np1/2pP4/P3PB2/2N5/1P1N1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 10,This thematic knight move has been championed by John Watson in his book 'Starting out: Modern Benoni' Strategically black wants to follow up with ...Nd7 and ...Ne5 in preparation of ...f7-f5.

There is nothing inherently bad about this move but offering to give up your prized Bishop for a weaker one is never a good idea. In almost all cases it is black who will miss the DSB as he will have to maintain control of the dark squares with his queen which is easily harassed by the weaker pieces.
22,Bd4,g7d4,rnbq1rk1/1p3p1p/p2p2p1/2pP3n/P2bP3/2N1B3/1P1N1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 3 12,!?

24,Bxe3,d4e3,rnbq1rk1/1p3p1p/p2p2p1/2pP3n/P1N1P3/2N1b3/1P3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 13,"Overall, I would say that white is doing better. On black side he has managed to resolve the problematic d6 weakness for the foreseeable future. The absence of the DSB means that b7-b5 is highly unlikely. So black must throw everything into making f7-f5 work."
25,Nxe3,c4e3,rnbq1rk1/1p3p1p/p2p2p1/2pP3n/P3P3/2N1N3/1P3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 13,"Overall, I would say that white is doing better.

27,g3,g2g3,r1bq1rk1/1p1n1p1p/p2p2p1/2pP3n/P3P3/2N1N1P1/1P3P1P/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 14,"a powerful little move, keeping the knight out of f4 and supporting said f2-f4 advance."

The logic in this move is to support ...f7-f5 or maybe to play ...Ne8 to meet Nc4. Either way black may have better luck with ...Rb8; ...Re8 or ...Nhf6.
29,Nc4,e3c4,r1bq1rk1/1p1n1pnp/p2p2p1/2pP4/P1N1P3/2N3P1/1P3P1P/R2QKB1R b KQ - 2 15,hitting at d6 again.

31,Nd2,c4d2,r1bq1rk1/1p3pnp/pn1p2p1/2pP4/P3P3/2N3P1/1P1N1P1P/R2QKB1R b KQ - 4 16,The knight has moved 4 times already is well traveled. I am anticipating an attack on e4 shortly so nd2 and Bg2 should do the trick.
