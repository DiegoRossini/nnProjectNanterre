12,c5,c6c5,r2qkbnr/pp1n1ppp/4p3/2ppPb2/3P4/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,an attempt to break open the centre.  Simular the lines in the advance french but a tempo down.
13,c3,c2c3,r2qkbnr/pp1n1ppp/4p3/2ppPb2/3P4/2P2N2/PP2BPPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,supporting the centre is an acceptable way to play it.  Other good moves include 7. Nbd2 and the strange looking 7. c4!?
14,c4,c5c4,r2qkbnr/pp1n1ppp/4p3/3pPb2/2pP4/2P2N2/PP2BPPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,"?! Although gaining space, it is probably not the best move as the pawn chain can be broken and it neglects development.  Developing moves such as 7...Be7 are better."
15,Be3,c1e3,r2qkbnr/pp1n1ppp/4p3/3pPb2/2pP4/2P1BN2/PP2BPPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 1 8,I tried to get my bishiop into the game before I played Nd2 followed by b3.  Maybe I should have playe 8. Nbd2 before developing the Bc1
16,h6,h7h6,r2qkbnr/pp1n1pp1/4p2p/3pPb2/2pP4/2P1BN2/PP2BPPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 0 9,A total waste of a move.  What is that achieving? Develop!!
17,Nbd2,b1d2,r2qkbnr/pp1n1pp1/4p2p/3pPb2/2pP4/2P1BN2/PP1NBPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 1 9,continuing my plan of gaining space on the Q-side
18,Ne7,g8e7,r2qkb1r/pp1nnpp1/4p2p/3pPb2/2pP4/2P1BN2/PP1NBPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 2 10,"Finally, developing the Ng1.  White is ahead on development and has an advantage."

21,a4,a2a4,r2qkb1r/p2nnpp1/4p2p/1p1pPb2/P1pP4/1PP1BN2/3NBPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 11,trying to exchange the weak a-pawn.
22,bxa4,b5a4,r2qkb1r/p2nnpp1/4p2p/3pPb2/p1pP4/1PP1BN2/3NBPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 12,"Better is 12. bxc4 picking up the c-pawn and the a pawn.

However, even with that slight inaccuracy, black has an issolated a-pawn, is behind in development, hasn't castled and controls less space than white.  Having said that he is still in the game but needs to get his act together quite quickly!"
23,Rxa4,a1a4,r2qkb1r/p2nnpp1/4p2p/3pPb2/R1pP4/1PP1BN2/3NBPPP/3Q1RK1 b kq - 0 12,"Better is 12. bxc4 picking up the c-pawn and the a pawn.

25,bxc4,b3c4,r2qkb1r/p2n1pp1/2n1p2p/3pPb2/R1PP4/2P1BN2/3NBPPP/3Q1RK1 b kq - 0 13,"Blacks appears to get more into the game, a pawn down having not castled in an open position.  Sound dangerous?"
