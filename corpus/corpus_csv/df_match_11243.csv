4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/P7/1PPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,attacking e4
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/P1N5/1PPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 3,developing move defending e4
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/P1N5/1PPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 3 4,following the rule to develop knights before bishops. but I think Bc5 would be fine here preventing d4.
7,g4,g2g4,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P1P1/P1N5/1PPP1P1P/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,an attack after only one piece developed? hmmm. this really gets white behind.
8,d5,d7d5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3pp3/4P1P1/P1N5/1PPP1P1P/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"now the pawn can be taken, or if g5 then Nxe4. white has created weaknesses with the g5 move, so I will try for an open game."
9,h3,h2h3,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3pp3/4P1P1/P1N4P/1PPP1P2/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,another pawn move to protect the weak g4 pawn. the dark squares are weakining around the king. he needs to play d3 and then Bg4 and Qd2 so he can castle queenside.
10,dxe4,d5e4,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4p1P1/P1N4P/1PPP1P2/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,free lunch! if d3 and Bg5 were played this would not be possible.
11,g5,g4g5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/4p1P1/4p3/P1N4P/1PPP1P2/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,the one pawn attack! such a brave little guy! Where are all the troops in the army? sleeping in the barracks?? What kind of army has only one brave soldier?

17,Rh2,h1h2,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/4pbP1/4Nn2/P6P/1PPP1PBR/R1BQK1N1 b Qkq - 4 9,"like a stack of dominoes, once the first one falls, so go the rest."
