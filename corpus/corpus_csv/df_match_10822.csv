1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"A tricky move order. Black doesn't let White continue with certain attacking structures (e.g. the feared 9.0-0-0 Rauzer) because he threatens an early ..d7-d5 (discussed in a later note). This move order is often neglected in the Dragon because of the nagging possibility of 6.Nxc6! bxc6 7.e5; in that line, White immediately pressures Black's negligence in the center, even at the cost of strengthening Black's pawn structure. Black tends to score poorly in that line, hence the early ..d6 (preventing this idea entirely)."

It is super-weak against g4 for the opposite reason - now White can easily open lines to the Black king. Already, Black is lost. It is instructive to note the defensive spirit of Black's play (the dubious prophylactic ..Re8, the sluggish preparatory ..a6, and now the blunderous ...h5). Fear of White's attacking possibilities pervades Black's play, to his doom. In the Dragon (specifically these Rauzer lines), the key word is counter-attack. White's attack is naturally strong, and to some degree indefensible. Black's best plan is then to attack White's king, not spend several tempi ""defending."" Moves like ..Qa5, ...Bd7, ..Rac8, and ..Ne5 ought to be on the board, not this mishmash. Black would have fared much better if he had simply continued with his own attacking plan!"
