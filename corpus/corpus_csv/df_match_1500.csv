8,d6,d7d6,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PPB2/8/PPPN1PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"Just blinding black's dsb. I want to attack the kingside, and I need to have a fierce barrier on the queenside."
9,c3,c2c3,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PPB2/2P5/PP1N1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"Just blinding black's dsb. I want to attack the kingside, and I need to have a fierce barrier on the queenside."
10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PPB2/2P5/PP1N1PPP/R2QKBNR w KQ - 1 6,"""Come and get me""."
11,Be2,f1e2,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PPB2/2P5/PP1NBPPP/R2QK1NR b KQ - 2 6,Slowly.
12,c6,c7c6,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2pp1np1/8/3PPB2/2P5/PP1NBPPP/R2QK1NR w KQ - 0 7,"This move enables Qb3, that forces me in thinking about all the ""poisoned pawn's stuff"" (Qxb2!?). It is not my intention to go this way. Maybe, more engaging would have been c5 instead. This gives me one precious tempo to go on with the attack."
13,g4,g2g4,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2pp1np1/8/3PPBP1/2P5/PP1NBP1P/R2QK1NR b KQ - 0 7,"The problem for black is if Nh5, BxN forces him to open the g column, and this is potentially very dangerous. Black's knight should find a good square to fly, and soon."
14,b5,b7b5,rnbq1rk1/p3ppbp/2pp1np1/1p6/3PPBP1/2P5/PP1NBP1P/R2QK1NR w KQ - 0 8,...so this move seem a little optimistic.
15,g5,g4g5,rnbq1rk1/p3ppbp/2pp1np1/1p4P1/3PPB2/2P5/PP1NBP1P/R2QK1NR b KQ - 0 8,"Well, ok, but that means your pieces are far from the king and all blocking each other..."

18,Bb7,c8b7,rn1q1rk1/pb1nppbp/2pp2p1/1p4P1/3PPB2/2P2N2/PP1NBP1P/R2QK2R w KQ - 3 10,"c5 is countered by a final Bxb5 by white, so a good idea would have been to play a6 or Ba6."
19,h4,h2h4,rn1q1rk1/pb1nppbp/2pp2p1/1p4P1/3PPB1P/2P2N2/PP1NBP2/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 10,"I won't care: if he sees it, better for him. Otherwise, I'll start my assault, that is not granted at all."

21,Bg3,f4g3,rn1q1rk1/pb1n1pbp/2pp2p1/1p2p1P1/3PP2P/2P2NB1/PP1NBP2/R2QK2R b KQ - 1 11,"I wanted to target d6 even sacrifying a pawn on the queenside. I looked to many lines, very complicated, involving discovered threats on my Rh1, and a Bxd6 that threatened the R but of little use after Re8. It was already complicated. Be3, the ""wise"" one, just leads to exchanges and pressure over me."
22,a5,a7a5,rn1q1rk1/1b1n1pbp/2pp2p1/pp2p1P1/3PP2P/2P2NB1/PP1NBP2/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 12,"Black counterattacks on the queenside. Now, c5 can be answered by d5, and this blocks black's plans on the queenside (well, that may be not be completely accurate, black keeps some chances of disrupting actions on the queenside after it). Anyway, this looks a little slow."
23,a3,a2a3,rn1q1rk1/1b1n1pbp/2pp2p1/pp2p1P1/3PP2P/P1P2NB1/1P1NBP2/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 12,"I honoured my opponend by defending. In fact, this may be not the best move, when h5 seemed so aggressive."
24,Nb6,d7b6,rn1q1rk1/1b3pbp/1npp2p1/pp2p1P1/3PP2P/P1P2NB1/1P1NBP2/R2QK2R w KQ - 1 13,"Black is playing very accurately to unravel his pieces and seriously threat my queenside. It was not that slow, after all. Now, Na4 sticks my queen or my rook to the defence of b and c, and I can't avoid that. I realized it was my h5 plan the ""too slow one"". Maybe just in time. 
So I though to ""go a little crazy"".
We are already in a very complex position, with a lot of possible lines that goes long for many moves before they fix into a definite win, that is true for either side.
As an example: 

13.	d1-b3	a5-a4
14.	b3-b4	c6-c5
15.	b4-b5	b7-c6
16.	b5-d3	e5-d4
17.	c3-d4	c5-d4
18.	f3-d4	f8-e8
19.	d4-c6	b8-c6
20.	g3-d6	g7-b2
21.	a1-b1	b2-d4
22.	d2-f3	c6-e5
23.	f3-e5	d4-e5
24.	d6-e5	d8-d3
25.	e2-d3	e8-e5
26.	b1-b6"
25,Qb3,d1b3,rn1q1rk1/1b3pbp/1npp2p1/pp2p1P1/3PP2P/PQP2NB1/1P1NBP2/R3K2R b KQ - 2 13,"The idea behind this move is to tempt black in playing a4, forbidding this square for his knigth."
26,a4,a5a4,rn1q1rk1/1b3pbp/1npp2p1/1p2p1P1/p2PP2P/PQP2NB1/1P1NBP2/R3K2R w KQ - 0 14,"...which my opponen does. I'd call it an inaccuracy. My queen is not threatening anything, but x-raying two undefended black pieces, if the c pawn is moved. So black thinks he has to kick it even at this high price. I could have kept the queen on the white diagonal from a2, but the real pressure for the queen was on the b column. Here, an interesting tactic can make the game very interesting. I am planning to lose my queen."
