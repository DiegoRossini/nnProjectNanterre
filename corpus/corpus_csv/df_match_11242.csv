1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I've known Bob for a few years now, yet I'd only faced him over the board one other time: in the last round of my first tournament at the Illowa Chess Club in December 2001. (For those who don't know, Bob is the proprietor of the chess publishing & distribution company, ChessCo.  www.chessco.com)  Since he thrashed me during that first encounter (and since I've learned a thing or two since my days of pushing wood in the Class H section), I was happy to finally get the chance to redeem myself. Having played Bob only once (and that almost two years ago), I really wasn't sure what opening he played, so I asked a friend of mine what I should expect. Knowing my penchant for king-pawn openings, he told me Bob was fan of the French. This put me at ease a little since I've had good results against the French in past tournament play, but then, before I could finish my thought, my friend added, ""I think he's even written a book or two about it."" Great. I knew I was in for a battle, but I was determined to make the best move against my formidable opponent, who isn't just one of the biggest chess proprietors in the nation, but also has a knowledge of opening theory that puts the little experience I have to shame. (Plus, I suffer from an affliction I like to call ""acute tactical glaucoma"", so I knew I needed to take my time.) I didn't always make the best move, but luckily for me Bob had a few inaccuracies of his own I was able to capitalize on and come out on top."
