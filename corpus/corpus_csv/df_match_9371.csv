1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This move is logical and strong.  Either with sense of humor or a profound respect for the quirky Fischer, many commentators feel compelled to add ""recommended by Fischer!"" OK.  OK.  Recommended by Fischer."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Frequently black's c pawn is exchanged for the white d pawn.  Consequently, black often seeks to place a rook on the half open c file.  The Sicilian defense discourages an immediate d4.  White can play d4. 1. e4 c5 2. d4 cxd4 3. Nf3 (Qxd4) Nc6. You'll probably like the line if you study and play the center-counter defense.  It's ""a book line that's generally considered inferior to the 'main' line"" as pointed out by GK player nuntar, but as is often the case, proving an inferiority is probably difficult even for expert players.  At any rate, d4 would probably discourage black from implementing a king-side fianchetto."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"White's normal response prepares d4 and avoids such committing moves as f4 or d3 or Nc3, which have their own rationale."
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"A later analysis by Chessmaster says:  Steamroller tactics may help White here. 3.d4 cxd4 4.Qxd4 Nf6 5.Bb5 Nc66.Bxc6 dxc6 7.Qxd8  Kxd8 8.Nc3 Bg79.Bf4 favors White by 12%. For this reason, Black may elect, after 3.d4 to play 3...Bg7 allowing the cramping 4.d5 which also turns out to White's favor in the long run."
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"Black breathes a sigh of relief.  While, I had no computer analysis during the game, my own experiences with the English opening have shown that the Queen capture is quite playable.  4.Qxd4 is also a forcing move that pressures black to play Nf3 before he may wish to."
6,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Black breathes a sigh of relief.  While, I had no computer analysis during the game, my own experiences with the English opening have shown that the Queen capture is quite playable.  4.Qxd4 is also a forcing move that pressures black to play Nf3 before he may wish to."
7,Nxd4,f3d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"Black breathes a sigh of relief.

8,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk1nr/pp1pppbp/6p1/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,This gives no clues to black's possible development plans.  It also allows black to see how white will proceed.
9,c4,c2c4,rnbqk1nr/pp1pppbp/6p1/8/2PNP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"Standard Sicilian lines would play Nc3 here.  White arrives at a position identical to games where play proceeds 1. c4 c5 2. Nf3 g6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Bg7 5. e4, which could be described as transposing to the English opening.  White chooses to play a Maroczy bind position.  This position is frequently enough used that there is a Wikipedia page devoted to it.  (This page lacks any analysis though.)  After some disappointing tests of Chess Openings for White explained, I would take Alburt and Dzindzischavili's claim in the CO for White counterpart book that black need no longer fear the bind a little skeptically.  See John Watson's review of their book for white on Jeremy Silman's site."
10,e6,e7e6,rnbqk1nr/pp1p1pbp/4p1p1/8/2PNP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"I didn't like the idea of Nf6 being challenged by e5.  While it's true that the knight can escape the advance by the simple Qa5  followed by Qxd5 , I am more familiar with the placement on e7 which escapes the pawn's harrassment at the cost of the bishop pin.  Arrakis08 feels that this is a bad move creating serious problems.  But could we truly say serious? 6.Nb5 threatens Nd6  and Nc7  if he can manage to cover c7 to prevent Qxc7. Yes, black doesn't seem to have a preferable way to deal with both threats created by Nb5, but is 6... d6 so bad? If white follows with Bf4, then e5. Black suddenly becomes vulnerable to Bc4, but white has to move the c pawn first. I think black has sufficient resources to deal with the threats. If 6...e6 might not be a great move, but it's not a blunder, and I have to ask what would the preferred move be?  Perhaps 5.Nf6 which allows castling immediately removing one of the two threats (Nd6 ) behind Nb5?"
11,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk1nr/pp1p1pbp/4p1p1/8/2PNP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"I imagine that many players like this position because they have positional elements of the Sicilian mainline with a pawn at c4 restraining d5.  Since the claims are 5...e6 is bad, I edited commentary into the analysis of 5...e6."
12,Ne7,g8e7,rnbqk2r/pp1pnpbp/4p1p1/8/2PNP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 7,"This is a common motif.  I've played it and won with it, but I have my doubts about its soundness especially because the knight is placed on e7 instead of f6.  It's clearly a common goal to induce h6 here, and yet h6 can be part of a kingside attack.  Black can respond with f6, h6, or ignore the pin.  I've played f6 before, but, to me, it seems awkward.  One of the reasons to play Ne7 is to leave the f pawn free to advance if appropriate, but if black proceeds with an eventual f5, the bishop is free to return to pin the knight.  Ignoring the pin can be dangerous, and h6 is frequently played in such situations.  As such, I chose it."
13,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqk2r/pp1pnpbp/4p1p1/6B1/2PNP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 3 7,"This is a common motif.

None of the materials I have on this position are written from the black perspective, and none of the ones written for white suggest it, but the move can have a real rationale for it:  Inducing g5 and playing Bg3 to control c7.  If black plays g5, white gets to play Bg3 with tempo.  Because of this, I'm still willing to play it, but I figure moves preparing it are necessary.  The pin is still there, but for the moment it seems safe to ignore."

Quite often the idea of Qd2 is to exchange the DS-bishop, but that is improbable here, and one of his strongest tactical ideas is Bg3.  This allows castling queenside, but this position isn't near enough to the Yugoslav attack lines favorable to white that it cannot be clearly good yet."

23,Be2,f1e2,r1bq1r2/1p1pnpbk/p1nNp1pp/8/2P1P2B/2N5/PP1QBPPP/R3K2R b KQ - 3 12,"I actually controlled d4, and he controls d5.  Both are loose goals of these openings, but I can't see how he can exploit d5 yet because of the e pawn.  And yet I move it?  He gains access to d5.  I fully gain access to d4.  And suddenly the contemplation of f5 is interesting.  CM later recommends f4, but I must ask, ""Why not play it now?""  I originally thought it should wait until after f6, but now thanks in part to analysis by dmaestro it's clear it should wait until white has prepared for the exf4 capture because of the subsequent piece-forking pawn advance.  I think castling kingside accomplishes this preparation."

27,Rd1,a1d1,r1bq1r2/1p1pn1bk/p1nN1ppp/3Np3/2P1P2B/8/PP1QBPPP/3RK2R b K - 1 14,Taking his advanced knight looks like he will get central authority out of it.  Perhaps I can kill two birds with one stone?
28,Nd4,c6d4,r1bq1r2/1p1pn1bk/p2N1ppp/3Np3/2PnP2B/8/PP1QBPPP/3RK2R w K - 2 15,His knight is now only supported by pawns.  His queen is too valuable to exchange for my knight.  His DS-bishop is out of place to challenge my knight.  His knight on d5 suddenly feels lifeless though I didn't recognize it yet.  I don't quite believe he did either.  The only problem with this move is that the knight on e7 is placed well for a Kingside expansion and this move allows the e7 knight to be exchanged.  I feel though that the move is necessary.  I had to keep the center closed to play on the flank.
29,Bg4,e2g4,r1bq1r2/1p1pn1bk/p2N1ppp/3Np3/2PnP1BB/8/PP1Q1PPP/3RK2R b K - 3 15,"I really had no intention of exchanging my central knight for his scopeless bishop.  His position is creaking, but I still feel his pressure.  The subsequent CM analysis says: Slightly better is Bd3.  Though CM cannot elaborate on why, I can:  flank attacks are going to be the order of the day.  One of the little chess rules of thumb about flank attacks is the center must hold.  Bd3 reinforces the center and should the white e pawn get exchanged, it will pin the g pawn."
