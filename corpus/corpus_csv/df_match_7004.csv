1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Standard stuff. I have recently shown preference to either the Nimzo or the Bogo Indian which have very similar plans. I used to prefer c5 to intiate the Benko Gambit which is exciting to play but these lines are safer against stronger players

5,g3,g2g3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/6P1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,Seems natural to chuck in the check to gain a tempo

7,Bd2,c1d2,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/6P1/PP1BPP1P/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 2 4,So i have reached a Bogo Indian position and white has not got Knight f3 in so if i am right i am a tempo up.

17,O-O,e1g1,r1b2rk1/ppppqppp/2n1p3/8/2PPn3/2B2NP1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 4 9,It is a pity but i think i am forced to take it now in case of Be1 which now raises the question whether the time spent doing it and damaging his pawn structure is worth it??

19,bxc3,b2c3,r1b2rk1/ppppqppp/2n1p3/8/2PP4/2P2NP1/P3PPBP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 10,I personally think it is but it is a matter of taste.
20,d6,d7d6,r1b2rk1/ppp1qppp/2npp3/8/2PP4/2P2NP1/P3PPBP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 11,The idea is now to play e5 and if d5 then we have transposed into a Nimzo of sorts without the usual counterplay for white as his bishop on g2 will be blocked in.
21,Qd3,d1d3,r1b2rk1/ppp1qppp/2npp3/8/2PP4/2PQ1NP1/P3PPBP/R4RK1 b - - 1 11,Preparing perhaps to go to e4? I do not really agree with this one. I think he had to play d5 or e4 straight away as this wastes time and allows me to play......

24,f5,f7f5,r1b2rk1/ppp1q1pp/2np4/4pp2/2PP4/2PQ2P1/P2NPPBP/R4RK1 w - - 0 13,Now i am trying to control e4 to prevent his knight going there.
25,e4,e2e4,r1b2rk1/ppp1q1pp/2np4/4pp2/2PPP3/2PQ2P1/P2N1PBP/R4RK1 b - - 0 13,Well now he blocks his own bishop it is simple to see my next move.
26,f4,f5f4,r1b2rk1/ppp1q1pp/2np4/4p3/2PPPp2/2PQ2P1/P2N1PBP/R4RK1 w - - 0 14,Somewhat annoying but after looking at this i could see he has no real threats but to avoid any checks i played safe with.....
27,Rab1,a1b1,r1b2rk1/ppp1q1pp/2np4/4p3/2PPPp2/2PQ2P1/P2N1PBP/1R3RK1 b - - 1 14,Somewhat annoying but after looking at this i could see he has no real threats but to avoid any checks i played safe with.....

29,h3,h2h3,r1b2r1k/ppp1q1pp/2np4/4p3/2PPPp2/2PQ2PP/P2N1PB1/1R3RK1 b - - 0 15,Not quite sure what he planned here. Perhaps he was thinking of g4??
30,b6,b7b6,r1b2r1k/p1p1q1pp/1pnp4/4p3/2PPPp2/2PQ2PP/P2N1PB1/1R3RK1 w - - 0 16,I am sure you are all seeing what comes next. The standard Nimzo Ba6 Na5 situation.
31,Kh2,g1h2,r1b2r1k/p1p1q1pp/1pnp4/4p3/2PPPp2/2PQ2PP/P2N1PBK/1R3R2 b - - 1 16,Step 1

36,c5,c7c5,r4r1k/p3q1pp/bp1p4/n1p1p3/1RPPPp2/2PQ1BPP/P2N1P1K/5R2 w - - 0 19,This is just bad for him. He is solidifying my pawn structure and ensuring his is weaker for the duration of the game. Additionally i am going to gain control of the open file.
37,dxc5,d4c5,r4r1k/p3q1pp/bp1p4/n1P1p3/1RP1Pp2/2PQ1BPP/P2N1P1K/5R2 b - - 0 19,This is just bad for him. He is solidifying my pawn structure and ensuring his is weaker for the duration of the game. Additionally i am going to gain control of the open file.

39,Ra4,b4a4,r4r1k/p3q1pp/bp6/n1p1p3/R1P1Pp2/2PQ1BPP/P2N1P1K/5R2 b - - 1 20,Got to be bad. Now if you look that rook will never make it out again the Knight and pawn control all the squares.
