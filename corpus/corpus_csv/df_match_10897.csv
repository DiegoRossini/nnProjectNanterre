1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This famous ecounter pitted the world champion Emauel Lasker against the sensational young Capablanca. Lasker proved that he wasn't yet ready to roll over and die before the next generation. Besides the historical significance of this game, this match is noteworthy for Laskers simple winning startegy, seemingly flowing right from the flowing. Simple for a master not for players like me! What this game lacks in brilliant combinations is more than made up Lasker's sheer elegance. At the end of the first half of this double-round tournament, Capablanca stood a point and a half ahead of his nearest rivals Lasker and Tarrasch. When he met Lasker again in the seventh of the ten final rounds, even a draw would virtually assure the Cuban of first place. But Lasker, the great chess psychologist, adopted an opening in which Black might indeed try for the advantage, but could not readily obtain a draw. The result was a great victory over a great opponent."
