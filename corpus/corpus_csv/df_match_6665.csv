d4 is a common opening for me."
2,h6,h7h6,rnbqkbnr/ppppppp1/7p/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I rarely see this move in my games so i wasn't familiar with the opening very much.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppppppp1/7p/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"I always hesitate to move my d or e pawns only up on space, I usually get my bishop locked in. In this game the middle hadn't developed much yet so I guessed that if I needed to move it I should have a better chance than normal."

6,a6,a7a6,rnbqkbnr/1pp1ppp1/p2p3p/8/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,Apparently likes to move his a and h pawns early in the game.
7,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/1pp1ppp1/p2p3p/8/2BP4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"hhhmmm, this is where i noticed him bringing his queen into battle too early in the game, although it may make your opponent feel unsafe, well....you'll see the problem with it soon."
