Things to learn from this game.

1. When attacking, putting presure should be priority.
2. It is very easy to lose advantage in the middle.
3. Understimating mate threats is very dangerous.
4. When in better position, relaxing causes bad moves.
5. A bad move may turn good, if opponent does not exploit its weakness."
