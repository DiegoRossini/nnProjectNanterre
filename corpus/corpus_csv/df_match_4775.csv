3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Normally I prefer the standard 2...d5, but it does one good to vary from time to time.  I like this version of Owen's Defence, deferring the central struggle for the time being.  But Black does have to watch that he doesn't allow White to shove a pawn wedge into his centre."

6,Bb7,c8b7,rn1qkbnr/pbpp1ppp/1p2p3/8/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,Bringing pressure against e4...
7,Bd3,f1d3,rn1qkbnr/pbpp1ppp/1p2p3/8/3PP3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 4,...to which White responds in sensible fashion.
8,d6,d7d6,rn1qkbnr/pbp2ppp/1p1pp3/8/3PP3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"Possibly this is too restrained - the GK engine 'thinks' so, indicating 4...c5.  Last time I played that I got my head handed to me.  The move played has the virtues of solidity and flexibility.  But it doesn't interfere with whatever plans White has in train."
9,c4,c2c4,rn1qkbnr/pbp2ppp/1p1pp3/8/2PPP3/3B1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"Also good was 5.0-0, but there was no reason not to seize as much central territory as he could hold..."
10,g6,g7g6,rn1qkbnr/pbp2p1p/1p1pp1p1/8/2PPP3/3B1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"Transforming the game into a Modern Defence - specifically, the Hippopotamus.  Black plans to bring White's centre under a crossfire of bishops.  But he has to be careful.  There is always the danger of the Hippo having his head shoved under and held there."
11,Bg5,c1g5,rn1qkbnr/pbp2p1p/1p1pp1p1/6B1/2PPP3/3B1N2/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 1 6,(!) A bit embarrassing for Black.
12,f6,f7f6,rn1qkbnr/pbp4p/1p1pppp1/6B1/2PPP3/3B1N2/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"(!?)  Apparently weakening, but it has its points.  For one thing, I just didn't fancy 6...Ne2 7.Bf6!, though, come to think of it, Black's game would not have been all that bad.  But Black has it also in mind to counter any advance White maks in the centre with an advance of his own.  Note that the Black pawns on the third rank advancing to the fourth obviate any 'en passant' captures, which might have been a nuisance."
13,Bh4,g5h4,rn1qkbnr/pbp4p/1p1pppp1/8/2PPP2B/3B1N2/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 1 7,"(!?)  Possibly 7.Be3 was an improvement, building up his centre.  This bishop could have, and probably should have, been chased back to g3 after this, where it would have been a target for Black's K-side pawns."
14,Nd7,b8d7,r2qkbnr/pbpn3p/1p1pppp1/8/2PPP2B/3B1N2/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 2 8,"(!?) OK, but 7...g5 was indicated, really.  I did concern myself with the possibility White would try a sac (7...g5  8.Nxg5 fxg5  9.Qh5ch Kd7  10.Bxg5...) but after 10...Qe8 it's not clear that White has much.  Would White have tried it on had I played ....g5?  I wasn't prepared to find out."
15,Nc3,b1c3,r2qkbnr/pbpn3p/1p1pppp1/8/2PPP2B/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 3 8,"(!?) 8...g5 was still playable, with a knight interposing after the bishop check: 8...g5  9.Nxg5?! fxg5  10.Qh5ch Ke7  11.Bxg5ch Ngf6  12.e5 dxe5  13.dxe5 Nxe5 and Black seems to escape with the extra piece."
16,Bg7,f8g7,r2qk1nr/pbpn2bp/1p1pppp1/8/2PPP2B/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 4 9,"(!?) 8...g5 was still playable, with a knight interposing after the bishop check: 8...g5  9.Nxg5?! fxg5  10.Qh5ch Ke7  11.Bxg5ch Ngf6  12.e5 dxe5  13.dxe5 Nxe5 and Black seems to escape with the extra piece."
17,O-O,e1g1,r2qk1nr/pbpn2bp/1p1pppp1/8/2PPP2B/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 5 9,"White's mobilization is just about complete, and he commands more space.  But Black is not far behind, and is ready for anything."
18,Ne7,g8e7,r2qk2r/pbpnn1bp/1p1pppp1/8/2PPP2B/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 6 10,"You might think White has much greater mobility, and it's true enough.  But, under no particular constraint by White, Black's game (in my view) contains a lot of potential energy.   Incidentally, there is no real concern that the respective knights will continue on to c6 and f6, taking four tempi to develop to squares reachable at the outset in two!"
19,Rc1,a1c1,r2qk2r/pbpnn1bp/1p1pppp1/8/2PPP2B/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/2RQ1RK1 b kq - 7 10,I have a feeling that this developing move lacked any real purpose.  Possibly White had in mind to advance the Q-side pawns and bust open the c-file with the advance of that pawn.
20,O-O,e8g8,r2q1rk1/pbpnn1bp/1p1pppp1/8/2PPP2B/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/2RQ1RK1 w - - 8 11,"With the completion of Black's mobilization, there still has been no contact between the respective armies - just a brief skirmish at g5.  But now White makes his first real strike."

The move is OK - there really wasn't anything doing with 12.Nb5 Qb8 -  but it does release quite a lot of the tension that existed along the #5 rank.  Black now casts his eye towards a K-side operation."
