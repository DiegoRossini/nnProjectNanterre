My only thought was to provide a escape square for my bishop upon b5, and to take control of the dark squares on the queen side with a eventual a5 but this is to weakening for such a double-edged opening, even more so that I had been thinking about castling long and pushing my king side pawns."

He should have developed his queen side.  I think that Nc5 would have been better.  If black can get his pieces out he will be better because of the weakening move a4 played by white (me)"

The king side.  With the bishop on a2 when I play hxg6 he won't be able to play the sometimes superior fxg6, limiting his options.  This always helps when you are attacking since the less options he has the less you have to consider."
