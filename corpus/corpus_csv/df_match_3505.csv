1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,Hi all! This is a game from an ongoing mini-tournament that I just had to annotate. The tactics and complications are simply too good to pass up! Enjoy!
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,"This was a thematic mini-tournament starting with just 1.Nf3, so almost any opening is open season through transposition. I'm not going to spend too much time on the opening itself, both because it's quiet and because I'd just end up saying 'we could still transpose into...' a lot."

After a quiet opening, Black fires the first shot, announcing his intention to break into the White King's position by force. This is probably the most common strategy to break a castle with a fianchettoed Bishop, when a Bishop-Queen battery isn't available to force a trade, like here. Another option would be the immediate ...e5 break, followed by shifting the Queen to d7, but I like this better anyway. More style."
