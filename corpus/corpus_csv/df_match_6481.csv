20,Bb7,c8b7,r2qk2r/pbppbppp/5n2/1p2N3/3PP3/2P5/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 4 11,"The pawn was undefended, but right now Nxe4?? runs into Qf3! where Black loses the knight as he defends against the mate threat on f7 (Nf6, Qxa8) Now, Black has two pieces attacking e4 and White has none defending it. Now, before I go on allow me to summarise the Evans Gambit link in my profile. It mentions two interesting ideas with Evans Gambit players; 1) White must be aggressive and 2) White would do well to stop Black from castling. Is there an aggressive move that stops Black from castling?"
21,Nxf7,e5f7,r2qk2r/pbppbNpp/5n2/1p6/3PP3/2P5/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 11,"!? Why, yes there is! :) I'm pretty sure that most of you are sitting there, scratching your heads and wondering how I could even consider sacrificing a piece against the Master Mater, but I had looked through this line many times and found it to be perfectly sound (to me). Allow me to explain that a little more; 1) I can get two pawns for the knight, and a one point material defect, to me, isn't losing at all. (In fact, that is a result of a normal Evans Gambit) 2) The only other move that saves the pawn is f3, which is a defensive move that also blocks the queen's scope to kingside..."

When I played 16.f4, I looked through lines where the Black Queen retreated down the g-file after f5; 17.f5 Qg4 18.h3 Qh5 19.g4 looks good (in case of 18...Qh4, either Kh2, intending g3 would to, or Bd2, intending Be1 would do) After Freddy played this move, I saw that the queen could go to c6 - these late discovering of moves happen to me quite often. Even worse though - this happens to me sometimes too..."

White doesn't want to exchange material (another thing mentioned in the link on my profile) and he reckons that he can weather the storm after Qc6 [A stupid idea anyway? I'll let the readers decide on that] However, 17.Qxg6 hxg6 18.g3 would have been best for White, as Freddy has a nifty little trick that not only forces off the queens..."
