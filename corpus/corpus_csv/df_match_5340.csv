1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,Black could have played into either a Pirc or a Phillador's (which does actually occur) here but chooses to keep the game in independent lines for at least a while
2,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,Black could have played into either a Pirc or a Phillador's (which does actually occur) here but chooses to keep the game in independent lines for at least a while

4,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/4P1b1/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 3,Black could have played into either a Pirc or a Phillador's (which does actually occur) here but chooses to keep the game in independent lines for at least a while
5,Bc4,f1c4,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/2B1P1b1/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 3,With the optomism of Bxf7+
6,e5,e7e5,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/2B1P1b1/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,Preparing d4 and taking the game into quite an unusual branch of the Philladors
7,c3,c2c3,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/2B1P1b1/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,Preparing d4 and taking the game into quite an unusual branch of the Philladors
8,Nf6,g8f6,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/2B1P1b1/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 5,This move certainly feels provocative but in all lines simply looks good for white. Perhaps Nf6 was a bit of a blunder
9,Qb3,d1b3,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/2B1P1b1/1QP2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 2 5,This move certainly feels provocative but in all lines simply looks good for white. Perhaps Nf6 was a bit of a blunder
10,Bh5,g4h5,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p2b/2B1P3/1QP2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 3 6,White isn't afraid of the doubled f-pawns as the rook can develop to g1 whilst the blocked dark square bishop and strong white grip of the centre should ensure relative king safety on the queen side. If black ever does manage to gain an attack then the extra centre pawn will allow white to liquify at his discretion and potentially punish any over extension.

22,Re8,f8e8,r2qr1k1/pQpnbppp/3p3B/4p2n/1PB1P3/2PP1P2/P4P1P/RN2K1R1 w Q - 1 12,"The thinking behind move is quite good as it simply improves Black's position a little bit. The pin is removed and c6, d5, ideas come into play where White's king could potentially get caught out and the light-squared bishop will prove to be misplaced."

I felt that Black should play c6 at this point though after, 0-0-0, d5, Bb3 White will have chances to fight back for the centre with an eventual Re1 whilst Black will struggle to progress."

The condensed nature of the position is making it difficult for White's extra pawn so far to have meaningful sway but creating a passed pawn on the wing gives White a simple plan of queenside expansion that makes improving the position much easier than before.
