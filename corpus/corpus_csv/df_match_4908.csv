2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"My favorite Scandinavian, that is not good."
3,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Other moves are possible and possibly better. But the whole point for me is to ""demostrate"" that the principle of not to get out the queen so early is not always true... if you know what to do with it."
4,Qxd5,d8d5,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Other moves are possible and possibly better. But the whole point for me is to ""demostrate"" that the principle of not to get out the queen so early is not always true... if you know what to do with it."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"The good move for white here involves d4 and c4, but most people plays this one, in the sensible principle that developing with tempo can't be bad."
6,Qe5+,d5e5,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/4q3/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"This check is done mostly because I want to retreat the queen in c7, after c6. Still, white has to think which defence is better. I think Ne2 is slightly better, since it support a near-to-come Bf4, but any move is good, here."
7,Qe2,d1e2,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/4q3/8/2N5/PPPPQPPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 3 4,"This implies an early queen's exchange. I can retreat the queen, but it will be ""hanging around"", chased by white's minor pieces, all the game. And the ""logic"" Nc6 fails to QxQ, NxQ, Nb5, that threats Nc7+. The fork can be avoided only by Na6, that gives an unconfortable square (and game) for black."
8,Qxe2+,e5e2,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/8/2N5/PPPPqPPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"This profilactic move is half-forced. The other way is e4 and after Nb5, Bd3, NxB, cxN. This can be playable, but I don't like to play without the bishop in a most likely endgame. Still, I have to find the right way to develop my pieces here, and it is still dubious black can make it to an equal position."
9,Bxe2,f1e2,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/8/2N5/PPPPBPPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 0 5,"This profilactic move is half-forced. The other way is e4 and after Nb5, Bd3, NxB, cxN.

10,c6,c7c6,rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/8/2N5/PPPPBPPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 0 6,"This profilactic move is half-forced. The other way is e4 and after Nb5, Bd3, NxB, cxN.

11,d3,d2d3,rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/8/2NP4/PPP1BPPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 0 6,"d4 only helps me, because of Bf5, threatening c2. White tried (in countless previous games) either Bd1 or Bd3. The latter allows BxB and cxB. Incredibly enough, the doubled central pawns are not easy to attack, and I am not satisfied with the resulting game. Probably better is Bg6, where BxB, hxB provides me with a semi open column that whorts something - not much, to be true."
12,Bf5,c8f5,rn2kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/5b2/8/2NP4/PPP1BPPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 1 7,"Anyway, just to bring out the piece so Nd2 doesn't jail the bishop. But e5 can be an option, trying to keep white's dsb out of the f4 outpost."
13,g4,g2g4,rn2kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/5b2/6P1/2NP4/PPP1BP1P/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 0 7,Interesting and good.
