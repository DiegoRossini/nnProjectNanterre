1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"We begin with a Caro Kann - not my favorite.  I hardly ever play the thing, but, looking for a change I had forgotten I had played recently in a Mini-Tournament with precisely this opening (the Panov-Botvinnik Attack, withal).  That MT was not a success for me: 1 win, 4 draws and 3 losses."
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"We begin with a Caro Kann - not my favorite.

3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"The usual, though 2.Nc3 is quite a good alternative."
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"With 2...g3, Black could turn the thing into a Modern Defence.  But this central challenge is the most often played."
5,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3P4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"Exchanging is not the only method.  White also has 3.Nc3 (probably the most popular), 3.Nd2 and 3.e5 (The Advance Variation).  Interesting that these three are the most popular third moves against the French Defence as well."
6,cxd5,c6d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,3...Qxd5 seems pointless.
7,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"This is the aggressive Panov-Botvinnik Attack, a line that has certain affinities to the Queen's Gambit Declined.  This is what I have usually played on the White side (steering for the Gunderam Attack), but here I have the Black pieces.  A good alternative for White is 4.Bd3!? - The Rubinstein Attack."
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,Also playable is 4....e6.
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 5,"My favorite line is 5.c5 - the Gunderam Attack.  The idea is at once to establish a Queen side (pawn) majority in the hope of [a] obtaining a past pawn or two  and/or [b] imposing a bind on Black's Q-side.  In the Mini-Tournament earlier mentioned, this didn't work out so well, though a game shortly afterwards (vs veldhuiazaria) went my way after a very tough struggle."
10,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 3 6,"(!?) Herzog Defence.  I know 'Herzog' means 'Duke', but the temptation to an Anglophone such as myself is to mispronounce, just a little: the 'Hedgehog' Defence.   Not that it's very hedgehoggy.  Slightly more usual is 5...e6."
11,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/3p4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 4 6,"Jo opts for straightforward development, though 6.Bg5 was a good alternative."
12,Bg4,c8g4,r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/3p4/2PP2b1/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 5 7,"Choosing to develop this bishop outside the pawns.  Shortly afterwards I began to have doubts about this, as will be explained shortly..."
13,cxd5,c4d5,r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/3P4/3P2b1/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"The motivation for this exchange is not very clear to me.  It does release the tension in the centre, but leaves White with an 'isolani' - an isolated Queen's Pawn - sitting on a file half-open for Black's rooks.  On the other hand there is - or used to be - potential for White to develop a quick K-side attack by bringing the bishops to d3 and g5.   As it transpired, White's pawn structure was of no serious concern until very late in the game."
14,Nxd5,f6d5,r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/2n5/3n4/3P2b1/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,"Instead, 7...Bxf3 has been tried, but has not, according to the Gameknot World Database, proved very successful for Black.  Far more popular has been this standard recapture."
15,Qb3,d1b3,r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/2n5/3n4/3P2b1/1QN2N2/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 1 8,Now things get interesting.  White strikes at the centre but also towards the b7-pawn.
16,Nb6,d5b6,r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/1nn5/8/3P2b1/1QN2N2/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 2 9,"Cautious, though Black also has it in mind to play...Nxd4 subsequently.  An alternative was ...Bxf3, but, as earlier mentioned I was having doubts about this.  The upside of this capture is the doubling of pawns on the f-file, and White is left with her whole pawn structure shattered.  But I felt that the open g-file and more active game would have gone a long way to compensate for that.  But without exchanging on f3, the bishop sortie to g4 seems lacking in purpose.  So maybe ...e6 ought to have been played instead of ...Bg4, and then deploy the piece to d7."
17,Be3,c1e3,r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/1nn5/8/3P2b1/1QN1BN2/PP3PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 3 9,"White still has a range of options: 9.Ne5 or, most often played, 9.d5.  Against the pawn advance, though, Black's record has been quite good."
18,Bxf3,g4f3,r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/1nn5/8/3P4/1QN1Bb2/PP3PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 10,"(!?) A big decision.  Fact was, I couldn't find anything better, and this exchange, damaging to White's structure as it is, makes a lot of sense.  But I felt that White received rather less harm than it looked by this; the bishops being very mobile pieces, and Black's position on the Q-side looking rather fragile.  Incidentally, according to the GK engine, we has departed from 'the book' a move back, but all this had been played before.  As it turned out, we would transpose back in the 'book' a move later..."
19,gxf3,g2f3,r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/1nn5/8/3P4/1QN1BP2/PP3P1P/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 10,"'Book'.  But I seriously considered 10...g7 here.  This would have gone some way to neutralise the g-file, but I was worried that it was too slow.  Of course, if I wanted to develop the bishop, scarcely any other move came into consideration.  But it is already late in the day for mobilizing Black's King side..."
20,e6,e7e6,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/1nn1p3/8/3P4/1QN1BP2/PP3P1P/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 11,"'Book'.  But I seriously considered 10...g7 here.  This would have gone some way to neutralise the g-file, but I was worried that it was too slow.  Of course, if I wanted to develop the bishop, scarcely any other move came into consideration.

21,O-O-O,e1c1,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/1nn1p3/8/3P4/1QN1BP2/PP3P1P/2KR1B1R b kq - 1 11,"Annoyingly good, but there was no way to stop this.  White's King position looks pretty loose, but Black has no attack.   All the same, I felt that 11.Rg1 would also have created difficulties for Black."
22,Be7,f8e7,r2qk2r/pp2bppp/1nn1p3/8/3P4/1QN1BP2/PP3P1P/2KR1B1R w kq - 2 12,Finally running out of Book.  The game is too close to call here.
