1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I'm most comfortable with Queen's Pawn Gambit
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Standard
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Queen's Pawn Gambit
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,Standard
5,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p2B1/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 2 3,I'm always mixed on this move. It often ends badly for me.
6,dxc4,d5c4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/6B1/2pP4/8/PP2PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Accepts the gambit one move later
7,Bxf6,g5f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5B2/8/2pP4/8/PP2PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,I decided to double the pawns as I never get a lot of use out of my dark squared bishop anyway
8,gxf6,g7f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5p2/8/2pP4/8/PP2PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,I was surprised here as it destablizes an king side castle but keeps the king's pawn available for central control
9,e4,e2e4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5p2/8/2pPP3/8/PP3PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,Take the center
10,e5,e7e5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2p1p/5p2/4p3/2pPP3/8/PP3PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,Meets the move
11,d5,d4d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2p1p/5p2/3Pp3/2p1P3/8/PP3PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,I thought the awkward pawn structure was worth keeping. I didn't want to trade queens nor did I like 6. ... exd4

14,Bxc3+,b4c3,rnbqk2r/ppp2p1p/5p2/3Pp3/2p1P3/2b5/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 8,This surprised me. I think it removes his good bishop and allows me a stronger pawn chain
15,bxc3,b2c3,rnbqk2r/ppp2p1p/5p2/3Pp3/2p1P3/2P5/P4PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 8,I'll take it

17,exf5,e4f5,rnbqk2r/ppp2p1p/8/3PpP2/2p5/2P5/P4PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 9,I thought this was better trying to protect my pawn
18,Bxf5,c8f5,rn1qk2r/ppp2p1p/8/3Ppb2/2p5/2P5/P4PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 10,Takes
