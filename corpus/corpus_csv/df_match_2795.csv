1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,e4 open to me is the strongest move from any opponent.  d4 runs a close second choice to e4 open.  I am Black and my usual is the Caro Kann against e4....
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,...and so it is my most comfortable defense against the strongest White Open: e4.
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,A strong and expected response to the seemingly diminutive first move of Caro Kann Defense.
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,The usual thing to do here in Caro Kann...
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,A usual thing for White to do....
6,dxe4,d5e4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/3Pp3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,a usual thing for me to do...
7,Nxe4,c3e4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/3PN3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,the usual expected response to my usual.  Now comes the Caro Kann Defense to attack the knight:
8,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/5b2/3PN3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,A usual Caro Kann maneuver--but keep in mind Caro has more options in most times to usual moves by White to deal with the diminutive Caro Kann c6 defense to e4.....
9,Ng3,e4g3,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/5b2/3P4/6N1/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 5,My bishop is out and he needs to avoid capture.  I have to place him in a safe yet ready place for use.
10,Bg6,f5g6,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p3b1/8/3P4/6N1/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 3 6,Best place and the usual for Caro Kann.
11,Nf3,g1f3,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p3b1/8/3P4/5NN1/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 4 6,This is an expected move for White to make.  In fact White has been doing the standard moves since e4 open on my favorite: The Caro Kann.
12,e6,e7e6,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p1b1/8/3P4/5NN1/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,I inch forward with another seemingly diminutive move....
13,Be2,f1e2,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p1b1/8/3P4/5NN1/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,"Usually I would have expected White to apply pressure King Side by going after my Q Bishop.  Not the case here. However, on the surface, this seems to be a safe move for White allowing 0-0 in the next move.  This is where White, who should be on the Offensive, becomes Defensive.  White should either attack and go out in a blaze of glory or resign or play a long game against a slow Black Defense like the Ruy Lopez.  Or Giuoco Piano. Or French Defense.  I am set in my ways.  The Caro Kann can suddenly turn the tables with attack at any time."
14,Bd6,f8d6,rn1qk1nr/pp3ppp/2pbp1b1/8/3P4/5NN1/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 8,Castling for White in a protective ensconced corner of the board is now under contemplation....
15,O-O,e1g1,rn1qk1nr/pp3ppp/2pbp1b1/8/3P4/5NN1/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 3 8,White castles.
16,Nd7,b8d7,r2qk1nr/pp1n1ppp/2pbp1b1/8/3P4/5NN1/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 4 9,Standard for Caro Kann.
17,Be3,c1e3,r2qk1nr/pp1n1ppp/2pbp1b1/8/3P4/4BNN1/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 5 9,A build up around the White King while developing.
18,Ngf6,g8f6,r2qk2r/pp1n1ppp/2pbpnb1/8/3P4/4BNN1/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 6 10,The other Knight coming into sequence and position with the other Knight coming across more laterally than vertically--in Caro Kann the Knights are used beyond the usual defenses.  They act in sequence like two rooks mated.
19,c4,c2c4,r2qk2r/pp1n1ppp/2pbpnb1/8/2PP4/4BNN1/PP2BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 10,White is pushing Infantry at the expense of the range of his Bishops....
20,h6,h7h6,r2qk2r/pp1n1pp1/2pbpnbp/8/2PP4/4BNN1/PP2BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 11,Since White is locking himself down into defense my only choice is to continue an attack.  It continues with another diminutive move common in the Caro Kann.
