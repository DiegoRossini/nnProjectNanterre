1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,Here is a relatively short game where I found an intriguing sacrifice idea. It begins with an orthodox kind of opening sequence.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 2,Standard Reti stuff.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,Standard Reti stuff.
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,Claiming more of the centre while it's available.
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,Claiming more of the centre while it's available.
6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,Challenging the centre.
7,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3P4/3P4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"Nc3 is more ""mainline"", but I chose this because after 4...dxc4 white has to spend a tempo on regaining the weak pawn later on."
8,Qxd5,d8d5,rnb1kb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3q4/3P4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"More aggressive than Nxd5, but will need to retreat/sidestep immediately."
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1kb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3q4/3P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,Free development with a tempo attack.
10,Qd6,d5d6,rnb1kb1r/ppp1pp1p/3q1np1/8/3P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,"Creating more presence in the centre, and threatening a cheap fork on e5."
11,e4,e2e4,rnb1kb1r/ppp1pp1p/3q1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"Creating more presence in the centre, and threatening a cheap fork on e5."
12,Qb4,d6b4,rnb1kb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/8/1q1PP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,"Black avoids the fork, and pins the knight, threatening white's e4 pawn. It also prevents white's dsb from developing."
13,Qa4+,d1a4,rnb1kb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/8/Qq1PP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 2 7,"Offering the exchange. Black's Queen has moved three times already, so is behind in development. If the exchange is accepted then white will lose the e4 pawn though."
14,Qxa4,b4a4,rnb1kb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/8/q2PP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 0 8,Accepted
15,Nxa4,c3a4,rnb1kb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/8/N2PP3/5N2/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 8,Another free tempo for white. The knight must move straight back to f6 - d6 would just be plain horrible.
16,Nxe4,f6e4,rnb1kb1r/ppp1pp1p/6p1/8/N2Pn3/5N2/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 0 9,Another free tempo for white. The knight must move straight back to f6 - d6 would just be plain horrible.
17,Bd3,f1d3,rnb1kb1r/ppp1pp1p/6p1/8/N2Pn3/3B1N2/PP3PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 1 9,Another free tempo for white. The knight must move straight back to f6 - d6 would just be plain horrible.
18,Nf6,e4f6,rnb1kb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/8/N2P4/3B1N2/PP3PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 2 10,Completing development and aiming at the weak c pawn.
19,Bf4,c1f4,rnb1kb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/8/N2P1B2/3B1N2/PP3PPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 3 10,Completing development and aiming at the weak c pawn.
20,c6,c7c6,rnb1kb1r/pp2pp1p/2p2np1/8/N2P1B2/3B1N2/PP3PPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 11,"Tucking the king away and connecting the rooks. White is far ahead in development, but does have three pieces hanging."
21,O-O,e1g1,rnb1kb1r/pp2pp1p/2p2np1/8/N2P1B2/3B1N2/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b kq - 1 11,"Tucking the king away and connecting the rooks. White is far ahead in development, but does have three pieces hanging."
22,Bg7,f8g7,rnb1k2r/pp2ppbp/2p2np1/8/N2P1B2/3B1N2/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w kq - 2 12,"Claiming the long diagonal, and preparing to castle."
23,Rfe1,f1e1,rnb1k2r/pp2ppbp/2p2np1/8/N2P1B2/3B1N2/PP3PPP/R3R1K1 b kq - 3 12,Now if black castles white will regain the pawn.
24,e6,e7e6,rnb1k2r/pp3pbp/2p1pnp1/8/N2P1B2/3B1N2/PP3PPP/R3R1K1 w kq - 0 13,"Keeping the black King from castling. White's dsb isn't easily chased away from the d6 square. Black could look at Bf8, but would be exchanging exactly half of his active army, and would still lose the right to castle on the kingside."
25,Bd6,f4d6,rnb1k2r/pp3pbp/2pBpnp1/8/N2P4/3B1N2/PP3PPP/R3R1K1 b kq - 1 13,"Keeping the black King from castling. White's dsb isn't easily chased away from the d6 square. Black could look at Bf8, but would be exchanging exactly half of his active army, and would still lose the right to castle on the kingside."
26,Nbd7,b8d7,r1b1k2r/pp1n1pbp/2pBpnp1/8/N2P4/3B1N2/PP3PPP/R3R1K1 w kq - 2 14,"Bringing the knight away from the rim. If black exchanges then white can de-isolate the d pawn, and create chances for a rook planted on d1."
27,Nc5,a4c5,r1b1k2r/pp1n1pbp/2pBpnp1/2N5/3P4/3B1N2/PP3PPP/R3R1K1 b kq - 3 14,"Bringing the knight away from the rim. If black exchanges then white can de-isolate the d pawn, and create chances for a rook planted on d1."

29,Nxe6,c5e6,r1b1k2r/p2n1pbp/1ppBNnp1/8/3P4/3B1N2/PP3PPP/R3R1K1 b kq - 0 15,"Curiosity was the deciding factor in this move. A piece for two pawns and a (hopefully) strong attack on a somewhat awkward position seemed sound. Rxe6 may have been an interesting option, but black has time to respond before white can gain enough advantage to justify being a rook down."
