1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I am actually not going to annotate this entire game. I am a bit sick lately and more sick because I just lost a game I should have won had it not been for my lack of seriousness at the end, and my telling myself ""don't worry there is not checkmate he can pull on you for now"". I do not think the game is necessarily eventful in any particular way until about move 25 or so. Both my opponent and I make decent moves as well as mistakes and blunders along the way. It is my big blunder at the end that I hope offers some lessons to some poor soul out there."
