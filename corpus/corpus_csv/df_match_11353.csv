1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The parrot is a demon two-knights defender and he plays the sicilian like Don Corleone. So the horse is wise to open on the queen side.  (Gratuitous boasting of course, but these are my annotations!)"
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,White has chosen a sort of Queen's gambit declined position to avoid the Nimzo.  Do I play c5 myself ?

6,c6,c7c6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,Hmm .. this is a sort of Slav defence or something .. will it weaken my Queenside ?
7,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/2PP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,This has transposed into a Slav
8,dxc4,d5c4,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/8/2pP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,I didn't consult my opening book for this.  Is it right ?
9,Bxc4,f1c4,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/8/2BP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,This reminds me of some of the Benoni positions I used to play and always lose...
