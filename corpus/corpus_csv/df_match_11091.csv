1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The Philidor Defense, considered inferior to the Queen's Knight and Petroff Defense because it blocks in the dark-squared bishop. Oddly there is no recorded game where Philidor played this."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The Philidor Defense, considered inferior to the Queen's Knight and Petroff Defense because it blocks in the dark-squared bishop. Oddly there is no recorded game where Philidor played this."

5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"Challenging Black's center, and trying to open up the game."
6,f6,f7f6,rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/3p1p2/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Defending the center, a poorer move than Nd7 or exd4. This unfortunately takes Black's Knight's best square and weakens the Black Kingside."
7,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/3p1p2/4p3/2BPP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,Developing the Bishop which turns out to be the key piece in the combination.
8,Ne7,g8e7,rnbqkb1r/ppp1n1pp/3p1p2/4p3/2BPP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,I think Nd7 was best here.
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1n1pp/3p1p2/4p3/2BPP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 5,"Dxe5 immediately was best but I didn't see that then, I just developed normaly."

12,fxe5,f6e5,rnbqkb1r/1pp1n1pp/p2p4/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"b5 or Nbc6 here were much much better, this was his first real blunder."
