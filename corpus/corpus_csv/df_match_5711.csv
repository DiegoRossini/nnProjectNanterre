1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"i do enjoy annotating the games that i won, there are many games that i lost, but i don't like to remember them, i think this is a human behaver and i think majority of people do the same, so expect to see me smiling with joy at the end of this game.
disregard what i said and let us start :
please note that i will use these abbreviations :
N = knight
B = bishop
o-o or o-o-o = castling
K = king
Q = queen
P = pawn
R = rock 
i like this starting move because it control the center and open the way to Q and B"
