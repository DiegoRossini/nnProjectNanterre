But if he wishes to succeed with his own attack he will have to detail at least one piece for that purpose. What is his plan of attack in the present circumstances? The only possible one is to advance the RP and exchange it for the QNP; then he will occupy the QR file with a Rook and attack the QNP with R and B. It is possible to calculate exactly the number of moves required in this process. That number is 4 moves; on the 5th move the QNP will be attacked twice. Now what of White? Again there is only one possible plan: the opening of the KN file. This will also require 4 moves, but on the 4th move the KBP will already be under attack. Had Black not lost one or two moves in his earlier maneuvers HIS threat would be the first to mature."
