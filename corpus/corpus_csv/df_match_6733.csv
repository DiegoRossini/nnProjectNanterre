1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Most of my wins involving mating attacks have involved Class C or Class D players.  Just for once my opponent was just 30 points shy of being a fellow Class A Player at the start of our game.  Yet he resigned on the grounds of unavoidable mate on move 21.  You are no doubt wondering, how in the heck did I manage to overcome passivitis in this game!  Well, read on.  This game starts as a 3 knights opening, the fireworks begin on move 4."
