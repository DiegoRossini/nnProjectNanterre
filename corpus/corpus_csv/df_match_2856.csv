1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

I recently managed to add another Expert Draw to my growing collection.  This time it was against Battlefleet (Stephen), Brigadecommander's (Janet's) brother.  This match started as a Queen's Gambit Accepted.  Although Stephen managed to win his pawn back, somehow, I managed to exchange the right pieces at the right time and create a solid position that convinced Stephen to make me an offer that I was loathe to refuse.  So, how did this happen?  Well, read on."

I thought this move was good because there are no pawns on the a or c column to drive Fou Lenoir off that square.  The draw offer comes next move and I accept it.  Gameknot analysis proved white to have a slight advantage.  I am pretty chuffed by this much needed result which put my rating back into the 1930s - just.  I hope you all have a good read.
