I joined GameKnot to especially get practice against d4, so I'm glad to get this test."
2,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I experimented with the Leningrad Dutch maybe ten years ago in a couple of tournament games, got scared, and put it aside. Recently, I tried to give it another try, and I got a book on the Dutch (the Classical Dutch, the Leningrad, and the Stonewall). And thanks to brMichael who let me experiment with something wild, I felt comfortable enough to try it in a match. Am I crazy, or what? Will our captain shoot me for learning a defense in a match? We'll see."

The Stonewall would put pawns on d5 and c6 (not fun for Black's QB, but not easy for White to break through. The Leningrad plays g6 and fianchettoes the bishop."

The book I read strongly recommended that it's important in the Dutch to be able to recognize when it's time to liquidate the pawn structure and shift it to something else. If he really wants that bishop on b2, I want to lock his pawn on d4.
And I felt comfortable switching to the Stonewall because I had just finished that practice game with brmichael where I played the Stonewall, tried something wild, he beat my unsound attack, but I felt I gained some intuition into the defense. (So brmichael gets an assist if I win this game!)"

I think c6 would be the natural move here to complete the Stonewall, but he's playing passively. I figure in every game, at least one person has to be attacking, and if my opponent wants to be passive, then it must be me who should be doing the attacking. (Don't worry, he'll punch back soon enough.) 
I don't remember which pawn I was planning to take back with if he captures the knight. Maybe I hadn't decided, because there's things I like about both. I like giving my rook a half-open file with fxe4. But I also like the threat of moving the pawn to f4. Yeah, I'd probably recapture with the d-pawn for that reason. But I don't think he wants to trade off that bishop for the knight, so I didn't think I'd have to face that choice, and he can't take with the knight because my pawn forks his knight & bishop."

My bishop's pretty week, but then I can think about getting it to e8 and out to the kingside. I don't remember for sure, but I seem to remember thinking he might play Ndf3 so he could recapture with his other knight if I trade."

If I'd given him time to play Ndf3, he could recapture with a knight, and the only way I'd ever get rid of the knight from that outpost would be to trade off my strong bishop. The way it stands now, he'll have a pawn on e5, and the square won't be of any value for his knight."

It gives his bishop on b2 a little more scope and keeps the kingside a little bottled up. I want to open the kingside, because I don't think his pieces, especially the bishop on b2, are well placed to defend. And they certainly don't scare me as an attacking force."

I've described to people that I play a kind of chess that relies on serendipity. I put my pieces on good squares and then expect good things to happen. If your pieces are on better squares than your opponent, then you'll have better opportunities than he does. And I also saw a quote from Karpov a few weeks ago in a game I was showing my students. He said if you aren't sure what to do, find your piece that's on the worst square and move it to a better square."

My queen's putting pressure on the e-pawn that doesn't have a pawn to defend it, and the bishop that could protect it is out of play. Oh, yeah, the threat Ng3 is mean. I win a rook or queen on the fork because his pawn is pinned and wouldn't be able to take the knight."
