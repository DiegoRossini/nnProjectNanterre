1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"As usual, I aim for an open game."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Not something I see OTB very often as most opponents these days opt for semi-open lines like the French or Sicilian.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,An unusual move order.  4... b5 or 4....Nf6 are much more common.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,An unusual move order.  4... b5 or 4....Nf6 are much more common.
5,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,An unusual move order.  4... b5 or 4....Nf6 are much more common.
6,a6,a7a6,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,An unusual move order.  4... b5 or 4....Nf6 are much more common.
7,Ba4,b5a4,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,An unusual move order.  4... b5 or 4....Nf6 are much more common.
8,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk1nr/1pppbppp/p1n5/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,An unusual move order.  4... b5 or 4....Nf6 are much more common.
9,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk1nr/1pppbppp/p1n5/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 3 5,"I castle anyway, not seeing any new opportunities or dangers offered by the odd move order."
10,b5,b7b5,r1bqk1nr/2ppbppp/p1n5/1p2p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 6,"We've now transposed back into a main line Ruy Lopez Orthodox Defence, with Black still having the option of launching Marshall's Gambit.  Anti-Marshall moves include an early a4 or h3."
11,Bb3,a4b3,r1bqk1nr/2ppbppp/p1n5/1p2p3/4P3/1B3N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 6,"We've now transposed back into a main line Ruy Lopez Orthodox Defence, with Black still having the option of launching Marshall's Gambit.  Anti-Marshall moves include an early a4 or h3."
12,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/2ppbppp/p1n2n2/1p2p3/4P3/1B3N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 7,"We've now transposed back into a main line Ruy Lopez Orthodox Defence, with Black still having the option of launching Marshall's Gambit.  Anti-Marshall moves include an early a4 or h3."
13,Re1,f1e1,r1bqk2r/2ppbppp/p1n2n2/1p2p3/4P3/1B3N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq - 3 7,"We've now transposed back into a main line Ruy Lopez Orthodox Defence, with Black still having the option of launching Marshall's Gambit.  Anti-Marshall moves include an early a4 or h3."
14,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/2ppbppp/p1n2n2/1p2p3/4P3/1B3N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 w - - 4 8,"We've now transposed back into a main line Ruy Lopez Orthodox Defence, with Black still having the option of launching Marshall's Gambit.  Anti-Marshall moves include an early a4 or h3."
15,h3,h2h3,r1bq1rk1/2ppbppp/p1n2n2/1p2p3/4P3/1B3N1P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQR1K1 b - - 0 8,"Recently, I've been using the latter, even though it does offer Black the chance to force the swap of my LSB by playing ..Na5 before I've provided the B with an escape route."
16,d6,d7d6,r1bq1rk1/2p1bppp/p1np1n2/1p2p3/4P3/1B3N1P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQR1K1 w - - 0 9,So now Black plays the more conservative 8...d6.  An immediate 8...Na5 would have given away the pawn on e5.  8...d5 is now less effective with g4 unavailable for Black's LSB or N.
17,c3,c2c3,r1bq1rk1/2p1bppp/p1np1n2/1p2p3/4P3/1BP2N1P/PP1P1PP1/RNBQR1K1 b - - 0 9,and now I have time to create my bolthole for my B.
18,Na5,c6a5,r1bq1rk1/2p1bppp/p2p1n2/np2p3/4P3/1BP2N1P/PP1P1PP1/RNBQR1K1 w - - 1 10,"This B has now made 4 out of the first 10 moves, which seems to go against all opening principles but it has also caused Black to use at least 3 moves to push it back, including putting his knight on the rim, where it is dim ... Now the B bolsters e4 and points indirectly at Black's castled position, with plenty of potential for effectiveness later in the game.  The Ruy Lopez is typically a slowly developing game with plenty of potential attacks forthcoming, once White has established his pieces on good squares."
19,Bc2,b3c2,r1bq1rk1/2p1bppp/p2p1n2/np2p3/4P3/2P2N1P/PPBP1PP1/RNBQR1K1 b - - 2 10,"This B has now made 4 out of the first 10 moves, which seems to go against all opening principles but it has also caused Black to use at least 3 moves to push it back, including putting his knight on the rim, where it is dim ...

20,c5,c7c5,r1bq1rk1/4bppp/p2p1n2/npp1p3/4P3/2P2N1P/PPBP1PP1/RNBQR1K1 w - - 0 11,"Typically, Black plays to restrict the power of White's threatened central thrust.  Black usually follows up by recentralising the QN and developing Q and B."
21,d4,d2d4,r1bq1rk1/4bppp/p2p1n2/npp1p3/3PP3/2P2N1P/PPB2PP1/RNBQR1K1 b - - 0 11,"I play the pawn thrust anyway.  I've been experimenting on Gameknot recently with lines involving d3 first, in the fashion of Michael Adams, but I don't have his skill in strangling opponents and often end up too cramped myself."
22,exd4,e5d4,r1bq1rk1/4bppp/p2p1n2/npp5/3pP3/2P2N1P/PPB2PP1/RNBQR1K1 w - - 0 12,"?!  Surprising and, I think, not very good, as it unleashes my e-pawn.  I'd expected either 11...Nc6 or 11...cxd4."
23,cxd4,c3d4,r1bq1rk1/4bppp/p2p1n2/npp5/3PP3/5N1P/PPB2PP1/RNBQR1K1 b - - 0 12,Clearly the point of Black's previous move: Black contests the e-file with this rook and probably plans to redevelop his DSB on g7.
24,Re8,f8e8,r1bqr1k1/4bppp/p2p1n2/npp5/3PP3/5N1P/PPB2PP1/RNBQR1K1 w - - 1 13,Clearly the point of Black's previous move: Black contests the e-file with this rook and probably plans to redevelop his DSB on g7.

26,Bf8,e7f8,r1bqrbk1/5ppp/p2p1n2/npp5/3PP3/5N1P/PPBN1PP1/R1BQR1K1 w - - 3 14,Black continues his plan and I continue with  mine ...
27,Nf1,d2f1,r1bqrbk1/5ppp/p2p1n2/npp5/3PP3/5N1P/PPB2PP1/R1BQRNK1 b - - 4 14,"!?  This took me by surprise but I couldn't see any advantage to this over the more normal ...Qc7 or continuing with redeploying the DSB.  Later in the game, though, the Q provided a useful defence of Black's third row from here."
28,Qb6,d8b6,r1b1rbk1/5ppp/pq1p1n2/npp5/3PP3/5N1P/PPB2PP1/R1BQRNK1 w - - 5 15,"!?

29,Ng3,f1g3,r1b1rbk1/5ppp/pq1p1n2/npp5/3PP3/5NNP/PPB2PP1/R1BQR1K1 b - - 6 15,I decided to make this thrust before I'd completed my development as Black's QN and DSB were still out of position.
30,g6,g7g6,r1b1rbk1/5p1p/pq1p1np1/npp5/3PP3/5NNP/PPB2PP1/R1BQR1K1 w - - 0 16,I decided to make this thrust before I'd completed my development as Black's QN and DSB were still out of position.
