1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Since both players are (obviously) way above my playing level, there is a good chance that I'll miss a lot of ideas/points/trick behind the moves of both sides. I'm just warning you now... ;)"
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"Alekhine's defence. I don't know much theory behind this opening, but I'll take a guess that Black hopes for counter-attacking options against White..."
3,e5,e4e5,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/4P3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Timman's knight move prompts this move - Short is able to get a tempo attack against him...

6,d6,d7d6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p4/3nP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"This move was played to perhaps weaken Short's centre control in the near future, as well as opening up a path for the light square bishop"
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p4/3nP3/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"As I'm following the GK database to check the moves played so far [as I've said, I don't have a lot of experience with this line], I can tell that both sides are still in mainline theory. This knight development is defined as the modern variation of Alekhine's defence."
8,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p2p1/3nP3/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"!? According to GK, Bg4 is played more here (followed by dxe5, with this move coming in third place). This is defined as the fianchetto variation, as of course is completely playable."
9,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p2p1/3nP3/2BP4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,"Before Timman can fianchetto his bishop, he needs to save his knight! [this is now called the keres variation according to GK]"
