1,b3,b2b3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Playing in a tournament and again this is my first win.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,My opening was pawn to b3 and black moved his pawn to e5.  I want to fianchetto and attack that e5 pawn.
3,d3,d2d3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/1P1P4/P1P1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"I moved another pawn to d3, coming out quietly but with protection and no sacrifice for black."
4,h6,h7h6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1pp1/7p/4p3/8/1P1P4/P1P1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Black comes down the h file with pawn to h6.  Black may be preparing for on his attack on the king side.
5,Bb2,c1b2,rnbqkbnr/pppp1pp1/7p/4p3/8/1P1P4/PBP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,I bring out my DB to b2 accessing the diagonal.
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1pp1/2n4p/4p3/8/1P1P4/PBP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,Black next move is Nc6.  Protecting his pawn at e5 and covering some central squares.
7,e3,e2e3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1pp1/2n4p/4p3/8/1P1PP3/PBP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,I move my pawn to e3 allowing my queen to get access to h5 diagonal.  Also I now have places for my knights to develop safely.
8,Bb4+,f8b4,r1bqk1nr/pppp1pp1/2n4p/4p3/1b6/1P1PP3/PBP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,Black develops his DB to b4 and checks my king.
9,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqk1nr/pppp1pp1/2n4p/4p3/1b6/1PNPP3/PBP2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 2 5,I move my knight to c3 blocking the check on my king and developing my knight with my bishop at b2 protecting my knight.
10,d6,d7d6,r1bqk1nr/ppp2pp1/2np3p/4p3/1b6/1PNPP3/PBP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,Black pushes his d pawn out to d6 to protect his e5 pawn.
11,Nge2,g1e2,r1bqk1nr/ppp2pp1/2np3p/4p3/1b6/1PNPP3/PBP1NPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,I develop my knight to e2 and join my knights up so they can protect each other.
12,Bg4,c8g4,r2qk1nr/ppp2pp1/2np3p/4p3/1b4b1/1PNPP3/PBP1NPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 7,Now black decides to attack my e2 knight with his LB on g4.  I don't expect this to affect white too much as the bishop can be knocked back quite easily.
13,h3,h2h3,r2qk1nr/ppp2pp1/2np3p/4p3/1b4b1/1PNPP2P/PBP1NPP1/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,I move my pawn to h3 attacking the LB.
14,Bh5,g4h5,r2qk1nr/ppp2pp1/2np3p/4p2b/1b6/1PNPP2P/PBP1NPP1/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,Black could have taken and doubled my pawns on the h file but instead retreats to h5 but I may not be finished yet with that LB.
15,g4,g2g4,r2qk1nr/ppp2pp1/2np3p/4p2b/1b4P1/1PNPP2P/PBP1NP2/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,So I push my g pawn getting development and pushing the LB again.
16,Bg6,h5g6,r2qk1nr/ppp2pp1/2np2bp/4p3/1b4P1/1PNPP2P/PBP1NP2/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 9,Black's LB moves again to g6 and I think I am probably looking better in terms of development as black has had to make 3 moves with his LB and I have gained development whilst defending.
17,Bg2,f1g2,r2qk1nr/ppp2pp1/2np2bp/4p3/1b4P1/1PNPP2P/PBP1NPB1/R2QK2R b KQkq - 2 9,I now move my LB out to g2 to access a diagonal to a8 and allowing my king to castle.
18,d5,d6d5,r2qk1nr/ppp2pp1/2n3bp/3pp3/1b4P1/1PNPP2P/PBP1NPB1/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 10,Black pushes pawn d6 to d5 which again wastes a move.  Perhaps better would have been to make that move at the start and then he could have been moving his g8 knight out with that last move.
19,d4,d3d4,r2qk1nr/ppp2pp1/2n3bp/3pp3/1b1P2P1/1PN1P2P/PBP1NPB1/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 10,I move d3 to d4 giving me a chain of pawns and attacking his e5 pawn whilst the pawn is protected by the knight at e2..
20,exd4,e5d4,r2qk1nr/ppp2pp1/2n3bp/3p4/1b1p2P1/1PN1P2P/PBP1NPB1/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 11,Black captures my d4 pawn and attacks my c3 knight.
