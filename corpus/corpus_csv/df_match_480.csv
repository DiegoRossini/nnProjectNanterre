1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game is the main claim to fame of both Hamppe and Meitner, and has been reprinted widely. The variation of the Vienna Game it uses was named the Hamppeâ€“Meitner Variation in honour of the two players. The game was played in the 19th-century Romantic style, in which rapid development and attack were considered the most effective way to win, where many gambits and counter-gambits were offered (and not accepting them was considered slightly ungentlemanly), and where material was often held in contempt. These games, with their rapid attacks and counterattacks, are often entertaining to review even if some of the moves would no longer be considered the best by today's standards. In the game, Black sacrifices huge amounts of material to drive the white king to his back rank and attempt to force checkmate, but White spectacularly manages to force a draw by perpetual check."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,So the game start conventionally enough.
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"This is the Vienna Game, an opening which Hamppe made major contributions to, giving his name to two variations in the Vienna Gambit."
4,Bc5,f8c5,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,"2...Nf6 is more usual. This move is offbeat, but certainly playable."
5,Na4,c3a4,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/N3P3/8/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 3 3,"Better would be 3.Nf3! d6 4.d4 and White has a slight advantage. The move is premature; although many lines of the Vienna have White trying to obtain the bishop pair with this move, the bishop can still retreat to e7, and the knight is not ideally placed at a4."
6,Bxf2+,c5f2,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/N3P3/8/PPPP1bPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"The quiet 3...Be7 would be better and less risky, especially since the move played may in fact lead to a win for White with best play. A bishop sacrifice is commonly seen in reply to an early knight attack in various lines, including this one."
7,Kxf2,e1f2,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/N3P3/8/PPPP1KPP/R1BQ1BNR b kq - 0 4,Of course white does not want to be materially down.
8,Qh4+,d8h4,rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/N3P2q/8/PPPP1KPP/R1BQ1BNR w kq - 1 5,"Black attacks, and forks king and e4 pawn."
9,Ke3,f2e3,rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/N3P2q/4K3/PPPP2PP/R1BQ1BNR b kq - 2 5,The only way to save the e4 pawn. If 5. Kf3 then Qf4 drives the king away from the protection of the e4 pawn.
10,Qf4+,h4f4,rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/N3Pq2/4K3/PPPP2PP/R1BQ1BNR w kq - 3 6,Black checks again.
11,Kd3,e3d3,rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/N3Pq2/3K4/PPPP2PP/R1BQ1BNR b kq - 4 6,White obviously doesn't want to lose the e4 pawn.
12,d5,d7d5,rnb1k1nr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/N3Pq2/3K4/PPPP2PP/R1BQ1BNR w kq - 0 7,"Black tries to open up the position, in order to get at the wandering white king."
13,Kc3,d3c3,rnb1k1nr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/N3Pq2/2K5/PPPP2PP/R1BQ1BNR b kq - 1 7,"Although 7.Qe1 is usually given as a refutation of this line, with 7...dxe4+? 8.Kc3 e3?! 9.Kb3! Be6+ 10.Ka3 where Black has nothing left, Black need not play 7...dxe4+?, and in fact better is 7...Nf6! (Schiller's move) 8.g3! dxe4+ 9.Kc3 Qg4 10.Bh3 Nd5+ 11.Kb3 Nc6!! (11...Qg6!? is unclear) 12.Bxg4! Na5+ 13.Ka3 Nc4+ 14.Kb3 Na5+ with an equal position. 7. Kc3 is perhaps the best move."
14,Qxe4,f4e4,rnb1k1nr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/N3q3/2K5/PPPP2PP/R1BQ1BNR w kq - 0 8,Threatening the Na4
15,Kb3,c3b3,rnb1k1nr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/N3q3/1K6/PPPP2PP/R1BQ1BNR b kq - 1 8,"Better for White than this curious king move would be 8.d4!? exd4+ 9.Qxd4!! Qe1+ 10.Bd2! Qxa1 11.Nf3 Qxa2 (an alternative is 11...Nc6!? 12.Qxg7 Be6 13.Nc5! 0-0-0 14.Nxe6 fxe6 15.Qxh8 Qxa2 16.Bg5 where White has a large advantage) 12.Qxg7 Qxa4 13.Qxh8 d4+ 14.Nxd4 Qa5+ 15.Kb3 Qxd2 16.Qxg8+ Ke7 17.Qxc8 Qxd4 18.Bc4! and White has a winning advantage, but must find several very difficult moves."
16,Na6,b8a6,r1b1k1nr/ppp2ppp/n7/3pp3/N3q3/1K6/PPPP2PP/R1BQ1BNR w kq - 2 9,Threatening 9...Qb4#.
17,a3,a2a3,r1b1k1nr/ppp2ppp/n7/3pp3/N3q3/PK6/1PPP2PP/R1BQ1BNR b kq - 0 9,"This move is a crucial mistake, after which Black forces the draw in a breathtaking manner. White can win here more easily than at the previous move with 9.d4! exd4 10.Bxa6 bxa6 11.Nc5 or 9.c3! Bd7 10.Ka3 b5 11.d4 bxa4 12.Bxa6 Qxg2 13.Qf3! Qg6 14.Qxd5 Bc6 15.Bb5."
18,Qxa4+,e4a4,r1b1k1nr/ppp2ppp/n7/3pp3/q7/PK6/1PPP2PP/R1BQ1BNR w kq - 0 10,"A spectacular queen sacrifice, preventing White from playing Nc3 and Ka2, after which Black has insufficient compensation for his material disadvantage. The move forces the draw that follows."
19,Kxa4,b3a4,r1b1k1nr/ppp2ppp/n7/3pp3/K7/P7/1PPP2PP/R1BQ1BNR b kq - 0 10,"White of course, virtually has to accept."
20,Nc5+,a6c5,r1b1k1nr/ppp2ppp/8/2npp3/K7/P7/1PPP2PP/R1BQ1BNR w kq - 1 11,Black checks.
