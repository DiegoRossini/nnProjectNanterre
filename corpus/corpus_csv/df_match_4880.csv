1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Yup, you will come across a scene that is all too familiar.  I get a reasonable game against a Master and look as though I will be able to hold out for a Master Draw then it all goes belly up.  Indeed, I even had high hopes of a Master Victory in this game, particularly as I was the white player in a Ruy Lopez Exchange Variation.  If you are the white player in the Exchange Variation, you should be doing all you can to ensure that you a. keep the existing pawn structure intact and b. exchange down to a K & P ending, as my opponent Paolo, inflicted this on me in my game against him which I annotated as follows.http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/an-expert-lesson-in-how-to-play-k-amp-p-endings?gm=15275.  Sadly, although I managed to exchange down to a single rook ending, still keeping the kingside pawn majority while so doing, it was that wretched black rook that turned the game in my opponent's favour.  So the way Ken kept me tied down in that ending until I eventually cracked (I did not want to wait for the executioner like I did against Master Drhpatron - game annotated as follows http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/moving-the-king-in-the-opening?gm=38665) sucked big time - I am really, really trying to break the Experts' and Masters' psychological hold over me.  One day, I just hope it will finally come.  Anyhow, here is the Gameknot Analysis version:-http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15970775&rnd=0.3195287162576994"
