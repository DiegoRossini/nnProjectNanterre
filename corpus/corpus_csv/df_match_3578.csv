1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,My opponent says he has had better luck with d4 openings.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"My standard response, prevents (usually e4), develops my Knight."
3,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/6B1/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 2 2,"Aggressive, it seems to me!"
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/6B1/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"This is my typical next move, prepares for d5, slows down White's pawns."
5,e4,e2e4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/6B1/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,He has taken the center.
6,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/ppppbppp/4pn2/6B1/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"The Game DB really liked h6 here.  Maybe I should have done that, but I decided to develop more methodically with Be7, enabling castling. I was probably too conservative here."
7,e5,e4e5,rnbqk2r/ppppbppp/4pn2/4P1B1/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,White is aggressive!  He puts the question to my Knight.
8,Ne4,f6e4,rnbqk2r/ppppbppp/4p3/4P1B1/3Pn3/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"This was not in the database (Game DB). White must take.  The Queen re-takes.  White probably challenges my Knight with Nd2.  My opponent, who likes daring moves, would probably like me to sacrifice my Knight at f2, bring my Queen to h4 and start an attack.  White should be able to take the center pawns; so I'd be down only a pawn. It would teach White a lesson for pushing pawns so early in the game, which he cannot easily support if I act quickly and with daring. Hmmmm."
9,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqk2r/ppppbppp/4p3/4P1B1/3Pn3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 2 5,"White surprises me!  I don't win his piece, because the Black Knight has nowhere to go after h4.  I will attack his center with c5, and win his rook pawn on g5.  This promises to be a wild game, but first I must oblige him and take his Bishop with my Knight."
10,Nxg5,e4g5,rnbqk2r/ppppbppp/4p3/4P1n1/3P4/3B4/PPP2PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,"Even after White's h4, Black has the better game. More than equality.  So White is playing tactics here, counting on an error and a fierce attack to win the day.  I expect h4.

I will counterplay in the center with c5, ultimately taking White's d pawn and opening avenues for my Queen to get in on the fun, maybe with Qa5+, or Qb6, Qb4+.

Alternatively, my Knight moves back to e4, lets the Bishop take him, then pushes d5; White takes en passant, exd6, cxd6, and Black ends up with a nice center, good development, the Bishop pair, maybe also White's KR pawn, though that gives White some attacking chances. Still, it seems as if White should be punished more.  Hmmmm."
11,f4,f2f4,rnbqk2r/ppppbppp/4p3/4P1n1/3P1P2/3B4/PPP3PP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 0 6,Another surprise.
12,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/2n1p3/4P1n1/3P1P2/3B4/PPP3PP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 1 7,Developing my Knight.
13,fxg5,f4g5,r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/2n1p3/4P1P1/3P4/3B4/PPP3PP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 0 7,"I expected to lose the Knight, to the h pawn, to the f pawn, or to the Bishop on d3."
14,Nxd4,c6d4,r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/4p3/4P1P1/3n4/3B4/PPP3PP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 0 8,"This is the harder pawn to capture. If Qg4, then either Nc6, or Nxc2+, exchanging the Knight for the Rook or maybe ultimately winning it.

It will be hard to White to keep the g- and e-pawns now.  His attacking chances will soon peter out (I hope!)."
15,a3,a2a3,r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/4p3/4P1P1/3n4/P2B4/1PP3PP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 0 8,"I think he needed to develop a piece, Nc3 or Nf3.  If he was worried about Bb4+, I'd have to prepare to avoid a fork of my Knight and Bishop.  He does not have time for this move.  I suppose he might have tried h5, or at some point even g6.  He'd lose the pawn anyway and he could mess up my pawn structure."
16,d6,d7d6,r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/3pp3/4P1P1/3n4/P2B4/1PP3PP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 0 9,"Maybe 9. exd6, Qxd6, but my opponent might have a more aggressive play in mind."
17,c3,c2c3,r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/3pp3/4P1P1/3n4/P1PB4/1P4PP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 0 9,"No great moves here, but I would have developed a piece, like Nf3."
18,Nc6,d4c6,r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/2npp3/4P1P1/8/P1PB4/1P4PP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 1 10,"Black sits well. White will likely exchange pawns, and Black has a nice strong center, and at least one pawn up."
19,Nh3,g1h3,r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/2npp3/4P1P1/8/P1PB3N/1P4PP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 2 10,"I had expected exd6. But my opponent explained that he wanted to castle and put pressure on f7, which explains why he did not post his Knight on f3.  But . . . are his attacking chances worth the pawn he gave up on e5?  Of course, I don't think so.  But time will tell."
20,Nxe5,c6e5,r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/3pp3/4n1P1/8/P1PB3N/1P4PP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 11,White is down two.
