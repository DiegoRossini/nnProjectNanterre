9,h3,h2h3,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/2B1P1b1/3P1N1P/PPP2PP1/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,simple defence white brings pawn to h3 to pressure the knight.

12,Bg6,h5g6,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1nb1/4p3/2B1P1P1/3P1N1P/PPP2P2/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 7,"knight has now retreated back in 3 moves to g6 while white has opened up their king side. Looking at the white pawns, they seem to have a good position."
13,Bg5,c1g5,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1nb1/4p1B1/2B1P1P1/3P1N1P/PPP2P2/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 2 7,white brings out the bishop to g5 to pin down blacks knight which is in front of the black queen. Seems what comes arround comes arround to now put pressure on black just as black attempted.
14,Be7,f8e7,rn1qk2r/ppp1bppp/3p1nb1/4p1B1/2B1P1P1/3P1N1P/PPP2P2/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 3 8,black simply brings bishop to e7 to open the black knight for movement and at same time protects the queen
15,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qk2r/ppp1bppp/3p1nb1/4p1B1/2B1P1P1/2NP1N1P/PPP2P2/R2QK2R b KQkq - 4 8,white brings out knight on the queen side to b3. Looks as though white will be able to castle on the queen side soon.
16,Nbd7,b8d7,r2qk2r/pppnbppp/3p1nb1/4p1B1/2B1P1P1/2NP1N1P/PPP2P2/R2QK2R w KQkq - 5 9,bishop to d7 in front of the queen. This seems  not to be a better move than to c6. I'm not sure why? Will have to see how this pans out. I might of chosen c6 to allow the space in d7 to remain open for my queen. I do like the flexibility of not having to castle so quick that you have not telegraphed your play to the openent. I do think the queen will be out and eventually make black the ability to castle on the queens side.
17,Qd2,d1d2,r2qk2r/pppnbppp/3p1nb1/4p1B1/2B1P1P1/2NP1N1P/PPPQ1P2/R3K2R b KQkq - 6 9,white brings the queen to d2. While black has not committed to castling on the queen side white seems to only have this choice in order to have the best defence.
18,h6,h7h6,r2qk2r/pppnbpp1/3p1nbp/4p1B1/2B1P1P1/2NP1N1P/PPPQ1P2/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 10,black pressures white bishop by bringing out pawn to h6.

20,Nxf6,d7f6,r2qk2r/ppp1bpp1/3p1nbp/4p3/2B1P1P1/2NP1N1P/PPPQ1P2/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 11,black knight moves from d7 to take the bishop on f6. Looks like a good trade by black. This also has the d7 spot open now.
