1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,A usual opening from my friend.
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"My reaction is Caro-Kann. I don't really know how to play it, or I can play it well, but I don't use this very often."
3,Qf3,d1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 1 2,Whoa! That made me a bit confused. Did he really want to win with Scholar's mate? Did he think it seriously?
4,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2p5/4p3/4P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Hm... I just didn't want him to play d4. In case he had just wanted to confuse me a move driving into Scholar's mate, but wanted to have his queen in the battlefield."
5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2p5/4p3/2B1P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 1 3,Sholar's mate??? Are you serious??? :D
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2p2n2/4p3/2B1P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 2 4,He can't play Qxf7# :D
7,d3,d2d3,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2p2n2/4p3/2B1P3/3P1Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 0 4,"It was good to open the way for his DSB. If he plays Bg5, I will have doubled pawns. I must play something against it!"
8,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p2n2/3pp3/2B1P3/3P1Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 0 5,I played this in order to avoid having troubles with the f7 pawn.
9,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p2n2/3Pp3/2B5/3P1Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 0 5,He exchanges!
10,cxd5,c6d5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/5n2/3pp3/2B5/3P1Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 0 6,"I complete the exchange, again attacking his bishop."
11,Bb5+,c4b5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/5n2/1B1pp3/8/3P1Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 1 6,"Now, he played this. I have some choices, but I chose to bring the knight out. In my opinion, it was a time losing move, he didn't develop any pieces, but I could, on the other hand, he didn't have any choices, just to save the bishop."
12,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/1B1pp3/8/3P1Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 2 7,"So, I blocked with the knight. Later on, it will turn out that it was a good choice."
13,Qe2,f3e2,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/1B1pp3/8/3P4/PPP1QPPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 3 7,"As you can see, my knight is pinned, so my e5 pawn has no defender."
14,Bd6,f8d6,r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2nb1n2/1B1pp3/8/3P4/PPP1QPPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 4 8,Bd6 seemed to me the best to play.
15,Bxc6+,b5c6,r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2Bb1n2/3pp3/8/3P4/PPP1QPPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 0 8,"Now, he excanges, again."
16,bxc6,b7c6,r1bqk2r/p4ppp/2pb1n2/3pp3/8/3P4/PPP1QPPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 0 9,"Only option: I'm not in check, I have an e and a d pawn, both of them are defended, so I can say I control the centre."
17,Bf4,c1f4,r1bqk2r/p4ppp/2pb1n2/3pp3/5B2/3P4/PPP1QPPP/RN2K1NR b KQkq - 1 9,"Now, my pawn is pinned! I cannot take his bishop. I ought to move something which defends my e5 pawn and also make an end of the pin."
18,Qe7,d8e7,r1b1k2r/p3qppp/2pb1n2/3pp3/5B2/3P4/PPP1QPPP/RN2K1NR w KQkq - 2 10,"I could easily play this, because he puts no pressure on my queenside and not either on my kingside. I don't have to take care of that."
19,Nf3,g1f3,r1b1k2r/p3qppp/2pb1n2/3pp3/5B2/3P1N2/PPP1QPPP/RN2K2R b KQkq - 3 10,Blunder. This is why I wanted to make an end of the pin. I think he played this because he din't notice that the pin has been abolished.
20,exf4,e5f4,r1b1k2r/p3qppp/2pb1n2/3p4/5p2/3P1N2/PPP1QPPP/RN2K2R w KQkq - 0 11,"So, I took his bishop, and I also opened the e file. It's good for me because if he takes my queen, I can recapture withmy bishop (later on, I had te take care due to I had to keep my bishop on the a3-f8 diagonal), but if I manage to capture his queen, his only possible move to capture it with his king. And the a6-c8 diagonal is opened, that can be important, because if I move my bishop on the a3-f8 diagonal, my pawn would be out of defender and that can elicit his king to capture it."
