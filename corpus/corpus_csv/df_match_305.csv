8,Bxe6,c8e6,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4bn2/8/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"The lead in developement by black is well balanced by the d and c pawns. But white must not throw them into the front so quickly, and his good developement is not very dangerous for black."
9,d4,d2d4,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4bn2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"Here, white's best is Bf4, getting into the diagonal the first. I can hunt it with Nh5, white vn go to e5, hoping in f6, so to weaken e6 for the next stages, and then retire in g3, and if NxB, hxN and white has the semiopen column as a plus."

It was just not the best plan. o-o-o was much more to the point. Even Bh3 was not all that good, white is not forced to castle Kside, and I don't want to exchange my B for Nf3 at all."
