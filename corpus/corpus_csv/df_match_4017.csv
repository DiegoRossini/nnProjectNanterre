13,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/6B1/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 7,"This is the diagnostic move of the Richter-Rauzer variation which is quite unlike the Sozin in its strategic aims. The Sozin is a positional system that puts steady pressure primarily on Black's center, and White typically castles toward his KR. In the Richter-Rauzer White initiates an often bluntly tactical K-side attack usually featuring a raging pawnstorm, and so he almost always castles long the better to facilitate it. Mixing the systems can be done, but because their goals are dissimilar pursuing both strategies at once can easily lead to a confused game for White."
14,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/1p2bppp/p2ppn2/6B1/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 8,"A fashion that comes and goes. This thrust used to be played commonly, then fell out of favor after White started sacking on b5, often getting lasting positional pressure for the piece, plus all those joined, unopposed Q-side pawns staring Black into the endgame. The move has lately come back into fashion as defensive resources have improved, and the complications no longer favor White as much as they once did. Still, Black walks on brittle ice and must play the defense very precisely if White accepts the challenge to sac a piece, as he does here."
