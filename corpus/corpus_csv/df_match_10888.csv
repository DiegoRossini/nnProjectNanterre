1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The notations are looking at black position. It would be better if you click 'flip the board'. If I say 'left side' I mean right side if you are having white down.

This is toucanyahoo vs me. We don't know each other. This is also my sixth game so I'm not a very experienced player on gameknot.

White plays the e4. I mostly answer with e5 but I wanted to try something else. Not that this is very original..."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,d5. I was hoping for exd5 because I know how to play those games. Instead he played e5.  Nothing wrong with that.
3,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3pP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Maybe I should have played d4 here. The chess game database says c5,Bf5,d4 here. But I took the one after that, Nc6, threathening the pawn."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3pP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"White is making a massive pawn structure here, and I can't do anything about that."
5,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3pP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"White is making a massive pawn structure here, and I can't do anything about that."
6,Bf5,c8f5,r2qkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3pPb2/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,Just developing my pieces here.
7,Bd3,f1d3,r2qkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3pPb2/3P4/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 4,"Threathening my bishop. I could take d4 with my knight here, but the next move would be c3. Then I would have taken his bishop. (if you don't understand; 4Bd3, Nxd4 5c3 Bxd3 6 Qxd3) I thought the best thing to do here was just taking the bishop right away so I wouldn't lose any tempo and loss in development."
8,Bxd3,f5d3,r2qkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3pP3/3P4/3b4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,"Off course, not with the c-pawn. Taking it with the queen is much better."
9,Qxd3,d1d3,r2qkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3pP3/3P4/3Q4/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 0 5,"Off course, not with the c-pawn. Taking it with the queen is much better."
10,e6,e7e6,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/3pP3/3P4/3Q4/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 0 6,making my pawn stronger and trying to put my black bishop out.
11,Ne2,g1e2,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/3pP3/3P4/3Q4/PPP1NPPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 1 6,There were a lot of other possibilities here for white.
12,f6,f7f6,r2qkbnr/ppp3pp/2n1pp2/3pP3/3P4/3Q4/PPP1NPPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 7,threathening white pawn structure.
13,f4,f2f4,r2qkbnr/ppp3pp/2n1pp2/3pP3/3P1P2/3Q4/PPP1N1PP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 7,"instead of taking the pawn, white makes his pawn structure only stronger."
14,Nb4,c6b4,r2qkbnr/ppp3pp/4pp2/3pP3/1n1P1P2/3Q4/PPP1N1PP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 1 8,"threathening the queen. This is a very bad move, I dont understand why I did this. 8 Qb5  Nc3 9 Qxb7 Ng-e7

However, toucanyahoo surprisingly played Qh3."
15,Qh3,d3h3,r2qkbnr/ppp3pp/4pp2/3pP3/1n1P1P2/7Q/PPP1N1PP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 2 8,"I could go for Nxc2 here, making white unable to castle and taking his rook, but my knight can't go out of a1. The next move would probably Qxe6  and that doesn't look good either. I wouldn't get his Queen out of there. 

If you don't understand; 8 Qh3 Nxc2  9 Kd1 Nxa1 10 Qxe6 

So I didn't want his Queen at e6. Thats why I did f5."

This might give me some trouble on the left."
