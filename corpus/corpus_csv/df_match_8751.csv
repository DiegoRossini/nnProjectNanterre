2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I don't like the queen's pawn opening as much as the ""classic"" king's pawn, but I got used to it a little by now since it seems to be popular, at least against me. ;)"
3,h3,h2h3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/7P/PPP1PPP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Pretty defensive move at this point, I got nothing out, against what is he defending right now?"
4,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/3P4/7P/PPP1PPP1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,So I turn around the routine of trying to get the pawn out of the centre.
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/3P4/5N1P/PPP1PPP1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,He didn't want and I didn't want a double pawn so I just stepped forward. It opens up a nice line for my black bishop.
6,c4,c5c4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3p4/2pP4/5N1P/PPP1PPP1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,He didn't want and I didn't want a double pawn so I just stepped forward. It opens up a nice line for my black bishop.

8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p4/2pP1B2/5N1P/PPP1PPP1/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,"By now I thought I stood pretty nicely, solid pawn line, only very little figures out."

Obviously the king's side is more attractive, so I probably fooled no one here."
