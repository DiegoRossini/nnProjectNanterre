1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

This game was played nearly two years ago against my mentor, Ionadowman.  It has only been now that I could bring myself to annotate it as I was the victim here.  Some mistakes stay in the memory for a long time.  I had almost forgotten that game until my buddy Bob Jacobs lost big material in a recent game (which I will be annotating shortly as The Perils of Giving a Check) against me because he was lulled into a false sense of security by giving a check - it therefore revived the painful memories and I thought that some catharsis was necessary to try and get this loss out of my system once and for all.  One constructive way of doing this is to put this annotation into the Knights Coaching Project Forum because I feel it will be a useful learning tool for the guys who are taking part in Master Freddy's minefield of a Knights Coaching Project Mini-tournament.  Anyhow, the game becomes a Four Knights Game.   We start with the move 1. e4 which is a common starter among players and especially recommended to beginners because it opens lines for the WB on c1 - also to the WQ who can get to h5 - although Master Freddy played the Patzer Opening against me, regicide manuals do not recommend it to beginners!"
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,3. ..... Nf6 - this follows the opening principles of knights before bishops.  All four knights are in play so this is called The Four Knights Opening.

Nd5 - Ion does not recapture with Nxd4 - Qxd4?? is scuicidal because the WQ who in this instance I call the Wicked Witch of the West (enemy queen and very wicked she can be!) will drop to the black knight placed on c6.  This move is called The Belgrade Gambit - possibly because it was popular in that particular country!

You wouldn't think this move would be possible would you?  It is when your opponent finds himself in Old Matey's shadow (threatened with mate) and has no holding checks available to escape from the discovered attack.
