1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The King's Pawn opening. This is my normal opening move as white. I learned this move at a chess club at high school when I was 14, as it frees the queen and light-square bishop."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Scandinavian defence. My opponent is obviously looking to develop his queen should I capture his pawn...
3,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"...which is exactly what I do, transposing to the Lasker variation. I couldn't resist here, as I do like to create space to give my pieces more freedom..."
4,Qxd5,d8d5,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"...but it prompts him to bring out his queen into the centre of the board to get ahead in development, keeping with the Lasker variation..."
5,Qf3,d1f3,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"...so I bring out mine to contest the long light diagonal. The first time I remember this in a mini-tournament game, my opponent captured my queen, allowing my knight to come out and recapture..."
6,Qe5+,d5e5,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/4q3/8/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"...but she doesn't capture her just yet, she moves across to check my king..."
7,Qe3,f3e3,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/4q3/8/4Q3/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 3 4,...so I put mine in front of him to keep chasing her around...
8,Qxe3+,e5e3,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/8/4q3/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"...and this time she captures her, making me think ""which pawn to I use to recapture?""..."
9,dxe3,d2e3,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/8/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 0 5,...and I decide to use my queen's pawn to keep a more even connection on both sides.
10,Bf5,c8f5,rn2kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/5b2/8/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 1 6,This series of moves allowed him to develop his bishop...
11,Bd3,f1d3,rn2kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/5b2/8/3BP3/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 2 6,...so I develop mine to contest the b1-h7 diagonal...
12,Bxd3,f5d3,rn2kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/8/3bP3/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 0 7,"...forcing an exchange. I have two connected pawns on one side of the hole, and five on the other. Was he inviting these exchanges?"
13,cxd3,c2d3,rn2kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/8/3PP3/PP3PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 0 7,"...forcing an exchange. I have two connected pawns on one side of the hole, and five on the other. Was he inviting these exchanges?"
14,Nc6,b8c6,r3kbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/8/8/3PP3/PP3PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 1 8,He now develops his knight...
15,Nf3,g1f3,r3kbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/8/8/3PPN2/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 2 8,...so I do the same...
16,O-O-O,e8c8,2kr1bnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/8/8/3PPN2/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 3 9,"...and as he castles queenside, his rooks are now four squares apart, so my knight is eyeing up the f7 square, hoping to win a rook."
17,Ng5,f3g5,2kr1bnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/6N1/8/3PP3/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 4 9,"So I advance my knight to the 5th rank to attack the f7 square. There was one snag: his knight can cover by moving to h6, and my pawn on e3 is blocking the bishop's path..."
18,Nh6,g8h6,2kr1b1r/ppp1pppp/2n4n/6N1/8/3PP3/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 5 10,"...so he does the expected move, covering the f7 square with his knight."
19,O-O,e1g1,2kr1b1r/ppp1pppp/2n4n/6N1/8/3PP3/PP3PPP/RNB2RK1 b - - 6 10,"What was I doing castling kingside, when my pawn on d3 was under attack from my rook?"
