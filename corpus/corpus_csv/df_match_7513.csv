1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"My opponent begins with the Queen's Pawn, which is slower for castling than the more popular King's Pawn."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"My standard response is Nf6, with the hope of a King's Indian.  I play against Queen's Pawn openings quite regularly, one of the great players in Costa Coffee specialises in it enjoying the slow tactical manoeuvring that he can achieve."
3,Bf4,c1f4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P1B2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 2 2,"Perhaps trying for the London System?  I've always felt Nf3 first is the better move.  I suppose it is to stop my Knight on f6 from threatening the Bishop since after e3 I'd lose the Knight via Qxh5.  I could just be rambling here, I'm not all that familiar with anyone playing Bf4 before 2.Nf3."
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/3P1B2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,I'm looking at playing Bd6 as soon as I can place it in a defend able position to challenge the f4 Bishop.
5,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/3P1B2/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,Looking at attacking the weaker Kingside with a fianchetto.
6,b6,b7b6,rnbqkb1r/p1pp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/3P1B2/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Looking at attacking the weaker Kingside with a fianchetto.
7,Nd2,b1d2,rnbqkb1r/p1pp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/3P1B2/4P3/PPPN1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,Was expecting c3 here.
8,Bb7,c8b7,rn1qkb1r/pbpp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/3P1B2/4P3/PPPN1PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 2 5,Pins White's g2 Pawn and begins my threats on the White Kingside.
9,h3,h2h3,rn1qkb1r/pbpp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/3P1B2/4P2P/PPPN1PP1/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"Offers an escape the the White Bishop in case I play Nd5?  Not what I had in mind however, I'm still looking at the eventual Bd6 to shift that Bishop."
10,d5,d7d5,rn1qkb1r/pbp2ppp/1p2pn2/3p4/3P1B2/4P2P/PPPN1PP1/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"Now my Pawns are developed into the centre, I can play Bd6 without blocking my development."
11,Ngf3,g1f3,rn1qkb1r/pbp2ppp/1p2pn2/3p4/3P1B2/4PN1P/PPPN1PP1/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,Possibly just developing for the Kingside castle?
12,Bd6,f8d6,rn1qk2r/pbp2ppp/1p1bpn2/3p4/3P1B2/4PN1P/PPPN1PP1/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 7,"The killer attack on the White f4 Bishop, planned from the beginning.  This move is why I dislike the London System, White now struggles to find decent play."
13,Ne5,f3e5,rn1qk2r/pbp2ppp/1p1bpn2/3pN3/3P1B2/4P2P/PPPN1PP1/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 3 7,"Now the Ngf3 becomes more obvious, allowing White to defend his f4 Bishop.  However, this closes off the Bishop quite nicely, so other than being aware of the problem of Nxf7 I am happy to ignore it."
14,O-O,e8g8,rn1q1rk1/pbp2ppp/1p1bpn2/3pN3/3P1B2/4P2P/PPPN1PP1/R2QKB1R w KQ - 4 8,Looking at castling on the Kingside.
15,Bd3,f1d3,rn1q1rk1/pbp2ppp/1p1bpn2/3pN3/3P1B2/3BP2P/PPPN1PP1/R2QK2R b KQ - 5 8,Looking at castling on the Kingside.
16,c5,c7c5,rn1q1rk1/pb3ppp/1p1bpn2/2ppN3/3P1B2/3BP2P/PPPN1PP1/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 9,I'm attempting to destabilise his Pawn structure.
17,c3,c2c3,rn1q1rk1/pb3ppp/1p1bpn2/2ppN3/3P1B2/2PBP2P/PP1N1PP1/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 9,Finally.
18,Nc6,b8c6,r2q1rk1/pb3ppp/1pnbpn2/2ppN3/3P1B2/2PBP2P/PP1N1PP1/R2QK2R w KQ - 1 10,"Open to castling on either the Kingside or the Queenside.  However, I think this move was slightly worse than just simply castling to the Kingside."
19,Qf3,d1f3,r2q1rk1/pb3ppp/1pnbpn2/2ppN3/3P1B2/2PBPQ1P/PP1N1PP1/R3K2R b KQ - 2 10,"Open to castling on either the Kingside or the Queenside.  However, I think this move was slightly worse than just simply castling to the Kingside."

21,Ng4,e5g4,r4rk1/pbq2ppp/1pnbpn2/2pp4/3P1BN1/2PBPQ1P/PP1N1PP1/R3K2R b KQ - 4 11,"Provoked White into pinning my Bishop, which will allow me to dislodge it soon.  I'd have considered 11.Nxc6 Bxc6 12.Bxd6 Qxd6 13.O-O, which I think was slightly better."
22,Ne8,f6e8,r3nrk1/pbq2ppp/1pnbp3/2pp4/3P1BN1/2PBPQ1P/PP1N1PP1/R3K2R w KQ - 5 12,"Not the best of choices, disrupts White's Pawn formation whilst keeping mine reasonably strong.  I think White should've looked at 12.Bxd6 Qxd6 13.Qg3 Qxg3 14.fxg3 instead."
23,dxc5,d4c5,r3nrk1/pbq2ppp/1pnbp3/2Pp4/5BN1/2PBPQ1P/PP1N1PP1/R3K2R b KQ - 0 12,"Not the best of choices, disrupts White's Pawn formation whilst keeping mine reasonably strong.  I think White should've looked at 12.Bxd6 Qxd6 13.Qg3 Qxg3 14.fxg3 instead."
