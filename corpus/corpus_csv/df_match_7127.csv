And if I concentrate while he divides, I can use my entire strength to attack a fraction of his.  There, I will be numerically superior.  Then, if I am able to use many to strike few at a selected point, those I deal with will be in dire straits...For if he does not know where I intend to give battle, he must prepare in a great many places.  And when he prepares in a great many places, those I have to fight in any one place will be few.  For if he prepares to the front his rear will be weak, and if to the rear, his front will be fragile.  If he prepares to the left, his right will be vulnerable and if to the right, there will be few on his left.  And when he prepares everywhere, he will be weak everywhere...Therefore, determine the opponent's plans and you will know which strategy will be successful and which will not"" (ibid., 6:13-15, 20)."
