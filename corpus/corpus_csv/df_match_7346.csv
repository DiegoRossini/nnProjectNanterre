Recently, I've been looking into the Panov-Botvinnik attack and was surprised to see this tamer continuation.  Still, theory holds white retains a slight edge coming out of the opening, so it's hard to blame white for this line."

8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/3p4/3P4/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 5,Pressures the newly undefended pawn.
9,c3,c2c3,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/3p4/3P4/2PB4/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,A very solid structure!
10,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/3p4/3P4/2PB4/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 6,"?!  Black overprotects his pawn, but locks in the bishop.  Perhaps Bg4 was a more enterprising continuation, though black does want to be careful not get caught with an uncastled king!"

13,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/3p4/3P4/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 7,"This move puts pressure on the h7-pawn, but maybe this was a bit premature.  Bg5 comes to mind, as the queen certainly can delay development."
14,Bd6,f8d6,r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2nbpn2/3p4/3P4/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 8,"This move puts pressure on the h7-pawn, but maybe this was a bit premature.  Bg5 comes to mind, as the queen certainly can delay development."

18,Qc7,d8c7,r1b2rk1/ppq2ppp/2nbpn2/3p4/3P4/2PB1N2/PPQ2PPP/RNB1R1K1 w - - 6 10,"That being said, black only has a few pieces left to develop, and the bishop maneuver to d7 doesn't look appetizing.  Instead, black's real purpose is not the h3 pawn, but the e5 break."
19,h3,h2h3,r1b2rk1/ppq2ppp/2nbpn2/3p4/3P4/2PB1N1P/PPQ2PP1/RNB1R1K1 b - - 0 10,?! More consistent would be to try Rd8 and play for the break.  This play is rather passive.
20,Bd7,c8d7,r4rk1/ppqb1ppp/2nbpn2/3p4/3P4/2PB1N1P/PPQ2PP1/RNB1R1K1 w - - 1 11,?! More consistent would be to try Rd8 and play for the break.  This play is rather passive.

Finally, this meets black's threat (Bxf6 followed by Bxh7+).  Still, black may face some troubles with the half open g-file."

27,Nf1,d2f1,r4r2/ppqb1pk1/2nbpp1p/3p4/3P4/2PB1N1P/PPQ2PP1/R3RNK1 b - - 3 14,"White is moving his pieces to the kingside, but his play comes more slowly than black's."
28,Rfg8,f8g8,r5r1/ppqb1pk1/2nbpp1p/3p4/3P4/2PB1N1P/PPQ2PP1/R3RNK1 w - - 4 15,"Better than the overly ambitious plan of playing this rook to h8 and the other rook to g8, I think, because black is already well-poised to exploit the kingside.  The other rook would take unnecessarily long in this plan."
29,Ne3,f1e3,r5r1/ppqb1pk1/2nbpp1p/3p4/3P4/2PBNN1P/PPQ2PP1/R3R1K1 b - - 5 15,The black king gets out of danger quickly and exposes the g-rook.

33,Nh4,f3h4,r5r1/ppqbkp2/2nbpp1p/3p4/3P2NN/2PB3P/PPQ2PP1/R3R1K1 b - - 9 17,"White could have considered Nxh6, but then black would greedily have put his rooks on open h- and g-files.  Scary."
34,Bf4,d6f4,r5r1/ppqbkp2/2n1pp1p/3p4/3P1bNN/2PB3P/PPQ2PP1/R3R1K1 w - - 10 18,"!  Not only defends the pawn, but also keeps the white queen out of the action."
