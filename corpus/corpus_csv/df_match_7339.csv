1,c3,c2c3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/2P5/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Saragossa opening (A00). I wasn't at all familiar with that opening.
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/2P5/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I felt d5 was the best response.
3,Na3,b1a3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/N1P5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"Odd move to me, but since c3 is occupied deliberately perhaps there is a plan I can't see yet."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/8/N1P5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,I continue to develop as usual.
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/N1P5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,Push for center control.
6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3P4/N1P5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Looking back I'm not sure this was the best choice. I wanted to get control of the diagonal and didn't dare move e5 but perhaps I could have been more patient with it.
7,Nc2,a3c2,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3P4/2P5/PPN1PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,I think there was an early plan to defend d4 with a knight at c2.
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/3p4/3P4/2P5/PPN1PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 5,I chose to develop as usual.
9,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/3p2B1/3P4/2P5/PPN1PPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 3 5,Knight pin.
10,e5,e6e5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3pp1B1/3P4/2P5/PPN1PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,Now that I have my Knight in place to capture back I challenge the d4 pawn. I lost tempo here I suppose.
11,dxe5,d4e5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3pP1B1/8/2P5/PPN1PPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,dxe5 as expected.
12,Nxe5,c6e5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3pn1B1/8/2P5/PPN1PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,I felt that I gained space after the exchange and was happy to open up another diagonal in an area controlled by my Knights.
13,h3,h2h3,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3pn1B1/8/2P4P/PPN1PPP1/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 7,Protects against a likely Bg4.
14,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/2bpn1B1/8/2P4P/PPN1PPP1/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 1 8,Starting to put pressure on f2. I expect an eventual 0-0 if Bxf6...Qxf6 I'll be in a good position.
15,f4,f2f4,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/2bpn1B1/5P2/2P4P/PPN1P1P1/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 8,White realizes the weakness and advances and additionally threatens my Knight although potentially weakens the pawn.
16,Nc4,e5c4,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/2bp2B1/2n2P2/2P4P/PPN1P1P1/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 1 9,I felt this would be a good spot for my Knight and I liked the control I had over e3.
17,b3,b2b3,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/2bp2B1/2n2P2/1PP4P/P1N1P1P1/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 9,Chases away my Knight.
18,Ne3,c4e3,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/2bp2B1/5P2/1PP1n2P/P1N1P1P1/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 1 10,I am forcing a trade of Knights. To some degree it seems silly to have my Knight chased around just to trade it away but I really liked my Bishop on e3. I figured I could defend it well and it would cramp the King and make it difficult to maneuver.
19,Nxe3,c2e3,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/2bp2B1/5P2/1PP1N2P/P3P1P1/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 10,Nxe3 as expected.
20,Bxe3,c5e3,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p2B1/5P2/1PP1b2P/P3P1P1/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 11,I like the control here and like the possibility of potentially snagging a free pawn.
