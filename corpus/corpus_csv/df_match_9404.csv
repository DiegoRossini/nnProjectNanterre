Is it warranted?  3... e6 is forced, but here we reach the central discussion at hand.  White's bishop is useless in it's current position.  Should black play d4 the first chance he gets?"

Traditional logic is that d5 expands the black center with a gain of tempo, but is it really?  After d5, white moves the bishop (either to b3 or to b5), but didn't he want to anyway?  By white making a move he wanted to make, the effect of the so called gain is negligible."

Now, if I had immediately played Nf6 then d5, the knight on c6 would be pinned, but because the c knight was developed first and d5 delayed, black retains flexibility.  Unfortunately for white, it only looks like the common line."
14,Nd4,c6d4,r1bqk2r/pp1p1pbp/4pnp1/1Bp5/3nP3/3P1Q1N/PPPN1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 5 8,"From delaying d5, black plays Nd4 with three threats.  White has to move the queen although he does have some say in the matter.  At the very least the bishop is lost.  I expect the best continuation on such a mistake would be 8.Bxd7  Qxd7 9.Qd1.  If black does anything less than Qd1, the rook is lost.  So why solve your opponents problems for him?"
