1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I am a 1.e4 player as white.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I usually answer 1. e4 e4 with 2. f4 if my opponent is rated lower or only slightly above than me. In this particular case, it does not make much sense to go KG against Brad..."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,This move develops a piece and prepares for King-side castling.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"Standard answer to my second move. I often play this line but mainly as Black. According to my experience, the standard line seems to be 3.Bb5 a6 4. Bxc6 dxc6. Black Bishop's pair is counter balanced by Black's doubled pawn on the c-file."
5,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,"There we go. If my Bishop is put to the question with 3. ... a6, I will answer by 4. Bxc6."
6,a6,a7a6,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,I always wondered about the line: 4. Ba4 b5 5. Bb3; White seems to lose many tempi but the results shows otherwise!
7,Bxc6,b5c6,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1B5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,I always wondered about the line: 4. Ba4 b5 5. Bb3; White seems to lose many tempi but the results shows otherwise!
8,dxc6,d7c6,r1bqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1p5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"Let's have a try at Silman's imbalance system. The main imbalance of the position are as follows. 1. Black has the Bishop's pair and a Knight while White remains only with the dark-squared Bishop (but two Knights). 2. Black seems to has a slight structural problem with the doubled pawns on the c-file while White's pawn structure is sound. 3. White has a small advance in development with a knight out and also the trait.


Now can we build a general plan around those observations? Generally speaking, White would prefer the centre to remain closed; on the other hand, Black would like to open it up so that its Bishop's pair becomes more efficient (4. dxc6 was already a step in that direction).  White would like to find advanced posts for his knights while Black should strive not to create any."
9,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1p5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 5,"According to the imbalance, my candidate moves are: 5. O-O, 5. Nc3, 5. d3 and 5.a3. I don't like the look of 5. Nc3 (d3) Bb4 because a) 6. c3 makes White d-pawn a target, b) 6.Nc3 Bxc3 7. dxc3 Qxd1 8. Kxd1 9. Bg4 creates a second structural weakness for White and c) 6.bcx3 traps White dark-squared Bishop. Avoiding this problem are 5. O-O and 5. a3. The latter seems not so good because it places pawns on the squares that would be better used for White remaining Bishop. 

5. O-O places my King to safety, does not open the position and permit to observe Black reaction before committing to anything."
10,f6,f7f6,r1bqkbnr/1pp3pp/p1p2p2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 6,"One of the many moves protecting e5. According to the theory, 6. d4 is the modern answer to it. It opens the centre up (White would a priori avoids this happening) but it usually leads to variations featuring many exchanges and going toward the endgame. As it is now, this favour White because of the sounder pawns' structure."
11,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/1pp3pp/p1p2p2/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 6,Another factor in favour of this move is the still uncastled Black King. It is then usually good for the better developed player to try and rip the centre open...
12,Bg4,c8g4,r2qkbnr/1pp3pp/p1p2p2/4p3/3PP1b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 7,This removes one defender of d4. There is now two options: 7. dxe4 and 7. d3. Both seems equally fine but they lead to quite different games.
13,c3,c2c3,r2qkbnr/1pp3pp/p1p2p2/4p3/3PP1b1/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,This move permits White to keep a sound pawn structure and avoid too many early exchanges.
14,exd4,e5d4,r2qkbnr/1pp3pp/p1p2p2/8/3pP1b1/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,Logical continuation.
15,cxd4,c3d4,r2qkbnr/1pp3pp/p1p2p2/8/3PP1b1/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,Logical continuation.
16,Qd7,d8d7,r3kbnr/1ppq2pp/p1p2p2/8/3PP1b1/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 9,Prepare queen-side castling and defend the white bishop.
17,Be3,c1e3,r3kbnr/1ppq2pp/p1p2p2/8/3PP1b1/4BN2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 2 9,Defend the d-pawn so that ... Bxf3 doesn't loose a pawn.
18,Ne7,g8e7,r3kb1r/1ppqn1pp/p1p2p2/8/3PP1b1/4BN2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 3 10,Defends both e4 and f3 so that the White queen is free to move.
19,Nbd2,b1d2,r3kb1r/1ppqn1pp/p1p2p2/8/3PP1b1/4BN2/PP1N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 4 10,Defends both e4 and f3 so that the White queen is free to move.
20,Ng6,e7g6,r3kb1r/1ppq2pp/p1p2pn1/8/3PP1b1/4BN2/PP1N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 5 11,"Control the dark square e5 and f4. These squares could be put under even more pressure when Black will play 11 ... Bd6. Then, 12. e5 is not really an alternative for White since a pawn would be lost. Moreover, 10. ... Ng6 also permits 11. ... Bb4 which could be bothering for White."
21,Qc2,d1c2,r3kb1r/1ppq2pp/p1p2pn1/8/3PP1b1/4BN2/PPQN1PPP/R4RK1 b kq - 6 11,"Prepare 12. Qc3 that permit 13. e5 if needed. For now, keep an eye on b2 and e3 and unpin the f3 knight."
22,Bd6,f8d6,r3k2r/1ppq2pp/p1pb1pn1/8/3PP1b1/4BN2/PPQN1PPP/R4RK1 w kq - 7 12,"Not only does the bishop take control of the d6-f4 complex, but the King is also now free to castle to both aisles. Now, what are White plans? The major imbalances are A) the bishop pair for Black, B) the sounder pawn structure for White and C) a bit more space in the middle for White. According to B, White would like to go for the endgame and this means exchanging the queen. But it seems too late for this now because 1) there is no obvious way of exchanging for sure, and 2) this would mean ripping open the centre (which could be dangerous for white). So what? 12. Qc3 seems now tricky because of 12. ... Nf4, which almost forces 13. Bxf4 Bxf4 and then opening up the centre is fully out of question (12. Rfe1 might prevent this but then ... Bb4 is a problem, so is 12. a3 the solution?)."
23,Qc3,c2c3,r3k2r/1ppq2pp/p1pb1pn1/8/3PP1b1/2Q1BN2/PP1N1PPP/R4RK1 b kq - 8 12,Despite of 12. ... Nf4 13. Bxf4 Bxf4 this seems still the most logical move at this point.
