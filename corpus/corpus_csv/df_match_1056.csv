The opening doesn't hold against a good player, unless he just doesn't know it and possibly never played it, so it gives certain chances. My opponent obviously doesn't know it, so he goes for..."

9,Bb5+,f1b5,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4bn2/1B6/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,Not necessarily bad. Black can shield only two reasonable ways.
10,c6,c7c6,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1bn2/1B6/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,I choosed this over Ne7 because of the tempo gain. My N will develop through e7 anyway.

13,d3,d2d3,rn2kb1r/pp2qppp/2p1bn2/8/B7/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,? Understandable mistake. No beginner can easily expect my next move...
14,Bb3+,e6b3,rn2kb1r/pp2qppp/2p2n2/8/B7/1b1P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 8,... and white loses a bishop. But... (the show isn't over yet)
15,Qe2,d1e2,rn2kb1r/pp2qppp/2p2n2/8/B7/1b1P1N2/PPP1QPPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 2 8,"?? Big mistake. I should have exchanged Qs while I have the chance, then taken on c2, and lost three moves saving the B and putting it on a6. Now white can easily try to trap my B with c4!, and I'm forced to play c5 in order to save it after b3 and a4."

After 10. c4, NxBe3, fxe3, b3 traps the B, and no use Qb4+, f6, and black has the counterthreat Bc4+ (disc), winning the BQ. This was surely not so easy to see on a blitz, so..."
19,O-O,e1g1,rn2kb1r/pp2qppp/2p5/3n4/b7/3PBN2/PPP1QPPP/RN3RK1 b kq - 3 10,"...was very sensible, even if it missed a good chance. Seldom there is a position in which there is nothing more important or aggressive than castling. The important thing about castling is to be able to do it, not actually doing it. But this time was very good, indeed: now I have to be very, very careful in my developement plan, because of my QK alignement. My Bf1 is closed in, and I have to find a way to castle. My advantage piece is not easy to feel right now."
20,Nxe3,d5e3,rn2kb1r/pp2qppp/2p5/8/b7/3PnN2/PPP1QPPP/RN3RK1 w kq - 0 11,"? A counterdevelopement move, not good. But I looked for exchanges, wanted to keep the B pair, and possibly swap Q."

I'm not interested in delicate play, I just want to finish the game soon... and I started to play very lightly. This move was an example. I have a one-move rest before the Ra8 threats my lined Q and K. What will I do? I couldn't see the dangers I was about to face. My turn."

30,Bxc2,a4c2,rn2k2r/pp1qbppp/8/2p5/8/2NPQN2/PPb2PPP/4RK2 w kq - 0 16,"it seems good, since now I threat Qxe6+ and I can greately release white's pressure. Now the game becomes interesting for the second time. BUT this move costed me the control of b5 after white's next (good!) move. I didn't see it, either. This will deserve a ? at least on a serious game."
31,Ne5,f3e5,rn2k2r/pp1qbppp/8/2p1N3/8/2NPQ3/PPb2PPP/4RK2 b kq - 1 16,"Protecting e3, and attacking the Q. When my Q moves, white's N will be able to jump to b5, threatening c7. This will be hard to meet, since I have no time for the simple a6. I am +8, but I am going to lose a lot of material, due to my ligh play (no Q's exchange, NxB and c5). Q can go to f5 or..."
