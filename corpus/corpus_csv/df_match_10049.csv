1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I annotated this game to force myself to review it and to (hopefully) improve as a player.  There are errors on both sides in game play and I am certain that there are errors in the annotation. Comments and constructive criticism are welcome.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,Developing the Knight and exerting pressure on the center without committing to a central pawn structure.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 2,Black opens a line for the King's Bishop and exerts control over d5.
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,Black opens a line for the King's Bishop and exerts control over d5.
5,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"White chooses the Yusupov-Rubinstein system. I know very little about Queen's Pawn openings (why am I annotating this game?), but this seems to be fairly passive. The pawn on d4 is not in need of support and now, how will the Bishop on c1 be developed?"
6,b6,b7b6,rnbqkb1r/p1pp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,Aiming to fianchetto the Queen's Bishop to exert pressure on the long diagonal and to increase control of d5 and e4 in the center.
7,Nbd2,b1d2,rnbqkb1r/p1pp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/3P4/4PN2/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"Playing the Knight to d2 rather than c3 allows the c-pawn to be pushed to c4 to fight for control over the d5 square or to c3 to support the d4 pawn. This Knight also helps White to control the important c4 and e4 squares.  The Knight on d2 blocks the c1 Bishop, but it wasn't going anywhere anyway."
8,Bb7,c8b7,rn1qkb1r/pbpp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/3P4/4PN2/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,"Developing the Bishop, aiming to exert pressure on the center with the minor pieces."
9,Bc4,f1c4,rn1qkb1r/pbpp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2BP4/4PN2/PPPN1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 5,"This is a deviation from theory. Bd3 is normal, aiming at h7 and fighting for control of e4. At c4, the Bishop is subject to harassment from Black's advancing Queenside pawns. Perhaps White was trying to provoke d5 which would severely restrict the scope of the Bishop on b7."
10,c5,c7c5,rn1qkb1r/pb1p1ppp/1p2pn2/2p5/2BP4/4PN2/PPPN1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"Attacking White's center, offering to exchange a c-pawn for one of White's central pawns."
11,O-O,e1g1,rn1qkb1r/pb1p1ppp/1p2pn2/2p5/2BP4/4PN2/PPPN1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 6,
12,cxd4,c5d4,rn1qkb1r/pb1p1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2Bp4/4PN2/PPPN1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,"Another option here would be d5, pushing back the Bishop and equalizing in the center."
13,exd4,e3d4,rn1qkb1r/pb1p1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2BP4/5N2/PPPN1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,"Developing the King's Bishop, preparing to castle."
14,Be7,f8e7,rn1qk2r/pb1pbppp/1p2pn2/8/2BP4/5N2/PPPN1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 1 8,"Developing the King's Bishop, preparing to castle."
15,Ne5,f3e5,rn1qk2r/pb1pbppp/1p2pn2/4N3/2BP4/8/PPPN1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 2 8,"This move is a puzzle. White still has not developed his Queen's Bishop and the Knight, although temporarily centrally located, can be easily driven off before any threats develop. Perhaps white was hoping to provoke some sort of overreaction to this seemingly aggressive move."
16,O-O,e8g8,rn1q1rk1/pb1pbppp/1p2pn2/4N3/2BP4/8/PPPN1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 3 9,"This move is also a puzzle to me. White seems to have wasted the last two moves, not losing any material, but losing time. This is the second piece that White has moved twice during the opening phase of the game, breaking one of the cardinal rules of chess."
17,Bb5,c4b5,rn1q1rk1/pb1pbppp/1p2pn2/1B2N3/3P4/8/PPPN1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 4 9,"This move is also a puzzle to me. White seems to have wasted the last two moves, not losing any material, but losing time. This is the second piece that White has moved twice during the opening phase of the game, breaking one of the cardinal rules of chess."
18,Qc7,d8c7,rn3rk1/pbqpbppp/1p2pn2/1B2N3/3P4/8/PPPN1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 5 10,"Developing the Queen to c7, exerting pressure along the c-file and the b8-h2 diagonal. Black has continued developing normally, ignoring White's premature advance of the Bishop and Knight."
19,Re1,f1e1,rn3rk1/pbqpbppp/1p2pn2/1B2N3/3P4/8/PPPN1PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - - 6 10,Developing the Rook on the half-open e-file.
20,d6,d7d6,rn3rk1/pbq1bppp/1p1ppn2/1B2N3/3P4/8/PPPN1PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 0 11,Time to start gaining space with tempo by kicking the Knight.
21,Nd3,e5d3,rn3rk1/pbq1bppp/1p1ppn2/1B6/3P4/3N4/PPPN1PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - - 1 11,The Knight is probably better placed at f3 where it aids in the King's defense and does not obstruct White's other pieces.
22,Nbd7,b8d7,r4rk1/pbqnbppp/1p1ppn2/1B6/3P4/3N4/PPPN1PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 2 12,"Developing the Knight. Nc6 was also an option, locating the Knight more centrally, but I chose to not obstruct the scope of the Queen or the Bishop by placing it on d7. Note, however, that the Queen's protection of the Bishop on e7 is now obstructed. This could come into play with a pin of the Knight on f6 by the c1 Bishop or an advance of the central pawns.  Perhaps Nc6 would have been a better choice."
23,c3,c2c3,r4rk1/pbqnbppp/1p1ppn2/1B6/3P4/2PN4/PP1N1PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - - 0 12,Gaing more space with tempo due to the poor placement of white's Bishop.
24,a6,a7a6,r4rk1/1bqnbppp/pp1ppn2/1B6/3P4/2PN4/PP1N1PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 0 13,Gaing more space with tempo due to the poor placement of white's Bishop.
