1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I played this game at my local chessclub. My opponent needed a win for promotion and actually I thought I was lost allready since I'd had only four hours of decent sleep the previous night!
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"With the kingside fianchetto black aims his bishop on the central squares e5 and d4, where the pressure on d4 can soon be increased by playing   ...e5 or ...c5."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"With the kingside fianchetto black aims his bishop on the central squares e5 and d4, where the pressure on d4 can soon be increased by playing   ...e5 or ...c5."
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"With the kingside fianchetto black aims his bishop on the central squares e5 and d4, where the pressure on d4 can soon be increased by playing   ...e5 or ...c5."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"Forcing black to make a commitment, as to wether to play the Gruenfeld, or to play 3..Bg7, allowing white to play the move e4, wich would stop the Gruenfeld."
6,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,3..d5 would have entered the Gruenfeld defence.
7,e4,e2e4,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,The King's Indian defence is a very tricky opening wich can lead to some nice chances for black when handled improperly by white. This is often based on the strength of the bishop along the diagonal.
8,d6,d7d6,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"It's not easy for white to find the right defence against black's setup, mostly because this opening has so many variations, wich can only be compared to the Sicilian defence."
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"5.f3 is also very common, planning on castling queenside and using the kingside pawns for the attack. At the post-mortem my opponent told me he always plays 5.f3 when playing white in this opening."
10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 2 6,The most common continuation.
11,Be2,f1e2,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 3 6,Straight from the book.
12,c5,c7c5,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2p5/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 7,...e5 is played more often.
13,d5,d4d5,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2pP4/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 7,The 'best' move here.
14,Nfd7,f6d7,rnbq1rk1/pp1nppbp/3p2p1/2pP4/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 1 8,"?! Black is not wasting time and wants to play ...f5 as soon as possible and open the c-file for attacking chances. Still, 7...e6 would have been much stronger."
15,Bd2,c1d2,rnbq1rk1/pp1nppbp/3p2p1/2pP4/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP1BBPPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 2 8,"8. O-O was also playable, but eventually I decided to develop my bishop first and avoid the doubled pawns after 8....Bxc3 9.bxc3."
16,f5,f7f5,rnbq1rk1/pp1np1bp/3p2p1/2pP1p2/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP1BBPPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 9,As expected.
17,Qc1,d1c1,rnbq1rk1/pp1np1bp/3p2p1/2pP1p2/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP1BBPPP/R1Q1K2R b KQ - 1 9,? I must admit this is a strange move and this shows I was rather tired. I was looking for something like 10.Bh6 Bxh6 11.Qxh6. Better would have been simply 9.exf5
18,Ne5,d7e5,rnbq1rk1/pp2p1bp/3p2p1/2pPnp2/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP1BBPPP/R1Q1K2R w KQ - 2 10,Black must move the knight on d7 again in order to develop his bishop.
19,O-O,e1g1,rnbq1rk1/pp2p1bp/3p2p1/2pPnp2/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP1BBPPP/R1Q2RK1 b - - 3 10,"I now think 10.Nxe5 followed by 11.exf5 would have been stronger, but I was looking to complicate things a little."
20,fxe4,f5e4,rnbq1rk1/pp2p1bp/3p2p1/2pPn3/2P1p3/2N2N2/PP1BBPPP/R1Q2RK1 w - - 0 11,With the treat of a possible fork on e6.
21,Nxe4,c3e4,rnbq1rk1/pp2p1bp/3p2p1/2pPn3/2P1N3/5N2/PP1BBPPP/R1Q2RK1 b - - 0 11,With the treat of a possible fork on e6.
22,Bf5,c8f5,rn1q1rk1/pp2p1bp/3p2p1/2pPnb2/2P1N3/5N2/PP1BBPPP/R1Q2RK1 w - - 1 12,With the treat of a possible fork on e6.
23,Neg5,e4g5,rn1q1rk1/pp2p1bp/3p2p1/2pPnbN1/2P5/5N2/PP1BBPPP/R1Q2RK1 b - - 2 12,With the treat of a possible fork on e6.
24,Nbd7,b8d7,r2q1rk1/pp1np1bp/3p2p1/2pPnbN1/2P5/5N2/PP1BBPPP/R1Q2RK1 w - - 3 13,My opponent spent 15 minutes before making this move! I then spent quite some time myself before making my next move since I immediately saw he was either trying to provoke 13.Nh4 or he had just missed it and now 'just' developed his knight.
25,Nh4,f3h4,r2q1rk1/pp1np1bp/3p2p1/2pPnbN1/2P4N/8/PP1BBPPP/R1Q2RK1 b - - 4 13,I decided to go for it...
