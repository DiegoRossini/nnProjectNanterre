1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!  Just dug out this game on the Fried Liver attack in which I played the black pieces.  This match took place in a leisure centre in Brandon, Suffolk sometime in 1998.  I lost this game but it does throw open to debate how strong the Fried Liver Attack really is."
