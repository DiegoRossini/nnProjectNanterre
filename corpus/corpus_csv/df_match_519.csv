1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was a ladder challenge from someone well over 500 points north of my rating. What usually happens in these games is that I do ok for twenty to thirty moves, then I make a mistake and it all rapidly falls apart. This game was different for a number of reasons. Firstly we followed book for much longer than I normally would, secondly this is the longest game I have ever played against such a high ranked player, thirdly it turned into a bit of a ding dong battle if only in terms of material, finally a draw would normally feel like a win for me in these circumstances but this one didn't, if anything it felt like a loss. 

I hope this game inspires you to not give up when playing much higher ranked players"
