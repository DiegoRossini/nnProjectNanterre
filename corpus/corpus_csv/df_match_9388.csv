6,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Black cannot play Bg7 lazily without thought or else he loses both bishop and rook.  With the knight immediately threatened, black cannot trap the queen in the corner depriving white of the queen for the immediate future.  The problem is that the queen provides a tasty target once the forced Nf6 is played."

14,Nc7,d5c7,r1bqkb1r/ppnppp1p/2n3p1/4P3/4Q3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 5 8,"Oddly enough white plays c4 anyway.  Three possible reasons for the move exist.  These include limiting the scope of the c7 knight, hoping for a knight outpost at d5/b5, or c5 followed with bringing the bishop to bear upon f7 via Bc4.  Black has enough tempo to easily escape the bishop threat.  And without preparation, black could drive a knight from either of the potential outposts with simple pawn moves."

Advancing the e pawn further only gives it away for free.  If the e pawn falls, then White's b pawn becomes painfully pinned.  White is controlling more space, but black is more secure in the immediate future."
17,Bf4,c1f4,r1bqk2r/ppnpppbp/2n3p1/4P3/2P1QB2/5N2/PP3PPP/RN2KB1R b KQkq - 2 9,"The b pawn was already secure for the moment.  I would have preferred development.  Because there isn't a good place for White's light-squared bishop, the knight on b could be developed.  White might be tempted to castle queen-side, but the likelihood of black eventually placing a rook on c8 should temper this desire."
18,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/ppnpppbp/2n3p1/4P3/2P1QB2/5N2/PP3PPP/RN2KB1R w KQ - 3 10,"I perhaps should have considered b6, but there is nothing wrong with the move here."
19,c5,c4c5,r1bq1rk1/ppnpppbp/2n3p1/2P1P3/4QB2/5N2/PP3PPP/RN2KB1R b KQ - 0 10,"One promising, plausible alternative is 10. Qe3 threatening to exchange dark squared bishops.  The pawn on c4 would prevent Nd5 challenging the Queen (without the pawn, the continuation would probably favor White, but without the pawn White could not force the exchange)."
20,Ne6,c7e6,r1bq1rk1/pp1pppbp/2n1n1p1/2P1P3/4QB2/5N2/PP3PPP/RN2KB1R w KQ - 1 11,"This primarily accomplishes two things:  The Black queen has been freed, and it forestalls for some time --maybe even permanently-- exchanging dark-square bishops.  If white plays Qe3 threating to exchange, black can simply play Nxf4."
21,Bc4,f1c4,r1bq1rk1/pp1pppbp/2n1n1p1/2P1P3/2B1QB2/5N2/PP3PPP/RN2K2R b KQ - 2 11,Capturing the pawn with the queen undermines the hold on e5.  Black can bring pieces to capture it faster than white can support it.  I like bringing out the queen when she cannot easily be captured and when she helps reduce the power of the opposing queen.
22,Qa5+,d8a5,r1b2rk1/pp1pppbp/2n1n1p1/q1P1P3/2B1QB2/5N2/PP3PPP/RN2K2R w KQ - 3 12,Capturing the pawn with the queen undermines the hold on e5.
