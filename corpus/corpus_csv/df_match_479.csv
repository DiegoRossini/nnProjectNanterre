1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Lesson learned not to repeat moves and found that this admits I made the wrong moves too many time in my game with elyhim. I opened d4 and made it 45 Plus moves when the mating net was dropped on this sly fox. I resigned before the mate but I don't give up easy or do I? I used the analyze the board through out the game and this Redfox was out smarted and instead of rising, I raised the white flag! Good game elyhim. As part of my conditional surrender I am hear now to annotate our game."
