6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,"from black's point of view the pressure over d4 is reduces by Bb5, as white can even exchange the bishop for the knight,  so we have a few possible choices here:
a) 3...g6 so black can fiancheto the bishop and regain some pressure over d4
b) 3...e6 with the idea Nge7, if possible before the exchange of white's bishop, then Bb5 would lack it's point
c) 3...d6 preparation of Bd7, after exchange Bxc6 Bxc6, black would exert pressure over e4
d) 3...a6 in my opinion a bad choice, as it loses one tempo so white can exchange and black could have developed a piece or opened some lines with a pawn advance, in this case just lost that oportunity
e) 3...Qc7, also losing tempos with the queen not my first choice also
f) 3...Nf6, is at the same time a solid choice but also a very fighting one, Richard Palliser, in His book ""The Bb5 Sicilian"" called this 3...Nf6 the fashionable line, due to several recent successful games with it, so this will be my choice for this game..."
