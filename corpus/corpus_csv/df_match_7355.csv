1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi all. I have decided to annotate this game, as the end of an era for me. This is - was - the last chess game in which I ever played the Stonewall Attack as White. I know that readers may have different opinions, but I have finally become convinced of how difficult it is to crash home with this attack against an experienced player. Several bad experiences with the Stonewall Attack, both OTB and online, have caused the decision to give it up. Have a look at this game to see why."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I start with the queen pawn, and my opponent plays his queen pawn."
3,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"This move characterises White's aim at playing the Stonewall Attack, although there is still the option of transposing to a Colle System with 3.Nf3. White will place his central pawns to dominate the dark squares, on d4, e3 and f4."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"This tends to be the response that White is hoping for, to facilitate his kingside attack. It tends to be harder to attack if Black plays ...g6 and ...Bg7, as Black's g-pawn is then a strong buffer, and also rules out any possible Greek Gift sacrifices - although these are rare in the Stonewall. Another good option for Black is 3...Nc6! threatening both 4...e5 and 4...Nb4, either of which disrupts White's Stonewall formation."
5,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/3BP3/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 3,"This tends to be the response that White is hoping for, to facilitate his kingside attack.

8,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/3P1P2/3BP3/PPP3PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,"Solidifying the structure, and preventing any future problems from ...Nb4. If Black tries ...cxd4, White replies exd4 and opens up the centre for his dark-squared bishop."
9,c3,c2c3,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/3P1P2/2PBP3/PP4PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,"Solidifying the structure, and preventing any future problems from ...Nb4. If Black tries ...cxd4, White replies exd4 and opens up the centre for his dark-squared bishop."
10,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2pp4/3P1P2/2PBP3/PP4PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 6,"In hindsight, I should probably have played 6.Nb2, to prevent Black's next move - the last trick he has up his sleeve against my Stonewall formation. I would then have continued 7.Nf3."
11,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2pp4/3P1P2/2PBPN2/PP4PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 6,"In hindsight, I should probably have played 6.Nb2, to prevent Black's next move - the last trick he has up his sleeve against my Stonewall formation. I would then have continued 7.Nf3."
12,Ne4,f6e4,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2pp4/3PnP2/2PBPN2/PP4PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 3 7,"Owch. Suddenly there is a major stumbling block to my attack. I considered 7.Nbd2, but then Black plays 7...f5! solidifying the powerful grip on the centre that his 6th move has brought him."
13,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2pp4/3PnP2/2PBPN2/PP4PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 4 7,"Instead, I played a normal developing move, bringing my king to safety, while placing the rook on the f-file, from where it can become active via f3 in a future attack."
14,c4,c5c4,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1p3/3p4/2pPnP2/2PBPN2/PP4PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,"Unfortunately for me, Black's plans to not seem to allow White to play any kind of ""future attack"". Black is trying to lock down on my position and cramp my centre, so that the attacking pieces...simply cannot get out. Ordinarily, ...c4 is a weak choice for Black, as it removes all his possible counterplay on the queenside. Under the circumstances, however, and accompanied with his powerful grip on the centre, it is a strong option."
15,Bc2,d3c2,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1p3/3p4/2pPnP2/2P1PN2/PPB3PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 8,"In hindsight, maybe the bishop would have been better on e2. I at the time wanted to keep my bishop on the powerful c2-h7 diagonal - but, of course, Black will soon close that."
16,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2n1p3/3p4/2pPnP2/2P1PN2/PPB3PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 9,My last resort to try to shift Black's powerful knight.

18,f5,f7f5,r1bqk2r/pp2b1pp/2n1p3/3p1p2/2pPnP2/2P1PN2/PPBN2PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 10,"Consolidating Black's powerful centre. Black is now dominating the centre and the queenside, while White's attacking pieces have barely any room to breathe. Black's backward pawn on e6 is in no way weak. The good thing for White is that Black has no way to break through and convert his positional advantage into a win - his pieces cannot get past my pawns on the queenside, while the centre is locked."
19,Nxe4,d2e4,r1bqk2r/pp2b1pp/2n1p3/3p1p2/2pPNP2/2P1PN2/PPB3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 10,"I exchange off that irritatingly powerful knight outpost on e4, and return the favour: I shove my knight on e5. Black has the slightly better position, because his dark-squared bishop is well placed, while both my bishops are banging their heads on granite. However, at this point, I felt that neither side had any tangible advantage that could bring a win."

Objectively, Black's position is superior, with his bishops far better-placed.
