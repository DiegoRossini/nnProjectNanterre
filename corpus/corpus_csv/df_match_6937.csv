8,d4,d5d4,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/8/3p4/2N2NP1/PPPPPPBP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"Black has just blitz screened white! See how the black pawn is doing the two things of a great pawn move. Of course if a pawn punches forward this early in the game it requires support. 

In the end, the pluses gained from pawn moves like this are temporary. In the end they become a liability."
9,Nb1,c3b1,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/8/3p4/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,The knight has nowhere to go so it goes home. This highlights the problem of 4.Nc3
10,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/8/3p2b1/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 6,some would question the value of this move as it is not clear where the best developing square for the bishop will be. for the perpcetive of white taking a deep breath and not playing the hasty h3 is refutation of the ...Bg4 plan.
11,d3,d2d3,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/8/3p2b1/3P1NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"Stoping the blitz screen, opening up the dark square diagonal and preventing black from playing ...d3 which would force white to create a weakness in his pawn structure."
12,g6,g7g6,rn1qkb1r/pp2pp1p/2p2np1/8/3p2b1/3P1NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,I played this so that when I follow up with h3 I dont have a messed up pawn chain. I hate doubled pawns
13,Nbd2,b1d2,rn1qkb1r/pp2pp1p/2p2np1/8/3p2b1/3P1NP1/PPPNPPBP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,I played this so that when I follow up with h3 I dont have a messed up pawn chain. I hate doubled pawns
14,Bg7,f8g7,rn1qk2r/pp2ppbp/2p2np1/8/3p2b1/3P1NP1/PPPNPPBP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 8,now ...Bg4 looks kind of silly doesn't it
15,h3,h2h3,rn1qk2r/pp2ppbp/2p2np1/8/3p2b1/3P1NPP/PPPNPPB1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,now ...Bg4 looks kind of silly doesn't it
16,Be6,g4e6,rn1qk2r/pp2ppbp/2p1bnp1/8/3p4/3P1NPP/PPPNPPB1/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 9,Do you see how I am using my pawns to carve out territory and space for my peices?
17,c3,c2c3,rn1qk2r/pp2ppbp/2p1bnp1/8/3p4/2PP1NPP/PP1NPPB1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 9,Of course the result of a pawn blitz screen is that pawns advance too far and run the risk of being cut off from the rest of its army and becomes isolated. this is excatly the issue of black's pawn on d4. Because it is so far advanced it is almost impossible to defend.
18,dxc3,d4c3,rn1qk2r/pp2ppbp/2p1bnp1/8/8/2pP1NPP/PP1NPPB1/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 10,"White's openning trouble has been almost resolved. However as a result of the poor 4. Nc3 I have a mobilty problem. However, I do like my pawn structure as it is very flexible and mobile. My pieces are much more harmonious than blacks."
19,bxc3,b2c3,rn1qk2r/pp2ppbp/2p1bnp1/8/8/2PP1NPP/P2NPPB1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 10,"White's openning trouble has been almost resolved. However as a result of the poor 4. Nc3 I have a mobilty problem.

20,O-O,e8g8,rn1q1rk1/pp2ppbp/2p1bnp1/8/8/2PP1NPP/P2NPPB1/R1BQK2R w KQ - 1 11,this is not black's most solid continuation because it seriously hinders the mobilty of his bishop. Other alternatives are 11. ...Na6 and Qc7
21,Qc2,d1c2,rn1q1rk1/pp2ppbp/2p1bnp1/8/8/2PP1NPP/P1QNPPB1/R1B1K2R b KQ - 2 11,this is not black's most solid continuation because it seriously hinders the mobilty of his bishop. Other alternatives are 11. ...Na6 and Qc7
22,Nbd7,b8d7,r2q1rk1/pp1nppbp/2p1bnp1/8/8/2PP1NPP/P1QNPPB1/R1B1K2R w KQ - 3 12,this is not black's most solid continuation because it seriously hinders the mobilty of his bishop. Other alternatives are 11. ...Na6 and Qc7
23,Ng5,f3g5,r2q1rk1/pp1nppbp/2p1bnp1/6N1/8/2PP2PP/P1QNPPB1/R1B1K2R b KQ - 4 12,"White takes advantage of black's weak 11th move and gains two pluses 
1. relieves a cramped position
2. creates a lasting weakness in black's position

As a general rule if you are suffering from a cramped game aim to trade peices. This achieves two things for you
1. you create lines and open up squares for your remaining peices
2. you elimenate the attacking peices from your opponent"
24,Nd5,f6d5,r2q1rk1/pp1nppbp/2p1b1p1/3n2N1/8/2PP2PP/P1QNPPB1/R1B1K2R w KQ - 5 13,This is an interesting idea that makes the most out black's trouble. I think black will regret the double pawns in the end game though
25,Nxe6,g5e6,r2q1rk1/pp1nppbp/2p1N1p1/3n4/8/2PP2PP/P1QNPPB1/R1B1K2R b KQ - 0 13,"It is at this point where white starts to get his legs underneath him. When you have the opportunity to create a pawn weakness in your enemies position do it! The creation of a pawn weakness is encouraged under certian cases. Here is some questions to ask yourself if you are thinking about creating a pawn weakness. 

1. Do you get equivalent compensation?(In this game, I trade a bishop for knight so YES)
2. Do you achieve a strong attack? (In this game, I limit black's attack acheive solid attacking chances with Ne4)"
26,fxe6,f7e6,r2q1rk1/pp1np1bp/2p1p1p1/3n4/8/2PP2PP/P1QNPPB1/R1B1K2R w KQ - 0 14,now that I have created a lasting weakness in black's position I am going to focus on eliminating my pawn weakness which is c3.
27,Ne4,d2e4,r2q1rk1/pp1np1bp/2p1p1p1/3n4/4N3/2PP2PP/P1Q1PPB1/R1B1K2R b KQ - 1 14,defending c3 and hoping to play Ng5
28,Qa5,d8a5,r4rk1/pp1np1bp/2p1p1p1/q2n4/4N3/2PP2PP/P1Q1PPB1/R1B1K2R w KQ - 2 15,adding more attackers to c3
29,Bb2,c1b2,r4rk1/pp1np1bp/2p1p1p1/q2n4/4N3/2PP2PP/PBQ1PPB1/R3K2R b KQ - 3 15,the bishop must go here because if Bd2 then the knight on e4 is hindered
30,Nd7f6,d7f6,r4rk1/pp2p1bp/2p1pnp1/q2n4/4N3/2PP2PP/PBQ1PPB1/R3K2R w KQ - 4 16,?? not a great move since this relieves some of the pressure on c3. Also 15. ...Nd7b6 makes alot more sense
31,Nd2,e4d2,r4rk1/pp2p1bp/2p1pnp1/q2n4/8/2PP2PP/PBQNPPB1/R3K2R b KQ - 5 16,thinking about Nb3 or Nc4
