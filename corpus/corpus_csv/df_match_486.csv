I actually lost my queen in this game due to playing one night with one too many beers :). At any rate, I resumed playing the next day and was able to make the comeback. If anything this serves as an example never to resign even if you lost a piece in error or in my case too many ale's."

I could of developed another piece rather than this response, but if you notice, black knight has a great position here for the time being. There are minimal threats to the black knight pending whites additional moves. If white moves his knight to advance his pawn to F3, Black can move to KG3 and fork the bishop and rook. Alternatively, the other moves will end in a swap"
