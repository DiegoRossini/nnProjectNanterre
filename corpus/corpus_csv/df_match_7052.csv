4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p2Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 2 3,2. ... Nc6 is the usual continuation but I threw caution to the wind just to see what would happen
5,Qxe5+,h5e5,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4Q3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 0 3,Now the trick is to develop and force White to move his Queen around as much as possible

8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/2n2n2/4Q3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 3 5,The first step in development although 4. ... d6 is also possible and maybe better as it frees the light squared Bishop while forcing White to move the Queen to safety
9,Qf4,e5f4,r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/2n2n2/8/4PQ2/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 4 5,I liked this because it kept the pressure on White with 6. exd5 Nd5 attacking the Queen once again and with my Bishops acting in tandem giving the Queen few squares to which she might retreat
10,d5,d7d5,r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/2n2n2/3p4/4PQ2/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 6,I liked this because it kept the pressure on White with 6. exd5 Nd5 attacking the Queen once again and with my Bishops acting in tandem giving the Queen few squares to which she might retreat

13,Qe3,f4e3,r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/2n5/3pP2n/8/4QN2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 2 7,"I took a moment off here because I thought having my Rook available to jump on the e-file might be useful and of course, getting my King to safety"

15,Bd3,f1d3,r1bq1rk1/ppp1bppp/2n5/3pP2n/8/3BQN2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 4 8,This might not have been such a good move but I wanted to get the Bishop out. 8. ... Be6 might be better

24,Nxd5,b4d5,r2q1rk1/ppp1bp1p/6p1/3nP2n/8/3B1Q1P/PPPP1PP1/R1B1K2R w KQ - 0 13,I like that Knight at d5 quite a bit and I want to make White trade off his good Bishop if he wants to rid himself of it
