3,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"What to call the beast?  Note that the thing can arise from this move order: 1.e4 e5  2.c4 - and how often do you see that?   Yet the thing is not all bad, provided White is cognizant of the hole that has appeared at d4 - a long-term strategic concession.  It remains to be seen whether White gets any benefit from this."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2P1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"At once taking control of the d4-square.  The d4-break won't be easy for White to achieve, but for the time being he probably won't want to try for it."
5,g3,g2g3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2P1P3/6P1/PP1P1P1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"[!?]Aiming for a King's Indian Attack, or a Botvinnik System, maybe?  The Gameknot engine (hereafter GK) prefers more 'normal' development by 3.Nf3 Nf6  4.Nc3 Bc5  5.Be2 ...  But there is something to be said for this arrangement: g3/Bg2/Ne2/Nc3/d3/Be6 - the solid Botvinnik system."
6,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2P1P3/6P1/PP1P1P1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,There is no such thing as too much control of a vital central square.  This might turn out to be a problem for White.
7,Bg2,f1g2,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2P1P3/6P1/PP1P1PBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 4,Consistently carrying out his plan of development.  But Black takes the opportunity here for an early strike in the centre - before completing his K-side development.
8,d6,d7d6,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/2b1p3/2P1P3/6P1/PP1P1PBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,Consistently carrying out his plan of development.  But Black takes the opportunity here for an early strike in the centre - before completing his K-side development.

10,f5,f7f5,r1bqk1nr/ppp3pp/2np4/2b1pp2/2P1P3/6P1/PP1PNPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,Also playable was ...Ne7 or ...Nf6 and then ...0-0.  But this early strike can hardly be convenient for White!
11,d3,d2d3,r1bqk1nr/ppp3pp/2np4/2b1pp2/2P1P3/3P2P1/PP2NPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"GK mislikes this move on account of 6...fxe4  7.dxe4  Nf6  8.0-0 0-0  9.Nd2 Ng4 -(look at the pressure on f2 right now!)-  10.Nf3 Be6  11.Qd3 Qe8  12.Nc3 ... -(See how the knights criss-cross manouevres has led them to take 4 moves to carry out a 2-move development!)-  12...Qh5  13.Nd5 ... Here GK stops short, with Black about to play the killer: 13...Rxf3!  A clear case of the so-called 'horizon effect'.  Preferable, according to GK, is 6.Nbc3 Nf6  7.exf5 Bxf5  8.Bxc6 bxc6  9.d4 ... I don't buy it.  White's K-side looks very porous to me in this line."

There is no convenient way of defending c4, but after this move, White might have reason to fear for the dark squares on his Q-side."

23,Bxe4,g2e4,r4rk1/pppq2pp/2npb3/2b1p3/2P1B3/1P4PP/P3NP1K/RNBQ1R2 b - - 0 12,"Accepting the sacrifice, as he ought, for it is hard to see that Black gets enough attack for the Knight.  After 12...Bxh3  13.Bd5ch! ... -(a useful finesse)- ...Kh8  14.Bg2 Bxg2  15.Kxg2 Rf7  16.Nd2 Raf8   17.Ne4 Bb6  18.c5! (...dxc5  19.Qxd7 Rxd7  20.Be3.  Although Black obtains 3 pawns for the piece in this line, his attack would have been repulsed, and white would have a fine game.  On the whole one feels that Black's advantage would have been the greater for keeping his knight, and playing 11...Nd4."
