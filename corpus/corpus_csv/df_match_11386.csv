1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game is a Torre attack, where I played a less critical line than the line 3...c5, however, still gives Black a solid game after the most trying continuation 4. Bxf6.  My 2100 rated opponent, enters into this line, then let's off the accelerator with 5. e3, instead of the obvious 5. e4, with a central space advantage.  The position that results features a good example of play against an isolated d-pawn."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,The idea behind the bishop move is to exchange the defender of the e4-square and play e4.

6,h6,h7h6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1pp1/4pn1p/6B1/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,Modern theory regards inmmediately striking White's center with 3...c5 as the most critical test of White's opening strategy.  After 4. e3 Qb6 5. Qc1 Black gets a good game with 5...Ne4.
7,Bxf6,g5f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1pp1/4pB1p/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"4. Bh4 c5 5. e3 b6 6. Nbd2 Bb7 7. Bd3 Be7 8.  0-0 d6 9. c3 Nbd7, and Black's Hedgehog-style setup gives him harmonius development with little pressure from White."
8,Qxf6,d8f6,rnb1kb1r/pppp1pp1/4pq1p/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"White adopts a modest setup, choosing to establish a stable center before undertaking any attack.  Not really in the spirit of the opening, but Black doesnt have any immediate attack either."

11,Be2,f1e2,rnb1kb1r/pp1p1pp1/4pq1p/2p5/3P4/4PN2/PPP1BPPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"Again, 6. Bd3 is more aggressive."
12,cxd4,c5d4,rnb1kb1r/pp1p1pp1/4pq1p/8/3p4/4PN2/PPP1BPPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"This move could have waited, however, I wanted to get the extra center pawn before White played c3, when the symmetrical pawn structure would have made things less dynamic."
13,exd4,e3d4,rnb1kb1r/pp1p1pp1/4pq1p/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 0 7,"Now we are really out of book.  This knight typically goes to d7, however, with White's unambitious play, I decided to put the knight on a more aggressive square."
14,Nc6,b8c6,r1b1kb1r/pp1p1pp1/2n1pq1p/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 1 8,"Now we are really out of book.  This knight typically goes to d7, however, with White's unambitious play, I decided to put the knight on a more aggressive square."

19,Nc3,b1c3,r1b1kb1r/pp3pp1/2n1pq1p/8/2pP4/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 1 10,White is ahead in development.  I need to get moving.
20,Bd6,f8d6,r1b1k2r/pp3pp1/2nbpq1p/8/2pP4/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 2 11,Too slow would have been the typical bishop fianchetto of the Torre systems.  Here the dark-squared bishop goes to an active diagonal and fights for the e5-square.
21,Bxc4,e2c4,r1b1k2r/pp3pp1/2nbpq1p/8/2BP4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 11,"Still behind in development and with an uncastled king, I am now looking down the barrel of a d5-break."

23,Qd3,d1d3,r1b1k2r/pp3pp1/2nbp2p/8/2BP1q2/2NQ1N2/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b kq - 2 12,If 13. d5 Ne5 14. Nxe5 Qxe5 15. g3 ed and Black is fine.

27,Rfe1,f1e1,r1br2k1/pp3pp1/2nbp2p/8/2BP1q2/2NQ1N2/PP3PPP/3RR1K1 b - - 6 14,Anticipating an opening of the e-file.
28,Bd7,c8d7,r2r2k1/pp1b1pp1/2nbp2p/8/2BP1q2/2NQ1N2/PP3PPP/3RR1K1 w - - 7 15,"The only real problem with the Black position is the light-sqared bishop.  Here I clear a space for the a8-rook, but temporarily block any discovery tactics on the d-file from the d8-rook.  This was the major trade off.  In absence of any active plan, White is going to get a space advantage on the queenside, in addition to his advantage in the center, and I would slowly suffocate.  Here I can at least develop my pieces and get some counterplay on the open files."
