1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,My opponent played the rather common e4- but
2,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,a more interesting game
3,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"at this point i felt in a much weaker position, white had much more control of the center"
4,e5,e7e5,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,but i decided to attack
5,d5,d4d5,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/3Pp3/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,white played as most people would
6,Nce7,c6e7,r1bqkbnr/ppppnppp/8/3Pp3/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"this forced my knight back, making my opening slightly weaker"
7,c4,c2c4,r1bqkbnr/ppppnppp/8/3Pp3/2P1P3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,white simply keeps pushing those pawns
8,Ng6,e7g6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/6n1/3Pp3/2P1P3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,ah! I spotted Ng6 as a way to start a better attack as well as free my pieces more
9,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/6n1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 5,quite boring and expected move in my opinion
10,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/6n1/2bPp3/2P1P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 3 6,AS is usually played: Bc5
11,Be3,c1e3,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/6n1/2bPp3/2P1P3/2N1B3/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 4 6,counter attacked by white
12,Bxe3,c5e3,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/6n1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N1b3/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,the swap off is accepted
13,fxe3,f2e3,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/6n1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N1P3/PP4PP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 7,however i pulled out better from that position because white's pawn island is slightly weaker (double pawn)
14,d6,d7d6,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3p2n1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N1P3/PP4PP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 8,opening up still
15,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3p2n1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N1PN2/PP4PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 8,rather expected
16,Nh4,g6h4,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3p4/3Pp3/2P1P2n/2N1PN2/PP4PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 9,I was trying to get a bit fancier
17,Qd2,d1d2,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3p4/3Pp3/2P1P2n/2N1PN2/PP1Q2PP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 3 9,white didn't accept the bait
18,Nxf3+,h4f3,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3p4/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N1Pn2/PP1Q2PP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 10,i still saw my oppurtunity
19,gxf3,g2f3,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3p4/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N1PP2/PP1Q3P/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 10,what else could one expect from white then!
20,Qh4+,d8h4,r1b1k1nr/ppp2ppp/3p4/3Pp3/2P1P2q/2N1PP2/PP1Q3P/R3KB1R w KQkq - 1 11,playing my queen out
