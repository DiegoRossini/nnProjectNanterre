Looking more closely it is clear that the position holds lots of potential for white, and black might have to fight for a draw. The 3 queenside pawns are extremely dangerous, and black lacks open files to whip his rooks around the board and create threats. White's queen is central exerting powerful influence and controls the only entry point into white's defences (the f2 square) as well as being well positioned to support a queenside pawn roller. Black has a real problem, and can easily lose. Its important for black to play actively, and create more open lines for his rooks (even at the cost of material) otherwise soon white will have pawns on the sixth rank and black will be fighting for a draw."
