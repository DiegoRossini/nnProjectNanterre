10,b5,b7b5,rnbqkbnr/p4ppp/8/1ppp4/8/1B3N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,This is poor move from me.  Thankfully my opponent didn't play 6. Qe2+ because I would've dropped that pawn I advanced.
11,c3,c2c3,rnbqkbnr/p4ppp/8/1ppp4/8/1BP2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,Maybe a stronger move here would've been Bg4 pinning the knight?
