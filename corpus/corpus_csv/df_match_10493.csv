In response to comments by sarasani and sicilianunleash, it is true that I was not particularly concerned about 3... b5.  In that case, I would have responded 4. a4 c6 5.b3 (not 5. axb5), or possibly 4.a4 a6? 5.axb5, if I got the chance."
6,Qd6,d8d6,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/3q4/8/2pPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,Qd6?  Why move the Queen out?  Becomes a potential target.
7,Bxc4,f1c4,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/3q4/8/2BPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 4,"Recapture the pawn, assert stronger centre control"
8,Qb4+,d6b4,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/1qBPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 5,"Qb4 ?  Why?  Attempting to grab the bishop?  Easily defended.  And from here, I can start developing with tempo."
9,Nd2,b1d2,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/1qBPP3/8/PP1N1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 2 5,"Defensive, but the Queen is vulnerable."
10,Nc6,b8c6,r1b1kbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/8/1qBPP3/8/PP1N1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 3 6,Not bad.  Attempt to regain centre control since the pawn is not protected by the Queen anymore.
11,Ngf3,g1f3,r1b1kbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/8/1qBPP3/5N2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 4 6,"But again, easily defended."
12,g6,g7g6,r1b1kbnr/ppp1pp1p/2n3p1/8/1qBPP3/5N2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"Setting up the fianchetto, with idea to move ...Bg7."
13,a3,a2a3,r1b1kbnr/ppp1pp1p/2n3p1/8/1qBPP3/P4N2/1P1N1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,"So let me get the Queen out of here, and develop my pieces"
14,Qa5,b4a5,r1b1kbnr/ppp1pp1p/2n3p1/q7/2BPP3/P4N2/1P1N1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 8,"Backs up the Queen.  I do not want to move b4, since 8.b4 Nxb4 loses a pawn, or worse, for me."
15,O-O,e1g1,r1b1kbnr/ppp1pp1p/2n3p1/q7/2BPP3/P4N2/1P1N1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 2 8,Castle my King to get rid of that annoying pin.
16,Nf6,g8f6,r1b1kb1r/ppp1pp1p/2n2np1/q7/2BPP3/P4N2/1P1N1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 3 9,"Not sure why this play.  Blocks in Bg7, also the Knight on d2 is no longer pinned."
17,Nb3,d2b3,r1b1kb1r/ppp1pp1p/2n2np1/q7/2BPP3/PN3N2/1P3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 4 9,"As seen here.  Of course, this exposes my pawn on e4, which I regretted later."
18,Qh5,a5h5,r1b1kb1r/ppp1pp1p/2n2np1/7q/2BPP3/PN3N2/1P3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 5 10,"Moves Queen to Kingside, which is where my King is now.  Also, Queen is less exposed to my pieces, which for the moment, are all Queenside."
19,Bf4,c1f4,r1b1kb1r/ppp1pp1p/2n2np1/7q/2BPPB2/PN3N2/1P3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 6 10,"Desiring here to gain dominant centre control.  However, overlooked vulnerable pawn on e4."

21,Qe2,d1e2,r1b1kb1r/ppp1pp1p/2n3p1/7q/2BPnB2/PN3N2/1P2QPPP/R4RK1 b kq - 1 11,Attack the Knight.
22,f5,f7f5,r1b1kb1r/ppp1p2p/2n3p1/5p1q/2BPnB2/PN3N2/1P2QPPP/R4RK1 w kq - 0 12,"Why?  The Queen is limited in space she can go, and is not really a threat here.  Why not Bf4, developing a more mobile piece, and freeing up the rook on a8, to move to half-open d file."
