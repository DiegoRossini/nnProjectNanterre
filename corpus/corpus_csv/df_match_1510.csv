1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,My usual.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,My usual.
3,Bf4,c1f4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P1B2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 2 2,My usual.
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/3P1B2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"One of the strongest response. Black shouldn't lose the chance to move this pawn. He CAN, actually, go on with Nf6, but he has to handle developement very well to equalize, and often castle queenside. All this is avoided with the text move."
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/3P1B2/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"One of the strongest response. Black shouldn't lose the chance to move this pawn. He CAN, actually, go on with Nf6, but he has to handle developement very well to equalize, and often castle queenside. All this is avoided with the text move."
6,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/3P1B2/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"One of the strongest response. Black shouldn't lose the chance to move this pawn.

7,c3,c2c3,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/3P1B2/2P2N2/PP2PPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"I have to be very careful. Black opened the way for his queen to go b6, threatening b2. Since I plan to castle queenside and attack black's kinside (it's my principal plan when playing white), I dont' want to play b3. Now, if black takes, I'll take back with the knight, since I don't want to move my c3 pawn at all, or a strong attack will come over me starting with Bb4+. I'll take with the knight, and if Nc6 or d6 is played... well, I'll see, I can afford this."
8,b6,b7b6,rnbqkb1r/p2p1ppp/1p2pn2/2p5/3P1B2/2P2N2/PP2PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Black goes for another good move, developing the lsb on the big diagonal. I have to be very careful managing this. Accurate player can, I couldn't. Now, I lost a good way to play my game by dxc5, Bxc5, Bd6!, but hey, Ne4 throws away my hopes."
9,Nbd2,b1d2,rnbqkb1r/p2p1ppp/1p2pn2/2p5/3P1B2/2P2N2/PP1NPPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"I know I won't be able to play e4, but nevertheless, I have to develop... and quickly. This knight can reach d6 through c4..."
10,Bb7,c8b7,rn1qkb1r/pb1p1ppp/1p2pn2/2p5/3P1B2/2P2N2/PP1NPPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,"My lsb must be free to check on b5 if black moves the d pawn. By exchanging pieces, I can improve my position. Anything but allowing black to cover d6 or to castle."
11,e3,e2e3,rn1qkb1r/pb1p1ppp/1p2pn2/2p5/3P1B2/2P1PN2/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"My lsb must be free to check on b5 if black moves the d pawn. By exchanging pieces, I can improve my position. Anything but allowing black to cover d6 or to castle."
12,Be7,f8e7,rn1qk2r/pb1pbppp/1p2pn2/2p5/3P1B2/2P1PN2/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,Now or never.
13,dxc5,d4c5,rn1qk2r/pb1pbppp/1p2pn2/2P5/5B2/2P1PN2/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,Now or never.
14,Bxc5,e7c5,rn1qk2r/pb1p1ppp/1p2pn2/2b5/5B2/2P1PN2/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,"If black castles now, he gets into troubles when one of my pieces, B or N, go into d6, joined with b4."
15,Nc4,d2c4,rn1qk2r/pb1p1ppp/1p2pn2/2b5/2N2B2/2P1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 8,"If black castles now, he gets into troubles when one of my pieces, B or N, go into d6, joined with b4."
16,d5,d7d5,rn1qk2r/pb3ppp/1p2pn2/2bp4/2N2B2/2P1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 9,"RIGHT! As a good player will do. This counters my threat on d6. And Ne5 is a non-threatening move that goes for a quiet game, where I am squeezed in and undeveloped. This is the moment that Caissa have to bless me."
17,b4,b2b4,rn1qk2r/pb3ppp/1p2pn2/2bp4/1PN2B2/2P1PN2/P4PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 9,"I'll exchange pieces, queens and pawns, and my position will be decent. He will go for something more, I'm sure..."
18,Be7,c5e7,rn1qk2r/pb2bppp/1p2pn2/3p4/1PN2B2/2P1PN2/P4PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 10,"Right! And this leaves my queen's exchange meaningless, but..."
19,Qa4+,d1a4,rn1qk2r/pb2bppp/1p2pn2/3p4/QPN2B2/2P1PN2/P4PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 2 10,Naive? Not at all: I'll defend my knight by pinning black's d pawn.
20,Bc6,b7c6,rn1qk2r/p3bppp/1pb1pn2/3p4/QPN2B2/2P1PN2/P4PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 3 11,"Not the best, but on Qd7, we had a boring game, and the N move would have conceded a lot after Ne5 - Rd1 etc."
21,b5,b4b5,rn1qk2r/p3bppp/1pb1pn2/1P1p4/Q1N2B2/2P1PN2/P4PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 11,"Again, the crossed exchange favours me grately, due to c7+, so black has to decline."
22,Bb7,c6b7,rn1qk2r/pb2bppp/1p2pn2/1P1p4/Q1N2B2/2P1PN2/P4PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 1 12,"He sopped my queen, but he is not more developed than before, and I still have..."
23,Rd1,a1d1,rn1qk2r/pb2bppp/1p2pn2/1P1p4/Q1N2B2/2P1PN2/P4PPP/3RKB1R b Kkq - 2 12,"The BQ can move to c8, but in that case, I can play Nd6, forcing BxN, BxB, and black cannot castle, while I dominate the black squares. But this nice pin has a downside..."
24,O-O,e8g8,rn1q1rk1/pb2bppp/1p2pn2/1P1p4/Q1N2B2/2P1PN2/P4PPP/3RKB1R w K - 3 13,"Yep, black can castle. Now, I have to find a way to exploit my outpost on b5, controlling c6, a key square for his developement. I want my TWO knights ""looking"" at c6... how to achieve it?"
25,Nce5,c4e5,rn1q1rk1/pb2bppp/1p2pn2/1P1pN3/Q4B2/2P1PN2/P4PPP/3RKB1R b K - 4 13,"Of course, black can't even think about d4. This is ok for now, but the opening of the white diagonal on g2 is a factor that I should have cared for."
26,Qc8,d8c8,rnq2rk1/pb2bppp/1p2pn2/1P1pN3/Q4B2/2P1PN2/P4PPP/3RKB1R w K - 5 14,"As predicted, threatening c3, and avoiding my Nc6. I can defend it by Rc1, but hey, this rook will be undefended, giving some strange ideas to black... and my queen can't go to d4, or Bc5..."
27,c4,c3c4,rnq2rk1/pb2bppp/1p2pn2/1P1pN3/Q1P2B2/4PN2/P4PPP/3RKB1R b K - 0 14,"Take this! Ok, I'm allowing black's lsb to grab the diagonal, but it will lead me to be able to close it with a knight... very tense and interesting situation, IMO..."
