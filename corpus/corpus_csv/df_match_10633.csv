1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game is a very clear demonstration of why the loss of a king's fianchettoed bishop can have such a weakening effect, and it also demonstrates the power of a very sudden change in direction of attack."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Slav defense to the Queen's gambit. With the gambit 2. c4 white attempts to remove the defending pawn at d5 by temping it with the gambit, in order to make way for the white e-file pawn's advancement that will secure the centre. With 2...c6, black prevents this, and keeps open the option of readily developing the white-squared bishop on the c8-h3 diagonal."

The fianchettoed bishop in front of black's king in this variant has less effect than in some other openings, because white can often establish a strong line of pawns on the g1-a7 diagonal, which partially restricts the squares it could control. Black must endeavor to undermine the central white pawns."

Playing white, I wanted to preserve this bishop as it has a nice row of  pawns from f2 to d4 to slide along later in the game. However, the move 7. h3 is a bit slow and it risks a later bishop sacrifice (...Bxh3) attack from black."
