I've played thousands of KG games as white (and hundreds of Latvian Gambits as black), yet this one was unique as I very soon found myself under early attack. Normally it's the other way around: the gambiteer should be the early attacker. That being said, under a threat of mate, Caissa smiled and I found a sneaky way out...and was able to turn the tables just in time."
