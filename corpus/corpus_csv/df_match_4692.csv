2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"The exchange variation. My preferred way to play against the Alkhine, I have never tried the four pawn attack and instead play the exchange variation which is a little less ambitios but good none the less. I am actually going for a specific sub variation, the one I call the weird v variation."

10,cxd6,c7d6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/1n1p4/8/2PP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,Some people play exd I dont know which is better or for that matter which I prefer my opponents to play however all my opening knowledge is for if they play this move. So I am happy to continue my book knowledge.
11,Be3,c1e3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/1n1p4/8/2PP4/4B3/PP3PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 6,I'm not sure exatly what order I'm meant to play the moves for my variatoion however I do know the set up which is good enough.
12,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/1n1p2p1/8/2PP4/4B3/PP3PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,The Voronezh variation. I cant spell it without looking it up and I certaintly can't prounounce it. So I just call it the weird v variation. It delays kingside development to stop black adopting his usual game plan for the opening. It also scores very well for white.

18,Nc6,b8c6,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/1nnp2p1/8/2PP4/1PN1B3/P4PPP/2RQKBNR w K - 1 10,I have found out since playing this that after ...Nc6!? white mainline is for white to play d4 however I didn't know that at the time.
19,h3,h2h3,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/1nnp2p1/8/2PP4/1PN1B2P/P4PP1/2RQKBNR b K - 0 10,"?! probably a waste of time, it was done to prevent the knight being pinned which is I think thematic in the alkhine, however I suspect the immediate Be2 was better especially as that is whats likely to be played anyway."
20,Bd7,c8d7,r2q1rk1/pp1bppbp/1nnp2p1/8/2PP4/1PN1B2P/P4PP1/2RQKBNR w K - 1 11,I'm still waiting for the eventual e pawn thrust which is I also think common in this version of the alkhine.

I dont think this was a very good move from blacks perspective, it blocks the d7 square for the LSB so that white can now trade it off. I think as white my position is alright. White seems to have a slight bind going on as well as more options to play."
