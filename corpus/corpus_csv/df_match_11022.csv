1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Quite frankly this is one of the best games ever played, Kasparov once again plays a daring gambit in full knowledge Karpov and his seconds have had over a week to prepare for it. Kasparovs idea is so deep even Karpov underestimated the strength of it and is dragged into a position where his pieces are helpless due to a dominating knight on d3. Karpov refuses to return the pawn which allows Kasparov to domiate the game, in the end Karpov is bound hand and foot and all he can do is sit and await his execution"

The queen and rooks also have no squares. the dark square bishop has no squares and can only be exchanged for his black counter part. the light square bishop cannot come to e2 as 22...Ne4 23.Qxd3 Nxg3 wins a piece. so white is pretty much forced to play"
