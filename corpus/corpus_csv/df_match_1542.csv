1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was one of 6 Gameknot games I played simultaneously with my opponent. I lost two, drew 3 and won this. Some of those draws were very lucky, when my opponent kindly offered me a draw although I was a clear pawn down in a couple of them. In this game he loses as one of his knights goes out on a solo run to win a pawn, but ends up losing itself for two pawns. I manage to convert a lead of a knight for two pawns into a win - but we both make a lot os mistakes along the way!"
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"In a couple of games he had beaten me very quickly and very easily with the Blackmar–Diemer Gambit, after 1. d4 Nf6, 2. Nc3 d5 3.e4. I wanted to try and find out what he would play against it himself."
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 2,"In a couple of games he had beaten me very quickly and very easily with the Blackmar–Diemer Gambit, after 1. d4 Nf6, 2. Nc3 d5 3.e4. I wanted to try and find out what he would play against it himself."
4,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"But instead he transposes into a Benoni. This version of the Benoni is considered better for white however, as the normal c2-c4 has not been played. the square c4 is available for a knight or bishop."
5,d5,d4d5,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2pP4/8/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"g6, d6 and e5 are all more common at this point."
6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2pP4/8/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"g6, d6 and e5 are all more common at this point."
7,e4,e2e4,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2pP4/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,I reinforce my centre.
8,d6,d7d6,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3ppn2/2pP4/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,He prevents the d5-d6 push.
9,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3ppn2/2pP2B1/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 1 5,I'm following the Gameknot opening databases as usual!
10,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/3ppn2/2pP2B1/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 2 6,He develops.
11,Bb5+,f1b5,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/3ppn2/1BpP2B1/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 3 6,I throw in a check.
12,Bd7,c8d7,rn1qk2r/pp1bbppp/3ppn2/1BpP2B1/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 4 7,He blocks.
13,dxe6,d5e6,rn1qk2r/pp1bbppp/3pPn2/1Bp3B1/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 0 7,I take.
14,fxe6,f7e6,rn1qk2r/pp1bb1pp/3ppn2/1Bp3B1/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 0 8,He takes back.
15,Bxd7+,b5d7,rn1qk2r/pp1Bb1pp/3ppn2/2p3B1/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 0 8,I exchange bishops.
16,Nbxd7,b8d7,r2qk2r/pp1nb1pp/3ppn2/2p3B1/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 0 9,He takes back. Interestingly on the World database taking back with the queen is the only move given. Taking with the knight can hardly be bad surely?
17,Nge2,g1e2,r2qk2r/pp1nb1pp/3ppn2/2p3B1/4P3/2N5/PPP1NPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 9,"As played in longtail99 (1922) vs. sualksnh (2472), in a tournament called ""Play the Trompowsky Attack!"" so obviously with a different move order."
18,a6,a7a6,r2qk2r/1p1nb1pp/p2ppn2/2p3B1/4P3/2N5/PPP1NPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 10,That game continued with Ne5 instead of a6. a6 is given as a mistake by the Post Match Computer Analysis (PMCA).
19,a4,a2a4,r2qk2r/1p1nb1pp/p2ppn2/2p3B1/P3P3/2N5/1PP1NPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 10,So this is the first move I did entirely off my own bat. PMCA says it is a mistake and prefers Nf4! Oh well.....
20,Ne5,d7e5,r2qk2r/1p2b1pp/p2ppn2/2p1n1B1/P3P3/2N5/1PP1NPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 1 11,So this move comes in at last.
21,f4,f2f4,r2qk2r/1p2b1pp/p2ppn2/2p1n1B1/P3PP2/2N5/1PP1N1PP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 11,So I hit the knight.
22,Neg4,e5g4,r2qk2r/1p2b1pp/p2ppn2/2p3B1/P3PPn1/2N5/1PP1N1PP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 1 12,"And of it goes, on a solo adventure from which it will never come back."
