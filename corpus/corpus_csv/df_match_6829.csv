1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Already Doubrava is overcautious.
2,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Already Doubrava is overcautious.
3,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,"Dadian, by contrast, plays aggressive chess."
4,Nd7,b8d7,r1bqkbnr/pppnpppp/3p4/8/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 3,Way too conservative. Also blocks the QB.
5,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pppnpppp/3p4/8/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,Dadian develops quickly and efficiently.
6,g6,g7g6,r1bqkbnr/pppnpp1p/3p2p1/8/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,Why? 3...P-K4 was definitely in order. Doubrava will choke to death if he doesn't claim some space.
7,Ng5,f3g5,r1bqkbnr/pppnpp1p/3p2p1/6N1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,Threatens 5 BxP mate!
8,Nh6,g8h6,r1bqkb1r/pppnpp1p/3p2pn/6N1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,Forced.
9,Bxf7+,c4f7,r1bqkb1r/pppnpB1p/3p2pn/6N1/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,Sacrificing the Bishop...
10,Nxf7,h6f7,r1bqkb1r/pppnpn1p/3p2p1/6N1/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,Forced again. But now...
11,Ne6,g5e6,r1bqkb1r/pppnpn1p/3pN1p1/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,And Doubrava resigns. His Queen will fall. His lack of fight cost him severely in this game.
