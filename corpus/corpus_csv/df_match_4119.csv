2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The computer analysis shows this move, Nf6, as not as precise as d6.  The gameknot database for the Scotch shows only d6 as the book move here.  In 365chess.com, they show White winning ~79% of the time with the response of e5.  Black cannot find a good place for his Knight.

Note how this one imprecise move by Black causes it to lose time, while White develops nicely.

This corresponds to the advice I give to look for a mistake or lack of precision or sharpness in the opening, seize on it and relentlessly put pressure on your opponent. The opening book does show Black's Bf6 as possible."
