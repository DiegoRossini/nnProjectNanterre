1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,My favorite opening with White.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Starting with King's Pawn Game.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Playing the most popular move by White in this position.
4,f6,f7f6,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"Bad move for Black. Since the e-pawn can be taken by the Knight. And if Black takes back the Knight, there will be a great counterplay by White.
These four moves are known as the Damiano Defence."
5,Nxe5,f3e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,So white takes the e-pawn.

9,Bxh6,c1h6,rnbqkb1r/ppp3pp/3p1p1B/4N3/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"A Knight for a Knight trade, because if Black takes the Bisshop, it leads to a Mate in two."
