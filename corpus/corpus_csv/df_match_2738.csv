1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This is my first annotation.  Comments and critics are encouraged and appreciated!
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"This is not one of the more typical defenses, but it is logically.  The fianchetto helps black take advantage of the weak e5 square."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 2,"This is not one of the more typical defenses, but it is logically.  The fianchetto helps black take advantage of the weak e5 square."

7,g3,g2g3,rnbqkb1r/p1pp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,To bring my white bishop to g2 and help support my white squares.  Nc3 is certainly playable here as well.
8,Bb7,c8b7,rn1qkb1r/pbpp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"According to the Gameknot DB this is the Torres Attack.  Personally, I think it's very strong.  Black gets c5 off quickly, his LS bishop has lots of room, and generally has a good game."
9,Bg2,f1g2,rn1qkb1r/pbpp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 5,"According to the Gameknot DB this is the Torres Attack.  Personally, I think it's very strong.  Black gets c5 off quickly, his LS bishop has lots of room, and generally has a good game."

12,exd5,e6d5,rn1qkb1r/pb1p1ppp/1p3n2/2pp4/2P5/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"The d5 pawn is now pinned, and white can recapture at his convenience."
13,Nh4,f3h4,rn1qkb1r/pb1p1ppp/1p3n2/2pp4/2P4N/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,"The d5 pawn is now pinned, and white can recapture at his convenience."

Even though the bishop has a longer diagonal on d5, I'm not sure where it's going from there.  Maybe it can come to e5 in the future but that seems to be the only offensive post, and be7 is stronger defensively."
15,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qk2r/pb1p1ppp/1p1b1n2/2pp4/2P4N/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 8,"Although I could recapture, I still don't have to, so I strengthen my light squares and develop."
