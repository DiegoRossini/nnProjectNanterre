1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hello i'd like to annotate this game because i found it fascinating...It was a game for the 5th round of 61st GK Tournament. I play with black here.
 So he started with e4."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I played e5. I always prefer that move instead of playing c5.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Typical.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,And typical reply too. I don't like Nf6.
5,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,He played with his white bishop. Nice move.

7,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1B2p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 5 4,In order to protect the e4 pawn.
8,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1Bb1p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 6 5,I open the bishop. I wanted to castle and also open my white bishop with d6 pawn.

11,Nxe5,f3e5,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1Bb1N3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 6,"So he attacked in the e pawn and i accepted that, nice move. He wanted to open the game and not being pathetic. i have the tendency as black to play a quiet game ( i prefer to play with white pawns)."
12,Nxe5,c6e5,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/5n2/1Bb1n3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 7,So i took it.
13,d4,d2d4,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/5n2/1Bb1n3/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 7,I imagined that. Otherwise it would have been a bad move for him.
14,Bxd4,c5d4,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/5n2/1B2n3/3bP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 8,I decided to sacrifice the bishop! Bye bye Bishop! I think i made the right choice.
15,Qxd4,d1d4,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/5n2/1B2n3/3QP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 0 8,He took my bishop and he's queen has somehow a more attacking attitude.
16,Qe7,d8e7,r1b2rk1/ppppqppp/5n2/1B2n3/3QP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 1 9,I decided to open my queen too and protect my knight.
17,Bg5,c1g5,r1b2rk1/ppppqppp/5n2/1B2n1B1/3QP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - - 2 9,Now he's pushing the other knight but still i have no worries. Nice movement anyway.
18,c6,c7c6,r1b2rk1/pp1pqppp/2p2n2/1B2n1B1/3QP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 10,I said now it's time to push his white bishop cause i did not like the square he controlled. But i had doubts for that movement..Nevermind!
19,Bd3,b5d3,r1b2rk1/pp1pqppp/2p2n2/4n1B1/3QP3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - - 1 10,He put it back. I still didn't have a serious plan in my mind.
20,Nxd3,e5d3,r1b2rk1/pp1pqppp/2p2n2/6B1/3QP3/2Nn4/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 11,So i decided to take his bishop and sacrifice my knight.
