1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I start with the usual
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,He replies with my favourite defence
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,I continue with the main line
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"And he responds with a fianchetto - the accelerated Dragon (Classes as Sicilian (B27), Hungarian variation by some authorities). On the league's website this was also described as ""Hyper-accelerated Dragon"" http://wirralchessleague.com/?page=news"
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,So I continue in the approved manner.
6,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"He takes. For the first time in the game, I had a think. I did consider taking with the queen, threatening his rook on h8, but after 4. Qxd4 Nf6 5. e5 Nc6 I didn't think that white had any advantage. I check on the Opening Databases after the game seemed to back me up."
7,Nxd4,f3d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,So I took with the knight.
8,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk1nr/pp1pppbp/6p1/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,He continues with the logical development.
9,c4,c2c4,rnbqk1nr/pp1pppbp/6p1/8/2PNP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"and I take a grip on the centre, the Maroczy Bind strategy. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar%C3%B3czy_bind"
10,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/8/2PNP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,He continues to develop
11,Be3,c1e3,r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/8/2PNP3/4B3/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 2 6,I have to protect the knight on d4
12,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/pp1pppbp/2n2np1/8/2PNP3/4B3/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 3 7,"He develops with tempo, hitting my e pawn"
13,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqk2r/pp1pppbp/2n2np1/8/2PNP3/2N1B3/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 4 7,So I develop and protect it.
14,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp1pppbp/2n2np1/8/2PNP3/2N1B3/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 5 8,He castles
15,Be2,f1e2,r1bq1rk1/pp1pppbp/2n2np1/8/2PNP3/2N1B3/PP2BPPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 6 8,"I develop. I want to play Qd2, but I don't want him hitting my Be3 with Ng4."
16,d6,d7d6,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/2PNP3/2N1B3/PP2BPPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 9,"I'm not too bothered with Ng4 10. Bxg4 Bxg4 as I get rid of my ""bad"" bishop - the one on white squares, which is rather blocked by my pawns."
17,Qd2,d1d2,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/2PNP3/2N1B3/PP1QBPPP/R3K2R b KQ - 1 9,"I'm not too bothered with Ng4 10. Bxg4 Bxg4 as I get rid of my ""bad"" bishop - the one on white squares, which is rather blocked by my pawns."
18,Re8,f8e8,r1bqr1k1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/2PNP3/2N1B3/PP1QBPPP/R3K2R w KQ - 2 10,"One idea of this move is that if white continues with the plan of f3, 0-0-0 and Bh6, black is not forced to exchange black squared bishops and can just drop the Bg7 back to h8."
19,f3,f2f3,r1bqr1k1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/2PNP3/2N1BP2/PP1QB1PP/R3K2R b KQ - 0 10,I reinforce my centre. 0-0 may be better
20,Bd7,c8d7,r2qr1k1/pp1bppbp/2np1np1/8/2PNP3/2N1BP2/PP1QB1PP/R3K2R w KQ - 1 11,he continues to develop. This position has been seen before.
21,O-O-O,e1c1,r2qr1k1/pp1bppbp/2np1np1/8/2PNP3/2N1BP2/PP1QB1PP/2KR3R b - - 2 11,"But this move is probably over-optimistic. 0-0 is the usual move played in this position, and a slow positional grind in the centre and queen's side. But the question is - how does black avoid the standard attack that white is planning, with g4, h4-h5, take on g6 to open up the h file, and, as Bobby Fischer said ""sac, sac, mate""."
