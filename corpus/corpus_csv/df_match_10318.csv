1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"This is a very interesting attacking miniature, which also features a clever way to play against the Reti Opening.  However, what is actually more impressive in this game is what doesn't transpire over the board.  This game definitely will appeal to Dutch Defense players who face 1. Nf3."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,
3,g3,g2g3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5NP1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,"Kramnik doesn't like to enter the reverse Benoni lines after 2. c4 d4.  It is probably worthy to note that Kramnik would normally play 2. d4 here, however, this game was the last in a winner take all tournament and he was looking to avoid any preparation that his opponent might have done prior to the match."
4,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/8/5NP1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"Black begins to secure his center, while leaving the c8-h3 diagonal open for the bishop.  This is a very flexible way of playing the opening."
5,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/8/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 3,
6,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/6b1/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 4,"This move is very logical, as Black intends on closing the light squares with ...e6.  If 3...Nf6; 4. c4 Bg4, White has the very sharp 5.  Ne5 Bh5; 6. cd cd; 7. Qa4  Nbd7; 8. Nc3 e6; 9. g4!  Black is having difficulties."
7,O-O,e1g1,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/6b1/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 3 4,White keeps his options open as well.
8,Nd7,b8d7,r2qkbnr/pp1npppp/2p5/3p4/6b1/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 4 5,Black is preparing an advance in the center.
9,d4,d2d4,r2qkbnr/pp1npppp/2p5/3p4/3P2b1/5NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 5,"White finally commits in the center, as ...e5 was Black's idea."
10,e6,e7e6,r2qkbnr/pp1n1ppp/2p1p3/3p4/3P2b1/5NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 6,Black has a strong center and a very logical developmental plan.  White's central pawn breaks are c4 and e4.  Black prevents this in an interesting way.
11,Nbd2,b1d2,r2qkbnr/pp1n1ppp/2p1p3/3p4/3P2b1/5NP1/PPPNPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 6,Leaving the possibility of both breaks open.
12,f5,f7f5,r2qkbnr/pp1n2pp/2p1p3/3p1p2/3P2b1/5NP1/PPPNPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,"This move radically prevents the e4 break, which White was going to play after ...Ngf6; 7. Re1."
13,c4,c2c4,r2qkbnr/pp1n2pp/2p1p3/3p1p2/2PP2b1/5NP1/PP1NPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,White reverts to the other plan of attack.
14,Bd6,f8d6,r2qk1nr/pp1n2pp/2pbp3/3p1p2/2PP2b1/5NP1/PP1NPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 1 8,"Now Black can develop the knight flexible and either move to f6 or f7 via h6.  If Black is able to develop the knight and castle, then he will have no problems as he has a favorable version of the stonewall with the bishop outside of the pawn chain."
15,Qb3,d1b3,r2qk1nr/pp1n2pp/2pbp3/3p1p2/2PP2b1/1Q3NP1/PP1NPPBP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 2 8,Kramnik decides that the Black kingside is underdeveloped and undertakes active operations to keep Black off balance.

17,Re1,f1e1,1r1qk1nr/pp1n2pp/2pbp3/3p1p2/2PP2b1/1Q3NP1/PP1NPPBP/R1B1R1K1 b k - 4 9,"This move indicates that White wants to play e4, however, this looks difficult at the moment."
18,Nh6,g8h6,1r1qk2r/pp1n2pp/2pbp2n/3p1p2/2PP2b1/1Q3NP1/PP1NPPBP/R1B1R1K1 w k - 5 10,"After 9...Ngf6; 10. cd cd; 11. Ng5 Qe7; 12. f3 Bh5; 13. e4, White would begin a direct attack against the Black king."
