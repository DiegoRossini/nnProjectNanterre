2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"1... e5 - This takes me well out of my element. I'm not a fan of Classical play because I'd rather not memorize the vast numbers of lines. I guess I played it because I wanted a different flavour to my game than usual. Only after I made the move did I notice the gap in ratings. Here I thought, ""This may have been a mistake."""
