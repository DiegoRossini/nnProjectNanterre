1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"As my regular readers know by now, I'm concentrating on the English Open for OTB chess and am using Gameknot to help me practise its lines."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"This move opens up the Reverse Sicilian, but as it is White's move it keeps the advantage on White's side."
3,g3,g2g3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/6P1/PP1PPP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Allows White to begin his strategy of light coloured square control.
4,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk1nr/ppppbppp/8/4p3/2P5/6P1/PP1PPP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"I've stated this before in games at this point and I'll state it again, I think the best move is Nf6 here allowing a d5 push and strengthening the centre.  It also happens to be the preferred move of Karpov for this situation, although I wouldn't dare to guess at his reasoning! :o)"
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk1nr/ppppbppp/8/4p3/2P5/2N3P1/PP1PPP1P/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 3,Black's plan of 2...Be7 is revealed as aiming for an early castle.
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqk2r/ppppbppp/5n2/4p3/2P5/2N3P1/PP1PPP1P/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 3 4,Black's plan of 2...Be7 is revealed as aiming for an early castle.
7,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqk2r/ppppbppp/5n2/4p3/2P5/2N3P1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 4 4,Pin on the b7 Pawn and helps to gain some control over the centre.
8,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppppbppp/5n2/4p3/2P5/2N3P1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQK1NR w KQ - 5 5,Looking at pushing my d Pawn forward.
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbq1rk1/ppppbppp/5n2/4p3/2P5/2N2NP1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 6 5,Looking at pushing my d Pawn forward.
10,d6,d7d6,rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/3p1n2/4p3/2P5/2N2NP1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 6,Black removes the threat on his e Pawn.
11,d4,d2d4,rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/3p1n2/4p3/2PP4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 6,"Attacks White's Knight on c3.  I prefer 6...c6 for Black here, looking at keeping the centre stronger.  Maybe something like 6...c6 7.O-O e4 8.Ne1 Be6 9.Nxe4 Bxc4 10.Nxf6+ Bxf6  ???"
12,exd4,e5d4,rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/3p1n2/8/2Pp4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 7,"Attacks White's Knight on c3.  I prefer 6...c6 for Black here, looking at keeping the centre stronger.  Maybe something like 6...c6 7.O-O e4 8.Ne1 Be6 9.Nxe4 Bxc4 10.Nxf6+ Bxf6  ???"
13,Nxd4,f3d4,rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/3p1n2/8/2PN4/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 7,"Logical move.  Pin on Black's b7 Pawn and evens up the material.  Also, d4 is a strong position for any Knight, allowing it to make it's presence felt on 8 squares."
14,c5,c7c5,rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/3p1n2/2p5/2PN4/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 8,Looks the best move.  Forces Black to move his Knight away.
15,Nc2,d4c2,rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/3p1n2/2p5/2P5/2N3P1/PPN1PPBP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 1 8,"I dislike this move, I don't feel it gains anything for Black, allowing White a ""move in hand"" as it were.  White already has the advantage of being first to move, so this sort of delaying move just plays into his hands.  I think I'd have looked at 8...Nc6 9.O-O Be6 10.Ne3 Qd7 11.Ned5 Bh3, which looks better."
16,a6,a7a6,rnbq1rk1/1p2bppp/p2p1n2/2p5/2P5/2N3P1/PPN1PPBP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 9,"I dislike this move, I don't feel it gains anything for Black, allowing White a ""move in hand"" as it were.

18,Ra7,a8a7,1nbq1rk1/rp2bppp/p2p1n2/2p5/2P5/2N1N1P1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 2 10,This smacks of another delaying move to me.  Perhaps someone else has some insight?  I'd have gone Nc6 with the aim of an eventual Rb8 and pushing the Queenside Pawns.
19,O-O,e1g1,1nbq1rk1/rp2bppp/p2p1n2/2p5/2P5/2N1N1P1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 3 10,"Finally gained my Knight foothold in the centre.  Very powerful square, defended by my second Knight and my Queen."

I think both moves have merit.  In the end I went with e4, more instinct than decision.  I simply didn't want to box in my e-Pawn with my Bishop.  The 12.Be3 line I had in mind was 12... b5 13.Qb3 Nxd5 14.Nxd5 Bxd5 15.Bxd5 bxc4 16.Qxc4, whereas the 12.e4 line I had in mind was 12... Nxd5 13.exd5 Bd7 14.Re1 b5 15.cxb5 axb5.  Was I right to go with the e4 one?  If correctness is measured by winning the game, then yes :o)"

Instead, Black chooses to defend his own Knight.  At this point I was beginning to feel that my opponent had decided to try and last against me, rather than to attempt to win.  This is a very good tactic when you feel outmatched in a game, allowing you to frustrate your opponent and occasionally force a draw or snatch a win through your opponent making an error."
