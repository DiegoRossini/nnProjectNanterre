I have, in my opinion, a combination in the middle game and a nice, quick and sharp rook endgame... There was a fixed initial opening in this mini-tournament; 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4.

Indeed, most statistical surveys suggest that 1.d4 is the most successful first move for White, but only because 1...c5! scores so highly against 1.e4.""  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Defense For more interesting and easy access knowledge about chess openings I suggest to read more at  wikipedia.org"
