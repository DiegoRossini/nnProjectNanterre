8,Bd6,f8d6,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3b4/3PN3/4p3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,I was thinking of 4...Qxd5; 5.d4

21,Be3,c1e3,rnbqr1k1/p4ppp/1p1b1n2/3PN3/2BQpP2/2N1B3/PPP3PP/R4RK1 b - - 1 11,"I didn´t feel like giving up my pawn, but I thought it was going to be the safest move. Also I found out (After I made the move) that I had a nice attack if Bxd5."
