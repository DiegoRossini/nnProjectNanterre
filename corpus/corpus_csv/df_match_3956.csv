However, Black is aiming for Nc6 which I think is a very dangerous move for White. White would have to thread a very thin needle to stay in the game at all (Qxd5 may work). Even then, a Knight on c6 is only two moves away from c2 attacking the Rooks. Obviously White's a1-Rook needs to get into play (I'm thinking c1 or d1), but that brings us back to the Bishop.
I considered Be3 ... but that begs the question 'Why did you move the Rook to e1 in the first place if you're going to block it with a Bishop?'
I ended up with Bf4."

This attacks my Queen (immediate issue) but also opens the d8-h4 diagonal ... giving Black's Queen a route into White's K-side. Would this discourage Black from playing g5 (and blocking the diagonal)? Hummm ... don't know.
Anyway, the Queen could fall back to d1, 2 or 3 and still have a playable position. The e-5-pawn is not in wonderful shape but doesn't need the Queen for protection at the moment.
So ... I don't think I need to move the Queen right at this moment. There may be something more useful on this move.

Na4 looks interesting. From there it could drop into b6 (as long as White's Queen stayed on d4 (which ain't going to happen as Black will play Nf5 anyway), or c5 blocking the c6-pawn. c5 might be a nice little outpost ... especially with a3 and b4 as protection. Just thinking out loud here."

My concern was getting the a5-Knight onto a more active square, eventually c5 or d4.  Therefore, I had to protect the a-pawn.  I spent a lot of time looking at Queen moves but couldn't come up with anything.

I simply could not get a clear picture of the board ... and any suggestions on how to do that would be greatly appreciated!  My opponent gave some good advice regarding playing over annotated master games.

Anyway, 26. Re3 seems to be the popular choice here ... but I'm not clear on how that allows Nb3 in the near-term."

Maneuvering my Rooks behind my advanced pawns will be very difficult with Black's light-squared Bishop still on the board ... as will freeing my King should the need arise.  If I can get my Rook to d2 or d4 then the forward d-pawn will be a bit more secure.  Whatever the case, Black is getting ready to play Rd8, but the d-pawn is (for a move or two) covered by White’s Bishop ... but then the pawn can’t move forward without a Rook backing it up.
However, with the Knight coming into play I have to make sure I get the Rooks and King are on different colored squares ... hummm, three pieces and two colors ... that really is going to be a trick!
The second choice is Be5 ... but there an eventual f6 (backed up by something of course) forces it away, maybe back to where it is now.  So that’s sort of a bust.  Although the Bishop really lacks any scope where it is, it seems to be doing its limited job fairly well.
And that brings us to a4.  Not a great move ... but it does protect the b-pawn.  And, now that I think about it ... Black is going to drop the Knight onto d4, threatening Nxb5 or Nc2 forking the Rooks.  So, to keep from dropping the pawn White has to cover it this move.  I think a4 does that.  Black obviously has a lot of optional responses ... but at least it works for one move.

In retrospect, I failed to realize how powerfully Black's Bishop was positioned.  Re3 was again the best move."
