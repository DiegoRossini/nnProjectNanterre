2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,My opponent decides to go for the french defence
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,No longer the standard french defence with my opponents last move.
4,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2p1p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,No longer the standard french defence with my opponents last move.
5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2p1p3/8/2BPP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 3,Could have played e4 to e5 but instead chose to place a stronger control on the center.
6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3p4/2BPP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 4,choosing not to open his king in the center he attacks towards the center but thus leaving his king open to my bishop

8,cxd5,c6d5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/3p4/2BP4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,choosing not to open his king in the center he attacks towards the center but thus leaving his king open to my bishop
9,Bb5+,c4b5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/1B1p4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 5,Now I really think he had better moves to protect the king because this move blocks in his bishop completely which will slow down his development.

11,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pp1n1ppp/4p3/1B1p4/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 3 6,He decides since his knight is pinned he will do the same to mine.
12,Bb4,f8b4,r1bqk1nr/pp1n1ppp/4p3/1B1p4/1b1P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 4 7,He decides since his knight is pinned he will do the same to mine.
13,Qd3,d1d3,r1bqk1nr/pp1n1ppp/4p3/1B1p4/1b1P4/2NQ4/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 5 7,not wanting to double up my pawns and I chose to bring my queen up. I didn't want to protect with my bishop hoping for the future knight to queen pin.
14,Ngf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/pp1n1ppp/4pn2/1B1p4/1b1P4/2NQ4/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 6 8,And theres the pin.
15,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqk2r/pp1n1ppp/4pn2/1B1p2B1/1b1P4/2NQ4/PPP2PPP/R3K1NR b KQkq - 7 8,And theres the pin.

17,Bxf6,g5f6,r1bqk2r/pp1n1pp1/4pB1p/1B1p4/1b1P4/2NQ4/PPP2PPP/R3K1NR b KQkq - 0 9,I sacrificed my pishop pair knowing he was down on development.

19,Nf3,g1f3,r1b1k2r/pp1n1pp1/4pq1p/1B1p4/1b1P4/2NQ1N2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 1 10,Not quite sure what his plans were with this move as he removed the pin and that just made his original pin move pointless.
20,Bd6,b4d6,r1b1k2r/pp1n1pp1/3bpq1p/1B1p4/3P4/2NQ1N2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 2 11,Not quite sure what his plans were with this move as he removed the pin and that just made his original pin move pointless.
21,O-O,e1g1,r1b1k2r/pp1n1pp1/3bpq1p/1B1p4/3P4/2NQ1N2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b kq - 3 11,Here I am completely developed and ready for the middle game and as you can see my opponent is way behind as he still needs to move his blocked bishop which requires him to move another piece first and his knight is pinned.
22,a6,a7a6,r1b1k2r/1p1n1pp1/p2bpq1p/1B1p4/3P4/2NQ1N2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w kq - 0 12,finally attempting to unpin his knight.
23,Ba4,b5a4,r1b1k2r/1p1n1pp1/p2bpq1p/3p4/B2P4/2NQ1N2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b kq - 1 12,keeping it pinned
24,b5,b7b5,r1b1k2r/3n1pp1/p2bpq1p/1p1p4/B2P4/2NQ1N2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w kq - 0 13,now here I had the choice to sacrifice the bishop for two pawns knowing he was so far down on development instead of backing off and chose to do so.
25,Bxb5,a4b5,r1b1k2r/3n1pp1/p2bpq1p/1B1p4/3P4/2NQ1N2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b kq - 0 13,now here you will notice I am threatening to take his bishop as well as seeing a future fork on the rook and king.
26,axb5,a6b5,r1b1k2r/3n1pp1/3bpq1p/1p1p4/3P4/2NQ1N2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w kq - 0 14,now here you will notice I am threatening to take his bishop as well as seeing a future fork on the rook and king.

28,O-O,e8g8,r1b2rk1/3n1pp1/3bpq1p/1N1p4/3P4/3Q1N2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - - 1 15,Blunder!!!!! He should have protected the fork and bishop in the same move by moving the bishop either on b8 or f4. The other choice is to move his queen once again and protect the bishop. You see how both moves require him to continue to remove pieces and not being able to continue to develop while I can begin my attack.
29,Nxd6,b5d6,r1b2rk1/3n1pp1/3Npq1p/3p4/3P4/3Q1N2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b - - 0 15,here he is double attacking both my queen and rook but that is not a huge problem for me as I simply move up my c pawn to block knowing after his pawn takes I can take with my knight.
30,Ba6,c8a6,r4rk1/3n1pp1/b2Npq1p/3p4/3P4/3Q1N2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - - 1 16,here he is double attacking both my queen and rook but that is not a huge problem for me as I simply move up my c pawn to block knowing after his pawn takes I can take with my knight.
31,c4,c2c4,r4rk1/3n1pp1/b2Npq1p/3p4/2PP4/3Q1N2/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b - - 0 16,now he is double attacking my knight.
32,dxc4,d5c4,r4rk1/3n1pp1/b2Npq1p/8/2pP4/3Q1N2/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 17,now he is double attacking my knight.
33,Nxc4,d6c4,r4rk1/3n1pp1/b3pq1p/8/2NP4/3Q1N2/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b - - 0 17,now he is double attacking my knight.

35,b3,b2b3,r1r3k1/3n1pp1/b3pq1p/8/2NP4/1P1Q1N2/P4PPP/R4RK1 b - - 0 18,so I double protect it.
