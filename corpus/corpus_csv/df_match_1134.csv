16,Be6,c8e6,rn2kb1r/1pq2ppp/p2pbn2/4p3/4P3/1NN1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 9,"One of the nice features of the Najdorf is the simplicity of formation. Black aims to setup a flexible defensive structure with bishops on e7 and e6, knights on d7 and f6 and Queen on c7 with rooks on c8 and d8. After that he plans to play b7-b5-b4 or d6-d5 for counter play."
17,g4,g2g4,rn2kb1r/1pq2ppp/p2pbn2/4p3/4P1P1/1NN1BP2/PPP4P/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 9,"Not everyone is a fan of this move as it is double edged. In the Sicilian, if you can not find the right balance between structure and activity you end up losing."

21,h4,h2h4,r3kb1r/1pqn1pp1/p2pbn1p/4p3/4P1PP/1NN1BP2/PPPQ4/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 11,continuing with the simple plan of overrunning on kingside.
22,Be7,f8e7,r3k2r/1pqnbpp1/p2pbn1p/4p3/4P1PP/1NN1BP2/PPPQ4/R3KB1R w KQkq - 1 12,develops a piece and prevents g4-g5.
23,Rh2,h1h2,r3k2r/1pqnbpp1/p2pbn1p/4p3/4P1PP/1NN1BP2/PPPQ3R/R3KB2 b Qkq - 2 12,I suspect that black wants to play d5 so I prepare to make it easy to double rooks on the d-file. So when it does open the d-file is mine
