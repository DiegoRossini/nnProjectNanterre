1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I liked this game because of the end game. I was down 2 pawns to 3 with a rook each, hoping against hope for a draw, and turned it around to a rook vs 3 pawns."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,You know the drill. :)
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"When I was younger I always played knight to c6, the most commonly made 2nd move, but after a while I got to thinking... When I play white I play the exact same opening, so why should I do what I would want me to do if I was playing me?
So I looked for something different about 8 months into my GK life, and I found this. Things begin to happen much faster with this opening, and some players even make an early blunder, thus allowing me an easy advantage."

5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"Not the most common white response, but I don't mind it at all. I like to escape the monotony of boring four knights openings. :)"
6,Nxe4,f6e4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/3Pn3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"This move was just trying something new. I saw it in the database and liked it, so I figured: why not? It looked fun. So I played it."

9,Bxe4,d3e4,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/3PB3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"Seems free, right?"
10,d5,d7d5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/3pp3/3PB3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"Well, okay, not FREE, per se. Bishop's only safe retreat gets the bishop and knight forked."
11,Nxe5,f3e5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/3pN3/3PB3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"A fine move, the pieces were going to be exchanged anyways, white just did it his way."
12,Nxe5,c6e5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3pn3/3PB3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"An inevitable loss... the castling king. I believe that this is why I ended up with a losing position coming into the end game. It's now going to take me 3 moves to castle, at the very minimum. White even has ways of stopping that castle from ever taking place."

16,Kxd8,e8d8,r1bk1b1r/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/4p3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 0 9,"All white wants to do right now is develop before black has a chance- white's advantage is that he can spend 2 extra moves developing while blacks trying to castle. I don't know if I agree with this move, however, as black then gets a bishop exchange AND moves his king to e7, leaving only 2 moves left in his castle, and now white no longer has moves to stop the castle. White has just effectively shortened his 2 move lead to a one move lead."

18,Be7,f8e7,r1bk3r/ppp1bppp/8/4P1B1/4p3/8/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R w KQ - 2 10,"I think I might have just pulled back to f4 as white, even after the wasted check. I don't understand why white wants to trade bishops, as if black ever gets the initiative back his white bishop can be a lot more powerful than white's knight."
19,Bxe7+,g5e7,r1bk3r/ppp1Bppp/8/4P3/4p3/8/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R b KQ - 0 10,"I think I might have just pulled back to f4 as white, even after the wasted check.

20,Kxe7,d8e7,r1b4r/ppp1kppp/8/4P3/4p3/8/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R w KQ - 0 11,"Re8 or Rd8 allow me to get my king into a castled position, as well as either attacking a pawn or taking a file."
21,Nc3,b1c3,r1b4r/ppp1kppp/8/4P3/4p3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQ - 1 11,"Again, white is developing. It's obvious he would like to queen side castle, immediately laying claim to the d file, but there is nothing black can do to stop that."
22,Bf5,c8f5,r6r/ppp1kppp/8/4Pb2/4p3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 2 12,"Bishop protects pawn, only logical move I found."
23,O-O-O,e1c1,r6r/ppp1kppp/8/4Pb2/4p3/2N5/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b - - 3 12,"White completes his queen side castle, still a move up on black."
24,Rhd8,h8d8,r2r4/ppp1kppp/8/4Pb2/4p3/2N5/PPP2PPP/2KR3R w - - 4 13,"At this point I'm willing to exchange for the open d file, because my e pawn and bishop may be able to team up with my rook to make a better attack than his knight can ever hope to achieve.
Better for black is Ke6, attacking the week pawn and leaving the king in the middle of the board- if the rooks get traded black is going to want to be in the center, not back on f8."
25,Nd5+,c3d5,r2r4/ppp1kppp/8/3NPb2/4p3/8/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b - - 5 13,"So white now gains a pawn. Kd7 doesn't work because of the double check from Nb6. All right, well this isn't a devastating set back, is it? We'll soon see for sure."
26,Kf8,e7f8,r2r1k2/ppp2ppp/8/3NPb2/4p3/8/PPP2PPP/2KR3R w - - 6 14,"Okay, the good news is that black has finally completed his castle. The bad news is that it is now much harder for black to get his king into the battle against the e5 pawn, which he should have done earlier."
27,Nxc7,d5c7,r2r1k2/ppN2ppp/8/4Pb2/4p3/8/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b - - 0 14,White has guaranteed a winning endgame position here.
28,Rxd1+,d8d1,r4k2/ppN2ppp/8/4Pb2/4p3/8/PPP2PPP/2Kr3R w - - 0 15,"It seems to me this was a stupid mistake on my part. I did not have to give up the open file, and I didn't have to trade rooks right now, as more trading will only bring the end game that much quicker, and I'm already down a pawn."
