1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game features another ...b5 pawn sacrifice from Suba, soon followed by a temporary piece sacrifice that keeps white on the defensive for the rest of the game.  White remains constantly tied down by Suba's threats, but Marin eventually manages to trade queens only to find himself in an endgame that's lost because of the weaknesses the middlegame attack created.  I recommend flipping the board.  Enjoy!"

White's king is still in the center, so if the center opens up white will have some problems.  Also, because white's bishop is not yet on g2, an opening up of the game will have black's bishop striking along the h1-a8 diagonal.  Finally, black has a good way to open up his rook with ...exd5 and he has a developmental advantage due to the moves white spent with his pawns."
