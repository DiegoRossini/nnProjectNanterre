1,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Another game form this project vs the tournament mastermind himself.  I feel that this game has a rather important theme to it, because not have I fallen for it but I believe that many of my fellow chess players have as well.  When attacking it is important to consider the safety of ones own king.  Don't rush forward at all cost.  Also, goes with the theme to play patiently even when far down in material."

I wanted to attempt to free up my dsb, but black ends up locking it in."

The best move in this case is O-O seems odd huh.  Freddy and I both agree on this now but I was too focused on how to go forward even-though I did consider castling.
