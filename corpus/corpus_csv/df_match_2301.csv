1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I always open e4 unless I'm in a game with pre-set moves.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"And Steve and I have had many battles with the Sicilian, one of which was my favorite game of all time: http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/nicolsos-isle-of-wight-open-2010?gm=37371"
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"He's made a habit of playing either the Dragon or the Najdorf against me. This variation -- the Paulsen -- is just as good, but has a different flavor."
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"He's made a habit of playing either the Dragon or the Najdorf against me. This variation -- the Paulsen -- is just as good, but has a different flavor."
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,The first surprise. I'd expected a knight to eventually go to f6; putting the queen there means a different setup is coming.
6,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,The first surprise. I'd expected a knight to eventually go to f6; putting the queen there means a different setup is coming.
7,Nxd4,f3d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,The first surprise. I'd expected a knight to eventually go to f6; putting the queen there means a different setup is coming.
8,a6,a7a6,rnbqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p3p3/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,The first surprise. I'd expected a knight to eventually go to f6; putting the queen there means a different setup is coming.
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p3p3/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,The first surprise. I'd expected a knight to eventually go to f6; putting the queen there means a different setup is coming.
10,Qf6,d8f6,rnb1kbnr/1p1p1ppp/p3pq2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,The first surprise. I'd expected a knight to eventually go to f6; putting the queen there means a different setup is coming.
11,Be3,c1e3,rnb1kbnr/1p1p1ppp/p3pq2/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 3 6,"Designed to make Bc5 less attractive, this is the best square for the dark-squared bishop."
12,Bb4,f8b4,rnb1k1nr/1p1p1ppp/p3pq2/8/1b1NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 4 7,"Pinning the knight, now that the bishop has chosen e3 instead of d2."
13,Qd2,d1d2,rnb1k1nr/1p1p1ppp/p3pq2/8/1b1NP3/2N1B3/PPPQ1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 5 7,"Bc4 was maybe a little more straightforward, making way for a kingside castle. This move makes way for O-O-O instead."
14,h6,h7h6,rnb1k1nr/1p1p1pp1/p3pq1p/8/1b1NP3/2N1B3/PPPQ1PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 8,"Keeping the bishop off of g5; I would've preferred developing a piece, but this is fine."
15,f3,f2f3,rnb1k1nr/1p1p1pp1/p3pq1p/8/1b1NP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 8,"In hindsight, this wasn't the strongest move either. There's no pressure on e4, so no need to protect it just now."
16,Ne7,g8e7,rnb1k2r/1p1pnpp1/p3pq1p/8/1b1NP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 1 9,"Consistent, and clears the way for a kingside castle. Playing the Sicilian and delaying queenside development pretty much commits black to castling kingside, though there are exceptions."
17,O-O-O,e1c1,rnb1k2r/1p1pnpp1/p3pq1p/8/1b1NP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR1B1R b kq - 2 9,"Castling on opposite sides of the board in an opening like this generally mean you're going to see a race to attack the kings: white will attack the kingside while black will counterattack on the queenside. This (overly?) aggressive move gets straight to the point, and helps justify the earlier f3."
18,O-O,e8g8,rnb2rk1/1p1pnpp1/p3pq1p/8/1b1NP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR1B1R w - - 3 10,"Castling on opposite sides of the board in an opening like this generally mean you're going to see a race to attack the kings: white will attack the kingside while black will counterattack on the queenside. This (overly?) aggressive move gets straight to the point, and helps justify the earlier f3."
19,g4,g2g4,rnb2rk1/1p1pnpp1/p3pq1p/8/1b1NP1P1/2N1BP2/PPPQ3P/2KR1B1R b - - 0 10,"Castling on opposite sides of the board in an opening like this generally mean you're going to see a race to attack the kings: white will attack the kingside while black will counterattack on the queenside.

20,Qe5,f6e5,rnb2rk1/1p1pnpp1/p3p2p/4q3/1b1NP1P1/2N1BP2/PPPQ3P/2KR1B1R w - - 1 11,"Greatly enhancing the queen's mobility, but beginning queenside development was maybe a superior strategy."
21,f4,f3f4,rnb2rk1/1p1pnpp1/p3p2p/4q3/1b1NPPP1/2N1B3/PPPQ3P/2KR1B1R b - - 0 11,"h4 was maybe stronger, but chasing the queen out of the center isn't all bad."
22,Qa5,e5a5,rnb2rk1/1p1pnpp1/p3p2p/q7/1b1NPPP1/2N1B3/PPPQ3P/2KR1B1R w - - 1 12,The pin on the Nc3 is now very strong.
23,Nb3,d4b3,rnb2rk1/1p1pnpp1/p3p2p/q7/1b2PPP1/1NN1B3/PPPQ3P/2KR1B1R b - - 2 12,"Again, chasing the queen. Black can respond Bxc3, but after 13. Nxa5 Bxd2+ 14. Rxd2, black is at a pretty severe positional disadvantage."
24,Qc7,a5c7,rnb2rk1/1pqpnpp1/p3p2p/8/1b2PPP1/1NN1B3/PPPQ3P/2KR1B1R w - - 3 13,"Best, as this keeps up the pressure on the still-pinned Nc3."
25,Be2,f1e2,rnb2rk1/1pqpnpp1/p3p2p/8/1b2PPP1/1NN1B3/PPPQB2P/2KR3R b - - 4 13,"It's small moves like this that get me into trouble. Yes, connecting the rooks is a smart move, yes, it keeps the g-file free for possible rook action, but what's black going to do with his light-squared bishop? Probably eventually eye the h1-a8 diagonal, and this just helps black out."
26,b5,b7b5,rnb2rk1/2qpnpp1/p3p2p/1p6/1b2PPP1/1NN1B3/PPPQB2P/2KR3R w - - 0 14,"Prepping for Bb7, attacking the e-pawn, which is unprotected thanks to the Bb4 pinning the knight."
27,h4,h2h4,rnb2rk1/2qpnpp1/p3p2p/1p6/1b2PPPP/1NN1B3/PPPQB3/2KR3R b - - 0 14,"Pushing for an attack without paying any mind to defense. Yes, it's easier to attack than find the correct defense, but black's position is not easy to break through."
28,Bb7,c8b7,rn3rk1/1bqpnpp1/p3p2p/1p6/1b2PPPP/1NN1B3/PPPQB3/2KR3R w - - 1 15,Obvious and good. White has to address the threat to e4 now.
