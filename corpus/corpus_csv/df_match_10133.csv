1,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"In this game Nate plays white and House plays black (age before cripple apparently). Nate opens with the bird opening which House notes is ""a passive approach, sign of a coward""."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"House replies with 1...c5 and Nate comments ""Sicilian Defence, sign of an idiot"". although technically speaking i'm not sure u would call this a sicilian. needless to say the verbal jousting between the two continues throughout the game."

5,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/5P2/4PN2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,As far as i can tell this a novelty and to be honest this move seems pretty dodgy to me the bishop is trapped in by blacks c5 pawn. Bb2 looks much better to me. Seems our child prodigy is feeling a little under the weather (which is to be expected since he's dying of liver failure).

15,Rb1,a1b1,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2nbpn2/1Bpp4/5P2/BPN1PN2/P1PP2PP/1R1QK2R b K - 7 8,Whoever composed this game stuck this move in to make the following combinations work out later on. as u'll see soon if this move wasnt played blacks attack wouldnt be possible (white would have too much extra tempo).
16,e5,e6e5,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2nb1n2/1Bppp3/5P2/BPN1PN2/P1PP2PP/1R1QK2R w K - 0 9,Too passive for my liking 10.Nxe5 was probably better.

21,Nxd5,c3d5,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/3b4/2pNn3/4n3/BP2PN2/P1PPB1PP/1R1QK2R b K - 0 11,Nate Grabs the pawn. I think u'll agree that the play so far has been mediocre at best - but dont forget they are playing under 5 minute time controls and Nate's skin has turned a horrible shade of yellow- but its now that the beautiful combinations kick in.
22,Nxf3+,e5f3,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/3b4/2pN4/4n3/BP2Pn2/P1PPB1PP/1R1QK2R w K - 0 12,"House Triumphantly announces check and informs Nate that there is ""a fine line between tortured genius and awkward kid who cant get girls. It's about now that the fireworks really begin."

31,Qf1,d1f1,r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/8/2pN2n1/8/BP2PBq1/P1PPK3/1R3Q1R b - - 3 16,"As House is about to make his move Nate informs him of his upcoming mating net and suddenly has a seizure   House is later seen making the moves on his board and eventually tipping his king, heres how the game would have continued."
32,Nxf3,g5f3,r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/8/2pN4/8/BP2Pnq1/P1PPK3/1R3Q1R w - - 0 17,? Critical mistake for black more prudent would have been 16...Bg4 or even retreating with 16....Qd6 (preventing Ne7 from being played which House comments on later in the episode
