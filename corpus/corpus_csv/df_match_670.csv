7,e3,e2e3,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,This is my usual reply.
8,c5,c7c5,rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/1bPP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,This is quite a reasonable move.
9,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/1bPP4/2NBP3/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 5,I continue with the plan.
10,d6,d7d6,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/3ppn2/2p5/1bPP4/2NBP3/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,He seems to have a plan of putting his pawns on black squares.
11,Nge2,g1e2,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/3ppn2/2p5/1bPP4/2NBP3/PP2NPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,And I have a plan to stop him doubling my c pawns.
12,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2nppn2/2p5/1bPP4/2NBP3/PP2NPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 7,He is preparing e7-e5.
13,Bd2,c1d2,r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2nppn2/2p5/1bPP4/2NBP3/PP1BNPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 3 7,"Now I am thinking that maybe if he takes on c3 I can take back with my bishop and have a nice diagonal for it, after I move my d pawn."
14,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2nppn2/2p5/1bPP4/2NBP3/PP1BNPPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 4 8,And he castles.
15,a3,a2a3,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2nppn2/2p5/1bPP4/P1NBP3/1P1BNPPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 8,"This seems to me to be a natural move, but on the opening databases I use I can only find 0-0 here."
16,Ba5,b4a5,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2nppn2/b1p5/2PP4/P1NBP3/1P1BNPPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 1 9,I was slightly surprised he didn't take - there would have been some logic in taking and then putting more pawns on black squares.
17,O-O,e1g1,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2nppn2/b1p5/2PP4/P1NBP3/1P1BNPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 2 9,And finally I castle.
18,e5,e6e5,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2np1n2/b1p1p3/2PP4/P1NBP3/1P1BNPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 10,He continues with his plan
19,d5,d4d5,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2np1n2/b1pPp3/2P5/P1NBP3/1P1BNPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 10,"And notice how now we have a similar pawn formation to the Czech Benoni, just like the previous game."
20,Ne7,c6e7,r1bq1rk1/pp2nppp/3p1n2/b1pPp3/2P5/P1NBP3/1P1BNPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 1 11,"The knight drops back. This position was seen in Jeremic, Veljko (2334) vs. Prelevic, Dusko (2385)		2001.03.13 when white continued with Rb1. That plan did cross my mind, but I chose something else - based on preventing his Bc8 finding any decent squares."
21,Ng3,e2g3,r1bq1rk1/pp2nppp/3p1n2/b1pPp3/2P5/P1NBP1N1/1P1B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 2 11,This is to stop his bishop - or his knight for that matter - coming to f5.
22,Bg4,c8g4,r2q1rk1/pp2nppp/3p1n2/b1pPp3/2P3b1/P1NBP1N1/1P1B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 3 12,And the same move played in the previous game.
23,f3,f2f3,r2q1rk1/pp2nppp/3p1n2/b1pPp3/2P3b1/P1NBPPN1/1P1B2PP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 12,The same reply.
24,Bd7,g4d7,r2q1rk1/pp1bnppp/3p1n2/b1pPp3/2P5/P1NBPPN1/1P1B2PP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 1 13,"And the same retreat. Again, I think that black has just lost time. f2-f3 is a move I would quite like to make anyway."
25,h3,h2h3,r2q1rk1/pp1bnppp/3p1n2/b1pPp3/2P5/P1NBPPNP/1P1B2P1/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 13,I am planning f3-f4 but I didn't want a black piece returning to g4.
