1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,e4 is my favorite Opening Move.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Petrov's Defence. It offers attacking opportunities for both sides, and a few lines are quite sharp."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Petrov's Defence. It offers attacking opportunities for both sides, and a few lines are quite sharp."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"Petrov's Defence. It offers attacking opportunities for both sides, and a few lines are quite sharp."
5,Nxe5,f3e5,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"Classical Variation. Other Possible Moves are 3.Nc3 , 3.Bc4 , 3.d4 (Steinitz Variation)"
6,Qe7,d8e7,rnb1kb1r/ppppqppp/5n2/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,"Black should not continue to copy White's moves and try to restore the material balance immediately with 3...Nxe4? because after 4.Qe2 White will either win material (4...Nf6?? 5.Nc6+ wins Black's queen, and after 4...d5 5.d3 Qe7 6.dxe4 Qxe5 7.exd5 Black loses a pawn), or obtain a superior position (4...Qe7 5.Qxe4 d6 6.d4 f6 7.Nc3 dxe5 8.Nd5 Qd6 9.Bf4 Nd7 10.0-0-0 and White has a big advantage). 
3... d6 is a better move."
7,Nf3,e5f3,rnb1kb1r/ppppqppp/5n2/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,"This is the main Line. other Lines are: 4.Nc4 , 4.Nd3 and 4.Nxf7 (Cochrane Gambit) 
4...Kxf7 5.Nc3 c5!? 6.Bc4+ Be6 7.Bxe6+ Kxe6 8.d4 Kf7 9.dxc5 Nc6."

10,g6,g7g6,rnb1kb1r/ppppqp1p/6p1/8/4n3/5N2/PPPPBPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,5...d5 or 5...Nf6 are  better moves here. the knight at e4 is vulnerable.
11,O-O,e1g1,rnb1kb1r/ppppqp1p/6p1/8/4n3/5N2/PPPPBPPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 6,I place my rook in front of black's queen.
