This is bad due to several reasons: first, generally moving a piece twice in the opening loses time and is considered to be bad (though there are  exceptions, like in the Alekhine opening 1. e4 Nf6, to name the probably most popular counterexample to this rule). Second, it blocks the square which would fit perfect for the knight, which is still sleeping on g8. Third, and in this concrete case probably most critical, it enables the simple pawn-winning tactics again by enabling the pin on e6!"

I classify this move definitely as a mistake (though the advantage is still on White's side), since the material-winning 12. Rxd7! would really not have been too hard to see at that point. Black can't take back or his queen is history (12... Qxd7? 13. Bxe6+). Anyway, ignoring that this was possible, the rook of course belongs to this file and the e6 pawn is threatened. This piece setup of White, arising from the Reti gambit is beautiful isn't it? With the light-squared bishop on c4 instead of g4, it would look perfect, in my opinion."
