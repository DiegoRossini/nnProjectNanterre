4,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"So into the Benoni-Benko systems. White has a slight space advantage. But will play his Bf8 to g7 and try to build up pressure along the long black diagonal, combined with play on the Queen's side. White may try for a large break through in the centre and/or a king side attack. It is quite unbalanced, which is why it is popular. According to the stats, 2.....c5 leads to less draws and more wins for both White and Black."

6,b5,b7b5,rnbqkb1r/p2ppppp/5n2/1ppP4/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"So Dave goes for what the English-speaking world call the Benko Gambit, after Pal Benko, a Hungarian-American Grandmaster who provided many of the ideas. In other countries it is known as the Volga Gambit. Black gives up a pawn on the Queen side. The idea is to get open a and b files, which combined with the Bg7 can give overwhelming pressure on the Queen side. The advanatages of this system is that Black's initiative and pressure can last well into the endgames and can continue even if a number of pieces have been exchanged. It is also a relatively easy system to play for Black."
