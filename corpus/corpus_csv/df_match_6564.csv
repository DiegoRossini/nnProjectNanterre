Black rarely can attack without consideration of material and position unless white commits some misstep, but he continues to press, prod, and poke sniffing at white's defenses."

The only problem is white has considerable freedom on when and if to capture the c6 pawn.  Additionally should black survive to material equality, he will have fewer strong attacking pieces.  Black must survive and prove his equality in the endgame.  White also eyes the d6 square and would love the f8 bishop to simply vanish."
