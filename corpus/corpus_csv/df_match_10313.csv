1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,The beginnings of Reti.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,"I gave him an easy pawn.  A truly dumb mistake on my part.  While it opens up the board, it's not what I wanted to do."
3,Nxe5,f3e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4N3/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,"At this point, Dad said, ""Thanks!"""
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4N3/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"Down a pawn, my tack is going to be conservative.  Might as well pressure his knight and open up the board.  I could have pressured with the queen, but didn't want to block up the avenues for developing other pieces.  I certainly didn't want to offer a trade by moving Nc6."
5,Nf3,e5f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"According to the book ...
1. Nf3 e5 2. Nxe5 d6 3. Nf3
A04: Reti opening"
6,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/6b1/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,"A bit aggressive all things considered, but it does present some options down the road."
7,c4,c2c4,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/2P3b1/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"Dad's been playing the c-pawn early a lot lately.  I seem to see this a lot lately, and I've started doing so myself as white."
8,Nd7,b8d7,r2qkbnr/pppn1ppp/3p4/8/2P3b1/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,I'm not sure why I'm not developing my king side at this point.  I suppose I'm trying to build support for an eventual pawn move to c5.
9,d4,d2d4,r2qkbnr/pppn1ppp/3p4/8/2PP2b1/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,Dad has a strong center pawn structure now.
10,Qf6,d8f6,r3kbnr/pppn1ppp/3p1q2/8/2PP2b1/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,This seems like a mistake as it blocks the kingside development even further.
11,Nc3,b1c3,r3kbnr/pppn1ppp/3p1q2/8/2PP2b1/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 6,Dad strengthens the middle more.
12,Bxf3,g4f3,r3kbnr/pppn1ppp/3p1q2/8/2PP4/2N2b2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"This move was not necessary.  It only speeds up the game.  With a pawn down, this probably wasn't wise.  The only advantage it confers is a stacked pawn structure."
13,exf3,e2f3,r3kbnr/pppn1ppp/3p1q2/8/2PP4/2N2P2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"I'm not sure I would have exposed the King here, but he did."
14,Qe6+,f6e6,r3kbnr/pppn1ppp/3pq3/8/2PP4/2N2P2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,Simple harassment without meaningful development.
15,Be3,c1e3,r3kbnr/pppn1ppp/3pq3/8/2PP4/2N1BP2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 2 8,A simple block that also develops the queenside.
16,Ne7,g8e7,r3kb1r/pppnnppp/3pq3/8/2PP4/2N1BP2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 3 9,I'm looking ahead to the possibility of Nf5 thus pressuring the bishop blocking the queen check.
17,Nb5,c3b5,r3kb1r/pppnnppp/3pq3/1N6/2PP4/4BP2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 4 9,Massive knight fork possibility at Nxc7 .
18,Kd8,e8d8,r2k1b1r/pppnnppp/3pq3/1N6/2PP4/4BP2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 5 10,"Argh, pesky knights.  Obviously, a6 leads to a fork.  O-O-O loses a pawn.  Rc8 loses a pawn.  I think Kd8 is the only move that I have here. Thoughts?  By moving the king, I've given up the ability to castle either way."
19,Qb3,d1b3,r2k1b1r/pppnnppp/3pq3/1N6/2PP4/1Q2BP2/PP3PPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 6 10,"With the king out of position, it makes sense to pressure that side of the board."
20,c6,c7c6,r2k1b1r/pp1nnppp/2ppq3/1N6/2PP4/1Q2BP2/PP3PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 0 11,A simple defensive move.
