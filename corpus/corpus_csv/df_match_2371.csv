1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was played at a time control of 5 minutes and a 10 second increment. I thought this was a good example of a superior minor piece, particularly in the end."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Counterattacking in the center. Because of this move 2. Nc3 is more common.

5,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2ppP3/5P2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,Gaining space.
6,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2ppPb2/5P2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,Moving the bishop outside the pawn chain before playing e6.
7,d3,d2d3,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2ppPb2/5P2/3P4/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,Trying to blunt the bishop's diagonal. I think d4 is better because only one of white's bishops is bad while now both bishop's diagonals are blocked.
8,e6,e7e6,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppPb2/5P2/3P4/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,Preparing to develop the queen bishop.

14,Be7,f8e7,r3k1nr/pp2bppp/1qn1p3/2ppPb2/5P2/2PP1N2/PP2B1PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 3 8,Maybe 0-0 later would have been safer but white can't really get anything going on the queenside.
