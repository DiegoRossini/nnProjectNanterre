1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Welcome to the first in what I hope will be a long line of annotated games from me. I'm just learning how to play chess, having seen a few games played and having been decimated by a friend every week when we meet for coffee I decided it was time to learn to play. My friend advised me to sign up here and annotate every game, win lose or draw. None of my annotations are likely to be good, however if anyone spots something I didn't or has a better explanation for a move made then please chime in!"
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"My opponent began with a Queen's pawn opening, so I responded with my favourite attempting for an Indian Defence.  I'm told that Queen's pawn is slower than King's pawn for castling, however provides for more tactical play."
3,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/6B1/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 2 2,"Internet's tell me this is the ""Trompowsky Attack"".  I think it looks pretty weak if I'm honest, however I think my response was probably not a good plan in hindsight.  My response is pretty instinctual, I decided to threaten the Bishop immediately with Ne4."

9,Qd2,d1d2,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3p2N1/3P4/8/PPPQPPPP/RN2KB1R b KQkq - 1 5,Lucky for me White decided to play Qd2 I guess! Allows me to protect my d5 pawn with e6.

I play Nc6 with the intention of threatening White's Queen through Bb4.  I think a better move for me would've been 6...Qxg5, allowing me to capitalise on White's error."

I think a better move would've been Nf3 which after 7...a6 8.Be2 Bd6 9.O-O O-O would've kept things even.  However, not to spoil our errors catalogue, I continued by moving Bb4! The idea was to threaten White's Queen, as stated in the previous move.  I had got so caught up in my 'strategy' I didn't spot the hanging Knight until after I submitted the move.  Once more, I think the best move was Qxg5."
14,Bb4,f8b4,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/1B1p2N1/1b1P4/4P3/PPPQ1PPP/RN2K2R w KQkq - 3 8,"Luckily for me, White makes another error with 7. Bb5.

I think Qxb4 was probably the better move.  However, I've finally noticed the open and undefended Knight on g5 so decide to exchange by taking with my Queen.  This allows me to threaten White's weakened g2 pawn."
