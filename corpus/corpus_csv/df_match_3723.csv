Moving back to either c1 or d1 would've been better. Being ahead in material would be nice, but a bigger prize is in sight."
16,Nd4+,c6d4,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p1B1/2Pn2n1/2NP1KP1/PP2P1BP/R2Q2NR w kq - 3 9,"The first move in a mate in 3. White resigned here. Here are the possible continuations:

9. Ke5 f5+ 10. Kd5 c6++ (my conditional moves were set for this continuation)
9. Ke5 f5+ 10. Kd5 Be6++
9. Ke5 Bf5+ 10. Kd5 c6++

I was very fortunate to get a golden opportunity this early in the game. The main lesson that I got out of this game is that it's almost never a good idea to bring your king out to the center of the board this early in the game. It's far too risky with this many pieces on the board."
