I won the game, but I could have won it with a beautiful forced mate if I had stopped to look at the position instead of blindly following my plan."

11,Qd5,d1d5,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n5/2bQP3/2B1n3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 2 6,This threatens both the Knight on e4 and mate on f7.
12,Bxf2+,c5f2,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n5/3QP3/2B1n3/5N2/PPP2bPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 7,"Black is going to lose one of his minor pieces, regardless of what he does. Taking one of my pawns and forcing my King on an awkward square is probably the best tradeoff."
13,Ke2,e1e2,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n5/3QP3/2B1n3/5N2/PPP1KbPP/RNB4R b kq - 1 7,"Black's bishop is now on a strong diagonal. With the f2 pawn gone, my King cannot move to g1."

17,Rd1,h1d1,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/1bn5/4P3/2B1Q3/5N2/PPP1K1PP/RNBR4 b - - 2 9,Activating the rook before the King moves back to the first rank. My rook is now lined up with Black's queen which might come in handy.
18,d6,d7d6,r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/1bnp4/4P3/2B1Q3/5N2/PPP1K1PP/RNBR4 w - - 0 10,This opens the diagonal for the White bishop. dxe5 is out of the question because the pawn on d6 is pinned.
19,Kf1,e2f1,r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/1bnp4/4P3/2B1Q3/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBR1K2 b - - 1 10,"Black offers a trade of bishops.
If 11. Bxe6 fxe6 and Black's rook is free, lined up with my king and pinning my knight."

11. Bd3 temporarily removes the pin on Black's d6 pawn but threatens mate on h7."
22,g6,g7g6,r2q1rk1/ppp2p1p/1bnpb1p1/4P3/4Q3/3B1N2/PPP3PP/RNBR1K2 w - - 0 12,My idea is to activate a piece with tempo. I may end up putting the bishop on f6 and maneuver my queen to h6. These are some strong threats that Black needs to watch out for.

14...Qxc6? is insufficient because of 15. Qxg4 Qxc2 16. Rd2 and Black lost another piece for a single pawn."

33,Bf6,g5f6,r4rk1/p1pq1p1p/1bp2Bp1/3pPb2/8/2N2N2/PPP1Q1PP/R2R1K2 b - - 1 17,"With the Black pawn no longer attacking e5, putting the Bishop on f6 makes for a strong combo that can't be attacked by any pawns."

18...Rab8 would be stronger in my opinion."

19. c4 is a move I didn't even consider in the game, mainly because I had already decided to remove the bishop with my knight. While this unwillingness to evaluate the position wasn't a big deal at that point, a much more weighty situation is about to come up."
