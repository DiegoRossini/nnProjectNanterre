1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,His opening move came as no surprise
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,And my reply can't have been either.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,He varies from the d4 he played in the previous game.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,So one knight move deserves another
5,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,All main line so far
6,cxd4,c5d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,I take
7,c3,c2c3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3pP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"This was hardly a surprise either, he played the Smith-Morra gambit last time."
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/3pP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"So I did my usual reply. Black can accept the pawn, but this is good as well, a suggestion of Leonard Barden."
9,e5,e4e5,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/4P3/3p4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,This is the most commonly played move in the position.
10,Nd5,f6d5,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n5/3nP3/3p4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,And this is the only decent move for black.
11,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n5/3nP3/2Bp4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 6,"He played this move last time, in a slightly different position."
12,Nb6,d5b6,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/1nn5/4P3/2Bp4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 3 7,"And I hit the bishop again. In the previous game, he now played Bxf7ch, but later found that he didn't have enough for the bishop, and he lost relatively quickly."
13,Bb3,c4b3,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/1nn5/4P3/3p4/1BP2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 4 7,But this time he played a sensible move.
14,dxc3,d4c3,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/1nn5/4P3/8/1Bp2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"This move is inconsistent, and I later found out that it scores badly on the opening databases."
15,Nxc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/1nn5/4P3/8/1BN2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,"And this is about the only decent move for white. I thought here - well I am a pawn up, let's go for exchanges."
16,d6,d7d6,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/1nnp4/4P3/8/1BN2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,Looking for exchanges on e5 if he doesn't take.
17,exd6,e5d6,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/1nnP4/8/8/1BN2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 9,But he takes first.
18,Qxd6,d8d6,r1b1kb1r/pp2pppp/1nnq4/8/8/1BN2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 10,"Afterwards I found that exd6 is more commonly played, but I hoped this would lead to an exchange of queens and the chance to nurse my extra pawn to victory."
19,Qxd6,d1d6,r1b1kb1r/pp2pppp/1nnQ4/8/8/1BN2N2/PP3PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 0 10,"And he did take, after a long think"
20,exd6,e7d6,r1b1kb1r/pp3ppp/1nnp4/8/8/1BN2N2/PP3PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 0 11,So I took back.
