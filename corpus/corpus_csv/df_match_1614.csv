1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game is an example where ""under-promoting"" a pawn (the act of traversing the board with one's pawn and having it promoted to any piece other than the Queen) can lead to a tactical advantage.   In this case, I chose to promote my pawn to a Knight, which as it turns out gave me a significant advantage at the time, and gave quite a twist to the end of this game.  

I would also like to say that by publishing this annotated game, I am in no way trying to indicate that I am better than any other player and I do not intend to belittle or humiliate any other player, most of all my opponent in this game.  In fact white is quite a rival, fun to play against and a gentleman."

However, the score has, in general, been slightly in favor of white, with brief moments of slight advantage to black and brief moments of slightly greater advantage to white. But this game is very interesting from perspective of how important it is to stay focused and to always consider the strength of your pieces when they are strategically aligned and taking advantage of their increased defensive capabilities when kept close to the side of one's king or a pawn.  This game also demonstrates that small moves are sometimes the only move available and when coupled with a small move in another piece can result in a more drastic change of circumstances.  At the time I decided to make this game annotated (following the white Queen's capture of Black rook on move 48) I had just for the first time since move 12 evened the score at -0- again. And both players had exactly the same pieces on the board.  There had been 10 moves to check the king, the first three came from white and the last 7 came from black.  From move"

Any other move, or even the choice of queen for promotion, would have led to my defeat.  Given the position of white's queen, I initially considered moving my queen to c2, which would have protected my pawn while still allowing room to guard my king if white chose to put me in check by moving his queen to f6. But had I done this, white would most likely have gone for the ensuing queen trade, since this would have left him with a considerable advantage: I would have no way of protecting my pawn at e2 from capture by white's king, and I would not be able to prevent white's pawn at b5 from promoting.  Other than the aforementioned moves, I also considered one other way to prevent white from checkmating and that was to move my king to g6. This would prevent the next move checkmate, but it would leave my pawn at e2 unprotected, and it was my only hope of winning, and that little pawn almost won the game for me single-handedly.   If anyone else could envision another possible way for black to achieve victory following white's move at 51, I would like to know.  By the way this game followed the first game between white and drmra4 in which white won, and his win was more decisive than mine.  I'm looking forward to our next match-up!

white: Great choice, Good job..... That's why i hate horses
drmra4: It did not occur to me that I should go for the knight promotion until after I had gone through almost every other possible scenario twice or even three times and saw that you would have prevailed. And thinking I am going to check one more time and see if there was something I had missed...and there it was...the perfect solution! I was really very fortunate that the pieces were exactly where they were, otherwise you most certainly would have won. I am not saying you haven't won yet, just saying you would have definitely won if it weren't for the ability to choose any piece for promotion."
