1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The idea behind the Pirc and/or Modern defense is to allow white to establish a pawn center, and then try to undermine it."
2,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The idea behind the Pirc and/or Modern defense is to allow white to establish a pawn center, and then try to undermine it."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,We are already out of mainstream theory.  Black has already conceeded too much space to white.  Notice that the pawns on e6 and d6 interfere with the development of both bishops.
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3pp3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,We are already out of mainstream theory.  Black has already conceeded too much space to white.  Notice that the pawns on e6 and d6 interfere with the development of both bishops.
5,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3pp3/8/3PPP2/8/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,It is useful to advance the f-pawn prior to developing the knight to f3.  The f-pawn will support further spatial conquest.
6,f6,f7f6,rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/3ppp2/8/3PPP2/8/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"This weakens the h5-e8 diagonal, and robs the g-knight of the f6 square,  which is its most natural post."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/3ppp2/8/3PPP2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,White wishes to complete at least his kingside development before undertaking any further advance into enemy territory.
8,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp4pp/2pppp2/8/3PPP2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"This deprives the b-knight the c6 square, which is its most natural post.  The move does have the virtue of opening the a5-d8 diagonal for the queen."
9,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqkbnr/pp4pp/2pppp2/8/3PPP2/3B1N2/PPP3PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,"On c4 the bishop would run into d6-d5 and have to move again.  On d3, it is poised to attack the weakened light squares in black's kingside.  A move such as f7-f6, is a serious weakening."
10,b6,b7b6,rnbqkbnr/p5pp/1ppppp2/8/3PPP2/3B1N2/PPP3PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"Now, it is almost comical.  The move allows the bishop to be developed, but it bottles up the queen again.  Is black hoping to get all of his pawns on the 6th?  I've seen this curious play before, where players forget about their pieces and move only pawns.  It isn't to be recommended."
11,O-O,e1g1,rnbqkbnr/p5pp/1ppppp2/8/3PPP2/3B1N2/PPP3PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 6,"Now, white has safely removed the king from the center and will try to open lines of attack and penetrate black's position."
12,a5,a7a5,rnbqkbnr/6pp/1ppppp2/p7/3PPP2/3B1N2/PPP3PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,"A break from convention!  The pawn advances two squares.  If the idea is to eliminate the d3 bishop, then the immediate 6. ...Ba6 would suffice."
13,Nh4,f3h4,rnbqkbnr/6pp/1ppppp2/p7/3PPP1N/3B4/PPP3PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 7,With the threat of 8. Qh4
14,Nh6,g8h6,rnbqkb1r/6pp/1ppppp1n/p7/3PPP1N/3B4/PPP3PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 8,Perhaps a move such as 7. ...Qc7 in order to be able to answer 8. Qh4  with 8. ...Qf7.
15,f5,f4f5,rnbqkb1r/6pp/1ppppp1n/p4P2/3PP2N/3B4/PPP3PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,With the threat of 9. Bxh6 ruining black's pawn structure.
16,g5,g7g5,rnbqkb1r/7p/1ppppp1n/p4Pp1/3PP2N/3B4/PPP3PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq g6 0 9,"An interesting moment.  9. fxg6 e.p. wins material, but I wanted more."
17,fxe6,f5e6,rnbqkb1r/7p/1pppPp1n/p5p1/3PP2N/3B4/PPP3PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 9,Hoping for 9. ...gxh4 10. Qh4  Ke7 (forced) 11. Bxh6.
18,Bxe6,c8e6,rn1qkb1r/7p/1pppbp1n/p5p1/3PP2N/3B4/PPP3PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 10,The right move.
19,Nf5,h4f5,rn1qkb1r/7p/1pppbp1n/p4Np1/3PP3/3B4/PPP3PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 10,White is trying to open lines against the black king.
20,Nf7,h6f7,rn1qkb1r/5n1p/1pppbp2/p4Np1/3PP3/3B4/PPP3PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 11,Black goes into a defensive shell.  The problem is that black lacks space.  This means that white will be able to make threats that black will eventually be unable to respond to.  The important thing is to trust in the space advantage and not do anything rash.  You don't have to hurry in positions like this.
21,c4,c2c4,rn1qkb1r/5n1p/1pppbp2/p4Np1/2PPP3/3B4/PP4PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 11,Seizing more space.
22,Nd7,b8d7,r2qkb1r/3n1n1p/1pppbp2/p4Np1/2PPP3/3B4/PP4PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 12,Again with the idea of grabbing space.
23,d5,d4d5,r2qkb1r/3n1n1p/1pppbp2/p2P1Np1/2P1P3/3B4/PP4PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 12,Again with the idea of grabbing space.
