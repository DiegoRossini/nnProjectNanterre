1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Hello everyone! Just here looking for some friendly advice from the experts and a chance to show off my win. Just by reading some of the comments on this annotations have really boosted my chess knowledge. I'm white by the way.
2,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"He wants to put his bishop in what I call ""shotgun"" (This is not the official term mind you!). That rook looks exactly like a shotgun about to go off. He moves his bishop diagnal to the rook and he automaticly controls the middle."
3,d3,d2d3,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Simple development.
4,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/8/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"""shotgun"" going as planned."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/8/4P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 3,"This not only develops a piece, but guards my rook from future attack."
6,c6,c7c6,rnbqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2p3p1/8/4P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Development. A route for his queen maybe?
7,Qf3,d1f3,rnbqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2p3p1/8/4P3/2NP1Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 1 4,"I'm simply looking to castle. Is it better to castle on the right or left side? Just wondering? Anyway, since my knight is already in the action, I believe the left side will be quicker."
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqk2r/pp1pppbp/2p2np1/8/4P3/2NP1Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 2 5,"He wants to castle too I suppose. Also another positive of ""shotgun""."
9,Bf4,c1f4,rnbqk2r/pp1pppbp/2p2np1/8/4PB2/2NP1Q2/PPP2PPP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 3 5,Castle development.
10,d6,d7d6,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/2pp1np1/8/4PB2/2NP1Q2/PPP2PPP/R3KBNR w KQkq - 0 6,I assume he wants to confront my queen?
11,O-O-O,e1c1,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/2pp1np1/8/4PB2/2NP1Q2/PPP2PPP/2KR1BNR b kq - 1 6,"Castle time, at last."
12,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2pp1np1/8/4PB2/2NP1Q2/PPP2PPP/2KR1BNR w - - 2 7,I'm not the only one throwing a party in the castle.....
13,e5,e4e5,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2pp1np1/4P3/5B2/2NP1Q2/PPP2PPP/2KR1BNR b - - 0 7,I don't like the pathways to his king clogged up like that. I need some space to work.
14,Bg4,c8g4,rn1q1rk1/pp2ppbp/2pp1np1/4P3/5Bb1/2NP1Q2/PPP2PPP/2KR1BNR w - - 1 8,"I knew this was coming. Bad timing...for me that is. I forgot I had that rook down there at the time, so this hurt."
15,Qg3,f3g3,rn1q1rk1/pp2ppbp/2pp1np1/4P3/5Bb1/2NP2Q1/PPP2PPP/2KR1BNR b - - 2 8,Just a safe move to keep me in the general area of the action.
16,Bxd1,g4d1,rn1q1rk1/pp2ppbp/2pp1np1/4P3/5B2/2NP2Q1/PPP2PPP/2Kb1BNR w - - 0 9,"Now I've got a decision to make. I'm in a great position to come back. By delaying his attack on my queen/rook, I've got a knight I can take down, and then I've still got another bishop to bring down as well."
17,exf6,e5f6,rn1q1rk1/pp2ppbp/2pp1Pp1/8/5B2/2NP2Q1/PPP2PPP/2Kb1BNR b - - 0 9,"As I said on the previous slide, he shouldn't have waited for his attack."
18,Bxf6,g7f6,rn1q1rk1/pp2pp1p/2pp1bp1/8/5B2/2NP2Q1/PPP2PPP/2Kb1BNR w - - 0 10,"The smart thing to do in this postion. Get what you can, pawns included."
19,Kxd1,c1d1,rn1q1rk1/pp2pp1p/2pp1bp1/8/5B2/2NP2Q1/PPP2PPP/3K1BNR b - - 0 10,Comeback complete.
20,Qb6,d8b6,rn3rk1/pp2pp1p/1qpp1bp1/8/5B2/2NP2Q1/PPP2PPP/3K1BNR w - - 1 11,His attack on my pawn is too obvious. (Almost as ovious as the queen/rook attack I missed).
