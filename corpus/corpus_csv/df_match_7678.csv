1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The most common starting move, but when a game starts this way, one expects it to get interesting quickly.  This game does not disappoint."
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"""The Caro-Kann Defense may be compared to the Slav Defense against the Queen's Pawn:  It strives for defense of the strong-point at d5 and development of the Queen's Bishop"" (Chessmaster).  In the many games I have played against him, I do not play this move often.  I wanted to see what his reaction would be, though I had an idea that he'd play Bc4."

An awful second move by White which will cause White to lose time when Black attacks the Bishop with gain of space by 2...d5 3.exd5 cxd5. There are a few games using this line where Black failed to win, but through no fault of White's"" (Chessmaster).  Yes, you read right, the program called my brother a hillbilly.  I saw this move a mile away and was ready with 2...d5.  99.9 percent of the time, he starts with 1. e4 followed by 2. Bc4."
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 3,Gotta love a pawn fork on the second move.
5,Bb3,c4b3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4P3/1B6/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 3,"He is wasting time protecting his bishop, as stated in the annotation of move 2."

10,Bc5,b4c5,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/2bpP3/8/1BP5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 6,"Moving it to a5 would have resulted in the loss of one less tempo than this, but it would have put the bishop into a corner.  However, after 6. d4, it gets cornered anyway or moved back to e7.  Either way, white gains some time."
11,d4,d2d4,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/2bpP3/3P4/1BP5/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 6,"Threatening my queen, but I see that this attack has no support, and the bishop is hanging.  A better way of attacking the queen would be to play 7.Nf3 and follow that with 8.Bg5 so that the bishop has some support.  In addition, Nf3 develops a piece and opens up castling lines."

His rook is aiming at the weak g7 pawn and his knights are controlling central squares, while the only black piece that is active is the queen.  The pawn structure is severely hindering black's development."

I think that Ng6 was better because it takes advantage of the weakness on g6 to fork the queen and rook, leading to fxg6 Rxg6, and though white loses a knight for two pawns, damages black's pawn structure and makes it very difficult for him to develop."
