12,Ke7,e8e7,r1bq1bnr/pppnkBp1/7p/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 1 7,"Black leaves the bishop alone, but now has dropped a pawn and lost the ability to castle."
13,Bg6,f7g6,r1bq1bnr/pppnk1p1/6Bp/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQ - 2 7,"Defends the e4 pawn and keeps the mobility of the king down. If 7... Kf6 8. Bf5 is planned, but perhaps after 8... g6 black can start to mobilise pieces."
14,Ngf6,g8f6,r1bq1b1r/pppnk1p1/5nBp/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 3 8,"Threatens a future Nd5  check, and just generally helps development"

Qxd5 is favourable for white -- the rook at a8 is hanging and the Queen can join with the bishop to attack black's king"

Nxf6  is very painful, as it drops material for nothing and allows white to swap off the other knight, the c8 bishop and the queen on the d7 square, whilst leaving white the next move to castle kingside.

if 10... Kf7 then I plan on 11. b3 to fianchetto the c1 bishop and attack the lone e5 pawn. If 11... Bb7 then 12. Nxf6 is possible, but my e4 pawn is in danger, so perhaps another strategy will be required. Nc3 seems passive but perhaps Nxe5  is strong instead..."
20,Kf7,e6f7,r1bq1b1r/p1pn1kp1/1p3n1p/3NpB2/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 4 11,The only safe option.

12. Nxf6 only allows a King capture (before g6 the pawn was possible) now, as 12... Nxf6 13. Qxd8 seems losing.

12... Kxf6 13. Qd5 leaves some interesting threats. The rook is hanging but if 13... Rb8 14. Qe6  Kg7 15. Qxg6# is a straight win. interestingly, 13... gxf5 14. exf5 is also good as the pawn can replace the bishop in the mating attack if 14... Rb8

Alternatively, 13. Ne5  is also strong, with 13... Kxe5 14. Qd5  winning material for white.

12. Nxf6 seems therefore to give white a potentially winning advantage, unless there is some trickery I have missed!"

I need to make sure the exposed nature of my king does not allow tactical combinations involving the queen and bishops.
