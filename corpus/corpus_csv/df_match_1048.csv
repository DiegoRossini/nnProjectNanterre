1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Hello those who like to follow annotated games I'm hoping to get good comments on this one.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"in my passed annotations i started at 1350 elo and ive been steadily climbing with some bumps here and there, and as i climb i always like facing tougher opponents.  this is my third opponent in the 1700 range since my return and this also happens to be a revenge match in a tourny we are playing together,"
3,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,"my classic LSB exit,  This was our 2nd game where i lost the first after playing 43 moves even and then just straight out blundering to lose,"
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 3,the nf6 i face most often
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 3 3,"previously i went d3 here but i had annotated i prefer to go nc3 when the opponent goes nc6 and we will get to see why, i told myself im coming out hard vs this guy and making it a pawn war and i will not be looking for a checkmate early unless some blunderous option appears."
6,Bc5,f8c5,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 4 4,"and like i previously noted ive learnt the blacks like to park their DSB on c5 so i dont need to do a2 that i love to do lol,"
7,Nge2,g1e2,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPPNPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 5 4,and my response to this is ne2 with a quick d4 depending on what my opponent plays next

15,e5,e4e5,rn1qk2r/pbpp1ppp/1p3n2/4P3/2BQ4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 0 8,if he retreats back to the backline he delays his castling  and its what i sometimes expect. when they go to h5 is when i love it
16,Nh5,f6h5,rn1qk2r/pbpp1ppp/1p6/4P2n/2BQ4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 1 9,he went to h5 perfect!

21,Bh6,g5h6,rnq1k2r/pbpp1p1p/1p4pB/4P2n/2B3Q1/2N5/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 3 11,"and i prevent his castling getting ready to castle myself i was maybe looking to queen side castle,  i like the set up i have at the moment and hence why i like to play d4 if allowed over d3 early on, it can offer many antics and a fun game, but this is far from over my opponent will not lie down and just surrender politely"
