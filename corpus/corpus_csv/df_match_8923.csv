2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"I play Alekhine's Defence, a daring choice for me as I gave it up some months ago. Black attempts to entice White's pawns forward and weaken them while doing so. I chose the French Defence in Round 2, and I wanted a change, so I went for this defence."
3,e5,e4e5,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/4P3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,The only feasible square for the knight. After 2...Ne4? it is being kicked around the board.
4,Nd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/3nP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,The only feasible square for the knight. After 2...Ne4? it is being kicked around the board.
5,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/3nP3/2P5/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"This is generally considered inferior to 3.d4, as consolidating White's pawn formation is preferred to attacking Black's knight once again. Often 3.d4 d6 and THEN 4.c4 as White's central pawn formation has been strengthened."
6,Nb6,d5b6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/1n6/4P3/2P5/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"A common move in Alekhine's Defence, challenging White's advanced e-pawn."

9,f4,f2f4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/1n1p4/4P3/2PP1P2/8/PP4PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"This position has more or less transposed into the Four Pawns Attack of Alekhine's Defence, after 3.d4 d6 4.c4 Nb6 5.f4. White is trying to maintain his e-pawn in the centre."
10,dxe5,d6e5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/1n6/4p3/2PP1P2/8/PP4PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,Black proceeds with his plan. The White's hopefully over-extended central pawns can now be undermined by cunning long-range bombardment from Black's knights.

13,Be3,c1e3,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/1nn5/4P3/2PP4/4B3/PP4PP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 2 7,"White starts committing pieces to his pawns' defence - all part of Black's plan, of course :-)."
14,Bf5,c8f5,r2qkb1r/ppp1pppp/1nn5/4Pb2/2PP4/4B3/PP4PP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 3 8,"Perhaps 7...Be6, attacking White's impertinent c-pawn, would have been stronger, but I decided against it as it has less freedom on e6 and blocks Black's e-pawn."
