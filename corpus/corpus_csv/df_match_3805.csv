1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

In this game I have been guilty of pawn grabbing and GM Cyrano ensured that my second game against him ended in a rout - in his favour!  I thought it was OK to grab a pawn because the queens were traded off prior to that so I did not have to worry about Henry copping Old Matey.  Still, the rooks were on the board and Cyrano's pieces were better developed than my own and he took full advantage of this fact.  Here is how the drama unfolded.  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17572831&rnd=0.30321710962631215"
2,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,2. ..... g6 - this opening has become the Pirc/Robatsch Defense after both the d and g pawns have been advanced one square in response to my e4 and d5.  Afro is gonna allow me to develop a strong pawn centre and then undermine it.

Whichever square Henry chooses to go to it will allow a knight fork, either on c3 or d3.  I realised that one move later and waved the white flag.  It was just so amazing how quickly a seemingly OK position can fall apart in the space of a couple of moves!  I thought I had a telling advantage being a pawn up but Afro made me have another think coming - although my rating is now just 5 points south of 1900 thanks to another Expert timing out on me I still have an awful lot to learn!"
