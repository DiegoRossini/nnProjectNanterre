1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

If you have been following my annotation about Pawn Fork Part 1, you will notice that I made a Bad Draw Offer because of planless play in a won position.  However, I felt so much better after this game because my opponent was the same opponent that I gave that draw to.  I ended up with a two pawn advantage in the late stages of the middlegame but kept my eyes firmly averted from the Offer Draw button and somehow worked out how to gain a much needed victory to get my Class A status back.  My opponent kicks off with c4 which is the English Opening and you can follow the action with the following link to Gameknot Analysis.

This ensures that at the very least, white must give up her rook for Glenda.  This is exactly what happens.  It is amazing, that at the sight of a big black queen, how many opponents wave that white flag.  Gail duly waved it as soon as Glenda appeared.  Gail would have been a whole rook and pawn to the bad and my rook would have no trouble in cleaning up the white pawns and then checkmating the WK.  I hope this will help if you do get stuck in a won position but you are wondering just how to convert it.  I hope you have a good read.  Bye for now - Joanne"
