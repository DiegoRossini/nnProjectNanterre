1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"A bit of a waiting move; my preferred response to White's choice of opening. Depending on whether White plays c4 or e4, this can transpose into either the Slav or the Caro-Kann, both very solid lines for Black."
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"A bit of a waiting move; my preferred response to White's choice of opening. Depending on whether White plays c4 or e4, this can transpose into either the Slav or the Caro-Kann, both very solid lines for Black."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"White puts off making the choice of c4 vs e4, though this historically signals a preference for c4."
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2p3p1/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"?! Not unseen, but not standard either. 2...Nf6 is seen more often. The issue with this move is generally that it blocks up more of Black's light squares--his LSB is frequently difficult to develop in this opening even without this extra blockage."
5,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2p3p1/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"We've arrived at a Slav defense, if a little nonstandard. White should have very little trouble developing, whereas Black will be looking for an eventual break through the center to mobilize his forces."
6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pp1p/2p3p1/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"We've arrived at a Slav defense, if a little nonstandard. White should have very little trouble developing, whereas Black will be looking for an eventual break through the center to mobilize his forces."
7,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pp1p/2p3p1/3p4/2PP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"We've arrived at a Slav defense, if a little nonstandard. White should have very little trouble developing, whereas Black will be looking for an eventual break through the center to mobilize his forces."
8,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkbnr/pp2pp1p/2p3p1/3p1b2/2PP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"Probably 5.Nf6 was more accurate, to defend d5 a bit more thoroughly."

15,Qa4,d1a4,r2qk1nr/pp2ppbp/2n3p1/1B1p1b2/Q2P4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 3 8,"A bit dangerous to bring the Queen out so early, but White's got a lead in both space and development so it's up to Black to prove there's anything wrong with this."
16,Bd7,f5d7,r2qk1nr/pp1bppbp/2n3p1/1B1p4/Q2P4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 4 9,"Black has no good way to hold on to the d-pawn (again, Nf6 at any point before this would have helped greatly), so he drops it in exchange for a bit of freedom and chances at counterplay."
17,Nxd5,c3d5,r2qk1nr/pp1bppbp/2n3p1/1B1N4/Q2P4/4PN2/PP3PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 0 9,"This threat is actually a bluff, but it's not an obvious one. If Black takes 10...axb5, White will win an exchange after 11.Qxa8! Qxa8 12.Nc7+, regaining the Queen with superior position and a Rook for a Bishop."
18,a6,a7a6,r2qk1nr/1p1bppbp/p1n3p1/1B1N4/Q2P4/4PN2/PP3PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 0 10,"This threat is actually a bluff, but it's not an obvious one. If Black takes 10...axb5, White will win an exchange after 11.Qxa8! Qxa8 12.Nc7+, regaining the Queen with superior position and a Rook for a Bishop."

20,Nxd4,c6d4,r2qk1nr/1p1bppbp/p5p1/3N4/Q2n4/4PN2/PP2BPPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 0 11,"! Seizing the opportunity, Black reclaims his pawn, opens the long diagonal for his KB and is about to trade off White's good Bishop to boot (after 11.Qd1 Nxe2 12.Qxe2)."
21,Qc4,a4c4,r2qk1nr/1p1bppbp/p5p1/3N4/2Qn4/4PN2/PP2BPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 1 11,"? This error is more subtle than the last--and much more devastating. Now instead of a strong position, Black can sweep up a concrete material advantage thanks to the WQ's lack of mobility."
22,Rc8,a8c8,2rqk1nr/1p1bppbp/p5p1/3N4/2Qn4/4PN2/PP2BPPP/R1B1K2R w KQk - 2 12,! Winning big material. White's obvious tries all fail quickly and miserably to a fork on c2.
