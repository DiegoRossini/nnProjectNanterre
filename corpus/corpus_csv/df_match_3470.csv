That with the accompanying analysis was a real treat to read through and seeing it was when I first realised just how much preparations GMs do. What I like about this gambit is that black gets a fierce kingside attack where white must step very carefully however even more than that black gets long term positional compensation, so even if white parries blacks kingside attack the resulting positions are often drawn anyway since black will usually have long term activity even into the endgame and also such positions often result in opposite coloured bishop endings. Not to mention the opening is considered sound and playable even by today's GMs and finally the fact that human intuition is actually more important than computer analysis which is always a bonus"
