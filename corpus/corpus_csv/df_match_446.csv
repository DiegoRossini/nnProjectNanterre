1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone! This was one of the most interesting games I have ever played, so I thought I might share it with you. My favorite style of play is sacrificial play with forced lines, but as I am a very low level chess player and new to this game, I rarely get the chance to play them myself. However, in this game an opportunity presented itself where i could sacrifice a piece, and if the bait was taken - as far as i could see, but i actually made a couple of blunders on the way according to the postgame analyzes, giving him the opportunity to escape  - every move after that would lead to me winning the end game, and in many variations if he should make the wrong move, check mate."
