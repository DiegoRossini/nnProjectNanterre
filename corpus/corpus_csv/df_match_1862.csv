I initially was impressed with this opening, but I have not liked the results. Perhaps I should study more master games with Be7 and d6 - I'm not optimistic, however. There are several problems:

(1) The weakness on f4 - A solid, strong, loyal companion in both the Leningrad and Stonewall varaitions, mr. f is virtually alone in the classical - protected only by mr. e whose job in the other two variations is shielding the king from diagonal checks. I can play Kh8, but it wastes time and doesn't solve the problem of being forced to take *out* of the center and open the e file (rather than the d file which is what the Dutch naturally prefers). Another option is using mr. g to protect it (like in the Leningrad), but if I play g6, I want to play Bg7!

(2) The e7 bishop is AWFUL - look at it! It lacks a legal move!! There's not a 'good' bishop and a 'bad' one (like there is in both other variations) there are TWO bad bishops...it's hard to figure out which one is worse!

At the end of the day, this is the reason people don't play the Dutch - king safety problems, a weak overextended mr. f, and a cramped position that keeps your bishops home. You're grabbing space, but doing nothing with it!

Leningrad and Stonewall have both made me proud - let's go back to them!"
