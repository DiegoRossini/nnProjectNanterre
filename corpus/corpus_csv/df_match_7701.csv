However it was this precise line that was considered a practical refutation of the Dragon back in the '80s. Fischer and Karpov were the main exponents of the White side, winning almost every encounter. Support of the variation dwindled. Fashion plays a big role in chess openings. Everyone plays what GMs play. Entire openings are deemed untrustworthy only because current practice focuses on more positional lines and so the state of mind is created."

22,Ne5,c6e5,1r1q1rk1/pp1bppbp/3p1np1/4n3/3NP3/1BN1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR3R w - - 9 12,Preparing b5 and Nc4. A typical Dragon maneuver.

After 13...Nxe3 14.Qxe3, Black must find an active plan and be complacent and relax now that he has the Bishop pair and his DSB is unopposed. My opponent didn't want to part with his Bishop so soon and retreated, knowing that he will have time to regroup and regain the g4 square with tempo. The problem is that if White tries to open the h-file, g4 will again be weak."

36,h6,h7h6,2rq1rk1/p2bppb1/3p2pp/8/3NnPP1/1B5Q/PPP3P1/2KR2BR w - - 0 19,Forced.
