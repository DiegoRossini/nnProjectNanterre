1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"WIN ON MOVE 12- destructive power of the Kings gambit. BISHOP AND KNIGHT SACRIFICE. However, when I played this gambit against players of ranking 1600 or higher, I often had losses. I learnt the kings gambit this summer, and this is one opening where you need some formal training to avoid the carnage that poor maten9 had to endure.

4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"still dangling the f pawn for him, while developing"

7,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/2B1Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"continue development and eye the f7 pawn, crucial in kings gambit"
8,g5,g7g5,r1bqkbnr/pppp1p1p/2n5/6p1/2B1Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,he shores up f4
9,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkbnr/pppp1p1p/2n5/6p1/2B1Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 5,"if he moves pawn to g4, that is when the CLASSICAL kings pawn gambit starts"
10,g4,g5g4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1p1p/2n5/8/2B1Ppp1/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 6,"Now, it depends on my mood. If I want to continue the ride, I let him take my knight. If I am in a pessimistic mood and want to play safe I withdraw knight to e1. 
But I have been told that that is even more unsafe, because the 2 pawns advance right up to the castled king with others to follow. Is that right, pl let me know"
11,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1p1p/2n5/8/2BPPpp1/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 6,"okay, deep breath, take my knight. After all, life is sometimes about excitement and taking risks"
12,gxf3,g4f3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1p1p/2n5/8/2BPPp2/5p2/PPP3PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,"has to be retaken not with the rook but by the might queen, bring her to the f file. Note, ultimate target - f7 pawn"
13,Qxf3,d1f3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1p1p/2n5/8/2BPPp2/5Q2/PPP3PP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 0 7,"you lose pieces and pawns and it hurts. 2 options now- 1) Qx f4- clears f file   
But there is a more dangerous option - CAN YOU GUESS IT?"
14,Nxd4,c6d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/8/2BnPp2/5Q2/PPP3PP/RNB2RK1 w kq - 0 8,"you lose pieces and pawns and it hurts. 2 options now- 1) Qx f4- clears f file

15,Bxf7+,c4f7,r1bqkbnr/pppp1B1p/8/8/3nPp2/5Q2/PPP3PP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 0 8,BOOM
16,Kxf7,e8f7,r1bq1bnr/pppp1k1p/8/8/3nPp2/5Q2/PPP3PP/RNB2RK1 w - - 0 9,"2 pieces sac now. options-  1.)  Bx f4, but then his q or knight could come to f6   2)  Qxf4, same problems.
PLEASE GUESS AGAIN THIRD OPTION"
17,Qh5+,f3h5,r1bq1bnr/pppp1k1p/8/7Q/3nPp2/8/PPP3PP/RNB2RK1 b - - 1 9,I think from now on it should be straightforward with forced moves
18,Ke7,f7e7,r1bq1bnr/ppppk2p/8/7Q/3nPp2/8/PPP3PP/RNB2RK1 w - - 2 10,"options, keep giving checks and use the e pawn and Rxf4 or???"
19,Bxf4,c1f4,r1bq1bnr/ppppk2p/8/7Q/3nPB2/8/PPP3PP/RN3RK1 b - - 0 10,this move is better for it adds another piece to the atack - the threat of bishop checking both k and q on g5
20,Ne6,d4e6,r1bq1bnr/ppppk2p/4n3/7Q/4PB2/8/PPP3PP/RN3RK1 w - - 1 11,note- all his pieces other than one knight are asleep
21,Be5,f4e5,r1bq1bnr/ppppk2p/4n3/4B2Q/4P3/8/PPP3PP/RN3RK1 b - - 2 11,"the squares around his king are finishing off now, one by one. his rook is in danger, but that is of minor interest now"
22,Qe8,d8e8,r1b1qbnr/ppppk2p/4n3/4B2Q/4P3/8/PPP3PP/RN3RK1 w - - 3 12,too late
23,Qh4+,h5h4,r1b1qbnr/ppppk2p/4n3/4B3/4P2Q/8/PPP3PP/RN3RK1 b - - 4 12,"He resigns. Kings gambit, highly unpredictable and dangerous. I never try it on anyone whose rating is above 1650 or so, because most of the time I lose.
Key mistake for him, I think, was not bringing his queen to f6 on move 7- what do you think? Pl go back to move 7 and see.
PL RATE and comment freely.  I hope you enjoyed this brief ride, I do feel a bit queasy annotating a win over a weaker opponent, but just like I learned a few months ago, someone else can learn this most unpredictable of all gambits."
