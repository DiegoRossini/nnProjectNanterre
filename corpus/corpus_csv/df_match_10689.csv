Despite contrary advice I consider the best opening to be one that suits your style of play, or simply one that you are familiar with."

Looking through variations now, Ng4 looks interesting. If
1) 6. d4 exd4 7. Na4, with a small advantage to black
2) 6. 0-0 Qh4 (possible since knight isn't on f3) 7. h3 (avoiding # on h2) Nxf2 looks pretty good for black, since black is going to have to give up the exchange"
