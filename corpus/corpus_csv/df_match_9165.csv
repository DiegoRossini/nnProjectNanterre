1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Queen sacrifice- my first I think. Cracking game where we both castled on opposite sides and tried to attack the other's king. Can you spot his brilliant trap on move 25 and if I say so myself, my nice move on #36 which allowed me to wrap it up. Pl comment freely, I am sure you will enjoy this high octane ride. Thanks also to tomoa who sent a nice message on defeat. PLEASE RATE"
