1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"1. c4  English opening

I like it because of all the transposition possibilities. Since Sicilian is my game, reversed Sicilian with 1. ... e5 is even more so with an extra move."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"id=Chrisobee plays Nf6, which is flexible without going into Reversed Sicilian.  It's a good response and I play it myself sometimes."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"This is a standard response to Nf6.  I'm not afraid to play a Queen's Gambit game if necessary.  In fact, sometimes I prefer it.  I guess it depends upon my mood."
4,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"This is an interesting but good reply.  This transposes the game a third time into a possible Benoni.  In fact, Benko's Gambit is sometimes thought of as a Benoni.  But really, Benko's Gambit is truly a separate kind of animal that deserves respect on its own.  

I generally don't play it as Black, because it is difficult to win against proper play.  Playing it for drawing purposes is OK.  

Yet, it is a very tricky opening.  It has great surprise value against the unprepared. Computers often make mistakes when analyzing these games."
5,d5,d4d5,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2pP4/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"I've studied extensively with the Benoni - learning pawn structure, secrets, and levers.  Some people cannot stand it because of the closed nature of the positions.  You have to know strategy a little better to do well in this opening.

To continue with the Benoni, play 3. ... e6."
6,b5,b7b5,rnbqkb1r/p2ppppp/5n2/1ppP4/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"This is a fourth transposition (into the Benko Gambit), and it has only been three moves.  That kind of aggressive manipulation is often attempted by both sides when strong players meet. It's a normal characteristic of the game.

****

The main idea here is for Black to sacrifice his a and b pawns to open up the files for his rooks."
7,cxb5,c4b5,rnbqkb1r/p2ppppp/5n2/1PpP4/8/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"It is dangerous to not accept the pawn.  Take it every time in this position.  

At least that is my advice.  Some authorities claim  4. Nf3 is possible.  I don't buy it.  I've tried it and have been burned big time.

8,a6,a7a6,rnbqkb1r/3ppppp/p4n2/1PpP4/8/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"Offering the second pawn may seem weird in an unfamiliar position, but 4. ... a6 is considered the only real way to safely handle the Benko as Black."
9,bxa6,b5a6,rnbqkb1r/3ppppp/P4n2/2pP4/8/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"A strong alternative for White would be to play 5. b6 instead.  Such a move avoids the complications that taking the extra pawn creates.  I find that this alternative is unnecessary as long as you are sufficiently familiar with the main line and the subsequent variations from it.  If 5. b6, then Black can choose between Qxb6 or e6.

****

It is strongly advised for Black to wait to retake the second pawn after 5. bxa6. For Black, the sacrifice is done to gain position and speed in development.  

****

At first glance, Black could retake with his rook on a8, with his knight on b8, his bishop in c8, or with his queen after a tactical finesse (Qa5+ followed by Qxa6).  Experience suggests that the only good retake is with the Bishop.  But like I said before, Black should develop first.  There is no hurry in this position."
10,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/3ppp1p/P4np1/2pP4/8/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"5. ... g6 is considered best play.  

****

I've noticed, however, that play can continue the same by taking the a6 pawn instead with the Bishop.  But by playing g6 before retaking, an unfamiliar white player is more likely to move something that will get him into trouble.  

****

Since many players are unfamiliar with the particulars of this opening, 5. ...g6 is a good strategic move.  Tactically, the two lines are equivalent."
11,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/3ppp1p/P4np1/2pP4/8/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 6,"Black has already gained tempo for the sacrifice of the pawn.  Apparently pawn positions later in the game tend to favor Black too.  So White must play accurately.  Development is priority. 

Thus 6. Nc3 is sound.  A rare alternative is 6. g3; it is also playable."
12,Bxa6,c8a6,rn1qkb1r/3ppp1p/b4np1/2pP4/8/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,"Black has open lines for an attack. 

****

He has the potential for a devastatingly powerful lever with e6 later in the game.  An eventual c4 pawn is golden if Black can safely reach d3 with his Knight.  He can potentially do this with a knight on d7 and moving it through a vacated square on c5. Together these features can be a winning positional strategy for Black.  It's is easier said than done.  White can usually give Black back material to prevent this. However, often greed gets the better of players.  

****

These are not the only ideas for Black.  He could move his f6 knight to either b5 or a4 to create a double attack with his fianchettoed bishop at g7 upon the important c3 White knight.  And/or (depending upon circumstances) the b8 knight could move through d7 and maneuver to either b4 or c4 to attack the White b pawn.  If Black can somehow succeed in gaining back the lost material by capturing either the White a or b pawn, then Black should immediately trade down into an endgame.  The likely pawn structure should significantly favor Black.

****

Timing is extremely important in the Benko.  If things are coordinated just right, White suddenly finds himself in a positional zugzwang.  No matter what he does, his position continually deteriorates.  

But if Black does not time his movement properly, then he will be the one in trouble instead."
13,e4,e2e4,rn1qkb1r/3ppp1p/b4np1/2pP4/4P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 7,"This may seem strange, but this is considered best by many authorities.  It's called the King's Walk Variation.  Grandmaster practitioners of the Benko's Gambit play this variation often enough to attest to its viability.

****

Major alternatives include, 7. Nf3 or 7. g3."
14,Bxf1,a6f1,rn1qkb1r/3ppp1p/5np1/2pP4/4P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKbNR w KQkq - 0 8,It turns out that the loss of ability to castle is not a true loss at all.  You will understand this in just a couple of more moves.
15,Kxf1,e1f1,rn1qkb1r/3ppp1p/5np1/2pP4/4P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQ1KNR b kq - 0 8,The moves d6 and Bg7 are standard ones that White should know are coming soon.  These will give White enough time to fix his King-side problem.
16,d6,d7d6,rn1qkb1r/4pp1p/3p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQ1KNR w kq - 0 9,"By trading the bishops, Black has relinquished one of his opening compensations for the pawn.  The light squared Black bishop no longer provides pressure along the a6-f1 diagonal. Yet at the same time, White will likely have weak control over the white squares.  The only way Black can exploit this weakness is through potentially awkward movements with his knights.

****

The battle for c4 and subsequent control of d3 will have to be fought by Black's knights or major pieces.  This is likely to lessen the pressure along the a and b files.  This may give White enough wiggle room to at least force a draw and perhaps launch a counter-attack upon Black's King position."
17,Nf3,g1f3,rn1qkb1r/4pp1p/3p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1K1R b kq - 1 9,"First, the development of the other knight is prudent.  Now White will work on releasing his trapped rook."
18,Bg7,f8g7,rn1qk2r/4ppbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1K1R w kq - 2 10,"Meanwhile, Black can do nothing more than normal development."
19,g3,g2g3,rn1qk2r/4ppbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N2NP1/PP3P1P/R1BQ1K1R b kq - 0 10,It turns out that Black has made the Bishop exchange for naught.  White is clearly about to catch up with Black in development.
