1,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/2N5/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 1,"Hi everyone, I just do not learn, I do not learn.  This time I castled on the queenside at precisely the wrong moment and got eaten alive by Master Freddy.   **Ah, Freddy, kittens have 9 lives as well as cats and I may well be back again Freddy, but now I lick my wounds as I contemplate the bite behind the Dunst Opening which transposes into a Sicilian Richter Rauzer attack to devastating effect.  I follow a line in the World DB that is favourable to the Expert that played it, but, aha, I was playing a Master.  Here is how I got ........... Mastered!

**N.B.  My reference to kittens in this annotation relates to an article I wrote in the General Forums many moons ago regarding life on the Expert's playing field where I envisaged myself as a little white furry kitten that had strayed onto safari land where the big cats such as lions, tigers and hornets lurk, not to mention the blazing hot sun beamed out by lightotheright!  Not surprisingly I get a cattermauling!"
