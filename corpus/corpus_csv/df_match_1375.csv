1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"Unusual opening for me, but nothing that scares me."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,"Unusual opening for me, but nothing that scares me."

4,d4,d5d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2Pp4/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,...knowing that the pawn's defence won't have to be easy.
5,b4,b2b4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/1PPp4/5N2/P2PPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"Oh, that's really brand new to me! Let's have fun!"

Now I am prepared to exchange the B for the N in order to release pressure against d4, that could then be supported by e5. In the meanwhile, I'll had to stand for he attack on the white squares, which I am confident I can do provided I won't lose d4 in the process."
7,Ne5,f3e5,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/4N3/1PPp2b1/8/P2PPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,"This knight is not actually threatening nothing but c3, and it was foreseen."
8,Bh5,g4h5,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/4N2b/1PPp4/8/P2PPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 3 5,"The e4 pawn is not defended after my next move, but it is not threatened, either. Even without the bishop, my defences should hold, since the N e5 will be threatened."

12,Qc7,d8c7,rn2kbnr/ppq1pppp/2p5/1P2N2b/Q1Pp4/8/P2PPPPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 1 7,"No white pawns or lsb in sight to threat my knight, and his is still under threat."

17,Ba3,c1a3,r3kbnr/p1q1pppp/2p5/7b/Q1Pp4/B7/P2PPPPP/RN2KB1R b KQkq - 1 9,White is pressing me hard. I'm not advised to move the e pawn and lose the castling rights.
18,Nf6,g8f6,r3kb1r/p1q1pppp/2p2n2/7b/Q1Pp4/B7/P2PPPPP/RN2KB1R w KQkq - 2 10,"So I develop the other minor piece, hoping for a better chance. e4 - incredibly - is not threatened yet."
19,g3,g2g3,r3kb1r/p1q1pppp/2p2n2/7b/Q1Pp4/B5P1/P2PPP1P/RN2KB1R b KQkq - 0 10,"White, correctly, gets more pressure on c6, while I am still far from c5. I hope to force him to play c5 himself, so to block his dsb's action."
20,Nd7,f6d7,r3kb1r/p1qnpppp/2p5/7b/Q1Pp4/B5P1/P2PPP1P/RN2KB1R w KQkq - 1 11,"Nb6 would unpin the c pawn, supporting a sure c5 from black's side."
