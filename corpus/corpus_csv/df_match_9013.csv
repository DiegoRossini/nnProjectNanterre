2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I play the French Defence, my favourite response to 1.e4."
3,b3,b2b3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/1P6/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"If my opponent wanted to get me ""out of the book"" he has certainly managed it! This is the Reti/Spielmann Variation, very rare in comparison the the main line 2.d4, and I had never seen it before in my life. Not a good start."
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/4P3/1P6/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"I simply continued with the core idea of the French Defence, pretending it was the main line. This is the most usual response to the Reti/Spielmann Variation as well."
5,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3pP3/8/1P6/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,The game broadens into a more usual French formation - though still a far cry from main line French Defence.

10,c6,c7c6,r1bqkb1r/pp1nnppp/2p1p3/1B1pP3/8/1P3N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"Black's position is unfortunately very cramped, with both bishops completely blocked in. In particular, Black's light'squared bishop is stuck behind Black's c- and e- pawns, as well as his d2-knight - at least Black's dark-squared bishop has an easy exit after Ng6. However, I was hoping to target the pawn on e5, which was not currently protected by any other pawns: if this pawn falls, Black can expand his cramped postion."
