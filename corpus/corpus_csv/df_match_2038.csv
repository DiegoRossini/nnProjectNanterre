This modest looking move is designed to prepare ...e5 without having to worry (overmuch) about White's landing a minor piece on the b5-square and attacking the d6-point.  At the same time, the move supports an eventual expansion by Black on the Q-side.  So purposive is the move, it hardly comes under the pejorative 'country move' associated with a move like a2-a3 or ...a7-a6, which often signals a timorous approach to the game.

11,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"[!?] This move, similar to the Sozin Attack in the 2...Nc6 lines of the Sicilian, has declined relatively in popularity compared with 6.Bg5 and 6.Be3.  In former times it was something of a favorite with Bobby Fischer, and was held to be one of the more aggressive lines against the Najdorf Sicilian.  It tends to discourage Black's planned ...e7-e5 advance, but at the cost of presenting Black's b-pawn with a target, unless White is prepared to pay a price in time."

GM O'Kelly de Galway called this 'the most active continuation preparing a counter-attack on the White KP [e-pawn].'  Bobby Fischer himself played this line against Robert Byrne in the Sousse Interzonal, 1967.  Also playable here are 7...Be7 and 7...Nbd7."

It was with the latter move Bobby Fischer came within an ace of defeating Mischa Tal in the 1959 Candidates' Tournament.  After 8.f4 b4?! Tal got himself into all sorts of trouble:  9.Na4 Nxe4  10.0-0 g6  11.f5! gxf5  12.Nxf5! Rg8   13.Bd5! Ra2.  Note Tal's 8th and 9th moves - the thematic idea behind Black's play.

It may well have been White's purpose to draw forward the h-pawn, weakening Black's K-side slightly, and creating a target for a later K-side attack.  Returning to the centre, this bishop is well placed to intervene on either flank."

Planning to castle Q-side, she will be aiming to centralise both rooks.  But such is White's lead in development, she could already have contemplated the thematic sacrifice at e6:  11.Nxe6!? ... and now [A] 11... fxe6  12.Nb6! Bb7  13.Nxa8 Bxa8  14.Bxe6; or [B] 11...Bxe6  12.Bd5! Nd7! -(Instead 12...Bxd5  13.Qxd5 and White has a strong attack going)- 13.Bxe4 Rc8.  both lead to unclear positions with chances for both sides.  Insofar as the sacrifice does not compromise White's chances, we might consider it to be sound enough."

But that is not to say Black Black is not ready to face this onslaught.  Things have suddenly become very interesting!  Should Black accept the sacrifice?  In calling Black's reply a mistake, the GK engine offered this alternative with a near-even assessment: 13....fxe6  14.Qh5ch Ke7 -(I'll revisit this in my next note)  15.Bc5ch Nxc5  16.Nxc5 Qb6  17.Nxe6 Nc6 -(Not much improvement can be got from 17...Nd7  18.Rhe1 Nf6  19.Qf5)- 18.Nxf8 Raxf8  19.Qxd5 Kf6  20.Qe6ch Kg5  21.Rd5ch Kh4 - the limit of the engine's vision, and so it looked even.

22.Qh3#.  From this it might appear that Black did well to leave the knight alone..."

It seems that Black ought indeed to have taken the Knight and then clung on in the face of White's assault: 13...fxe6!  14.Qh5ch Kd7! -(We surmise that the GK engine's choice ...Ke7 is insufficient, though that has yet to be definitively determined).  At this point White might well fling everything into the assault: 15.Bxd5!? exd5  16.Rxd5ch Bxd5  17.Qxd5ch Nd6! -(any King move gets axed)- 18.Re1! ... -(the straight-forward 18.Qxa8 is playable, too, by the look)-  18...Be7 -(What else?  Not 18...Nc6, that's for sure: 19.Nc5ch!)-  19.Qxa8.  At this point White would be a piece behind still, but with so active a game could still fancy her winning chances.  'Fancying her chances' is however a far cry from the 'gimme' win White now obtains."
