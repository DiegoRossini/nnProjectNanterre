11,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2np4/1N2p1B1/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"'!?' - The bishop is poison (of the Najdorf variety - ...Qxg5 is a fairly common try), but that is not all. This move initiates a sideline (used successfully by Velimirovic) designed to unbalance Black in the opening. Though not objectively best (c4 is critical), this move induces a pseudo-Sveshnikov position where White has not yet played Nc3. If not 6..Qxg5!?, Black must play ...Nf6 (if ..Be7? 7. Bxe7, then Black must awkwardly recapture ..Kxe7 to avoid dropping the d-pawn; and ..f6 is somewhat ridiculous but similarly possible). More typical is 6.c4(!), initiating a positional stranglehold that is uniquely available in the Kalashnikov and considered bad for Black. It is also the reason many players prefer the Sveshnikov move order."

Still, this initiates a doubled-pawn position White is familiar attacking from Sveshnikov play, where f7 becomes a target and White plays for a quick attack."

If the d5 knight moves (threatening Qf7#) then Black can retreat ..Rg6! and White has gotten nowhere. Black's retreat covers f7 and threatens ..Rh6, driving off the White queen."

Nf4! introduces an ultra-sharp position where White is winning with accurate play, which might continue  20..Rf6 21.Nh5 Rxf2 22.Qxh6 bxc4 23.Nxc4 when Black is up an Exchange but subject to a vicious winning attack as the knights occupy crucial (and often unassailable) holes in the Black position. The text relies on ..exf4?? Qh8  ( -) and, as seen in the game continuation, f4-f5 wins the rook with attack."
