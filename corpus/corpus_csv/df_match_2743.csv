1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Before the game gets completely underway, I would like to compliment my opponent for two things.  First, he chose an obscure opening that isn't well analyzed. This in and of itself isn't particularly striking.  However, it offered attacking chances and in places, it could get tricky.  And second, he has a strong tactical sense that I'm sure has served him well over his chess career.  I enjoyed this game very much."
