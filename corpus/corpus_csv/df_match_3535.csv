Initially (at move 24) I really had this in mind. After Nd6 black would have to take on d6 with the bishop, which I would take with my rook. The chances for both sides seem pretty equal here, for me it also already looked a bit drawish.

While seeing this position however, I suddenly had a pretty 'strange' idea... a move which I would never have done if the team 2vs2 team match wouldn't have been lost already..."

A truly weird seeming knight sacrifice. But it leads to a few forced moves. Black gets my knight and for that, I get 2 pawns and the black king has to travel back to the middle. 
What actually really surprised me though is that this move isn't critisized by GK analyzer... I still think it is dubious though, especially for a rather unexperienced player like me.

The next few moves were pretty much forced and easy to see from that position. Until move 31 the choices were pretty clear."
