19,Bxf3,e2f3,2kr2nr/ppp2ppp/2n5/3q4/1b1P4/P1N2B2/1P3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 10,White choose to eliminate the LSB first because it enables to menace the queen. Of course black can make a check but white vcan play the DSB on e3 (it's a piece which didn's move and e3 is not a bad place for it). It won't be pinned for long as white can castle short in one move.

White is slightly in late of material. Nobody controls the open file. No immediate threat. Both kings are safe. The center is nomansland, Black pawn structure is better because white has an isolated pawn on c file. White has a slight advantage because the two bishops, the queen are all aiming at black's kingside. 
White hesitated between 15. Rd1 (controling the open file and aiming at the center) and 15. Rb1 but finally elected the last move for it strenghtens the attack on the kingside."
