The Knight on b1 has nowhere to go that is helpful, and he has now just blocked the development of his c1 Bishop. He is moving pawns and neglecting his development. He is also no closer to castling."

You see, my pawn is supposed to be on e5, and it isn't. The Old Indian has one real strategy problem...It has a traffic jam in the middle becuase the pawns block the pieces. I do not have that problem because my opponent took on e5 and because I was able to play e4. But I still need to control the center and I need to control b5, so this is a good move. It also let's my put my Queen somewhere safe."
