1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was the second of games with this time limit - it is the longest setting on the blitz section. I had won the previous one, on the white side of a Nimzo-Indian fairly comfortably. As she had annotated that one http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/real-time-game?gm=61234 I felt duty bound to annotate this one."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I opened e2-e4 to make a change. I had opened d2-d4 against her in our previous game. Maybe my first mistake?

Then I thought ""well she would never respect me if she found out I deliberately lost"", but as it happened, I lost anyway!"
5,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,"So I play the Spanish, considered best."
