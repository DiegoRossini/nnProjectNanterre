Neither side can safely advance their pawns to any useful extent. I get this pawn formation played against me quite frequently when I play the Sicilian against an opponent of approximately 1700+ rating. Fortunately I don't think I have ever lost when it comes to this position, due to a few reasons.  1) The moment the game breaks open, white's king is in trouble.  2) This becomes a positional battle where each player maneuvers their pieces behind their pawn barrage as artillery support.  I happen to be good at that.  3) While my opponent's position ""looks"" good and solid, ""impenetrable"", they tend to let their guard down on defense and concentrate on formulating an attack plan. The thing about these positions is that it's extremely difficult to predict what will happen (or what the opponent had planned in mind) once the position breaks open.
