1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"in this game, white went into a won endgame, but played a huge blunder in the very end.  But black resigned before trying to play out the position. This mistake was probably made by a miscalculation, as you will see."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,this is the so called 4 knights scotch.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,this is the so called 4 knights scotch.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,this is the so called 4 knights scotch.
5,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 3,this is the so called 4 knights scotch.
6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 4 4,this is the so called 4 knights scotch.
7,d4,d2d4,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,this is the so called 4 knights scotch.
8,Bb4,f8b4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/1b1PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"I do not know any theory on this opening, but this defense seems reasonable. White has no way to make any material gains."
9,Nxe5,f3e5,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4N3/1b1PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,acceptable.
10,Nxe5,c6e5,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4n3/1b1PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"I consider that this is a mistake. The better move was probably 6.Nxe4, but here white still wins the majority of games."
11,dxe5,d4e5,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4P3/1b2P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"now black's position is much worse. The black knight has only 1 safe retreat, and that is back to g8. Black is forced to play 6...Nxe4 as the game went, or 6...Bxc3+ 7.bxc3 Nxe4 8.Qg4! winning material(8...Nxc3 9.Qc4)."
12,Nxe4,f6e4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/1b2n3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,(!) this tricky move is best. Black has no way to prevent material losses. This transposes into the previous line I mentioned.
13,Qg4,d1g4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/1b2n1Q1/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 1 7,(!) this tricky move is best. Black has no way to prevent material losses. This transposes into the previous line I mentioned.

24,Bf5,c8f5,r3kr2/pp2qpQp/2p4B/3pPb2/4n3/P1PB4/2P2PPP/R3K2R w KQq - 4 13,white already has a decisive material advantage. He now uses the pin on the knight to win more material.
