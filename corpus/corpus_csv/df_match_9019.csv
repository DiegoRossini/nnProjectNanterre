1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone, I have decided to annotate a couple of very lucky wins.  After the disappointing result of the Beafyness tourney two players put a smile on my face by waving the white flag.  But, as you will see from these two games, the chessic illness I suffer from, passivitis, is still with me.  But I got away with it and as a result you could certainly call me a lucky so and so!  This game started out as a Guicco Piano."
