1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I managed to equalize the game right from the opening and in the middle game I was able to get a decisive positional advantage that would soon convert in to a promoted pawn... white in his effort to avoid this ended in a mate net!
