2,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Something a bit different this time around, I wanted to try fianchettoing my Bishop. This might have been a mistake, considering I was black, white already has a strong claim to the center that will be difficult to challenge."

6,e5,e7e5,rnbqk1nr/pppp1pbp/6p1/4p3/3PP3/4B3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"While on the one hand, this pawn is defended by my bishop..."
7,d5,d4d5,rnbqk1nr/pppp1pbp/6p1/3Pp3/4P3/4B3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,...I failed to consider that white might elect to just set up his pawn structure.
8,d6,d7d6,rnbqk1nr/ppp2pbp/3p2p1/3Pp3/4P3/4B3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"Stopping the march of the D-pawn, but playing into white's wish for a closed game."
9,h3,h2h3,rnbqk1nr/ppp2pbp/3p2p1/3Pp3/4P3/4B2P/PPP2PP1/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"Stop a moment and look at my bishops. Neither one has any hope of moving to any square where they'll be useful any time soon. White's e4 pawn in particular completely locks down my e-pawn, my dark-squared bishop and takes the f5 square away from my other bishop. If I'm going to do anything this game, it has to go. And since I don't want to move my f-pawn, that means attacking white's d-pawn first."

11,c4,c2c4,rnbqk1nr/pp3pbp/2pp2p1/3Pp3/2P1P3/4B2P/PP3PP1/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,"White declines to trade pawns, twice. If I play cxd5 or bxc4, he simply retakes, and his center pawns are as safe as ever. While it would open up the queenside, his bishops are better placed to take advantage of that than mine."

15,Qc2,d1c2,rnbqk2r/p4pbp/2pp1np1/1p1Pp3/2P1P3/1P2B2P/P1Q2PP1/RN2KBNR b KQkq - 2 8,"White brings the queen in to defend, but I think Bd3 (or Bg5 to pin the knight) would have been better."
16,Na6,b8a6,r1bqk2r/p4pbp/n1pp1np1/1p1Pp3/2P1P3/1P2B2P/P1Q2PP1/RN2KBNR w KQkq - 3 9,"White wants to avoid Nb4, as it would chase the white queen off the b1-h7 diagonal, letting me claim the pawn."
17,Bd2,e3d2,r1bqk2r/p4pbp/n1pp1np1/1p1Pp3/2P1P3/1P5P/P1QB1PP1/RN2KBNR b KQkq - 4 9,"White wants to avoid Nb4, as it would chase the white queen off the b1-h7 diagonal, letting me claim the pawn."

21,Nce2,c3e2,r1bqk2r/p4pbp/2pp1np1/2nPp3/1pP1P3/1P5P/P1QBNPP1/R3KBNR b KQkq - 1 11,"The threat here is that if I don't react well, white will play Bxc5, dxc5, Qxe4, and I'm down a piece with a worse pawn structure."
22,Nfxe4,f6e4,r1bqk2r/p4pbp/2pp2p1/2nPp3/1pP1n3/1P5P/P1QBNPP1/R3KBNR w KQkq - 0 12,"The threat here is that if I don't react well, white will play Bxc5, dxc5, Qxe4, and I'm down a piece with a worse pawn structure."

If white reacts poorly, black can play Nxf2, threatening the h1 rook and unmasking the bishop for a discovered attack onto white's queen. The queen's movement options are also severely limited, the only space she can safely move to is Qd1. (c1 and b2 are unavailable because of Nd3+.)"
25,Ng3,e2g3,r2qk2r/p4pbp/2pp2p1/2nPpb2/1BP1n3/1P4NP/P1Q2PP1/R3KBNR b KQkq - 2 13,?? This loses the game immediately. While technically Nxf2 doesn't work any more...

27,Qxf5,c2f5,r2qk2r/p4pbp/2pp2p1/2nPpQ2/1BP5/1P4nP/P4PP1/R3KBNR b KQkq - 0 14,"White elects to trade in his queen instead of giving up the rook, which I think is a poor decision. With his queen off the board, his dark-squared bishop becomes his only developed piece, and none of the others (particularly that h1 rook he decided to save) can reach active positions any time soon."
28,gxf5,g6f5,r2qk2r/p4pbp/2pp4/2nPpp2/1BP5/1P4nP/P4PP1/R3KBNR w KQkq - 0 15,"? I was so eager to take the queen, I missed Nxf5. It costs me the knight, though the material advantage is decisive regardless."
29,fxg3,f2g3,r2qk2r/p4pbp/2pp4/2nPpp2/1BP5/1P4PP/P5P1/R3KBNR b KQkq - 0 15,"While the game is effectively over, white elected to play on for a while, and the mop-up isn't too dull."
