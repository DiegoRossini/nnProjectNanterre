1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Still very bored so I figure I'll do a thematic tourney game with one of my favorite openings.  The Samisch King's Indian.  Most of the horrid blunder belong to black but I make some to let black keep playing.

3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Strange move right off 5... e5 or 5... O-O followed by 6... c4 (my recommended line for black)

7,e4,e2e4,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,Strange move right off 5... e5 or 5... O-O followed by 6... c4 (my recommended line for black)
