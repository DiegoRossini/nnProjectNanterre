1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"this strange game deserves to be annotated, due to the surrealistic developments it evolved to. As I was confident I should lose it when the middle game showed white as much better placed in space, I decided to try some positional compensation for a rook sacrifice. It strangely worked, of course with a little help of my opponent. My moves are not correct in a chess master point of view. Though I like the game because of the erratic esthetic of it."
