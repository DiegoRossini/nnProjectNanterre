1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone, just for once it is me that gets those pawns rolling!  This game against my buddy Bob Jacobs, a player less than 100 points south of my rating, is very even until well into the late middlegame when a pile up on the c file of my heavies leads to me winning a pawn due to a pin on his dark square bishop.  After that I still end up with work to do.  One big dilemma that I was faced with was ""Should Glenda abandon the c file to the Wicked Witch of the West and if so, where should she go?""  Thankfully that dilemma was somehow sorted with Glenda able to go back to that file.  A queen swap followed and I had a strong wall of passers.  It seemed plain sailing, but, I ask, when is a jstevens1 victory plain sailing?  Not often.  In the end, a knight move enabled me to put the advanced queenside pawns just where I wanted them.  Even him giving up his dsb would not have prevented a joyous reunion between Glenda and Henry so he waved the white flag.

He kicks off with the Caro-Kann Defense and I respond with the exchange variation hoping for open play."
