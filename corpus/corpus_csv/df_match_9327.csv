1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I played as Black in this unrated game against one of my teammates whom I found to be a strong 1700  player.  In the game, Black plays an interesting 9th move which defines a good portion of the game.  Late in the game, Black blunders away a winning position and with a second blunder loses the chance to draw.  The credit really goes to White though who played a nearly flawless game."

15,Nxd4,f3d4,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/3P4/1b1N4/2NBP3/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 8,A nice move adding a defender to the knight and attacking h7

Yet, as my opponent pointed out to me after the game, g6 was probably objectively better as this weakens the a2-g8 diagonal which becomes a thorn in my side."

Ideally, I would like to blockade the passed pawn with my dark squared bishop on d6 and get my light squared bishop to b5."
