1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is a short game I played in a GK tournament recently. There were a range of tactics, nearly all of which were missed by at least one player."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"This is unusual - in my experience, white normally follows up with 3.c4 and attempts to squash black's position. As a move I don't like it for white, and the only game in the database that started like this was won by black."
3,d5,d4d5,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/3P4/8/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"This is unusual - in my experience, white normally follows up with 3.c4 and attempts to squash black's position. As a move I don't like it for white, and the only game in the database that started like this was won by black."
4,c6,c7c6,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2p2n2/3P4/8/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"I thought exchanging seems sensible - the line I have played most often is 3.c4 cxd5 4.cxd5 e6 5.d6 Qb6 6.Bf4, which leads to a complex position, as white must hang onto the pawn. In that line, I don't really like either player's position."
5,dxc6,d5c6,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2P2n2/8/8/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"3.dxc6? is certainly a mistake, handing black a central pawn majority and a development advantage."

7,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/8/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,"I wanted to prevent the knight from having anywhere it could take up an outpost - not that I thought this likely, but it couldn't hurt, and in any case I needed to release my bishops. Finally, this unleashes the possibility of ...Qa5 and ...d4."
