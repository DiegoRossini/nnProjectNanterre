1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Freddy has told me that he likes to take underrated opponents out of book early and he does so here with the Reversed Grob.  If you go to the games database, you'll notice that there are only 4 listed responses for this position.  As for the position itself, it doesn't do much for center control, but does allow the opportunity to play a hyper-modern game; controlling the center from the wings."

3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/8/6p1/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,So I look to take more real estate in the center of the board.

6,h6,h7h6,rnbqk1nr/ppppppb1/7p/4P1p1/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Post Game Computer Analysis (PGA) gave me a slight advantage after this move, but in hindsight I see it as a mistake and a loss in tempo.  I should have used this opportunity to develop another piece.  Granted, I had my eye on the potential Ne2, so I wanted to develop the bishop to avoid barricading it, but Ne2 wasn't necessary and in the end I didn't play it anyway.  The Bishop could have been developed later (and to potentially a better square)."

I can't remember the last time I played a game where I developed both Bishops before either Knight, Freddy forced this in my mind because I saw 5. Nf3 g4 6. Nd2 cxd4.  Either way, a Knight couldn't defend the challenged piece without losing the e5 pawn.  The only other option was 5. c3."
