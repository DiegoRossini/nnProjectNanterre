1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Solid & reliable opening.
2,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,Leading with horsey rather than prawn :-)
3,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"White follows usual rule - if centre space is available, grab it."
4,d5,d7d5,r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,I play a standard response with .. d5
5,e5,e4e5,r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3pP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,Pawn pushes up rather than taking...still well within normal theory...
6,f6,f7f6,r1bqkbnr/ppp1p1pp/2n2p2/3pP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Now I'm feigning to play wing-theory by getting the white e pawn out of the game. This is not my real plan however.....
7,Bd3,f1d3,r1bqkbnr/ppp1p1pp/2n2p2/3pP3/3P4/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 4,"White plays an aggressive move to threaten the queen check (Qh5). I could play g6 to block it, but I am looking for white to play the check so I play along with the terrible-looking pawn-grab instead. This allows white to develop the 'winning' position."
8,Nxd4,c6d4,r1bqkbnr/ppp1p1pp/5p2/3pP3/3n4/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,"OK Knight takes pawn looks suicidal and breaks all the rules, but bear with me...."
9,Qh5+,d1h5,r1bqkbnr/ppp1p1pp/5p2/3pP2Q/3n4/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 1 5,White plays the book move and puts me in check with a nasty bishop threat to come.
10,g6,g7g6,r1bqkbnr/ppp1p2p/5pp1/3pP2Q/3n4/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 0 6,"I block with the pawn, well aware that white will now take the pawn."
11,Bxg6+,d3g6,r1bqkbnr/ppp1p2p/5pB1/3pP2Q/3n4/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 0 6,Sure enough white plays the obvious and apparently powerful move. Black would probably be advised to get the king out of there but I believe in my analysis and play the suicidal-looking move.....
12,hxg6,h7g6,r1bqkbnr/ppp1p3/5pp1/3pP2Q/3n4/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 0 7,Allowing white to nab my rook....
13,Qxh8,h5h8,r1bqkbnQ/ppp1p3/5pp1/3pP3/3n4/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQq - 0 7,The situation for black now looks grim but I believe this is a potentially winning situation. I go straight into counter-attack with.....
14,Nxc2+,d4c2,r1bqkbnQ/ppp1p3/5pp1/3pP3/8/8/PPn2PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQq - 0 8,Forking the rook.
15,Kd1,e1d1,r1bqkbnQ/ppp1p3/5pp1/3pP3/8/8/PPn2PPP/RNBK2NR b q - 1 8,"White plays the natural move. Black might be tempted to nab the rook but I think this would be a mistake, so I leave the knight hanging and play a strange-looking move instead."
16,Qd7,d8d7,r1b1kbnQ/pppqp3/5pp1/3pP3/8/8/PPn2PPP/RNBK2NR w q - 2 9,My plan here is to let the white king take my knight in order to bring it into range of my attack. Putting my queen on d2 allows me to develop quickly.
17,Kxc2,d1c2,r1b1kbnQ/pppqp3/5pp1/3pP3/8/8/PPK2PPP/RNB3NR b q - 0 9,Sure enough white takes the knight.
18,Qg4,d7g4,r1b1kbnQ/ppp1p3/5pp1/3pP3/6q1/8/PPK2PPP/RNB3NR w q - 1 10,"It might seem better to play Qf5+ but my analysis shows that this is non-optimum. Putting my queen on g4 serves two purposes - firstly she is now ready to swing into action in the attack and secondly she is watching the g6 pawn which, after white takes on g8, is a natural target for the white queen."
19,Qxg8,h8g8,r1b1kbQ1/ppp1p3/5pp1/3pP3/6q1/8/PPK2PPP/RNB3NR b q - 0 10,"Sure enough white takes, probably sensing no great danger at this point. Now it is time to bring my bishop into the counter-attack..."
20,Bf5+,c8f5,r3kbQ1/ppp1p3/5pp1/3pPb2/6q1/8/PPK2PPP/RNB3NR w q - 1 11,White has several options but analysis indicates they all lead to a similar outcome.
