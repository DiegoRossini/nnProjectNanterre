1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"So this is a game I faced the Morra Gambit, against which I had had very poor score in Blitz games. People don't play it too often here, since altough it is full of traps and zaps for black and gives him lot to think about, it is most probably a little unsound."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"This is the Gambit. White gets a tempo, open lines and space advantage for the price of pawn."

6,dxc3,d4c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/4P3/2p5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Accepting the gambit is the most natural and critical reply.
7,Nxc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/4P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"Interesting position. Obviously White will get his attack, but somehow he must succeed in creating some sort of weaknesses in blacks camp."
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/4P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,Not very much alternative squares for this knight.
9,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/4P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,"The white bishop will most probably place himself to c4, so black is trying to cover all possible targets."
10,e6,e7e6,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/8/4P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"The white bishop will most probably place himself to c4, so black is trying to cover all possible targets."
11,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/8/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,White has to get agressive to show he have something for the pawn.
12,a6,a7a6,r1bqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p1n1p3/8/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"Continuing the theme of restricting the bishop. ...b5, ...Na5 and ...Nxb3 is a possible plan, trading of a piece and creating weakness to white's camp, then face the storm and win in endgame."
13,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p1n1p3/8/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 7,"The good thing in Morra as white is that he can play pretty much natural developing and attacking moves, while blacks developement is made bit awkward as the d-pawn will probably have to stay on d7 for some time, Kings Knight is hard to place to f6 due the possibility of e5.

The good thing for black is... err... the pawn. Winning chances in endgame. White is the one having all the fun for now."
14,Nge7,g8e7,r1bqkb1r/1p1pnppp/p1n1p3/8/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 8,"I decided to develop this knight to g6. Don't know if it's the best plan, but the logic is clear. Knight out of the way so the black bishop can be developed and king be tucked to safety."
15,Qe2,d1e2,r1bqkb1r/1p1pnppp/p1n1p3/8/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP2QPPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 3 8,"I'm not sure about this move in positional basis, as it's not clear yet where the queen belongs. I'd probably play 8.Be3 black has stepped out of the option of ...Ng4 and e-pawn is under no pressure."
16,Ng6,e7g6,r1bqkb1r/1p1p1ppp/p1n1p1n1/8/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP2QPPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 4 9,"Black sees that there is no obviously good squares for the dark squared bishop, so he decides to trade of white's bishop, make room for the light squared bishop and double white's pawns, trying to later prove them as weaknesses. Later in the game we'll see that altough doubled, black has no queenside pawn majority, so the doubled pawns are maybe not so weak. This is probably what white expected when playing 8.Qe2, as the queens rook may be active on his original square after eventual hxg3."
17,Be3,c1e3,r1bqkb1r/1p1p1ppp/p1n1p1n1/8/2B1P3/2N1BN2/PP2QPPP/R4RK1 b kq - 5 9,"Black sees that there is no obviously good squares for the dark squared bishop, so he decides to trade of white's bishop, make room for the light squared bishop and double white's pawns, trying to later prove them as weaknesses.
