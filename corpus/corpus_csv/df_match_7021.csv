1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Well, recently after hitting my 6 month personal best and finally breaking 1300 I decided that I was hot shit and took on more games...so now my ratting is crashing like the NSX...well OK, its not that bad.

Anyways, this was a pretty good game I had with pastordon until I started to loose focus, very frustrating."
