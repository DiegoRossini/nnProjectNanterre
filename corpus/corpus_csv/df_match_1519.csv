8,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3p4/2PP1B2/2N5/PP2PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 2 5,Black has also tried ...c6 here with an easy game.

13,e3,e2e3,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/5np1/8/2pP1B2/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/2RQKB1R b K - 0 7,I am sure Genius did not like the look of a impending ...c5 after e4. Although out of the two moves e4 is the one that is the fighting move. By playing e3 Genius settles in for a long grind.
14,Be6,c8e6,rn1q1rk1/ppp1ppbp/4bnp1/8/2pP1B2/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/2RQKB1R w K - 1 8,Develops the bishop and defends the pawn. At the same time it invites the overzealous Ng5
15,Ng5,f3g5,rn1q1rk1/ppp1ppbp/4bnp1/6N1/2pP1B2/2N1P3/PP3PPP/2RQKB1R b K - 2 8,White's most resent try with Ng5 ended in failure between Istratesu vs Lagrav. The only things and why players play it is that this move gains the bishop pair along with a mobile centre. I would have opted for Nd2 which is more in the spirit of the game.
