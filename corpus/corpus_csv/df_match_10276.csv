The Sicilian is a dynamic system which rightfully portrays Kasparov's characteristic style, a mixture of positional subtlety and ruthless aggression. Always willing to complicate, even at the cost of material, yet ever patient, always waiting for the right moment to strike. If necessary, improving his position or playing defensive, then continuing his attack when he feels he is secure."

Unbalanced openings are less drawish since they allow chances for both sides and are risky."

I personally, along with many other top GM's, use this system as my main weapon against the Najdorf. This is a strong system which consists of the same setup as the Yugoslav Attack against the Dragon. Here, the pawn is placed on f3 to prevent ng4, harassing the bishop on e3. The bishop on e2 holds the f3 pawn in order to start the pawn storm g4, h5, etc. The pawn storm  does not only serve as an attack on he Black king. White wants to eventually push to g6 and remove the pawn from f7, softening e6, a key pawn in Black's chain. Black has some good chances as well. His attack can come from any moment, and quite dangerously at that. We can safely say that the position is in some type of dynamic equality."
