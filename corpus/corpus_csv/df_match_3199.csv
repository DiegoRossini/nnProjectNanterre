Specially after losing a game with easy19 in the same tournament, in which I played very, very badly. With this game, I think I mantain the balance... blitzkov will have another chance to crush me, anyway :-)"

9.	Qg3 (threatening Bh6)		Nh5 (a standard defence)
10.	Bxh7+	Kxh7
11.	Qh3		f6 (black cannot avoid white to recover the piece)
12.	Qxh5+	h7-g8
13.	Ng6, winning. 

Or: 

9.	Qg3		Nh5
10.	Bxh7+	Kxh7
11.	Qh3		Bxe5 (say)
12.	Qxh5+	Kg8
13.	dxBe5		e7-b4
14.	o-o-o		Nc5
15.	Nb3		Ne4
16.	Rd4		Qb5 and white's attack vanishes."

The point of all my attack is to avoid a black knight to be on f6, so I can attack h7. If black exchanges now, in addition to the threat on the pinned knight, I can open the f semicolumn. Anyway, Nh5, trying a queen's exchange, fails because my bishop, after BxQe7, Nh5xQg3, hxNg3, threats the black Rook."
