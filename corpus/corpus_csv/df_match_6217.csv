1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"1.e4 ... I've played this before and done okay, I hear its popular in Russia so it must be good !?  }8-D"
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Sicilian Defense, still the first choice of Grandmasters vs 1. e4 . Perhaps it always will be!? What do you think? Can you guess, or already know why it is such a popular choice for GM's; and others too? I'll tell a few of the reasons: #1 It ""tests"" the opponent thru all phases of the Game. First is the Opening itself which has reams of theory written on every variation conceivable. The breadth and depth of this theory gives an opponent ample opportunity to err in the very opening, and still can produce improvements aor TN's (Theoretical Novelties- Basically a substantially untried move which one hopes is no worse than present theory, yet new and different. It might even be slightly inferior but produce such complexity that a well prepared player may feel it is worth playing). The Middle-Game: Here too there is plenty of room for Improvements and novelties and simply knowing or playing the variations better than the opponent. And finally the End Game comes, if the opp has not yet succumbed. And it makes for a certain type of endgame as well. It will almost certainly have ""unbalanced pawn structure"" which is considered much less drawish than balanced wings. Also many Rook or Rook + Minor piece endings will occur, giving a player of the Sicilian a chance to put extra study and experience in them to good use."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Most common by far. One might try Ne2 instead in blitz to see if the opp will stop and think. However they could play 2...e5 then keeping it a Closed Siclian. So I prefer the straight forward Nf3

5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,Possible is such as 3...e6 intending to meet a 4.dxc5 move with Qa5+ then recapture the pawn on c5. Its just different for blitzing.
