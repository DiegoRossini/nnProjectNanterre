1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,My usual.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,And it looks like we're avoiding the Sicilian tactics.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,So out comes my Four Knights approach.
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"My least favorite of the variations. It's more aggressive from Black, and I don't see it played as often- much less in a timed match."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 3,I don't want to step off the main line of the idea just yet.
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 4 4,And we transpose back. So I decide to meet my aggressor with...
7,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1B2p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 5 4,Ruy Lopez would be proud.
8,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1Bb1p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 6 5,"Discouraging O-O, as White clearly wants to do this right away."
9,Bxc6,b5c6,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2B2n2/2b1p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,So I punish it by doubling his pawns.
10,dxc6,d7c6,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2p2n2/2b1p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"This makes going after e5 harder in the immediate future, as the d2 pawn has nowhere good to go for the next bit of time."
11,Nxe5,f3e5,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2p2n2/2b1N3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"Now, for me, it's been a bit of time since my last game. Here I thought this was a perfectly well placed knight (and for some of you, you would agree, but nonetheless), and I forgot what usually happens in this line. And yet, within Black's next two moves, I would already start panicking."
12,Qd4,d8d4,r1b1k2r/ppp2ppp/2p2n2/2b1N3/3qP3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 7,"I realized that e5 was not a free pawn, right here. Threatening Qf2#"
13,Nd3,e5d3,r1b1k2r/ppp2ppp/2p2n2/2b5/3qP3/2NN4/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 7,So the knight obviously must go here.
14,Bg4,c8g4,r3k2r/ppp2ppp/2p2n2/2b5/3qP1b1/2NN4/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 3 8,"And now I felt myself freaking out. In a Sicilian varation, this is part of a Grand Prix attack where White can actually consider taking the bishop, sacrificing the queen to harass a cramped Black King and using their developed space advantage to do so. This clearly doesn't work here. If f3, I need to worry about Nxe4 for at least the two turns it takes me to get the Queen off the LSB diagonal. If Ne2, I reverse the attack on the queen, but delay my ability to defend the e4 pawn, all the while it being clear that I cannot castle kingside this match."
15,f3,f2f3,r3k2r/ppp2ppp/2p2n2/2b5/3qP1b1/2NN1P2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,"Since O-O is clearly not an option, I opt to protect virtually the only defender to the king."
16,Bh5,g4h5,r3k2r/ppp2ppp/2p2n2/2b4b/3qP3/2NN1P2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 9,Deciding against Nxe4. Perhaps he felt he attacked too soon as well.
17,Nxc5,d3c5,r3k2r/ppp2ppp/2p2n2/2N4b/3qP3/2N2P2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 9,"Maybe not the best move, but I want this level of pressure dealt with at once."
18,Qxc5,d4c5,r3k2r/ppp2ppp/2p2n2/2q4b/4P3/2N2P2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 10,Virtually forced.
19,b3,b2b3,r3k2r/ppp2ppp/2p2n2/2q4b/4P3/1PN2P2/P1PP2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 10,Planning Bb2 instead of d3/d4 (allowing the queen to pin the knight) - e4 is still in danger.
20,O-O-O,e8c8,2kr3r/ppp2ppp/2p2n2/2q4b/4P3/1PN2P2/P1PP2PP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 1 11,"I was surprised he didn't do O-O here. It would get the kingside rook closer to the action, while the King is probably safer... (even despite the next 10 or so moves that happen)"
