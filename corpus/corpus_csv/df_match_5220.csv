1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,So she plays into the Indian systems
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,I reply with my usual
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,I reply with my usual
4,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,She takes us into the Benoni systems
5,d5,d4d5,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2pP4/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,I carry on with the main line
6,e5,e7e5,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/5n2/2pPp3/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6 0 4,and now it is a Czech Benoni
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/5n2/2pPp3/2P5/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,I continue to develop
8,d6,d7d6,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3p1n2/2pPp3/2P5/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,This is still pretty standard
9,e4,e2e4,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3p1n2/2pPp3/2P1P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,She continues the normal development.
10,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/3p1n2/2pPp3/2P1P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,She continues the normal development.
11,g3,g2g3,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/3p1n2/2pPp3/2P1P3/2N3P1/PP3P1P/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,"Other moves are available instead of 6. g3, but I already had the plan of advancing f2-f4 and being able to recapture on f4 with a pawn."
12,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/3p1n2/2pPp3/2P1P3/2N3P1/PP3P1P/R1BQKBNR w KQ - 1 7,She continues to develop.
13,Bg2,f1g2,rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/3p1n2/2pPp3/2P1P3/2N3P1/PP3PBP/R1BQK1NR b KQ - 2 7,as I do too
14,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bq1rk1/pp1nbppp/3p1n2/2pPp3/2P1P3/2N3P1/PP3PBP/R1BQK1NR w KQ - 3 8,I didn't want to block f2-f4 by putting my knight on f3. I did consider the immediiate f2-f4 but I didn't like the look of her exchanging on f4 and then moving her Nf6 and playing Be7-h4 check.
15,Nge2,g1e2,r1bq1rk1/pp1nbppp/3p1n2/2pPp3/2P1P3/2N3P1/PP2NPBP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 4 8,I didn't want to block f2-f4 by putting my knight on f3. I did consider the immediiate f2-f4 but I didn't like the look of her exchanging on f4 and then moving her Nf6 and playing Be7-h4 check.
16,a6,a7a6,r1bq1rk1/1p1nbppp/p2p1n2/2pPp3/2P1P3/2N3P1/PP2NPBP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 9,This is a usual move in this system.
17,f4,f2f4,r1bq1rk1/1p1nbppp/p2p1n2/2pPp3/2P1PP2/2N3P1/PP2N1BP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 9,This may be premature. 0-0 first is probably better.
18,exf4,e5f4,r1bq1rk1/1p1nbppp/p2p1n2/2pP4/2P1Pp2/2N3P1/PP2N1BP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 10,So she takes.
19,gxf4,g3f4,r1bq1rk1/1p1nbppp/p2p1n2/2pP4/2P1PP2/2N5/PP2N1BP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 10,"I didn't want to give her a lovely e5 square for her knights, which she would have got if I had recaptured any other way on f4."
20,Nb6,d7b6,r1bq1rk1/1p2bppp/pn1p1n2/2pP4/2P1PP2/2N5/PP2N1BP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 1 11,I was happy to face this move. Now her b7-b5 advance is hindered.
21,Qd3,d1d3,r1bq1rk1/1p2bppp/pn1p1n2/2pP4/2P1PP2/2NQ4/PP2N1BP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 2 11,"I have to defend c4 of course, and I felt this was the best way to do that."
22,Ng4,f6g4,r1bq1rk1/1p2bppp/pn1p4/2pP4/2P1PPn1/2NQ4/PP2N1BP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 3 12,So she opens up a diagonal for her bishop.
23,Ng3,e2g3,r1bq1rk1/1p2bppp/pn1p4/2pP4/2P1PPn1/2NQ2N1/PP4BP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 4 12,I decide to block the diagonal. 0-0 was better.
