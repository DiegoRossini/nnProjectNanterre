1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game was part of a Caro-Kann thematic mini, in which (in all my games as white) I practised the aggressive Advance Variation. In this particular game my opponent played the opening well, and I had to sacrifice two pawns to get an attack going. This led to some tactical complications,   eventually transposing to a winning endgame."
