1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Undeterred by recent experiences, I persevered with an Indian defence, though which flavour I hadn't yet decided."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"Undeterred by recent experiences, I persevered with an Indian defence, though which flavour I hadn't yet decided."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"First decision point: I decided to stay on familiar ground, even though I'm now convinced that the Nimzo-Indian is a much sounder defence.  As yet, I'm not sufficiently familiar with the Queen's Indian and Bogo-Indian to risk ending up in one of those, so I stuck with the King's Indian."
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"First decision point: I decided to stay on familiar ground, even though I'm now convinced that the Nimzo-Indian is a much sounder defence.  As yet, I'm not sufficiently familiar with the Queen's Indian and Bogo-Indian to risk ending up in one of those, so I stuck with the King's Indian."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,The next decision point: I could have gone for the Grunfeld with 3...d5 but I only really know one line of that and it doesn't usually work out for me to well.
6,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,The next decision point: I could have gone for the Grunfeld with 3...d5 but I only really know one line of that and it doesn't usually work out for me to well.
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 4,"An unusual move, indicating that White is probably avoiding the well-trodden lines after 4. e4."
8,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 4 5,"Since White had not yet played e4, I decided that I could defer the decision on how to structure my pawns and castled immediately, expecting White to reply with 5. Bg5."
9,Bg5,c1g5,rnbq1rk1/ppppppbp/5np1/6B1/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 5 5,I felt quite smug seeing this.  It's not often I can accurately predict my opponent's moves!
10,h6,h7h6,rnbq1rk1/ppppppb1/5npp/6B1/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 6,"I'm usually suspicious of playing ...h6 to push a bishop away, since the pawn can become a target after Be3 and Qd2; but in this position I felt that I should put the question to the B while my N was still unpinned, planning to defend the h-pawn with my King if necessary."
11,Bh4,g5h4,rnbq1rk1/ppppppb1/5npp/8/2PP3B/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 1 6,"The first surprise and quite a pleasant one: the h6 pawn is unlikely now to become a target.  On the other hand, the B is still aimed at my Q, so I need to be careful how and when I move my e-pawn and Nf6."
12,d6,d7d6,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppb1/3p1npp/8/2PP3B/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 7,"The standard KID move, preparing either ...c5 or ...e5"
13,e3,e2e3,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppb1/3p1npp/8/2PP3B/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 7,As predicted.
14,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bq1rk1/pppnppb1/3p1npp/8/2PP3B/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 1 8,"?! Played after some thought but probably wrong.  In the KID, Black is usually OK playing ...e5 without fully supporting it but not in this position with the B on h4.  Thus the motivation was to support ...e5 with this N.  I didn't want to develop it to the more aggressive-looking c6 because it could be immediately pushed away with d5.  Now, in many variations of the KID, Black tries hard to provoke White into that advance, solidifying the centre so that Black can work around the edges, but I couldn't see a suitable home for the N after 7...Nc6 8. e5.  Black's other possible N development is via a6, which again doesn't directly support ...e5 but does lay claim to b4 and c5, while leaving Black's lsb scope for development.  In this game, my lsb doesn't get to move till move 18, something that preyed on my mind throughout the intervening period.  I could have deferred decisions on the N's development by making a pawn move such as ...c6 or ...c5, ...b6 or ...a6 or ...a5.  7...g5 was considered briefly but I felt it was too risky: White could swap B or N for 2 pawns and then use the half-open files to launch a withering attack on my K."
15,Qc2,d1c2,r1bq1rk1/pppnppb1/3p1npp/8/2PP3B/2N1PN2/PPQ2PPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 2 8,"A sensible move, possibly preparing 0-0-0, possibly just Rd1.  With the Black N on d7, there is no risk of it coming soon to b4 to harrass the Q."
16,c6,c7c6,r1bq1rk1/pp1nppb1/2pp1npp/8/2PP3B/2N1PN2/PPQ2PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 0 9,"With White's pawn still on d4, his N could still occupy d5.  I'd seen in my game against Paxton-Doggett how devastating that could be, so I decided to prevent it while I still had time to, especially if I managed to get ...e5 in."
17,Be2,f1e2,r1bq1rk1/pp1nppb1/2pp1npp/8/2PP3B/2N1PN2/PPQ1BPPP/R3K2R b KQ - 1 9,"White is playing simple, flexible developing moves.  I'd expected 9. 0-0-0 or 9. Bd3, targeting the weakened g6 pawn, but this looks perfectly sensible and prepares 0-0 as well."
18,Qe8,d8e8,r1b1qrk1/pp1nppb1/2pp1npp/8/2PP3B/2N1PN2/PPQ1BPPP/R3K2R w KQ - 2 10,"I decided to get the Q off the d8-h4 diagonal before launching the e-pawn.  The main drawback that I could see was that, after 0-0, White could oppose the Q with Re1, making it risky to advance the e-pawn and provoke multiple exchanges."
19,O-O,e1g1,r1b1qrk1/pp1nppb1/2pp1npp/8/2PP3B/2N1PN2/PPQ1BPPP/R4RK1 b - - 3 10,"After all that preparation, I finally play the thematic advance."
20,e5,e7e5,r1b1qrk1/pp1n1pb1/2pp1npp/4p3/2PP3B/2N1PN2/PPQ1BPPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 11,"After all that preparation, I finally play the thematic advance."
21,Rad1,a1d1,r1b1qrk1/pp1n1pb1/2pp1npp/4p3/2PP3B/2N1PN2/PPQ1BPPP/3R1RK1 b - - 1 11,!  I found the long-term threats posed by the Rook very troubling.  White gained about ten minutes clock time on me around here.
22,a6,a7a6,r1b1qrk1/1p1n1pb1/p1pp1npp/4p3/2PP3B/2N1PN2/PPQ1BPPP/3R1RK1 w - - 0 12,"Played in anticipation of needing to advance the c-pawn and not wanting to allow Nb5, attacking the then-undefended d6 pawn."
23,dxe5,d4e5,r1b1qrk1/1p1n1pb1/p1pp1npp/4P3/2P4B/2N1PN2/PPQ1BPPP/3R1RK1 b - - 0 12,"But White's response makes that concern irrelevant, as the d-pawn now becomes the e-pawn, leaving a raking open file for White's rook."
24,dxe5,d6e5,r1b1qrk1/1p1n1pb1/p1p2npp/4p3/2P4B/2N1PN2/PPQ1BPPP/3R1RK1 w - - 0 13,"White prevents the pawn's further advance and possibly prepares an advance by his f-pawn.  I could also see that the N was probably aiming to go via e4 to d6, which looked like a nuisance but I felt I could live with it."
25,Nd2,f3d2,r1b1qrk1/1p1n1pb1/p1p2npp/4p3/2P4B/2N1P3/PPQNBPPP/3R1RK1 b - - 1 13,"White prevents the pawn's further advance and possibly prepares an advance by his f-pawn.
