1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Further to my earlier game, I was given the opportunity to co-ordinate a successful mating attack against a kingside castling position.  Funnily enough, Glenda ended up being a mere spectator in this game, but the minor pieces managed to get together and co-ordinate a successful mating attack.  Here is how it happened.  We start off with the Ruy Lopez, an opening I normally play in a double king pawn opening should black's second move be Nc6."
