1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Gotta love king pawn opening, it opens up two positional promotion routes for the queen and bishop."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Copycat...
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Maintaining the tempo, and making the opponent respond to my move"
4,f6,f7f6,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,Classic black defence.
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"Queen pawn follow up allows for the removal of the e5 pawn, via a pawn for pawn trade"
6,Bd6,f8d6,rnbqk1nr/pppp2pp/3b1p2/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,Bishop maintains the tension in the middle four squares
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk1nr/pppp2pp/3b1p2/4p3/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,"Classic attack, the knight allows for a wide variation of attacks"
8,c5,c7c5,rnbqk1nr/pp1p2pp/3b1p2/2p1p3/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Black is directly challenging the centre four squares but is at a disadvantage, the pawns only attack the black squares and there are limited follow on options with blacks setup"
9,dxc5,d4c5,rnbqk1nr/pp1p2pp/3b1p2/2P1p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,Pawn takes pawn to attack the bishop with both the pawn and the queen.
10,Bxc5,d6c5,rnbqk1nr/pp1p2pp/5p2/2b1p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,Bishop makes only obvious move. Opens black up to a structural weakness as no pawns can threaten d5
11,Nd5,c3d5,rnbqk1nr/pp1p2pp/5p2/2bNp3/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,Knight promotion to d5 results in a long term structural problem for black.
12,Qa5+,d8a5,rnb1k1nr/pp1p2pp/5p2/q1bNp3/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 7,"A wasted move, that allows for the promotion of my bishop to directly threaten the queen, causing a temporal advantage"
13,Bd2,c1d2,rnb1k1nr/pp1p2pp/5p2/q1bNp3/4P3/5N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 3 7,Black is now completely reactive
14,Qa4,a5a4,rnb1k1nr/pp1p2pp/5p2/2bNp3/q3P3/5N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 4 8,"This move surprised me. As a result the d5 knight has a choice, push forward for the fork or withdraw to c3 to threaten the queen and protect the e4 pawn and king."
15,Nc3,d5c3,rnb1k1nr/pp1p2pp/5p2/2b1p3/q3P3/2N2N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 5 8,DEFENCE DEFENCE DEFENCE... Structural defence to protect my centre and left side (a side)
16,Qc6,a4c6,rnb1k1nr/pp1p2pp/2q2p2/2b1p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 6 9,"Queen withdraws, maintaining attack on e4, but with the pawn on e6 this is a non event threat, if black's next move was pawn to f5 it would change the tempo of the game. It would cause the re-direction of effort from aiming at the A side to aiming at the more vulnerable H side, kings weak side."
17,Bd3,f1d3,rnb1k1nr/pp1p2pp/2q2p2/2b1p3/4P3/2NB1N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 7 9,Bishop promotion combines the queen thru to bishop synergies. Allows for king side castle and protect f2 with the king and rook.
18,b5,b7b5,rnb1k1nr/p2p2pp/2q2p2/1pb1p3/4P3/2NB1N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 10,I don't see the point of this move.... It doesn't allow for new lines of attack or threaten me to require a response. This in context with the ability to castle king side means minimal effect
19,Nd5,c3d5,rnb1k1nr/p2p2pp/2q2p2/1pbNp3/4P3/3B1N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 10,"Returning knight to d5, limits movement of black and reopens the c7 fork. Need to wait for pawn push to d6, this enables queen to e2. To drive a pin from b5 through the queen onto the king."
20,a6,a7a6,rnb1k1nr/3p2pp/p1q2p2/1pbNp3/4P3/3B1N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 11,"The possible pin is mitigated by the pawn to a6, bishop to b4 threatens the black c5 bishop, while being covered by the d5 knight. Three obvious moves 1- black Bishop takes the b4 bishop 2- the a pawn is moved forward to move the white bishop 3 - d pawn move to support the black bishop"
