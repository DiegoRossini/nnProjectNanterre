1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone, I would like to tell you about my best ever Chess Congress.  I played in the U1400 section in the Bury St Edmunds Congress, England.  There were 5 rounds and these lasted two days.  As it was well within driving distance I did not have an overnight stay in Bury.  This is the first of the five games.  Hope you enjoy.  Joanne"
