1,b3,b2b3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This move is the common opening move in the Nimzo-Larsen Attack, although white can also start with Nf3. The alternate move Nf3 prevents black from moving e5, which is black's strongest response to b3."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Black is eager to take control of the center.
3,Bb2,c1b2,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/1P6/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"The bishop is preparing for fianchetto, already with significant pressure on the central e5 pawn. Interesting to note that the DSB and the e5 pawn are locked in tension for much of the game."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/8/1P6/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,"Black responds with a typical knight development move, defending the pawn and staking claim on the dark central squares."
5,e3,e2e3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/8/1P2P3/PBPP1PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"There are multiple variations after Nc6. Common ones include: c4, e5, Nf3, and g3 among the most popular (not in any particular order). The move 3. e3 opens the LSB line while leaving the option for d4 keeping the opponent guessing. Having the luxury of game study, I think White here is interested in increasing the LSB's scope."
6,d5,d7d5,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/3pp3/8/1P2P3/PBPP1PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Black moves in to claim more territory in the center. However, this leaves the knight on c6 susceptible to pin."
7,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/1B1pp3/8/1P2P3/PBPP1PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 1 4,White takes advantage of the weakness. This move simultaneously attacks the knight and the e5 pawn.
8,Bd6,f8d6,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2nb4/1B1pp3/8/1P2P3/PBPP1PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 2 5,Black's DSB is forced to protect the pawn.
9,f4,f2f4,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2nb4/1B1pp3/5P2/1P2P3/PBPP2PP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,White continues the central pressure adding another attacker to the e5 assault.
10,Qe7,d8e7,r1b1k1nr/ppp1qppp/2nb4/1B1pp3/5P2/1P2P3/PBPP2PP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 1 6,"Black adds the queen to the defense. One might wonder why not f6? If black 5... f6 first, the black flank is open to a quick 6. Qh5+. This move is easily countered by g6, however, the kingside pawn damage is done inhibiting a successful castle."
11,Nf3,g1f3,r1b1k1nr/ppp1qppp/2nb4/1B1pp3/5P2/1P2PN2/PBPP2PP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 2 6,"White brings in more pressure to the e5. The flank attack is building now applying significant central pressure. However, white now has now limited his queen's scope a bit."
12,f6,f7f6,r1b1k1nr/ppp1q1pp/2nb1p2/1B1pp3/5P2/1P2PN2/PBPP2PP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 7,Now white can now add the f6 pawn defender without fear of the Qh5+ threat.
13,Nc3,b1c3,r1b1k1nr/ppp1q1pp/2nb1p2/1B1pp3/5P2/1PN1PN2/PBPP2PP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 7,"White brings his other knight into play. While this reduces the scope of the DSB, it is a natural development move. This sometimes provides white the possibility of a discovered attack on the black king side rook, although that does not occur in this game."
14,Be6,c8e6,r3k1nr/ppp1q1pp/2nbbp2/1B1pp3/5P2/1PN1PN2/PBPP2PP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 8,"Black develops the LSB, defending the d5 pawn."
15,O-O,e1g1,r3k1nr/ppp1q1pp/2nbbp2/1B1pp3/5P2/1PN1PN2/PBPP2PP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 3 8,White uses this opportunity to castle bringing the rook into play. Preparing for the eventual e file action.
16,Nh6,g8h6,r3k2r/ppp1q1pp/2nbbp1n/1B1pp3/5P2/1PN1PN2/PBPP2PP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 4 9,Black moves to castle king side now. I do not see any other value in this move.
17,fxe5,f4e5,r3k2r/ppp1q1pp/2nbbp1n/1B1pP3/8/1PN1PN2/PBPP2PP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 9,White begins the central attack sequence.
18,fxe5,f6e5,r3k2r/ppp1q1pp/2nbb2n/1B1pp3/8/1PN1PN2/PBPP2PP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 10,Exchange.
19,e4,e3e4,r3k2r/ppp1q1pp/2nbb2n/1B1pp3/4P3/1PN2N2/PBPP2PP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 10,White now moves in to break up the central structure.
20,dxe4,d5e4,r3k2r/ppp1q1pp/2nbb2n/1B2p3/4p3/1PN2N2/PBPP2PP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 11,"Black counterattacks and threatens the knight. Black might have alternatively moved d4, threatening the other knight. However, this results in the black king side weakening further when white moves Nd5 and attacks the queen. I'm not sure which is the better move. I would personally not have created the isolated pawn, but that's probably my personal fear at work. The isolated pawn will require constant defense attention from this point until its off the board."
