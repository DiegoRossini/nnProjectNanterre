1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is a quite short game I played recently. I want to test you to solve some intersting and basic positional and tactical ideas.
Take it as a quiz. 
First of all, open the java window, so that you can see the flow of the game with my comments on the bottom. Flip the board, as you will be playing the black side.
Then, cover with a sheet the part of the screen with the moves. Don't look at the moves.
From time to time you will be asked to find a move on your own. When you read ""IT'S YOUR TURN"" you'll have to decide what move to make. MAKE SURE to have a plan behind the move you want to make, or to have the CORRECT tactical idea, otherwise IT'S LIKE YOU DID NOT ANSWER CORRECTLY. The first moves are theoretical and there will be no questions. Anyway, try to figure out what's going on.
There are 10 points available in total (some questions give 2 points or more, others give 1 point). At the end, tell me your score!
I think that players above 1800 should have few problems in analysing this game, but for those under 1500/1600 might be interesting.
Good luck and enjoy!"

The fact is that there was a fight for the d4 square. If white managed to take control of that square, he will probably be able to complete smoothly his development. Moreover, the pawn on d5 was a negative factor for Black, because his pieces didn't have space enough. After that pawn disappears, the scope of the Rd8, the Bd7 and the Ne7 will be greatly increased. So many good things for just one pawn! Think Dynamic!

Add 2 more points if you also had in mind the following plan: exchange as many minor pieces as possible. In few moves we will see why."

Attacking the Queen this way, Black exchanges the last minor piece, and he will finally GET the INITIATIVE because of his powerful and active Rooks against an uncastled king and those poor undeveloped Rooks. Moreover, white now cannot take in a7 because of 19...Qc3 .
Not 18...Kb8? 19.Qd6!
Nor 18...Bc6 19. Qxa7! are good.
IMPORTANT: As you can see, Black is exchanging pieces even if is is down in material. You have probably been taught that when you have a material advange you should try to reach the endgame. BE CAREFUL with this approach! Don't always look for exchange of pieces when you are up with material. Instead, try to understand what is best to do in that situation! Sometimes it is necessary to fight with great determination even with a pawn up or two, because the player down in material may have some sort of dynamic compensation. In this case, for example, the more developed white pieces disappear, the bigger will be the difference in development between black and white."
