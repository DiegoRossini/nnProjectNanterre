1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Welcome to day two of the Space City Open. After a night of tequila, a lumpy hotel mattress, and a roomate whose snores can be heard from space, I am sufficiently hung over, sore, and tired enough for some more chess. I enter the tourney room, and immediately check out the wall chart. I'm struck by two interesting facts - one, I have the black pieces yet again (I had figured on playing white in round 4), and two, my opponent is yet another kid of about 12. Believe me when I say I really want to win this game - for two reasons. The obvious - I need the full point to have any chance to cash; the other reason is that this kid yesterday exhibited some of the worse sportsmanship I've ever seen at a chess tournament. Some of the things that came out of this kids mouth were just shameful - especially comments directed towards opponents he had beaten (he was 2/3 entering round 4). I won't go into specifics, but suffice it to say that every player in the Reserve section was rooting for me. This kid needed to be put down hard, and I was just ornery enough on this morning to do it. He drops a rook early, and I tell myself that if given the opportunity I will give him a taste of his own medicine. Call me insensitive - or a bad guy - if you like, but circumstances dictated that I crush him to teach him a lesson. While I take no real pride in the quality of the game, it was satisfying to put him in his place. White opens with 1. e4."
