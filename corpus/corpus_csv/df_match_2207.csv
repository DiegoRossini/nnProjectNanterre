The play was greatly affected by the tournament situation. Lasker was involved in a big battle with Capablanca for overall tournament victory. After a slow start, Lasker had found himself trailing the Cuban significantly, and in order to have any chance of catching him, he needed to win practically every game in the second half of the event. In the present game, he had therefore played in his typically provocative style, spurning straightforward equality in favour of stirring up complications, in the hope thereby of obtaining chances to outplay his opponent. We join the game just at the moment where Lasker's tactics have paid off, as White's last was a serious mistake which costs the exchange. However, that is only the start of the interest."
