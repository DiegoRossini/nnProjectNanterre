1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Nothing special here. e4: the most common opening for white.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Petrov's defense. Not too many people understand this opening, but I have used it on several occasions, and see scenarios where it works and situations where it doesn't. One thing I am confused, do most games end up in a draw with this opening or is there an advantage to one color and why?"

5,Qe2,d1e2,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPPQPPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 3 3,? - Not the response I was expecting. It traps the bishop and seems to hinder development just to protect the center e4 pawn.
6,d6,d7d6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPPQPPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"My general response to the protection of e4. In this case, my c8 bishop is free to roam and attack or defend white. I know black bishop is cut off, but I usually don't mind this, as the game usually develops into a situation in which this bishop becomes very useful."
7,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP1QPPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"?! - Seems like a move late, but still serves the purpose of attacking the center. Seems this would be more powerful at 3. d4!?"
8,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/3p1n2/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP1QPPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 1 5,Simple. I am just doing textbook strategy. The white bishop is still not developed so it seems as if I am ahead. Wonder if I castle too early or is the main goal here to get the king into a protected position by castling this early? Any feedback here would be appreciated.
9,h3,h2h3,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/3p1n2/4p3/3PP3/5N1P/PPP1QPP1/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"Blocks 5. ... Bg4, but development of the c2-bishop is still quite bad."

12,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bq1rk1/pppnbppp/3p1n2/4p1B1/3PP3/5N1P/PPP1QPP1/RN2KB1R w KQ - 3 7,Because I don't want to trade here right away. I want white to play aggressively. It benefits me. I can set up successful counters without much retribution from white. (Even though I do block in my queen.)
13,c4,c2c4,r1bq1rk1/pppnbppp/3p1n2/4p1B1/2PPP3/5N1P/PP2QPP1/RN2KB1R b KQ - 0 7,"? - Transposing to a three pawn attack? Break my chain? Not exactly what I expected white to do, although it is a pretty aggressive approach. Let's see where it leads..."

21,Nd2,b1d2,r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/8/4p1b1/2P1Q3/7P/PP1N1PP1/R3KB1R b KQ - 1 11,?? - FATAL miscalculation. Perhaps thinking of queen-side castle to try and regain central position? White is way too open to even think of trying this. 11. Bd3 to allow the king to reenter a closed protected area by castling kingside. This BAD miscalculation costs black dearly.
