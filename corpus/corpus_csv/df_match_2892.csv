1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I'm publishing this blitz game and annotation both to show an interesting opening and middle game, as well as hoping to learn from the mistakes that I made.
There was an early transposition in my opening, and a really unorthodox and risky opening for black. I took the center and almost came off with a pretty big advantage due to black's opening of both his kingside and queenside and lack of development, however I messed it up and soon onward the rest of the game favored black with some blunders on my part.
Constructive comments are welcome on this game."
