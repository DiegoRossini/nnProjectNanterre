6,Bb4+,f8b4,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/1bPP4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"The pressing line, which have some risks for both players."
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/1bPP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 4,"Ne4, Bd2, and all I get is Nxlsb... not bad, but not very much. And e5 is hanging. If Nc6, d5, so..."
8,exd4,e5d4,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/8/1bPp4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"If Qx, I win a tempo with Nc6."
9,exd4,e3d4,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,Pressing on c3.
10,Ne4,f6e4,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/8/8/1bPPn3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,Pressing on c3.
11,Qc2,d1c2,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/8/8/1bPPn3/2N5/PPQ2PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 2 6,"Qe7 begs to be played, but Be3 solves white's problems and I can't avoid it. Here, a brave option is f5, but I was playing against a 1600, you know... he has no developement, but my K is naked."
12,Nxc3,e4c3,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/8/8/1bPP4/2n5/PPQ2PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 0 7,Throwing away one of my advantages.
13,bxc3,b2c3,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/8/8/1bPP4/2P5/P1Q2PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 0 7,Now I didn't realize the problem I'll be in with my lsb.
14,Qe7+,d8e7,rnb1k2r/ppppqppp/8/8/1bPP4/2P5/P1Q2PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 1 8,"As said, I can't avoid this one. Now: where do I put my lsb, after Qa5?"
15,Be3,c1e3,rnb1k2r/ppppqppp/8/8/1bPP4/2P1B3/P1Q2PPP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 2 8,"As said, I can't avoid this one. Now: where do I put my lsb, after Qa5?"
16,Bd6,b4d6,rnb1k2r/ppppqppp/3b4/8/2PP4/2P1B3/P1Q2PPP/R3KBNR w KQkq - 3 9,"This ugly  move because if o-o-o, c5 - only way to save the B and let Nb8 a square to develop in."
17,Bd3,f1d3,rnb1k2r/ppppqppp/3b4/8/2PP4/2PBB3/P1Q2PPP/R3K1NR b KQkq - 4 9,"As expected, it was played authomatically, without thinking..."
18,Bf4,d6f4,rnb1k2r/ppppqppp/8/8/2PP1b2/2PBB3/P1Q2PPP/R3K1NR w KQkq - 5 10,"...on this one. White has to defend again, Qe2, and I can exchange at will, holding a decent position despite the white's pawns."
19,Nf3,g1f3,rnb1k2r/ppppqppp/8/8/2PP1b2/2PBBN2/P1Q2PPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 6 10,Does he want to revenge against h7? I'd be a bad bargain!
20,Bxe3,f4e3,rnb1k2r/ppppqppp/8/8/2PP4/2PBbN2/P1Q2PPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 11,"Much better was to take with the K, connecting R at once, and keeping the B on the good square. Now I would have needed much more time to study my developement. I got to be the undeveloped one... for a single pawn."
21,fxe3,f2e3,rnb1k2r/ppppqppp/8/8/2PP4/2PBPN2/P1Q3PP/R3K2R b KQkq - 0 11,"Much better was to take with the K, connecting R at once, and keeping the B on the good square. Now I would have needed much more time to study my developement. I got to be the undeveloped one... for a single pawn."
22,Qxe3+,e7e3,rnb1k2r/pppp1ppp/8/8/2PP4/2PBqN2/P1Q3PP/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 12,"Much better was to take with the K, connecting R at once, and keeping the B on the good square. Now I would have needed much more time to study my developement. I got to be the undeveloped one... for a single pawn."
23,Qe2,c2e2,rnb1k2r/pppp1ppp/8/8/2PP4/2PBqN2/P3Q1PP/R3K2R b KQkq - 1 12,"Much better was to take with the K, connecting R at once, and keeping the B on the good square. Now I would have needed much more time to study my developement. I got to be the undeveloped one... for a single pawn."

26,d6,d7d6,rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/2PP4/2P2N2/P3B1PP/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 14,"Thank you white, you gave me very important tempoes. Still, the best move here was castling. White has Bh5+, which is not dangerous now because of g6, but later on, it will make f6 weak. So I should have defended starting by castling instead."
27,Ng5,f3g5,rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/3p4/6N1/2PP4/2P5/P3B1PP/R3K2R b KQkq - 1 14,"Thank you white, you gave me very important tempoes. Still, the best move here was castling.

White has Bh5+, which is not dangerous now because of g6, but later on, it will make f6 weak. So I should have defended starting by castling instead."
29,Ne4,g5e4,rnb1k2r/ppp3pp/3p1p2/8/2PPN3/2P5/P3B1PP/R3K2R b KQkq - 1 15,Now Bf5 was called for.
30,Kf7,e8f7,rnb4r/ppp2kpp/3p1p2/8/2PPN3/2P5/P3B1PP/R3K2R w KQ - 2 16,?
31,O-O,e1g1,rnb4r/ppp2kpp/3p1p2/8/2PPN3/2P5/P3B1PP/R4RK1 b - - 3 16,"...and now I am threatened of Bh5+, and still I played, foolishly..."
32,Re8,h8e8,rnb1r3/ppp2kpp/3p1p2/8/2PPN3/2P5/P3B1PP/R4RK1 w - - 4 17,"Now. It seems a losing move, because of Bh5+, and after g6, Rxf6+. But, after Kg7, what does white have other than two threatened pieces? So I realized what was a mistake had its tricky side. Now, what about Nxc6 instead, threatening the R? I could have well taken the B in h5 and if NxR, KxN and I have two pieces (and ugly pawns) against a R. Another game..."
33,Bd3,e2d3,rnb1r3/ppp2kpp/3p1p2/8/2PPN3/2PB4/P5PP/R4RK1 b - - 5 17,"? I understand he wants to defend, and maybe feared the complications. Now, both players have made positional mistakes, but surely my position is worse, and a pawn doesn't compensate, unless I can survive the storm. Now, this move is played to avoid Kg6 after Ng5+. It would lead my K to the first row, and h7 will fall... as everything. So I have to be ""creative""."
