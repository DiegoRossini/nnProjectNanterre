1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Here is another annotation in the themed Sicilian Pelikan MT.  Although this is certainly not one of my best games, I thought I would annotate it to give you guys a bit of light relief.  Life, is about taking the rough with the smooth, both on and off the chessboard.  I certainly ended up doing this in this game.  I will begin the commentary with my 7th move as the first 6 moves are forced.  You can also follow the game with gameknot analysis as follows:-http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17599933&rnd=0.24172412757283301"
