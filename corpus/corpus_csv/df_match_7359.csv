I choose to annotate this one as it was my first game as white in the tournament, and a very enjoyable game, not least for the forced mate-in-8 at the end. Again, starting at move 7."

As black, I play to exchange in an attempt to make my material advantage count more as the game goes on, therefore as white I'd rather avoid exchanges. As white, It seems I need to find a balance between developing my pieces whilst trying to keep black restricted at the same time."

It'll give the d-pawn some protection, remove his DSB (my king is on a black square, and would remain so if I castled.), half open the b-file for my rook (opposite his king), and give a1-h8 diagonal options for my DSB. Only downside is I can't pick off the d-pawn, but I'm happy for that to stay there - it blocks his rook from my king."

If the b8 knight comes out to a6 then it has nowhere else to go from there.
