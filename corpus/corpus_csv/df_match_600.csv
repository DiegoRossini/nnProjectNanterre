1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The title of the game  ""Who needs a queen"" .  I was not sure who was going to lose a queen but I would soon find out. 

White opened with Kings pawn to e4."
2,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I decided to play using the Dutch defence.  I was intending to move my g knight out to f6.
3,Qh5+,d1h5,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p1Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 1 2,White moved his queen down to check my king at h5.
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/ppppp2p/6p1/5p1Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 0 3,I stopped the check by moving my g pawn to block the queen and protect my f pawn.
5,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqkbnr/ppppp2p/6p1/5p1Q/4P3/3B4/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 1 3,White developed his LB out to d3.
6,gxh5,g6h5,rnbqkbnr/ppppp2p/8/5p1p/4P3/3B4/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 0 4,I took the queen with my g pawn.  Now I found out who was going to lose their queen.  However this has given me doubled pawns on my h file which obviously means I cannot safely cast on the king side.  I don't think I would have chosen to take the queen in this position but if I get a chance to take a queen then I would mostly likely do so.
7,exf5,e4f5,rnbqkbnr/ppppp2p/8/5P1p/8/3B4/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 0 4,Now white takes the pawn I was offering at the start which provides a place for my knight to reside and stops the pawns advance.
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppppp2p/5n2/5P1p/8/3B4/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 1 5,Now white takes the pawn I was offering at the start which provides a place for my knight to reside and stops the pawns advance.
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/ppppp2p/5n2/5P1p/8/3B1N2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 2 5,White develops his knight to f3 and prepares to castle.
10,d6,d7d6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1p2p/3p1n2/5P1p/8/3B1N2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 6,I move my pawn to d6 and this allows my LB to be pointed at white's pawn on f5 and stops f3 knight from moving onto e5.
11,O-O,e1g1,rnbqkb1r/ppp1p2p/3p1n2/5P1p/8/3B1N2/PPPP1PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 1 6,White castles.  White looks likely to move his rook onto the e file which only has my undeveloped e7 pawn and the king still on his spot.
12,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp2p2p/3p1n2/2p2P1p/8/3B1N2/PPPP1PPP/RNB2RK1 w kq - 0 7,I continue to add to my pawn chain with the move c5.  I wonder if e5 would have been a better move as it would stop white from using the e6 square to place his pieces and limit my scope for attack.
13,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp2p2p/3p1n2/2p2P1p/8/2NB1N2/PPPP1PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 1 7,White develops his b knight to c3.  White's bishop is looking happy with itself as it is currently at d3 and has access to 2 diagonals to a6 and h7.
14,Bxf5,c8f5,rn1qkb1r/pp2p2p/3p1n2/2p2b1p/8/2NB1N2/PPPP1PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 0 8,For some reason I now decide to capture the pawn at f5 and in consequence lose my LB to white.
15,Bxf5,d3f5,rn1qkb1r/pp2p2p/3p1n2/2p2B1p/8/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 0 8,White captures my LB.  Actually this may be fair in the circumstances since white gave me his queen its only fair I give him something back.  But there is nothing for the LB to attack so this may be returning to its previous good position but I suppose its here so it might as well stay and cause me difficulties in moving my pieces out.
16,Rg8,h8g8,rn1qkbr1/pp2p2p/3p1n2/2p2B1p/8/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1B2RK1 w q - 1 9,I move my rook out to the half open g file as my doubled pawns are both protected by the knight at f6.
17,d3,d2d3,rn1qkbr1/pp2p2p/3p1n2/2p2B1p/8/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b q - 0 9,White moves his d pawn to d3 to allow his DB access to the diagonal to h6.
18,Nc6,b8c6,r2qkbr1/pp2p2p/2np1n2/2p2B1p/8/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w q - 1 10,I develop my b knight to c6 trying to get my pieces out on the queen side so I can long castle.
19,Be6,f5e6,r2qkbr1/pp2p2p/2npBn2/2p4p/8/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b q - 2 10,Now that pesky LB moves to the spot which I in future will try to fill with my own pieces before my opponent gets in them.  He is now pointed at my rook on g8.
20,Rg7,g8g7,r2qkb2/pp2p1rp/2npBn2/2p4p/8/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w q - 3 11,So I bring my rook out to g7 as there is nothing for me to attack at present and white has some squares on the g file protected.
21,h3,h2h3,r2qkb2/pp2p1rp/2npBn2/2p4p/8/2NP1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1B2RK1 b q - 0 11,White pushes the h pawn out to h3.  This stops my f knight from landing on g4 plus the e6 bishop is also protecting this square.
