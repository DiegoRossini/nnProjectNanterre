1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,White's queen pawn opening was met with black Kingside knight. With a potentially varied opening leading to many lines I enjoy to play.

4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,White's queen pawn opening was met with black Kingside knight. With a potentially varied opening leading to many lines I enjoy to play.
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"I decided to encourage the opening away from my favoured Nimzo-indian defence so I could explore a lesser played line, the Bogo-Indian defense."
6,b6,b7b6,rnbqkb1r/p1pp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,With pawn to Queen's Knight 3 it seems Black had other plans and I settled into a relatively straight forward Queen's Indian.
7,a3,a2a3,rnbqkb1r/p1pp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2PP4/P4N2/1P2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,Liking the more active queen-side play in opening I decided to take the game into the Petrosian System. This avoids many problem early on with black pinning the queen-side knight.
8,Ba6,c8a6,rn1qkb1r/p1pp1ppp/bp2pn2/8/2PP4/P4N2/1P2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,I had a little suprise from black - having expected the completion of the fianchetto on the queen-side I took some time to explore this position.
9,Qc2,d1c2,rn1qkb1r/p1pp1ppp/bp2pn2/8/2PP4/P4N2/1PQ1PPPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 2 5,With only three columns describing Ba6 in Batsford's I concluded that the best move was to use my queen early to cover black's early queen-side attack.
10,c5,c7c5,rn1qkb1r/p2p1ppp/bp2pn2/2p5/2PP4/P4N2/1PQ1PPPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Black's c5 was a direct challenge, seeking to break up white's developing central superiority of the centre."
11,d5,d4d5,rn1qkb1r/p2p1ppp/bp2pn2/2pP4/2P5/P4N2/1PQ1PPPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 6,I carefully checked ahead playing out the next few moves. The exchange looked to be a little more dangerous to me so I decided to see if black would miss a trick.
12,exd5,e6d5,rn1qkb1r/p2p1ppp/bp3n2/2pp4/2P5/P4N2/1PQ1PPPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 7,As expected black went for the exchange.
13,cxd5,c4d5,rn1qkb1r/p2p1ppp/bp3n2/2pP4/8/P4N2/1PQ1PPPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"White responded, now would black attempt to steal the pawn?"
14,Be7,f8e7,rn1qk2r/p2pbppp/bp3n2/2pP4/8/P4N2/1PQ1PPPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 1 8,"No, black was clearly aware of the danger of Qa4  which would have won black's knight. I now had to support my advanced pawn, the main reason for taking this line was to create an advanced pawn to hamper black's play."
15,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qk2r/p2pbppp/bp3n2/2pP4/8/P1N2N2/1PQ1PPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 2 8,Pawn is now covered...
16,O-O,e8g8,rn1q1rk1/p2pbppp/bp3n2/2pP4/8/P1N2N2/1PQ1PPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ - 3 9,Black completes king-side development and white is poised to launch an attack. This position offers a great deal of possibilities with the support of the queen and Queen-side bishop along two diagonals the knights could attack black's king.
17,e4,e2e4,rn1q1rk1/p2pbppp/bp3n2/2pP4/4P3/P1N2N2/1PQ2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQ - 0 9,"I decided to build my attack at the expense of castling early, staking out the centre and supporting my advanced pawn I play e4, revealing the attack on black's queen-side bishop."
18,d6,d7d6,rn1q1rk1/p3bppp/bp1p1n2/2pP4/4P3/P1N2N2/1PQ2PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ - 0 10,Did black miss the revealed attack? Either way d6 stop's my pawn advancing to cause more problems.
19,Bxa6,f1a6,rn1q1rk1/p3bppp/Bp1p1n2/2pP4/4P3/P1N2N2/1PQ2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 0 10,I have to exchange bishops the advantage of taking out such well placed piece and side-lining black's q-side knight can't be missed.
20,Nxa6,b8a6,r2q1rk1/p3bppp/np1p1n2/2pP4/4P3/P1N2N2/1PQ2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 0 11,Black recapture's.
21,Ne2,c3e2,r2q1rk1/p3bppp/np1p1n2/2pP4/4P3/P4N2/1PQ1NPPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 1 11,I now saw a great opportunity to sow some confusion in my opponent. At this point my rooks are not available to lend support to my central pawns and I need my knights in such a position that I can cover my rooks.
22,Qd7,d8d7,r4rk1/p2qbppp/np1p1n2/2pP4/4P3/P4N2/1PQ1NPPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 2 12,Black completes development with the queen moving down to link the rooks. Not a bad move but with my central pawn's on white squares I feel black's development advantage was at the cost of being able to defend against those two central pawns.
23,Ng3,e2g3,r4rk1/p2qbppp/np1p1n2/2pP4/4P3/P4NN1/1PQ2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 3 12,Black now has three pieces pointing to my king-side. Time to mount my own defence but also line my knights up to cover my rooks in a few moves time.
