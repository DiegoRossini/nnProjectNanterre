1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Many chess games against stronger player are unpleasant because you are getting tactically outplayed.  Often one gets the sinking sensation that the game is going to be a loss; that he will ""take an L"".  I have often counted it a principle to be sporting in such games.  Ultimately chess is about a search for perfection.  One values his knowledge of the game more than he clings to the spoils of any single victory.  In this sense, since we stand to learn directly from our superiors in the game, we should be grateful, and even value the difficult positions that attend our encounters with our teachers..."
