1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Solohawk and I have played many times, and although he can play several openings, he tends to play more e4 than anything else. I used to answer e4 with Petrov's Defense, but more recently have played ...e5."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"There is a good chance we will end up in a Ruy Lopez, but he is capable of playing several other choices as well."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,And a Ruy it is.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,And a Ruy it is.
5,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,And a Ruy it is.
6,a6,a7a6,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,"I always play Morphy's 3...a6, but of course, it is not required."
7,Ba4,b5a4,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"The only move listed in MCO-13, but I believe I have seen analysis that shows 4. Bc4 is playable. I am too poor to afford an MCO-14 :)"
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,"The main line, although I have played the Accelerated Counterthrust Variation with 4...b5. Also playable is the Modern Steinitz Defense with 4...d6."
9,d3,d2d3,r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/4p3/B3P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,This is a very timid move that surrenders any hope of keeping the opening white initiative. The main line is 5. O-O.
10,b5,b7b5,r1bqkb1r/2pp1ppp/p1n2n2/1p2p3/B3P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"It is probably better to attack white's center with 5...d5, but I wasn't sure I liked the line:
5...d5
6. exd5 Qxd5 (...Nxd5 will drop the e pawn after the trade on c6)
7. Bxc6  bxc6
8. Nc3
The text forces white's bishop onto a nice diagonal, but I will try to deal with that shortly."
11,Bb3,a4b3,r1bqkb1r/2pp1ppp/p1n2n2/1p2p3/4P3/1B1P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"Better late than never. In an e4 opening, black's goal is to get in ...d5 without it conceding anything to white. I believe with this move black has achieved equality."
12,d5,d7d5,r1bqkb1r/2p2ppp/p1n2n2/1p1pp3/4P3/1B1P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"Better late than never. In an e4 opening, black's goal is to get in ...d5 without it conceding anything to white. I believe with this move black has achieved equality."
13,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqkb1r/2p2ppp/p1n2n2/1p1pp1B1/4P3/1B1P1N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 1 7,"Creating complicating tactics, but with Solohawk I will always try to trade queens and head for an endgame."
14,dxe4,d5e4,r1bqkb1r/2p2ppp/p1n2n2/1p2p1B1/4p3/1B1P1N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 8,And so I hope for 8. dxe4 when I can trade the queens off.
15,Bxf6,g5f6,r1bqkb1r/2p2ppp/p1n2B2/1p2p3/4p3/1B1P1N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 0 8,"I assume this is an attempt to decoy my queen, as recapturing with the pawn will break up my kingside."
16,gxf6,g7f6,r1bqkb1r/2p2p1p/p1n2p2/1p2p3/4p3/1B1P1N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 9,But that is a price I am willing to pay in order to get the queens off.
17,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkb1r/2p2p1p/p1n2p2/1p2p3/4p3/1B1P1N2/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 1 9,Neglecting the fact that his knight was en prise.
18,exf3,e4f3,r1bqkb1r/2p2p1p/p1n2p2/1p2p3/8/1B1P1p2/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 0 10,So I am happy to win a piece.
19,Qxf3,d1f3,r1bqkb1r/2p2p1p/p1n2p2/1p2p3/8/1B1P1Q2/PPP2PPP/RN3RK1 b kq - 0 10,Threatening a nasty fork with Qxc6 .
20,Bg7,f8g7,r1bqk2r/2p2pbp/p1n2p2/1p2p3/8/1B1P1Q2/PPP2PPP/RN3RK1 w kq - 1 11,Which I totally overlook because I am so anxious to get castled.
21,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqk2r/2p2pbp/p1n2p2/1p2p3/8/1BNP1Q2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b kq - 2 11,But then he fails to pull the trigger on his threat.
22,Bb7,c8b7,r2qk2r/1bp2pbp/p1n2p2/1p2p3/8/1BNP1Q2/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w kq - 3 12,And I finally realize the danger and deal with it. The second reason for this move it to play 12...Na5 with a discovery on the queen that will allow me to trade off white's bishop.
23,a4,a2a4,r2qk2r/1bp2pbp/p1n2p2/1p2p3/P7/1BNP1Q2/1PP2PPP/R4RK1 b kq - 0 12,A curious move that seems out of place. I think centralizing the rooks was probably a better choice.
