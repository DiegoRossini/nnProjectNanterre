1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"?! The key move of the controversial Latvian Gambit. Very rarely seen at high levels, Black gives up a pawn (and usually much more) for a lead in space and development."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"?! The key move of the controversial Latvian Gambit. Very rarely seen at high levels, Black gives up a pawn (and usually much more) for a lead in space and development."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"?! The key move of the controversial Latvian Gambit. Very rarely seen at high levels, Black gives up a pawn (and usually much more) for a lead in space and development."
4,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"?! The key move of the controversial Latvian Gambit. Very rarely seen at high levels, Black gives up a pawn (and usually much more) for a lead in space and development."
5,Nxe5,f3e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4Np2/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"This is the main line, which continues with 3...Qf6 (or 3...Nf6?!) and then either 4.d4 d6 5.Nc4 fxe4 or 4.Nc4 fxe4 5.Nc3 Qg6 6.d3."
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/2n5/4Np2/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,"?! This unusual variation leads to especially sharp lines as Black offers White a free Rook with 4.Qh5+ g6 5.Nxg6 Nf6 6.Qh3 hxg6 7.Qxh8 Qe7, hoping his positional compensation will be enough to deal with White's significant material lead."
7,Nxc6,e5c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/2N5/5p2/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"This is not actually bad, but it is probably the best-case scenario for Black, as he gets to free up his LSB and the d-file without an enormous material sacrifice."
8,dxc6,d7c6,r1bqkbnr/ppp3pp/2p5/5p2/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"?! White is playing extremely aggressively, but the e-pawn was in no real danger (...fxe4 isolates Black's pawn far from any support and will be won back easily) and White needs to develop in order to compete with what is about to become a very active Black position."
9,e5,e4e5,r1bqkbnr/ppp3pp/2p5/4Pp2/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"?! White is playing extremely aggressively, but the e-pawn was in no real danger (...fxe4 isolates Black's pawn far from any support and will be won back easily) and White needs to develop in order to compete with what is about to become a very active Black position."
10,Qd4,d8d4,r1b1kbnr/ppp3pp/2p5/4Pp2/3q4/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,"With no Knight and d4 blocked, White doesn't have a comfortable way to dislodge this Queen."
11,Qe2,d1e2,r1b1kbnr/ppp3pp/2p5/4Pp2/3q4/8/PPPPQPPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 2 6,"This is the only way to protect the pawn until White can find time for f4, but it does the LSB no favors."
12,Be6,c8e6,r3kbnr/ppp3pp/2p1b3/4Pp2/3q4/8/PPPPQPPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 3 7,Black blockades the troublesome e-pawn and puts another piece between his King and the WQ.
13,c3,c2c3,r3kbnr/ppp3pp/2p1b3/4Pp2/3q4/2P5/PP1PQPPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"Kicking the Queen, but hampering White's development further."
14,Qb6,d4b6,r3kbnr/ppp3pp/1qp1b3/4Pp2/8/2P5/PP1PQPPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 1 8,"!? Black allows his Queen to be somewhat marginalized, but threatens White's b-pawn, tying the WQ to its defense should the Bishop get out after White's d4. With only a couple pieces in play, Black is making it exceedingly uncomfortable for White to complete his development."
15,d4,d2d4,r3kbnr/ppp3pp/1qp1b3/4Pp2/3P4/2P5/PP2QPPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 8,"Reinforcing the e-pawn, though this seems susceptible to attack from ...c5."
16,O-O-O,e8c8,2kr1bnr/ppp3pp/1qp1b3/4Pp2/3P4/2P5/PP2QPPP/RNB1KB1R w KQ - 1 9,White is still far behind in development and Black's pieces are looking hungrily at the WK--which is still at least three moves from castling.
17,Bg5,c1g5,2kr1bnr/ppp3pp/1qp1b3/4PpB1/3P4/2P5/PP2QPPP/RN2KB1R b KQ - 2 9,"?! White develops while trying to gain some tempo, but Black has an easy response. What's worse, this move ties the Queen to the defense of b2 and prevents White from playing an immediate Nd2 as a result."
18,Be7,f8e7,2kr2nr/ppp1b1pp/1qp1b3/4PpB1/3P4/2P5/PP2QPPP/RN2KB1R w KQ - 3 10,"I don't like this choice by White to trade off his only active piece. Perhaps 10.Be3 would be better, threatening 11.d5."
19,Bxe7,g5e7,2kr2nr/ppp1B1pp/1qp1b3/4Pp2/3P4/2P5/PP2QPPP/RN2KB1R b KQ - 0 10,"I don't like this choice by White to trade off his only active piece. Perhaps 10.Be3 would be better, threatening 11.d5."
20,Nxe7,g8e7,2kr3r/ppp1n1pp/1qp1b3/4Pp2/3P4/2P5/PP2QPPP/RN2KB1R w KQ - 0 11,"Black is almost fully developed, while only White's Queen is off her starting square--and she's not looking great, either."
21,b3,b2b3,2kr3r/ppp1n1pp/1qp1b3/4Pp2/3P4/1PP5/P3QPPP/RN2KB1R b KQ - 0 11,"? White tries to loosen up his position a bit, but it would have been better to simply bite the bullet and take the time to develop with 11.Qc2 followed by Bd3 and Nd2, as now Black can counter with..."
22,Rxd4,d8d4,2k4r/ppp1n1pp/1qp1b3/4Pp2/3r4/1PP5/P3QPPP/RN2KB1R w KQ - 0 12,! This sham sacrifice wins the pawn and gives Black undisputed control of the d-file. If 12.cxd4? Qxd4 and Black wins back his Rook with interest.
23,Nd2,b1d2,2k4r/ppp1n1pp/1qp1b3/4Pp2/3r4/1PP5/P2NQPPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 1 12,"Now White can take the Rook, but his queenside pawns and e-pawn are looking very weak."
24,Rf4,d4f4,2k4r/ppp1n1pp/1qp1b3/4Pp2/5r2/1PP5/P2NQPPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 2 13,"?! I still don't know how to feel about this move. Black continues to apply pressure to White's cramped position and prevents f4 for the moment, but he gives up the d-file and allows White to develop his Bishop with tempo."
25,g3,g2g3,2k4r/ppp1n1pp/1qp1b3/4Pp2/5r2/1PP3P1/P2NQP1P/R3KB1R b KQ - 0 13,"Not 13...Bd5? (thinking to invade h1 and deny White's castle) because of 14.f3!, simultaneously blocking the threat and winning the Rook."
26,Rg4,f4g4,2k4r/ppp1n1pp/1qp1b3/4Pp2/6r1/1PP3P1/P2NQP1P/R3KB1R w KQ - 1 14,"Not 13...Bd5? (thinking to invade h1 and deny White's castle) because of 14.f3!, simultaneously blocking the threat and winning the Rook."
