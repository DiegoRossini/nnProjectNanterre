1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"After 1.d4 d5 2.c4 Bf5 we have the Baltic Defence, which is a radical way of black trying to solve the problem of the QB in the Queens Gambit. The idea is to play an early Bxb1, giving up the bishop for white's QN. I thought for a while about playing 3.c4; did I really want to allow 3...Bxb1? It leaves white with the two bishops, of course. I've never quite believed that they are as strong as they are made out if the beneficiary of such an exchange tries to utilise their power by simply 'opening the game up'. I've always thought that, certainly in the middle game, the player with the two bishops can benefit not so much because of the power of the pair of clerics, but because the opponent will probably struggle to defend the squares of the colour of the bishop they have given up. Usually, the player with the B and N will try to stick their pawns on the colour square of which they have no defending bishop. In this case, black would play an early e6 and c6; in a normal QGD or a Slav, they would be trying for the freeing moves e5 or c5; without the white-squared bishop that strategy MUST lead to white-square weaknesses. So a Baltic Defence-style plan must, logically, lead to a passive game."

There was no way I would exchange the d6 knight for black's f5 bishop, and the a4 bishop is still a better minor piece than the c6 knight. The well-known American chess writer Jeremy Silman hammers on about minor piece 'imbalances' in a number of his books: he recommends constantly assessing your and your opponent's minor pieces. In this position, both white knights are superior to their counterparts, and white's white-squared bishop is better than its rival (which, although outside the pawn chain is hardly exerting any influence on the board). Black's other bishop is, I suppose, level with white's black-squared bishop (which is only operational on one diagonal right now). But black's bishop on f8 is a some way from being developed (it would actually love to take the d6 knight), and white's bishop on d2 would be a good minor piece on c3. All-in-all, the 'imbalances' hugely favour white. Incidentally, Silman makes the point in one of his books, that the main reason chess has remained such a great game over the centuries is because of the relative values (approx. 3 pawns each) of the bishop and the knight (which means they can be exchanged for each other during the game), and, because of that, the game lends itself to rich strategic themes involving the trading of the minor pieces in order to achieve positional advantages. He's an excellent writer (a sort of John Watson lite!). The other writer worth looking at is Jacob Aagaard (Excelling At Chess, Everyman, is his masterpiece . . . particularly good stuff about rook endings). Now, back to the game . . ."
