1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I overlooked quickly before this tourney main ideas of this defence. If he captures on e5, getting a stronghold point on d4 with further natural development to keep it on with Nc6, Qd7, 0-0-0 and maneuver g8 knight until he reaches g6 square and put double pressure on e5 gambited pawn.

If he would play the safely 3.e3, i would respond ...exd4 with a huge attack on his king as b4 is unprotected, e-file with kings exposed and quick development. The d5 square is almost impossible for white to get under control in this line and their remaining d4 will be contested with firepowering pieces as nothing can break knight+ bishop quick development."

5,dxe5,d4e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pP3/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,The best white move. Release the center pressure is a good + for white.
6,d4,d5d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/2Pp4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"d4 is a much stronger square than a dxc4 capture and allows queen exchange, king uncastled and the unleash of light squared white bishop."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/2Pp4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,Targets d4 and protects e5
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/4P3/2Pp4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,"Fighting for the center... c5 is also playable but as i planned to 0-0-0, i dont wanna weaken myself."
9,Bf4,c1f4,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/4P3/2Pp1B2/5N2/PP2PPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 3 5,"Here my opponent decided to carry his pawn up as long as he can. 5.g3 and a3 are the most common replies. As white's king is kinda trapped in the center for the moment, 5.g3 is a good way to develop bishop because an e3 move would open d-file which white wanna avoid as black's pieces wanna go there. 5.a3 is also good because it prevents a potentially annoying Bb4+."
10,Be6,c8e6,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n1b3/4P3/2Pp1B2/5N2/PP2PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 4 6,A playable move which puts pressure on the weak c4-pawn and develops a piece on queenside for a further castling. Most played is 5.Nge7 and fight for the e5 pawn immediately by re-routing next on g6.
11,Nbd2,b1d2,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n1b3/4P3/2Pp1B2/5N2/PP1NPPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 5 6,A good answer to a potential Bb4. It develops a piece and is probably best move.
12,Nge7,g8e7,r2qkb1r/ppp1nppp/2n1b3/4P3/2Pp1B2/5N2/PP1NPPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 6 7,"Planning to go on g6 as mentioned before. Qd7 also playable, but i dont wanna show him too early where i'm castling."
13,a3,a2a3,r2qkb1r/ppp1nppp/2n1b3/4P3/2Pp1B2/P4N2/1P1NPPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"I understand the purpose of not allowing b4, but is this a serious threat? I think this move is too defensive and that g3 could be better."
14,Ng6,e7g6,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1b1n1/4P3/2Pp1B2/P4N2/1P1NPPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,As planned.
15,Bg3,f4g3,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1b1n1/4P3/2Pp4/P4NB1/1P1NPPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 2 8,Where else?
16,Qd7,d8d7,r3kb1r/pppq1ppp/2n1b1n1/4P3/2Pp4/P4NB1/1P1NPPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 3 9,Announcing my colors: I wanna 0-0-0 and get control of the d-file.
17,Rc1,a1c1,r3kb1r/pppq1ppp/2n1b1n1/4P3/2Pp4/P4NB1/1P1NPPPP/2RQKB1R b Kkq - 4 9,"White's also annoucing their colors: I wanna smash up your 0-0-0 with a pawn storm. Computer recommends 9.h4 instead, allowing white some breathing for their bishop and force black to weaken their kingside with an almost absolute h5 needed. It also gives a support to the important g5 square."
18,O-O-O,e8c8,2kr1b1r/pppq1ppp/2n1b1n1/4P3/2Pp4/P4NB1/1P1NPPPP/2RQKB1R w K - 5 10,Not scared at all.
19,b4,b2b4,2kr1b1r/pppq1ppp/2n1b1n1/4P3/1PPp4/P4NB1/3NPPPP/2RQKB1R b K - 0 10,Computer here recommends 10.h5. The idea is to make white play first to avoid a bishop trap and use the extra tempo to play next move 11.Nce7. I was more focused on the idea of avoiding a potential white Qa4 and should be cautious about this pawn storm.
20,Nce7,c6e7,2kr1b1r/pppqnppp/4b1n1/4P3/1PPp4/P4NB1/3NPPPP/2RQKB1R w K - 1 11,Computer here recommends 10.h5. The idea is to make white play first to avoid a bishop trap and use the extra tempo to play next move 11.Nce7. I was more focused on the idea of avoiding a potential white Qa4 and should be cautious about this pawn storm.
21,h3,h2h3,2kr1b1r/pppqnppp/4b1n1/4P3/1PPp4/P4NBP/3NPPP1/2RQKB1R b K - 0 11,give some space for bishop retreat as potential Nf5 is expected. I think white holds on too much for their bishop and that 11.c5 is better as it gains space and force me to play Kb8 because c6 square i can't allow.
22,Qc6,d7c6,2kr1b1r/ppp1nppp/2q1b1n1/4P3/1PPp4/P4NBP/3NPPP1/2RQKB1R w K - 1 12,This move stops any pawn advance as it creates weaknesses black could exploit. c5 creates light squared weaknesses for the e6 black bishop and b5 allows strong c5 outpost. Qc6 also guards from a potentiel Ne4 which would be powerful.
23,Nb3,d2b3,2kr1b1r/ppp1nppp/2q1b1n1/4P3/1PPp4/PN3NBP/4PPP1/2RQKB1R b K - 2 12,"I understand the purpose of targeting the d4 pawn, but I think this move weakens the support of their queenside pawn storm, especially the c4 pawn. It also allows a breach on a-file. Computer recommends instead 12.Nh4 to trade off pieces and eliminate an attacker on the e5 pawn."
24,Nf5,e7f5,2kr1b1r/ppp2ppp/2q1b1n1/4Pn2/1PPp4/PN3NBP/4PPP1/2RQKB1R w K - 3 13,"I sticked to my plan, i thought freeing the dark squared black bishop + getting an outpoust on f5 and protect d4 would be good... but the computer recommends 12.Qa6 12. b5 Qxa3 13. Ra1 Qb4+ 14. Nbd2 Nf5 15. Rxa7 Nxg3 16. fxg3 Bc5 17. Ra8+ Kd7 18. Ra4 Qc3 19. Qb3 Qc1+ 20. Kf2 attacking the a3 and c4-pawn at same time while only one of them would be saved. Although, i didnt liked the idea of opening the a-file for a simple regain of the pawn i gambited. Maybe i should be more gutsy and open it as white's kingside is completely out of play for at least 3 moves (Bh2, g4, Bg2)."
