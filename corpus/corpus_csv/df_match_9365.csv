At first I thought that Black simply didn't pay attention to my bishop on c1, but then I saw that maybe Black was taking a shot at opening the h column for its rook, creating a potentially nasty discovered check, having the bishop on h2. I will never know which of the two were Black's motivation, but Black's apparent ""queen sacrifice"" will prove to be not so sound."
