1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I was paired with Jeff Lowther in the last round of the same tournament four  years earlier.  I lost quickly in an old stodgy Italian Game position.  Here again, in the 6th and final round, I am about to lose to Jeff a second time in pretty much the same fashion.  I do, however, last a little longer, choking in 20 moves instead of 19.  Only this time I come much closer to victory with correct strategy!"
2,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,The Nimzowitsch Defense
3,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Controlling the center with two pawns is natural, and is really the acid test of 1.e4 Nc6.  The alternate 2.Nf3 is played frequently by strong players, intending to either switch back into known Double KP theory or simply get a slightly better position with more space after 2...d6 3.d4 Nf6 4.Nc3, followed by White developing naturally behind his pawn center.  After 2.d4, Black must decide immediately on a central pawn break: 2...d5 or 2...e5."
4,d5,d7d5,r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Although Black is fine in the locked center positions resulting from 2...e5 3.d5, White can transpose into Scotch territory after 2...e5 3.Nf3.  Recalling Jeff's splendid play in a normal Double KP position from our previous encounter in 2002, I did not wish to give him that option and instead chose Nimzowitsch's original idea of 2...d5."
5,e5,e4e5,r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3pP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,Grabbing space and denying Black the f6 square for his Knight.  So far so good for White.  Other theoretical choices include the critical 3.Nc3 and 3.exd5.
6,Bf5,c8f5,r2qkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3pPb2/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"Black can play 3...f6, another strong choice.  But I prefer good old fashion development, leaving the ...f6 break in reserve."
7,c3,c2c3,r2qkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3pPb2/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"Obviously concerned about a possible ...Nb4 at some point, White chooses to blunt the Queen Knight and at the same time nail down the d4 pawn, creating a cramping pawn chain.  The c3 pawn can later be used to launch a queenside pawn storm with b2-b4, if Black castles long."
8,Qd7,d8d7,r3kbnr/pppqpppp/2n5/3pPb2/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"Although we're still in theory, there is something aesthetically pleasing when, after only 4 moves, you have 3 pieces developed and your opponent has zero!"
9,Nf3,g1f3,r3kbnr/pppqpppp/2n5/3pPb2/3P4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,"Hitting at the front of the pawn chain, since the base is unassailable.  Here it's even more effective, since the early Nf3 blocks the f-pawn.  Ideally White would like to support e5 with f2-f4, but often White makes this concession for the sake of rapid kingside development.  Black's 5...f6 is well-timed here."
10,f6,f7f6,r3kbnr/pppqp1pp/2n2p2/3pPb2/3P4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Hitting at the front of the pawn chain, since the base is unassailable.

12,exf6,e7f6,r3kbnr/pppq2pp/2n2p2/3p1b2/3P4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"Exclam!  Black does not recapture toward the center with 6...gxf6, nor with the KN, leaving a hole on e5.  Instead Black captures away from the center, opens the e-file and leaves the kingside pawns connected.  White has already lost the opening battle, stumbling into a French Exchange position where Black is up two tempi."
13,Bf4,c1f4,r3kbnr/pppq2pp/2n2p2/3p1b2/3P1B2/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 7,"Black wants to play 7...Bd6, so White will swap dark-squared Bishops if that happens.  The down side of 7.Bf4 is the coming ...g5 (with tempo), followed by the rolling of the kingside pawn mass."

In a normal French Exchange opposite-side castling position, White counters with standard queenside expansion via the pawn pushes b2-b4 and a2-a4, keeping Black on his toes.  Here, instead of counterattacking, White must play careful defense as a consequence of his mistake on Move 6."

It took me some time to find it over the board, as it moves a piece twice before finishing development.  But the Bishop now creates an annoying pin on the f3 Knight and sets up potential tactics, so its second movement is fully justified."

White was obviously anticipating 12...fxg5, so he could mount his Knight on e5, trade some pieces, and try to neutralize the attack.  But this capture only fuels the fire, allowing the h-pawn to roll.  Resistance is NOT futile after 12.Re1, which unpins the Knight and aids development.  Now the attack is unstoppable.  Realizing his mistake, White sighed and shook his head as I played..."

White will then need to decide whether to allow his King's position to be ripped open, or to entomb his dark-squared Bishop with 14.g3.  Both choices seem undesirable."
