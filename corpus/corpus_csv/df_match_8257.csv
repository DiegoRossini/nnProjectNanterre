6,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,"Certainly 3...c5 was playable, but I had already determined what opening I was going to play."
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 4,"Also playable were ...c6 or ...c5 here.  But I prefer the main lines anyway, which look to action on the K-side."

It proves very difficult for both sides to establish any kind of edge.  Against the more usual 7.0-0 I would probably have played 7...Nc6."
14,dxe5,d6e5,rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/5np1/4p3/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 8,"Yep: there go the Queens.  White could have tried the quite playable 8.Qc2, but then one would be inclined to wonder why the exchange on e5."

19,Rd1,a1d1,r1br2k1/pppn1pbp/5np1/4p1B1/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/3RK2R b K - 3 10,An interesting alternative was 10.0-0-0.

21,Nd2,f3d2,r1b2rk1/pppn1pbp/5np1/4p1B1/2P1P3/2N5/PP1NBPPP/3RK2R b K - 5 11,(!?) Castling instead seems good here.  Is the knight headed for b3?

24,Rd8,f8d8,r1br2k1/pp1n1pbp/2p2np1/4p3/2P1P3/2N1B3/PP1NBPPP/3RK2R w K - 2 13,"The pin released, Black rook returns to d8.  But 12...b6 at once might have been preferable. This rook, however, move is by way of preparing for the bishop to depart from the c8-square."

Note that both sides have played very cautiously, neither giving much away, neither over-committing to any positive action.  White has a very centralised position, which answers for the hole at d4.  Black is less compact, but has no real weaknesses to speak of.  This is a tough fight for both sides..."
