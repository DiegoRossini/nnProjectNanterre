1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"missloly is one of the delightful ladies featuring on the ~Sixth Sense~ 2015 calendar. I hope to play the ladies on it, in the month in which they appear. Miss Loly was the June lady."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I don't normally play this, but I thought I would see what she would play."
3,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,This is a sound developing move by her.
4,Bc5,f8c5,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 3,So I copy it again.
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,"This is also a good move, attacking e5."
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,"Which I defend in the conventional way. This opening is now what the English speaking nations call ""Giuoco Piano"" - Italian for ""Quiet Game"" - and what the rest of the world call the Italian Game.

7,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 5 4,This is also a good developing move.
8,d6,d7d6,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 5,"I continue with my development, opening up a diagonal for my Bc8."
9,d3,d2d3,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/2b1p3/2B1P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 5,She replies with the same.
10,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 6,And I develop my knight.
11,Ng5,f3g5,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/2b1p1N1/2B1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 2 6,"I think this is her first mistake. Nc3, c3, h3, and Bg4 are all stronger. The move attacks f7 again, but this is easily defended against. Making mistakes in the opening like this can easily but stopped on Gameknot by using the on-line opening databases, which are quite legal."
12,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/2b1p1N1/2B1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 3 7,So now I have two defenders to f7.
13,Nc3,b1c3,r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/2b1p1N1/2B1P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 4 7,This is good development.
14,h6,h7h6,r1bq1rk1/ppp2pp1/2np1n1p/2b1p1N1/2B1P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 8,"So I put the question to the knight. The post-game computer analysis (PGCA)gives this move as a mistake, and gives Bg4 as stronger, but I am not convinced. The PGCA is not always right!"
15,Nxf7,g5f7,r1bq1rk1/ppp2Np1/2np1n1p/2b1p3/2B1P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 8,"and she makes the wrong choice. Retreating was stronger. Although in theory knight and bishop are worth the same as rook and pawn, in practice they seldom are, and in this position, they certainly are not."
16,Rxf7,f8f7,r1bq2k1/ppp2rp1/2np1n1p/2b1p3/2B1P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 9,So I take.
17,Bxf7+,c4f7,r1bq2k1/ppp2Bp1/2np1n1p/2b1p3/4P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 9,She takes back.
18,Kxf7,g8f7,r1bq4/ppp2kp1/2np1n1p/2b1p3/4P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 10,And so do I.
19,Nd5,c3d5,r1bq4/ppp2kp1/2np1n1p/2bNp3/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 10,"PGCA gives this as a mistake, and recommends Be3. i tend to agree."
20,Be6,c8e6,r2q4/ppp2kp1/2npbn1p/2bNp3/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 2 11,So I develop again.
