1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"i played this game at a mini tournament where i was about to regain rating after severe timeout losses. out of an unorthodox reti opening developed the biggest avalanche i ever experienced in chess.

also note that (despite a handful of bishop moves) all blacks pieces only move towards ONE direction ^^"
