1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Here's a strange game that I won despite a series of blunders that deserved to lose.  Fortunately my opponent had already ceded plenty of material.  It's hardly a game ""worthy of publication"" but it does show the value of perseverance :-)  As it's a team game, we must have had similar ratings at the start, and my opponent won with White.  My rating has only recently shot up as a result of several fast ladder games against low-rated opponents, so don't expect my play to be commensurate with my current lofty rating."

Also, I normally play c3 to support a pawn advance to d4, but as my d-pawn is defending e4, I can't do that without defending e4 some other way.  Anyway, the result is that I'm developing in an unfamiliar fashion."
