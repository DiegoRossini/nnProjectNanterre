1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The above title of this annotation gives an achievement which, by my standards, is pretty good! It's a shame our profiles doesn't give a ""highest rating drawn against"" info. Anyway, I think there are some pretty good reasons for my opponent offering a draw: a) The game was going nowhere, b) my opponent's 154-game winning streak had just ended, so that didn't matter any more and c) in this 2-a-side team match, our opposition had already won 3 out of 4 games! From my perspective, why did I eventually agree a draw? Well, it gave my rating a +7.7 bounce without me having to exert myself to win...and, to be honest, I didn't fancy my winning chances against a player whose rating was 400 points higher than mine! (*For the record, when the team match started, we had roughly the same ratings, so we got paired to play against each other). And so, back to the game itself...I start with my usual Queen Pawn."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"Black plays a generic, flexible defence, known as the Indian Defence, which may branch out into any of many defences, including King's Indian Defence, Benoni, Gruenfeld, Nimzo-Indian Defence, and many others. The main advantage for Black here is that he can more or less completely choose which opening to use."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"White plays the main line to use against most ""Indian"" defences."

6,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"Black employs the Nimzo-Indian Defence, essentially playing for an open board and attempting to pin my knight to prevent me from occupying the centre with 4.e4."
7,Qc2,d1c2,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PPQ1PPPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 3 4,"I play the Classical Variation, the most popular choice here for White. White does not want to clog up his pawn structure after 4...Bxc3 5.bxc3, so he prepares to recapture with his queen. The main drawback here is that White must waste a few tempi to recapture with his queen, allowing Black a slight lead in minor piece development."
8,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PPQ1PPPP/R1B1KBNR w KQ - 4 5,"Known as the Adorjan Gambit, and by far the most popular option in the GK database. Statistics show a very slight edge for Black."
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N2N2/PPQ1PPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQ - 5 5,"Much more popular is 5.a3, putting the question to Black's irritating, pinning bishop on b4. However, I prefer 5.Nf3, because it develops a piece, which will dilute Black's advantage in development after the inevitable ...Bxc3 .Qxc3 is finally played. Soon, however, White must challenge Black's bishop with .a3."
10,c5,c7c5,rnbq1rk1/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/1bPP4/2N2N2/PPQ1PPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ - 0 6,"A very common move in many variations of the Nimzo-Indian: Black challenges White's central pawn superiority with this queenside pawn thrust. It is a gambit move, since .dxc5 Bxc5 loses a tempo and allows White to get rid of the annoying pin: therefore, Black should not immediately regain the pawn. I usually play dxc5, at whichever stage Black plays ...c5, because, firstly, I hope that, if Black is a weak player, he will play ...Bxc5 - obviously not the case here. Secondly, I hope to slow Black down in the hassle he must undertake with his knight to regain the pawn."

13,Bd2,c1d2,r1bq1rk1/pp1p1ppp/n3pn2/2P5/1bP5/2N2N2/PPQBPPPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 2 7,"I judged that it was time to challenge the bishop. Black's pieces are threatening superiority on my queenside, and are both very well-placed. Time to get rid of one of them. Obviously, 8...Ba5? 9.b4! loses material, so Black has only one move here."

Black is defending the f6-knight with another knight, so exchanging on d6 will give me no advantage, and in fact be very slightly worse for me as I am losing bishop for knight in an open position. And, 10.b4 no longer gains a tempo."
