1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I played this game while listening to some '77 Dead, and I was able to really outclass the opposition."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Okay, so I think this is the Slav defence to the Queen's gambit.  I think Anand and Kramnik had a lot of Slav and semi-Slav positions in their championship a couple years ago."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Okay, so I think this is the Slav defence to the Queen's gambit.  I think Anand and Kramnik had a lot of Slav and semi-Slav positions in their championship a couple years ago."
4,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Okay, so I think this is the Slav defence to the Queen's gambit.  I think Anand and Kramnik had a lot of Slav and semi-Slav positions in their championship a couple years ago."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"Here I just took, thinking black would take cxd."
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"Here I just took, thinking black would take cxd."
7,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3P4/3P4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"This move is not what I would call classy, in fact I would say that it lacks class, and I would embarrass myself if I played it.  Since it asks for simplifications, it is aesthetically unappealing."
8,Nxd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p5/3n4/3P4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"This move is not what I would call classy, in fact I would say that it lacks class, and I would embarrass myself if I played it.  Since it asks for simplifications, it is aesthetically unappealing."
9,e4,e2e4,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p5/3n4/3PP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,But I try and prop by game up by playing with some class.  This e4 here immediately reasserts the desire for individuation if nxc3.
10,Nxc3,d5c3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p5/8/3PP3/2n5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"And he does, and here I think I have a great move prepared."
11,bxc3,b2c3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p5/8/3PP3/2P5/P4PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,"Now that was a classy move from white.  I think white is going to have a lot of great attacking possibilities here with the bishops going naturally to b2 and d3, and maybe a gallant f4 break."
12,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1p3/8/3PP3/2P5/P4PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,This looks like another subpar move.  I think e5 may have been a lot better.
13,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1p3/8/3PP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 7,"Under no time pressure, I play nf3 before just f3."
14,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/2p1p3/8/3PP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 8,"This move looks slow, safe and uninspired."
15,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/2p1p3/8/3PP3/2PB1N2/P4PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 8,"As you can see, the white position develops itself very naturally.  I can not help my courtly charm.  But will I prove a salacious rogue?"
16,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/2p1p3/8/3PP3/2PB1N2/P4PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 4 9,"I think my development problem is almost solved, and I may be able to start attacking as early as the next move, which will only be move 10."
17,O-O,e1g1,rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/2p1p3/8/3PP3/2PB1N2/P4PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 5 9,My old-world good manners and obvious noble bloodstock are just too much here.  I play a marvelously civilized nd2.

19,Nd2,f3d2,r1bq1rk1/pp1nbppp/2p1p3/8/3PP3/2PB4/P2N1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 7 10,He is a bold but comely rapscallion.  This is just a beautiful looking move.
20,Nf6,d7f6,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2p1pn2/8/3PP3/2PB4/P2N1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 8 11,He is a bold but comely rapscallion.  This is just a beautiful looking move.

22,h6,h7h6,r1bq1rk1/pp2bpp1/2p1pn1p/8/3PPP2/2PB4/P2N2PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 12,"Okay, some maybe my opponent wasn't that great in this game."
23,Nc4,d2c4,r1bq1rk1/pp2bpp1/2p1pn1p/8/2NPPP2/2PB4/P5PP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 12,Maybe this knight idea isn't that brilliant.  Maybe just e5 or f5 would've been quicker and more to the point.
24,b5,b7b5,r1bq1rk1/p3bpp1/2p1pn1p/1p6/2NPPP2/2PB4/P5PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 13,"Okay, so I've got the knight where I want it, but why did I want it there."
