Confronted with my favorite Open Game, I complicate things with the Sicilian."

Nf3, but still it's the 3rd most popular amongst the experts in the World DB and it does quite well for white. Black responds with the main line which invites some immediate abuse by white's pawns, not unlike Alekhine's Defense."

Qxd5), white can gang up on it and develop a piece first. Jumping immediately to 5. cxd4 takes a little bit of the pressure off of black, giving him freedom to steer the course for a while."

13,Bb5+,f1b5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3pp3/1B1nP3/3P4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,7. Bb5+ it turns out is not a very popular choice in the World DB. More tentative developing moves like 7. Bc4 is much more popular and much more successful.

Bxd7+ instead. My instincts told me there is a reason this move is not chosen, but damned if I could find any way to exploit it. The one thing I didn't really want to do was give white an early queen exchange. With the disparity in our ratings, I wanted to keep the board as complex as possible."

It felt like castling into danger with white's knight, rook, and queen just sitting right there in striking distance. It's never a good idea to castle into danger. Never castle onto a file your opponent controls, especially if you're only shielded by a poorly defended pawn, and especially if your opponent has multiple pieces lurking about to assist in any attack along that file. But I couldn't see any way for white to make good on the danger, and I really wanted to play 19. ... f6 to chase away the knight for good, so I decided the danger was illusory and took the plunge."

Never castle into danger, etc., etc. White's pawn on c3 looks defended, but appearances are deceiving. Before castling, the pawn is defended. However, unlike black's plunge on move 18, the danger here is definitely not illusory. But white castled right into position that pinned his own bishop, removing it from defense of the pawn. The black queen makes short work of the pawn and, aided by her two bishops, she delivers the killing blow."
