1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Master Chrisobee, one of my Master buddies kindly invited me to a mini-tournament containing mostly Masters and Experts and two GRANDMASTERS!  I lost both my games to Ruwurtinger (whose rating was over 2500 at the time) then I found myself paired up against the Gameknot Grandmaster that every chessplayer on Gameknot has been dreaming of playing - that is, GM CYRANO!  Here I find myself playing against a Sicilian Naijdorf in which we both play book moves for the first 15 moves.  I will talk you through them.  There is also a Gameknot Analysis link to this game which is as follows:- http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15425960&rnd=0.49847992558701476"

For a long time, Glenda will sit on d2 doing nothing but defend Fou Lenoir and at the same time, darn a much needed new pair of medieval stockings for her beloved seafood loving other half, Henry, so that he doesn't catch cold if and when his castled position becomes just a little draughty."

However there is no way I will stop a crowning unless I am prepared to give up ruinous loss of material for it.

This game is a salutary lesson of the power of two connected passed pawns in the late middlegame."
