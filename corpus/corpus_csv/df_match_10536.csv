He should move his queenside pawns in a minority attack, a3-b4-b5, and once black is forced to compromise his queenside pawns, the power of white bishop on g2 would grow. However, white would find it more useful to have both rooks on the a and b files. So I'd play Qe2-Rfb1, or a3-b4 immediately."

White reacts correctly to this flank aggression -- by pressuring the center, he uses his better developed pieces to get a positional advantage."

A mistake. I thought this move accomplished two missions at once: prevent white from moving f4, and vacating the f6 square for the knight. But I missed a simple tactics: 15. Nxd5! cxd5 16. Bxd5 getting a pawn advantage."
