1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,The standard Kings pawn opening - nothing too special
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,The standard Kings pawn opening - nothing too special
3,a3,a2a3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/P7/1PPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Already a strange move, which doesn't seem to have any logical sense (other than stopping my bishop from reaching the b4 square, but that isn't really a threat this early in the game, is it?)"
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/P7/1PPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"developing, and threatening Nxe4"
5,d3,d2d3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/P2P4/1PP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"of course, this threat is easily parried, but I would have preferred Nc3 here (still, this move lets White prepare Bg5, if he wishes to)"
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/P2P4/1PP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"Already, my knight has its eyes set on the d4 square, but it can't do that yet because of c3."
7,Ne2,g1e2,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/P2P4/1PP1NPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,"Developing, but the problem with this is that it'd be slow development; not that White would want to move the knight, but the only reasonable move now for it is Ng3 because of my pawn on e5. It does make me forget Nd4 though"
8,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/4P3/P2P4/1PP1NPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 3 5,"Further developing, plus giving the option to castle kingside."
9,h3,h2h3,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/4P3/P2P3P/1PP1NPP1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"with the same idea of White's second move, only concerning Black's other bishop. Although it's a little more effective than 2.a3 (Bf5 is also impossible) I still think it's a little premature here, since the bishop isn't free yet, but it doesn't really matter in this game..."
10,d6,d7d6,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/2b1p3/4P3/P2P3P/1PP1NPP1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"because if White had developed before this move, he would have played h3 now (still, what if Black had castled, or decided to fianchetto his bishop?)"
11,Nbc3,b1c3,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/2b1p3/4P3/P1NP3P/1PP1NPP1/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,also worth considering for White is 6.Bg5
12,Be6,c8e6,r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2npbn2/2b1p3/4P3/P1NP3P/1PP1NPP1/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 7,"I'm not going to castle yet; instead, I decide to make queenside castling possible as well (I prefer queenside castling, actually, because it tends to make rooks more active)"
13,Na4,c3a4,r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2npbn2/2b1p3/N3P3/P2P3P/1PP1NPP1/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 7,"Obviously looking at Nxc5, which can't be stopped. However, I give this move a ? because it involves moving the knight three times, and since White has not finished developing yet, this is bad!"
14,Qe7,d8e7,r3k2r/ppp1qppp/2npbn2/2b1p3/N3P3/P2P3P/1PP1NPP1/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 4 8,"since White has decided to neglect development, Black calmly continues his, and opening up queenside developing as an option"
15,Nxc5,a4c5,r3k2r/ppp1qppp/2npbn2/2N1p3/4P3/P2P3P/1PP1NPP1/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,"expected - since White had already started the attack, there's no point in giving up on it"
16,dxc5,d6c5,r3k2r/ppp1qppp/2n1bn2/2p1p3/4P3/P2P3P/1PP1NPP1/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 9,"That's four knight moves in a row for White! It allows for Be2, then castling, but given White's situation he might have been better off going for queenside castling (Be3, then Qd2, then 0-0-0) which develops a little more (although, admittingly, White's light-square bishop would be horrible in that position) It's not as if White's lost in this position, of course"
17,Nc3,e2c3,r3k2r/ppp1qppp/2n1bn2/2p1p3/4P3/P1NP3P/1PP2PP1/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 9,"That's four knight moves in a row for White!

18,O-O-O,e8c8,2kr3r/ppp1qppp/2n1bn2/2p1p3/4P3/P1NP3P/1PP2PP1/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 2 10,"since dxc5 allowed for a half-open d-file, I immediately grab it with development. It also has the benefit of placing the rook on the same file as White's queen"
19,Be3,c1e3,2kr3r/ppp1qppp/2n1bn2/2p1p3/4P3/P1NPB2P/1PP2PP1/R2QKB1R b KQ - 3 10,"Development, but this brings my attention to the d4 square, and I realise...."
20,Nd4,c6d4,2kr3r/ppp1qppp/4bn2/2p1p3/3nP3/P1NPB2P/1PP2PP1/R2QKB1R w KQ - 4 11,"that my knight can now land on that square! White now has to decide whether to capture the knight or let it be (bearing in mind that only the bishop can shift it). Leaving the knight doesn't seem like too good an option, since the d4 square is great for the knight. If white were to take the knight..."
21,Bxd4,e3d4,2kr3r/ppp1qppp/4bn2/2p1p3/3BP3/P1NP3P/1PP2PP1/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 11,"! Black can do this! I like this move - the trade helps with Black's development, while doing nothing to help White's. If Black had captured with a pawn, it probably wouldn't have made as big as an impact, despite chasing away the knight."
22,Rxd4,d8d4,2k4r/ppp1qppp/4bn2/2p1p3/3rP3/P1NP3P/1PP2PP1/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 12,"! Black can do this! I like this move - the trade helps with Black's development, while doing nothing to help White's.
