1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I want to make a note for nobita2c if he ever reads this; especially after my game with muginz I was planning to offer a draw once this had played itself out.  It worked to a really interesting position so I'm sorry we couldn't finish it.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,This move was a part of my experiment with bishop's pawn openings.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 2,This move was a part of my experiment with bishop's pawn openings.
4,c6,c7c6,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2p2n2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,This move was a part of my experiment with bishop's pawn openings.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2p2n2/8/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,This move caught me by surprise.  I'm still unclear what the immediate objective was and I would recommend further development next time before moving in but Black is clearly not set up to remove the threat.  Even the fact that Black's Queen's knight can be picked off if it moves out may make this worthwhile.

8,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3pNb2/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,Black's slow development leaves him open to pawn pressure which will be the theme of the game.  The black bishop especially exerts no power in the game until far too late.
