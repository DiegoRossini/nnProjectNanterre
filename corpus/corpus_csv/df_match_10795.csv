The weakness of e3 is not so much the blocking in of the c1 bishop (though it is often useful to develop this piece to g5 after ..Nf6 and ...e6), but its inflexibility. In a sense, it gives Black unnecessary information about White's setup. Even if White intends this move eventually, he shouldn't play it so early. Instead, he ought to retain flexibility by playing the obvious 3.c4, keeping his setup unclear and thereby restricting Black's options somewhat more."

In this case, White gains a powerful light-squared counterattack for the pawn...in other words, White has more than enough compensation.
