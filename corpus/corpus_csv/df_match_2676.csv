1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I am the white player and I have played different openings on gameknot recently but e4 seems to have the most succes. I also like to play d4 but I'm most skilled in e4.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Black plays e5 and I'm happy with that, I rather play the simple e4 e5 than the silician."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Basic opening and this is not the ruy lopez but tries to take advantage of the weak f7 early on. However my opponent didnt play nf6 here, or I would have played ng5 already."
4,Bc5,f8c5,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"Basic opening and this is not the ruy lopez but tries to take advantage of the weak f7 early on. However my opponent didnt play nf6 here, or I would have played ng5 already."
5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,"Basic opening and this is not the ruy lopez but tries to take advantage of the weak f7 early on. However my opponent didnt play nf6 here, or I would have played ng5 already."
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,Note that Nxe5? is a blunder here. 4 Nxe5? Nxe5 5 d4 Nxc4! and I would have lost a piece.
7,c3,c2c3,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,"Found this on the gk database so I thought I should try it out. Also possible is the evans gambit with b4, or simply castling short. The queen will go to b3 shortly. I also had an interesting otb game with this which was 4 c3 d6 5 Qb3 f5? , which led to an interesting game but resulted in a draw."
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 5,This is the standard play here. It makes the way to d2 to develop the knight but not before the bishop is developped.
9,d4,d2d4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/2BPP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,This is the standard play here. It makes the way to d2 to develop the knight but not before the bishop is developped.
10,exd4,e5d4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b5/2BpP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"After trading the pawns black puts me in check, but this allows me to develop my knight with a free tempo."
11,cxd4,c3d4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b5/2BPP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"After trading the pawns black puts me in check, but this allows me to develop my knight with a free tempo."

13,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/1bBPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 7,"Now things get interesting, this looks like a free pawn, but I will 0-0 and then the knight may get in trouble after Re1"
14,Nxe4,f6e4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/1bBPn3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"Now things get interesting, this looks like a free pawn, but I will 0-0 and then the knight may get in trouble after Re1"
15,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/1bBPn3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 8,"He took my knight, this looks like there is going to be another free pawn but things will not turn out the way black wanted it to be."
16,Nxc3,e4c3,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/1bBP4/2n2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 9,"He took my knight, this looks like there is going to be another free pawn but things will not turn out the way black wanted it to be."
17,bxc3,b2c3,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/1bBP4/2P2N2/P4PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 9,"My rook is attacked, but I chose not to defend it, I saw that there is another possibility in the chess opening book database, and it turned out nicely."
18,Bxc3,b4c3,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/2BP4/2b2N2/P4PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 10,"My rook is attacked, but I chose not to defend it, I saw that there is another possibility in the chess opening book database, and it turned out nicely."
19,Qb3,d1b3,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/2BP4/1Qb2N2/P4PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 1 10,Qb3! This loses the rook but gets a major attack on the king. If black takes the rook he will be in serious trouble.
20,Bxa1,c3a1,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/2BP4/1Q3N2/P4PPP/b1B2RK1 w kq - 0 11,Bxa1 now the board says -7 for me. That doesn't sound too good. How do I make up for it.
21,Re1+,f1e1,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/2BP4/1Q3N2/P4PPP/b1B1R1K1 b kq - 1 11,"This is probably the best, because it immediatly brings the rook into play."
22,Ne7,c6e7,r1bqk2r/ppppnppp/8/8/2BP4/1Q3N2/P4PPP/b1B1R1K1 w kq - 2 12,"Kf8 doesn't look too good, this is probably the best answer. @l-d-j thanks for pointing that out."
23,Bxf7+,c4f7,r1bqk2r/ppppnBpp/8/8/3P4/1Q3N2/P4PPP/b1B1R1K1 b kq - 0 12,Check
24,Kf8,e8f8,r1bq1k1r/ppppnBpp/8/8/3P4/1Q3N2/P4PPP/b1B1R1K1 w - - 1 13,"The f pawn is now gone so the attack on the queen is here, Black doesn't have any solution to save the queen. At least he will still get some material out of it, though."

27,Bxe7+,g5e7,r1bq1k1r/ppp1BBpp/8/3p4/3P4/1Q3N2/P4PPP/b3R1K1 b - - 0 14,Maybe 14 ... Kxf7 might be better but after 15 Ng5+ the queen may also get in play and black is in a lot of trouble.
