o-o-o, Kxf7, BxB, KxRd1, Bxa2 , Kh1 (looking to grab my bishop after g3), Kg4! (threatening Kxf2), but after Qe2 or Qf3, what? His knight can escape taking e6, making my position very weak (and trheatening my queen). 
If Qe2, Kd8-f6? Qe6 , for instance. 
If after o-o-o, Kxf7, BxB, KxRd8, Bxh2 , Kh1, Rf8 (instead that RxK), Kxe6, Kg4, KxQ, Kxf2 , KxBh2, KxQ, c2xKd3, KxKc7, I am a rook under!
