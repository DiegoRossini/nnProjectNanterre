This allows for fast development by white but at a cost of losing one of his centre pawns. For black the exchange opens the c file which unbeknown to me at this point, was critical to the rsult of this game."

At my current level of understanding and what Ive experienced within my games over the years - nearly every time I castle I lose. I find it just give my opponent a fixed target and unless crucial can result in loss of tempo. I understand the benefits it provides in getting the king safe behind the pawns and activates the rooks but as you will see in this game, once the pawn structure is destroyed, the king is very vulnerable and stuck in a corner. My experience is leave the king in the centre, wait for your opponent to castle then attack that side with your pawns. Opinions and advice on castling is welcomed."
