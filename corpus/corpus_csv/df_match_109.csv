I knew a correspondence player in this country who used to play this with the express purpose of continuing to d5 and exchanging on e7.  Otherwise I don't really know what theory lies behind this move."

Black would have had to find 13...d5! to avoid the loss of either. E.g.: 14.Qe4 d5!  15.exd6 e.p. Qxd6 (threatening mate on h2) 16.Bf4 Qd7.

In fact, objectively speaking White has the edge right now.  All the same the situation is complicated and combative - and the slugfest is just beginning!"
