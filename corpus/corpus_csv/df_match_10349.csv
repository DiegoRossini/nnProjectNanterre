1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Playing Black is my friend I go to tournaments with. He doesn't play on gameknot anymore but his annotations are still here. I saw this game live while walking around during my opponent's turn. It was a wild position and great ending.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"This important move in the King's indian Defense stops e5 and prepares for a central break later with e5 or c5, sometimes both."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"This important move in the King's indian Defense stops e5 and prepares for a central break later with e5 or c5, sometimes both."

7,e4,e2e4,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"This important move in the King's indian Defense stops e5 and prepares for a central break later with e5 or c5, sometimes both."
8,d6,d7d6,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"This important move in the King's indian Defense stops e5 and prepares for a central break later with e5 or c5, sometimes both."
9,f3,f2f3,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2P2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"This differs from the main line where White plays Nf3 Be2 O-O. In this variation (Saemisch) White solidifies the center and keeps options open for maybe castling queenside and doing a kingside pawnstorm, or trying to get an advantage with the bolstered pawn center"
10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2P2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR w KQ - 1 6,"Baker usually plays for an attack like e5 Nh5 f5, but that attack is only good in the main line where White castles kingside quickly. This variation is more positional since White's pawns are more solid, and Baker and I both reccomend the positional c5-break over the tactical e5-break in variations where White moves his f-pawn early."
11,Be3,c1e3,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N1BP2/PP4PP/R2QKBNR b KQ - 2 6,"Yes, Black is offering to give up a pawn. Most players who know Saemisch well will not accept the pawn and instead play Nge2 hoping for cxd4 Nxd4 with a Maroczy Bind. If White accepts the pawn, then Black gets a lot of positional compensation. After dxc5 dxc5 Bxc5 Nc6, White's position is cramped and Black has a big lead in development. If you know this opening well then you know that accepting the gambit is not advisable."
12,c5,c7c5,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2p5/2PPP3/2N1BP2/PP4PP/R2QKBNR w KQ - 0 7,"Yes, Black is offering to give up a pawn.

13,d5,d4d5,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2pP4/2P1P3/2N1BP2/PP4PP/R2QKBNR b KQ - 0 7,"Instead of going for a maroczy bind, White avoids trading a central pawn for a flank pawn. This position is like the Benoni Defense, except that Black has not played e6-exd5 yet."
14,e6,e7e6,rnbq1rk1/pp3pbp/3ppnp1/2pP4/2P1P3/2N1BP2/PP4PP/R2QKBNR w KQ - 0 8,"Black wants to open the e-file for his rook and free up some space. White can choose whether he wants to trade his e-pawn, d-pawn, or c-pawn for Black's e-pawn. Swapping off both e-pawns is not good because Black's open e-file will be stronger. 8.dxe6 Bxe6 9.Nb5 Ne8 is also comfortable for Black. (10.Bxc5 won't work because of Qa5 )"
15,Qd2,d1d2,rnbq1rk1/pp3pbp/3ppnp1/2pP4/2P1P3/2N1BP2/PP1Q2PP/R3KBNR b KQ - 1 8,White's best bet is to let Black trade his central pawn for the flank pawn.
16,exd5,e6d5,rnbq1rk1/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pp4/2P1P3/2N1BP2/PP1Q2PP/R3KBNR w KQ - 0 9,"Usually making this kind of pawn swap favors the player with more central pawns, but White's center is contained, Black now has queenside pawn majority, and can break up White's center with f5 later."
17,cxd5,c4d5,rnbq1rk1/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N1BP2/PP1Q2PP/R3KBNR b KQ - 0 9,"Usually making this kind of pawn swap favors the player with more central pawns, but White's center is contained, Black now has queenside pawn majority, and can break up White's center with f5 later."
18,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bq1rk1/pp1n1pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N1BP2/PP1Q2PP/R3KBNR w KQ - 1 10,"In the lines where White leaves the pawn on d4 and keeps dxc5 an option, Black develops this knight to c6 and plays Ne5 if d5. In this variation where White plays d5 early, this is pretty much the only square to develop to. The idea of Na6-Nc7 planning a b5 advance takes too long and isn't that strong."
19,Nge2,g1e2,r1bq1rk1/pp1n1pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N1BP2/PP1QN1PP/R3KB1R b KQ - 2 10,"The position is cramped, so there will be a lot of positional maneuvering. Usually closed positions like this have an explosive ending once everything is opened up."
20,Ne5,d7e5,r1bq1rk1/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pPn3/4P3/2N1BP2/PP1QN1PP/R3KB1R w KQ - 3 11,Threatening Nc4-Nxe3 giving Black the bishop pair and also weakens White's dark squares.
21,Ng3,e2g3,r1bq1rk1/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pPn3/4P3/2N1BPN1/PP1Q2PP/R3KB1R b KQ - 4 11,Perhaps Nc1 was better because I don't think White has enough play for a kingside attack.
