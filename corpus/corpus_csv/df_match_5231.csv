1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I decided against playing my favourite Sicilian and played the French. My opponent didn't like openings where black gives white the center or a spacial advantage and so I tried to antagonize him and I also wanted to play something different

13,Be3,c1e3,r1b1kbnr/1p3ppp/1qn1p3/p1ppP3/3P4/P1P1BN2/1P3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 7,?

15,Nbd2,b1d2,r1b1kbnr/1p3ppp/2n1p3/p1ppP3/3P4/P1P1BN2/1q1N1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 8,Forced all others drop the rook

17,g3,g2g3,r1b1kbnr/1p3ppp/2n1p3/p1ppP3/3P4/P1q1BNP1/3N1P1P/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 9,Wanting to develop the bishop to a square that is not e2 where whites minor pieces are tripping over one another
18,cxd4,c5d4,r1b1kbnr/1p3ppp/2n1p3/p2pP3/3p4/P1q1BNP1/3N1P1P/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 10,forced however Bg5 may have been a viable alternative because of ...f6 exf6 gxf6 Bh4 (Bf4 falls to e5 were the Bishop is trapped) however the Bishop is trapped on the side and three pawns down however the weakened kingside means the king will be castling into danger on both sides. Rather than gxf6 Nxf6 could be played however Bxf6 forces gxf6 and removes the problem Bishop on the side of the board. However losing this also means the already struggling Queen becomes overloaded thanks to g3 were it now has the knight on f3 to defend but luckily black has no way to take advantage of this. Black must find a way to develop its remaining minor pieces and continue it attack otherwise its doubled c-pawns and advanced queen may come under attack with white just two moves away from castling and using it's better development to get an advantage.

22,fxe5,f6e5,r1b1kbnr/1p4pp/2n1p3/p2pp3/3p1B2/P1q2NP1/3N1PBP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 12,Forcing white to make the exchange or keep it's DSB and queen overloaded

26,Bd6,f8d6,r1b1k2r/1p4pp/2nbpn2/p2pN3/3p1B2/P1q3P1/3N1PBP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 3 14,Preparing to castle and give his rook the half open f-file

29,Bxd6,f4d6,r1b1k2r/1p4pp/2qBpn2/p2p4/3p4/P5P1/3N1PBP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 15,Don't exchange when your down however this is forced because the only other square is Bg5 which is defeated by h6 Bxf6 gxf6 which although weakens the king side means less pieces on the board and the Bishop is better than the Knight and also Bh4 falls to g5 which gives the rook the half open h-file and the king need not bother to castle at the moment
