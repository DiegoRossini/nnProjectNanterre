1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,My usual response to e4 . . .
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,My usual response to e4 . . .
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"I learned once the hard way that it's a good idea to take the pawn at d4.  Allowing white's pawn to d5 leaves black all congested.  Besides, if white's queen captures back at d4, it gives the initiative back to black."
4,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3pP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"I learned once the hard way that it's a good idea to take the pawn at d4.  Allowing white's pawn to d5 leaves black all congested.  Besides, if white's queen captures back at d4, it gives the initiative back to black."
5,Qxd4,d1d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 0 3,Which is exactly what happened here.  Pretty common stuff so far.

7,Qd1,d4d1,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 2 4,Maybe Nc3 would have been better for white here instead of capturing at d5.
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 3 5,Maybe Nc3 would have been better for white here instead of capturing at d5.

12,Qxd5,d8d5,r1b1kb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/3q4/8/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 7,"Threatening Qxg2 and pinning the bishop, since Qxd1 will prevent white from castling."
13,Nf3,g1f3,r1b1kb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/3q4/8/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,"Now I'm starting to regret having my queen out so early.  I hate to retreat, so . . ."

16,Nb4,c6b4,r3kb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3q4/1n4b1/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 9,Hoping that the threat of the knight fork at c2 will prevent the queen trade . . .
17,Bd2,c1d2,r3kb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3q4/1n4b1/5N2/PPPBBPPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 5 9,"The first evidence that my opponent might be the type of player who avoids trades, at least with queens."
18,Bxf3,g4f3,r3kb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3q4/1n6/5b2/PPPBBPPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 10,"That kingside knight seems so important to white's defense, and worth the trade if I can divert his bishop from e2."
19,Bxf3,e2f3,r3kb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3q4/1n6/5B2/PPPB1PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 0 10,Renewed attack on c2.

21,Nc3,b1c3,r3kb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/8/1nq5/2N2B2/PPPB1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 2 11,"I think I was hoping for c3 instead, which would have allowed Nd3+.  But white's good move here turns the tables for a long time."
22,Rd8,a8d8,3rkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/8/1nq5/2N2B2/PPPB1PPP/R2QK2R w KQk - 3 12,"I have few places to hide.  I didn't want Qe6, bottling up my e pawn.  I thought about Qc1, but that seemed like such a retreat.  I know I'm going to get chased around here."

29,Qe2,d1e2,3rkb1r/p3pppp/2p2n2/8/7q/2N5/PPPBQPPP/R3K2R b KQk - 1 15,"This puts a damper on my hopes for Ng4 followed by an attack on f2.  Now, maybe I better start to think about castling . . ."
30,g6,g7g6,3rkb1r/p3pp1p/2p2np1/8/7q/2N5/PPPBQPPP/R3K2R w KQk - 0 16,"I am not a fiancetto player by nature. I guess I just thought it would make me safer in this case, since my queenside is so blown apart."
