1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

A couple of days ago I finished this game with another buddy of mine, Graham, who took part in the Annotations Project Part 2.  Graham is a Class C 1400+ player whose play is reminiscent of that of The Dentist.  He can play well for some parts of the game and has offered up a few good suggestions in the chat in our latest game.  Alas, one slip up in the opening for Graham cost him more than an arm and a leg!  After a double e pawn opening I decided to try The Centre Game."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"2. d4 - this move characterises the Centre Game.  The main line is PxP, 3. QxP and then the WQ usually moves to e3."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"2. d4 - this move characterises the Centre Game.  The main line is PxP, 3. QxP and then the WQ usually moves to e3."
4,exd4,e5d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3pP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"3. Nf3 - I try an unusual line here, it is a gambit.  This will bring about swift development at the cost of a pawn.  This turns out to be a delayed Danish Gambit which is a favourite of my Expert Buddy, Jim Friar (Therealjimfriar)."
