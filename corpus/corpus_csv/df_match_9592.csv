1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The story of this game: Black recovers from some opening mistakes, holding a difficult defensive position for a while. White tries a sacrifice to break black's defenses, and black manages to make the material advantage from the sacrifice count in his favor rather than white's."

It's safer than usual because the queens and 2 minor pieces have already been exchanged away. From here on out, exchanges benefit black, precisely because they make the centralized king more of a help and less of a problem.

The alternative is to lose the d pawn and any pretense of central control."
25,Bc4,f1c4,r1b4r/1p1knp1p/p2p1p2/4p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b - - 3 13,Targeting the doubled pawns makes perfect sense here.
