1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi all! I'm back with a brief look at the next game in this training series, in which chicoboy catches me in an overconfident play and makes me pay dearly for it! This game is all about mindset--when you hold all the cards, remember that you get to make the threats!"
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"?! I've been playing the Latvian Gambit in these games, simply because it is a fun opening and full of energetic play from both sides."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"?! I've been playing the Latvian Gambit in these games, simply because it is a fun opening and full of energetic play from both sides."
4,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"?! I've been playing the Latvian Gambit in these games, simply because it is a fun opening and full of energetic play from both sides."
5,d3,d2d3,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"Personally, I think this is too passive. White should simply accept the gambit with 3.Nxe5 (or do so a move from now, with 3.d4! fxe4 4.Nxe5)."
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/2n5/4pp2/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,Black develops a Knight that can be troublesome in this opening and defends e5.
7,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/2n5/4pp2/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,"As White is continuing to play passively, Black develops in an aggressive posture."
8,Bb4,f8b4,r1bqk1nr/pppp2pp/2n5/4pp2/1b2P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 3 5,"As White is continuing to play passively, Black develops in an aggressive posture."
9,Bd2,c1d2,r1bqk1nr/pppp2pp/2n5/4pp2/1b2P3/2NP1N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 4 5,Breaking the pin.
10,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/pppp2pp/2n2n2/4pp2/1b2P3/2NP1N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 5 6,Probably a bit inaccurate--moving pieces more than once in the opening is generally a waste of time. Note that this does not actually lose the e-pawn for White: 6...fxe4 7.Nxf6+ Qxf6 8.dxe4 holds just fine.
11,Nd5,c3d5,r1bqk2r/pppp2pp/2n2n2/3Npp2/1b2P3/3P1N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 6 6,Probably a bit inaccurate--moving pieces more than once in the opening is generally a waste of time. Note that this does not actually lose the e-pawn for White: 6...fxe4 7.Nxf6+ Qxf6 8.dxe4 holds just fine.
12,fxe4,f5e4,r1bqk2r/pppp2pp/2n2n2/3Np3/1b2p3/3P1N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,Note how many lines of exchange there are from this position. Nearly every developed piece is looking down one barrel or another. The surprising thing is that none of the lines win any material for anyone.
13,Nxf6+,d5f6,r1bqk2r/pppp2pp/2n2N2/4p3/1b2p3/3P1N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"?! Black wants to keep a strong center pawn mass and open the g-file for Rook play against the White kingside as well, but 7...Qxf6 was probably more sound as it gives Black the option to shift the Queen over to g6 and pressure the hard-to-defend e-pawn."
14,gxf6,g7f6,r1bqk2r/pppp3p/2n2p2/4p3/1b2p3/3P1N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,"?! Black wants to keep a strong center pawn mass and open the g-file for Rook play against the White kingside as well, but 7...Qxf6 was probably more sound as it gives Black the option to shift the Queen over to g6 and pressure the hard-to-defend e-pawn."
15,dxe4,d3e4,r1bqk2r/pppp3p/2n2p2/4p3/1b2P3/5N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,"White wants to discourage Black from taking on e4 and losing the right to castle in return, though at the current rate the pieces are disappearing, Black may not care."
16,d5,d7d5,r1bqk2r/ppp4p/2n2p2/3pp3/1b2P3/5N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 9,"White wants to discourage Black from taking on e4 and losing the right to castle in return, though at the current rate the pieces are disappearing, Black may not care."
17,Bxb4,d2b4,r1bqk2r/ppp4p/2n2p2/3pp3/1B2P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 9,"White wants to discourage Black from taking on e4 and losing the right to castle in return, though at the current rate the pieces are disappearing, Black may not care."
18,Nxb4,c6b4,r1bqk2r/ppp4p/5p2/3pp3/1n2P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 10,"I think this is inaccurate. White is clearly aiming to win the d5 pawn, but Black can simply play..."
19,c3,c2c3,r1bqk2r/ppp4p/5p2/3pp3/1n2P3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 10,"I think this is inaccurate. White is clearly aiming to win the d5 pawn, but Black can simply play..."
20,dxe4,d5e4,r1bqk2r/ppp4p/5p2/4p3/1n2p3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 11,"Now Black has an extra pawn, but White's position is a bit more stable. It remains to be seen whether Black can hold onto his advanced center with so few pieces developed to back it up!"
21,Nd2,f3d2,r1bqk2r/ppp4p/5p2/4p3/1n2p3/2P5/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 11,"I don't know what I think about this move. White prepares to play Qh5+ and re-energie his development, but this still feels a bit passive. 11.cxb4 Qxd1+! (not 11...exf3 12.Qxf3) 12.Rxd1 exf3 13.gxf3 looks a bit more even."
22,Nd3+,b4d3,r1bqk2r/ppp4p/5p2/4p3/4p3/2Pn4/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 12,"Black's center is hugely advanced, but it's still unclear whether that's a strength or a weakness! White now has 13.Qh5+! and a complex position develops after 13...Ke7 14.f4 Qd5 15.O-O-O Qxa2 16.fxe5 where Black may have a slight edge but it's hard to see how to capitalize on it."
23,Bxd3,f1d3,r1bqk2r/ppp4p/5p2/4p3/4p3/2PB4/PP1N1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 12,"Black's center is hugely advanced, but it's still unclear whether that's a strength or a weakness! White now has 13.Qh5+! and a complex position develops after 13...Ke7 14.f4 Qd5 15.O-O-O Qxa2 16.fxe5 where Black may have a slight edge but it's hard to see how to capitalize on it."
24,exd3,e4d3,r1bqk2r/ppp4p/5p2/4p3/8/2Pp4/PP1N1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 13,"Black's center is hugely advanced, but it's still unclear whether that's a strength or a weakness!

25,Ne4,d2e4,r1bqk2r/ppp4p/5p2/4p3/4N3/2Pp4/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 13,"? I think this is probably a mistake. White wants to lock up the black center and create some space for his troops, but this allows 13...h5!, which keeps the WQ in check and gives Black time to develop. 13.Qh5+ immediately was stronger."
26,f5,f6f5,r1bqk2r/ppp4p/8/4pp2/4N3/2Pp4/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 14,"? In a rush to push the center, Black misses his chance to gain time for development with 13...h5! Allowing the WQ to invade, with no pieces to repel her, is dangerous at best."
27,Qh5+,d1h5,r1bqk2r/ppp4p/8/4pp1Q/4N3/2Pp4/PP3PPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 1 14,! The best move. White's Knight can relocate as needed once he sees where the BK goes.
28,Kf8,e8f8,r1bq1k1r/ppp4p/8/4pp1Q/4N3/2Pp4/PP3PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 2 15,"White keeps up the checks. Ideally he'll be able to maneuver the BK to a space where he can retreat the Knight with check, keeping ahold of his initiative. Black must play extremely carefully, as he has basically no developed pieces with which to defend his King."
29,Qh6+,h5h6,r1bq1k1r/ppp4p/7Q/4pp2/4N3/2Pp4/PP3PPP/R3K2R b KQ - 3 15,"White keeps up the checks. Ideally he'll be able to maneuver the BK to a space where he can retreat the Knight with check, keeping ahold of his initiative. Black must play extremely carefully, as he has basically no developed pieces with which to defend his King."
30,Ke7,f8e7,r1bq3r/ppp1k2p/7Q/4pp2/4N3/2Pp4/PP3PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 4 16,"?? This was played without thinking too hard about it--Black doesn't feel that White's attack is that dangerous. It's not good enough; correct was 15...Kf7, because..."
31,Qf6+,h6f6,r1bq3r/ppp1k2p/5Q2/4pp2/4N3/2Pp4/PP3PPP/R3K2R b KQ - 5 16,! White spots a devastating combination.
