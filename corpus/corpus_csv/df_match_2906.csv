1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This game was over very quickly.  I underestimated the danger to my uncastled king when I tried attacking too soon.  My 11 yr old opponent quickly showed me the error of my ways.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"So far, so standard.  My main alternatives at this stage were .... 0-0, ....Nbd7 and ....Nc6.  I chose this because I wanted to pin the e4 pawn against White's Q as quickly as possible and follow up with an attack on the Nc3."
