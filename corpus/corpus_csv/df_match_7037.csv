I thought that the obvious d3 was too simple not to have been considered by white, so I decided to try to play aggressively. 
I thought about Qf3, and I remember I found a refutation move by white, but I cannot remember which one. Of course, after Nc3, black has to cope with the possibility of Ne4.
I considered white's b3, in order to get a good pin against my knight, and the possible tactic after Nd3+, taking the rook. Still, I didn't see a clear win, and white hasn't to play b3 inmediately.
So I played Qe7, following one of the thematic moves of this opening, but looking hard where would it lead me to..."

But it has a disadvantage: it blocks the white queen's action. 
I considered d6 (but it was as to say Qe7 had no point).
Then, a4, trying to prevent white to develop his dsb on b2, but this position is so good for white he can easily let me take a4xb3!
Then I considered g6, Qh6, but I cannot go on in chasing the queen... f5...? maybe. But maybe ""chasing the queen"" had another roads: 
h6! I think, given the bad black position, it is a good move, since it threats g6, winning the queen!
White has a few move here: g3, hoping to exchange queens on h4 (leaving him a direct hit on my kingside in trade of doubled pawns in the h file - but he can use those pawns for a future attack, so maybe it is a good trade for him. Maybe I can improve this, some way.
