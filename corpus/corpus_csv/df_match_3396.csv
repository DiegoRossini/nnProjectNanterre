3,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/8/6P1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 2,"I decided to play for the Nf6/e6/b6 structure which is, more or less, a generally reliable all-purpose formation. If 3. e4 then I figured I could reply with 3...d5 inviting a French structure with 4.e5 Nfd7 5.d4 c5 6.c3 Nc6 7.Nf3 Qb6 8.O-O Be7 or possibly 4.exd5 exd5 with a nicely active open position."
