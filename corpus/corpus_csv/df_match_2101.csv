1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"White opens with a force using e4.  Bobby Fischer preferred this open.  He was an exceptional chess player as we all know.  Spassky liked d4 open and Spassky was as well a very professional player.  In my own mind I like e4 over d4 but I've used d4 after seeing my opponent might not have experience with it and that is the only time I use d4 white open: to upset the expected.  All have time to look into the history (past games) with an opponent and we should all take advantage of doing so.  I mean take the time to see what the opponent likes to do and why it is so.  

The Huntress has made, in my own personalized mind, the strongest open with e4 just like Bobby Fischer in the 1970s.  Since then this open has not been proven wrong and I respect the Huntress.  When I face e4 by white I choose Caro Kann mostly and sometimes Sicilian (SHEV) or Alekhine's.  I detest the Ruy Lopez defense along with the Giuccio Piano.  These black defenses can be torn apart very quickly especially if white (who opens e4) knows the King's Gambit."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"My team chess player enters into the losing Ruy Lopez.  Why? All white has to do now is move pawn to f4 or bishop to c4 to kill black with a 1900's proven white attack.  It is called the King's Gambit either accepted or declined by black.  Either way black is in for it faster than expected.  See my own history here as 9422m against the Ruy Lopez.  The Gambit is not here to extend a game; rather, it is here to win the game as soon as possible against the slow Ruy."
3,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,"Standard but first the f2 pawn should have been moved to f4 BEFORE THIS MOVE.  The King's Gambit pushes the king bishop pawn out to the line to be taken FOR POSITION.  This position is not at all in accordance to the King's Gambit.  White is just rolling along with the slow Ruy Lopez to wait and take advantage instead of finishing the game quickly with the King's Gambit.  
You chess players can look up the King's Gambit and see how many chapters are dedicated to it.  It shows how fast and how complex the open becomes to crush black in many different scenarios."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 3,"It is possible for white to check the king by taking f7 and bring the black king out of protection after black puts king knight to f6.  As well, the white queen is along a diagonal to continue or support attack directly against the black king.  My suspicion is black felt white would do something else and so it comes...."
5,d3,d2d3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 3,Now the game goes with white on the offense.  If I was black at this point I'd be thinking about infantry formation to protect my king and move in another direction.  Here black has the choice for the for the infantry point formation similar to the Caro Kann but instead Black wants to get a knight ahead of his troops into play.....
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 4,...thusly. I am thinking this is an okay move so far.
7,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 4,"So now the game is controlled by the slow Ruy instead of a Caro or Sicilian or Alekine's Defense.  It is going to be a bout for many rounds before either is able to make a TKO or KO.  It is going to last longer than it should last.  My player, hangatyr, believes in boxing to the 15th round by using the Ruy Lopez.  I say why waste the time using a Ruy Lopez and if anyone uses a Ruy Lopez on me I just go King's Gambit to make the bouts fast and furious to end with blood all over the mat and a knock out in the end."

9,Ng5,f3g5,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p1N1/2B1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 4 5,I wouldn't have done it this way if I was white.  I am thinking white is a bit off in sequence for effect here....
10,d5,d7d5,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/2bpp1N1/2B1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,Aggressive.  Very.
11,exd5,e4d5,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/2bPp1N1/2B5/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,Center of the board is in the mind of black and black is getting into the center of the board to take control....
12,Nxd5,f6d5,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n5/2bnp1N1/2B5/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,All by trading himself (black) to the center of the board to control it.
13,Qf3,d1f3,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n5/2bnp1N1/2B5/3P1Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 1 7,"Now comes out the white queen to do in f7.  Seems a good thing to do.  Black has a defense, however.  The best defense can also be wrapped up in an offense as we know....."
14,Be6,c8e6,r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2n1b3/2bnp1N1/2B5/3P1Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 2 8,A simple move by a bishop makes the board more complicated.  Anytime you can make a board more complicated (i.e. using the King's Gambit against a slow Ruy Lopez) DO IT!
15,Nxe6,g5e6,r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2n1N3/2bnp3/2B5/3P1Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 8,"Seems to be the best white, who is on the offense, can do at this point....."
16,fxe6,f7e6,r2qk2r/ppp3pp/2n1p3/2bnp3/2B5/3P1Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 9,...but white's queen is all of a sudden on her lonesome.  The most powerful piece is as effective as only a rook or bishop.  In the meanwhile black's queen is deciding when to move before moving.  When she moves she will make sure her loyalty to her king is eternal to die for him!
17,c3,c2c3,r2qk2r/ppp3pp/2n1p3/2bnp3/2B5/2PP1Q2/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 9,White is not sure what to do and so as someone said a long time ago why not just push a pawn and see what happens and that guy lost the game straightway.
18,Qf6,d8f6,r3k2r/ppp3pp/2n1pq2/2bnp3/2B5/2PP1Q2/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 1 10,I don't know if I was black I would do this but in a recent game I had to.  It all comes down to what the players opposing each other feel most comfortable doing.  If trading away queens feels better I can't say it is always bad.  I learned a long time ago to avoid trading my queen with the opposition but I confess I've done it.
19,Qxf6,f3f6,r3k2r/ppp3pp/2n1pQ2/2bnp3/2B5/2PP4/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 10,The trade of queens.
20,gxf6,g7f6,r3k2r/ppp4p/2n1pp2/2bnp3/2B5/2PP4/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 11,The only realistic way for black to capture the white queen for the obvious reason.
