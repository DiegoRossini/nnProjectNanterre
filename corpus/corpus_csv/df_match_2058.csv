1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This is my first game with bridgecommander. I am playing black. Please comment on the annotation.
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I wanted to do something different, probably why I never gained ground. Moved c6 in preparation for d5."
3,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Since I never really opened with c6 before, I was unprepared for this advance. Although in hindsight, it seems like it shouldn't affect my plan, butIdid decide to not push d5."
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2pp4/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"I wish I would have moved d5 instead of d6. I typically am more aggressive and wanted to try a defensive move instead. Also, this move took the game out of the database. Probably more of a disadvantage for me to do that."
5,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2pp4/8/3PPP2/8/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,That looks imposing.
6,Qc7,d8c7,rnb1kbnr/ppq1pppp/2pp4/8/3PPP2/8/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,Decided to castle queen side.
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnb1kbnr/ppq1pppp/2pp4/8/3PPP2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,"People have done this to me a lot, so I've been trying it myself to pin the knight. I think the goal appears to be to disrupt the kingside pawn structure."
8,Bg4,c8g4,rn2kbnr/ppq1pppp/2pp4/8/3PPPb1/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 3 5,"People have done this to me a lot, so I've been trying it myself to pin the knight. I think the goal appears to be to disrupt the kingside pawn structure."
9,h3,h2h3,rn2kbnr/ppq1pppp/2pp4/8/3PPPb1/5N1P/PPP3P1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"Worked as planned, although not much of an advantage."
10,Bxf3,g4f3,rn2kbnr/ppq1pppp/2pp4/8/3PPP2/5b1P/PPP3P1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"I decided to trade my LSB for the knight. Only real benefit I could see is to further disturb the king's pawns, but the there's that massive pawn onslaught down the middle I'll have to deal with. Never been here before, so we'll see what happens."
11,Qxf3,d1f3,rn2kbnr/ppq1pppp/2pp4/8/3PPP2/5Q1P/PPP3P1/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"Oops, I guess that really didn't work out at all. I just traded my bishop for a knight for no apparent benefit."
12,Nd7,b8d7,r3kbnr/ppqnpppp/2pp4/8/3PPP2/5Q1P/PPP3P1/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 1 7,Now just trying to castle before the pawns attack.
13,Bc4,f1c4,r3kbnr/ppqnpppp/2pp4/8/2BPPP2/5Q1P/PPP3P1/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 2 7,"Debated e6 to defend, but the king seems very vulnerable. It think I'll give up f7 and just castle now."
14,O-O-O,e8c8,2kr1bnr/ppqnpppp/2pp4/8/2BPPP2/5Q1P/PPP3P1/RNB1K2R w KQ - 3 8,I don't really feel much safer.
15,O-O,e1g1,2kr1bnr/ppqnpppp/2pp4/8/2BPPP2/5Q1P/PPP3P1/RNB2RK1 b - - 4 8,"Now that I see the king castle short, white doesn't really look very vulnerable with all my pieces undeveloped. What a mess."
16,Kb8,c8b8,1k1r1bnr/ppqnpppp/2pp4/8/2BPPP2/5Q1P/PPP3P1/RNB2RK1 w - - 5 9,I wanted to protect my a pawn. Definitely should have moved e6.
17,Bxf7,c4f7,1k1r1bnr/ppqnpBpp/2pp4/8/3PPP2/5Q1P/PPP3P1/RNB2RK1 b - - 0 9,First blood and nothing I can do about it.
18,Ngf6,g8f6,1k1r1b1r/ppqnpBpp/2pp1n2/8/3PPP2/5Q1P/PPP3P1/RNB2RK1 w - - 1 10,Trying to get my knight out of trouble. Really pointless with those center pawns. I'm way out developed here.
19,e5,e4e5,1k1r1b1r/ppqnpBpp/2pp1n2/4P3/3P1P2/5Q1P/PPP3P1/RNB2RK1 b - - 0 10,The white pawn troop make their move.
20,Nd5,f6d5,1k1r1b1r/ppqnpBpp/2pp4/3nP3/3P1P2/5Q1P/PPP3P1/RNB2RK1 w - - 1 11,The white pawn troop make their move.
21,c4,c2c4,1k1r1b1r/ppqnpBpp/2pp4/3nP3/2PP1P2/5Q1P/PP4P1/RNB2RK1 b - - 0 11,No time to develop without losing that knight. Not moving e6 was a big mistake.
22,Nb4,d5b4,1k1r1b1r/ppqnpBpp/2pp4/4P3/1nPP1P2/5Q1P/PP4P1/RNB2RK1 w - - 1 12,Wondering if Nb6 would have been better. Although I think a black c5 would have made me move it again.
