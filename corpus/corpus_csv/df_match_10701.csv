2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The most popular answer to the King's opening, since this movement keep certain simmetry in the center, which is possitive for the black side"

8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3P4/5p2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,"Now, there is several ways to follow the gambit properly, I chose this variant to go on the attack, though perhaps the more logical way of doing it would be e4 or even c6"
