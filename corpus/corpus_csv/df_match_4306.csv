5,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,"This is the Ruy Lopez. I don't encounter it too much, but I hear that it is a great opening. My lag of experience for very complex openings prevents me from using it. However, I counterattack this opening with moderate ease."
6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe from my experience that this is the Berlin Defence."
7,Bxc6,b5c6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2B2n2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,"This is not part of the opening played, therefore, it is an inaccurate move. 4.O-O is the main line and 4.d3 is the Mortimer variation while 4.d4 is the Nyholm Attack."
8,bxc6,b7c6,r1bqkb1r/p1pp1ppp/2p2n2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,I take toward the center.

11,Nxe5,f3e5,r1bqkb1r/p1p2ppp/2p2n2/3pN3/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,As predicted.
12,Bb7,c8b7,r2qkb1r/pbp2ppp/2p2n2/3pN3/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 7,Why the other Knight? Can't White play a little less agressive?
13,Bg5,c1g5,r2qkb1r/pbp2ppp/2p2n2/3pN1B1/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 2 7,Why the other Knight? Can't White play a little less agressive?

15,Qf3,d1f3,r2qkb1r/pbp2ppp/5n2/2ppN1B1/4P3/3P1Q2/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R b KQkq - 1 8,"Now, White is going too far. His Queen is in a rotten place, and there is no other way to attack my Knight. I call this a mistake."
16,dxe4,d5e4,r2qkb1r/pbp2ppp/5n2/2p1N1B1/4p3/3P1Q2/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R w KQkq - 0 9,"I don't really like my move either, but he doesn't catch it."
17,Qf4,f3f4,r2qkb1r/pbp2ppp/5n2/2p1N1B1/4pQ2/3P4/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R b KQkq - 1 9,"We are so occupied with the Kingside that my LSB is now now just sitting there lonley, lost, forgotten, abandoned..."

19,Bxf6,g5f6,r2qk2r/pbp1bppp/5B2/2p1N3/4pQ2/3P4/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R b KQkq - 0 10,"When calculating analysis, I was informed by a grandmaster that Bishop pairs are worth a lot (even more so in the middle game). I am shocked that my opponent didn't realize how useless he has been treating his Bishops."

22,Bxe4,b7e4,r2qk2r/p1p2ppp/5b2/2p1N3/4b3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R w KQkq - 0 12,"Here comes my once forgotten Bishop who sacrifices herself for the Queen. This opens way for her sibling, the DSB, to carry out the next assault."
23,Nf3,e5f3,r2qk2r/p1p2ppp/5b2/2p5/4b3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R b KQkq - 1 12,"Another severe blunder by White, who is now almost entirely destroyed. 12.dxe4 Bxe5 13.c3 should have been played."
