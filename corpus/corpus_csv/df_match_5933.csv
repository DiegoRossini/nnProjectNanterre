2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I wasn't expecting this
3,d3,d2d3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Chiefly to get the black bishop into picture as the pawn on c8 has exposed
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,reinforcements at the center of the field...
5,f3,f2f3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4P3/3P1P2/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,reinforcements at the center of the field...
6,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2p5/3pp3/4P3/3P1P2/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Same thing he does...
7,f4,f3f4,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2p5/3pp3/4PP2/3P4/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,He gets in a horse
8,Nd7,b8d7,r1bqkbnr/pp1n1ppp/2p5/3pp3/4PP2/3P4/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,He gets in a horse
9,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pp1n1ppp/2p5/3pp3/4PP2/3P1N2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,So do I to put more pressure on e5
10,f6,f7f6,r1bqkbnr/pp1n2pp/2p2p2/3pp3/4PP2/3P1N2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,This effectively prevents the horse on g8 to be in picture early in the game
11,f5,f4f5,r1bqkbnr/pp1n2pp/2p2p2/3ppP2/4P3/3P1N2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,This effectively prevents the horse on g8 to be in picture early in the game
12,dxe4,d5e4,r1bqkbnr/pp1n2pp/2p2p2/4pP2/4p3/3P1N2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,He gets things moving...
13,dxe4,d3e4,r1bqkbnr/pp1n2pp/2p2p2/4pP2/4P3/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,So do I
14,Qa5+,d8a5,r1b1kbnr/pp1n2pp/2p2p2/q3pP2/4P3/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,CHECK!... My King is exposed!
15,Bd2,c1d2,r1b1kbnr/pp1n2pp/2p2p2/q3pP2/4P3/5N2/PPPB2PP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 2 8,Could have brought the pawn at c2 forward but this is more attacking. that would also prevent the horse at b1 to come out to the center
16,Qb6,a5b6,r1b1kbnr/pp1n2pp/1qp2p2/4pP2/4P3/5N2/PPPB2PP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 3 9,Seems like a retreating move but actually the pawn at b2 (and the rook at a1 eventually) is under threat as the bishop is out!
17,b3,b2b3,r1b1kbnr/pp1n2pp/1qp2p2/4pP2/4P3/1P3N2/P1PB2PP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 9,"I read that :)
And brought the pawn in danger forward"
18,Nh6,g8h6,r1b1kb1r/pp1n2pp/1qp2p1n/4pP2/4P3/1P3N2/P1PB2PP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 1 10,The horse couldn't come in the center and thus went the other way
19,c4,c2c4,r1b1kb1r/pp1n2pp/1qp2p1n/4pP2/2P1P3/1P3N2/P2B2PP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 10,"Steady approach towards the queen.
Not a big plan."
20,Ng4,h6g4,r1b1kb1r/pp1n2pp/1qp2p2/4pP2/2P1P1n1/1P3N2/P2B2PP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 1 11,"Oops!
If the horse comes to f2, the queen and rook are in compromising positions!"
21,Qe2,d1e2,r1b1kb1r/pp1n2pp/1qp2p2/4pP2/2P1P1n1/1P3N2/P2BQ1PP/RN2KB1R b KQkq - 2 11,"I read that and brought queen forward to save the day.
But black is in much better position now as the queen at b6 is attacking areas near the castle."
22,Bb4,f8b4,r1b1k2r/pp1n2pp/1qp2p2/4pP2/1bP1P1n1/1P3N2/P2BQ1PP/RN2KB1R w KQkq - 3 12,"Good move by black. The bishop is pinned with the king.
If I take the bishop with the bishop at d2, the black queen will replace it and check!
White queen has to come in the middle for it (so that king does not move and castling is possible)
This might have been a better option that what I did eventually."
23,h3,h2h3,r1b1k2r/pp1n2pp/1qp2p2/4pP2/1bP1P1n1/1P3N1P/P2BQ1P1/RN2KB1R b KQkq - 0 12,"Moved the pawn forward to threaten the horse instead of taking the bishop at b4
He still has the choice open to kill the bishop d2 with b4"
