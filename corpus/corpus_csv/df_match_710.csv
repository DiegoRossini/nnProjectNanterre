As any good scientist will tell you, the smaller the sample size the less reliable the results. And, though I do love a pawn chain, the mealy movement of the f pawn in this position appeals to the tipsy not, especially since I find the Sicilian susceptible to a heavy weight of material on the queenside. I also find that the impressive side-by-side combination of the knights and bishops should suit my desire for aggressive space-grabbing in the opening and early middle (regardless of what opening I play).

I do remember some senior player here on GK telling me the f pawn should never move 1 in its first movement, save for when necessitated in end-games. I've lived by that for a long time, applying it also to the c pawn. The exception is when I've had the chance to erect pawn chains though usually they were much larger pawn chains than 3 when I've broken that rule. Hmmmm."
