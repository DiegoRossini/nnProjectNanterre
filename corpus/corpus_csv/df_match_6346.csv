1,c3,c2c3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/2P5/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

If you have read about my unnecessary concession of a Low Draw against my Class D buddy The Dentist due to some optical illusions then spare a thought for my former Class B opponent dmaestro.  In this game, Glenda scared him into waving the white flag with her imposing presence on the h column.   At least I only gave away half a point - at least dmaestro also has the consolation of the game being unrated however.   But gameknot analysis will show that he did have a defense to my mating attack.  Here is the link to the Gameknot Analysis version:- http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=14125809&rnd=0.0035182255284116892.  Anyway, on with the game in which I decided to experiment with the Sargossa opening which is 1. c3."
