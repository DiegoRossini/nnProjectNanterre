1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"My first move will be the standard king's pawn opening, a favorite for most intermediate chess players."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The opponent defends the center by copying my move, so far this seems like a normal chess game."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"I now attack his pawn with my knight, of course we're going to expect our oponent to defend it."
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"which he does, with his pawn, so far so good."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"I now move up my other knight, to protect my pawn but to also add to my evil plan."

9,Nxe5,f3e5,rn1qkbnr/p1p2ppp/1p1p4/4N3/2B1P1b1/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"I make the ""wrong move"" and give up my queen, hoping that he takes her."
