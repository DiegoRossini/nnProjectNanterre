It does get the queen out, and its' hard to chase, but I think taking with the pawn would have had more lasting benefits as it would control more center and allows his LSB to develop better."

17,Be3,c1e3,r1bqk1nr/1pp2ppp/p1n1p3/8/3PP3/2P1BN2/P1Q2PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 2 9,I complete minor piece development and have a strong center and well developed pieces. I believe white is slightly better here.

This also allows my rook to capture the pawn on f7. It's tempting to use the knight, but I have to use the rook because the LSB is attacking it."
