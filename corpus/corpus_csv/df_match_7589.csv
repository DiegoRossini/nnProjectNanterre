1,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/2N5/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 1,"I'm unsure how often this is played, but where I play I haven't seen it before.  It seems a fairly logical move, developing a piece early on and pressuring the centre light squares."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/8/2N5/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,So I played what felt natural to me.  c5 allows me to attempt to control the dark squares whilst ceding the light ones to White.  I figured that White would be forced to play either e4 or f4 to attempt to keep things even.
3,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/5P2/2N5/PPPPP1PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"As expected, White plays f4."
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/5P2/2N5/PPPPP1PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Development moves.  Felt I was already beginning to gain a small advantage.
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/5P2/2N2N2/PPPPP1PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,Development moves.  Felt I was already beginning to gain a small advantage.
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2pp4/5P2/2N2N2/PPPPP1PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,Development moves.  Felt I was already beginning to gain a small advantage.

9,Bb5+,f1b5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/1Bpp4/5P2/2N1PN2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,"White makes his first attack, I think mainly to test the resolve of his unknown opponent.  I think I preferred d3, which although slightly passive would allow White to continue developing instead of wasting a tempo."
10,Bd7,c8d7,rn1qkb1r/pp1b1ppp/4pn2/1Bpp4/5P2/2N1PN2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 6,Better than Nfd7 or Nbd7 due to the direct challenge of the Bishop.
11,Bxd7+,b5d7,rn1qkb1r/pp1B1ppp/4pn2/2pp4/5P2/2N1PN2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"White decides to exchange Bishops, which I think benefits Black more than it does White."
