1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Here is another game in Concordborn's Sicilian Pelikan MT.  It has a lot of twists and turns to it and both sides made big blunders.  These blunders thankfully proved not to be fatal for either side, although it did result in me conceding a low draw in the endgame.  At least my opponent is a fellow Class A player, and if a load of Experts and Masters had not timed out on me, Tamas and I would have had similar ratings.  So, how did this latest drama unfold?  Well, to follow this game, the Gameknot Analysis link is as follows:- http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17836218&rnd=0.45445301136640437"
