1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Again with the Centre Game. The first time I used this series of moves, I won fairly convincingly, and I like this, as my bishops control two diagonals, and my queen controls another. I also have a high success rate with this opening."

4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Is this another centre game? All four royal pawns are in the centre of the board, and I'm hoping to open up the queens' file by 3. dxe5 dxe4, followed by 4. Qxd8+ Kxd8 5. Bg5+, so I could eventually castle queenside, hopefully checking. (By royal pawns, I mean the pawns starting in front of the king and queen)."
