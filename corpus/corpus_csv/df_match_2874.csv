10,d6,d7d6,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2nppn2/2p5/2P5/2N2NP1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"black avoids this and plays a flexible move that leaves options open, although white can now look at d6 as being a potential weakness by playing d4 followed by e4 and clamping down on the d5 square so as to apply pressure to d6"
11,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2nppn2/2p5/2P5/2N2NP1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 6,"possibly a slight innaccuracy in move order, I was thinking that I should castle before opening the centre however its not as though the centre is going to be blown open and even if it were, white can always castle at the drop of a hat. instead playing d4 immediatly suggests itself, the problem with castling first is that it leaves black with more options. For example black could now play ...e5 to clamp down on the d4 square and enter a common enough set up. this isnt paticularly concerning for white but weather 6...e5 is good or bad for black doesnt matter, the point is that its better to play in a way that restricts your opponents options thus d4 immediatly should be preffered"

The thing is that blacks lack of space leaves him with no real counterplay white can take all the time he wants to calmly prepare moves like f4, b3, Qe2, Be3/a3 then followed up with doubling up on the d file and applying pressure against d6. Here I played Qe2 so that I could clear the way for a rook to come to the d file quickly whilst it also overprotects c4 and e4 plus it xrays the b5 square which makes it extremly difficult for black to effect any useful pawn break. Other moves like b3 or Be3 were also worth considering but I wasnt entirely sure if I wanted my bishop on e3 or a3 yet"

To be fair it is difficult in this sort of position to come up with a viable plan for the blackside, but if I were to have a go I would probably try making something happen on the queenside by considering moves that try to take advantage of the loose knight on c3 plans like Na7 with b6-b5 or Nc6-e5 followed again by a b6-b5 break even ideas like Rfc8 are worth considering if they attempt counterplay Nd7 is another possiblity that comes to mind, it would protect  b6 and also allow the bishop to come to c6 which seems like a better place than passivly sitting on e7. I think probably Na7 or Nd7 are blacks best shots here the problem is that these plans require alot of tempi to implement and in that time the whole dynamics of the position could very easily have changed"

F4 was proberly a better move gaining more space and depriving black use of the e5 square or maybe Rad1 was also a better move"

I had been thinking of getting my bishop to a3 and so played this so that I could play Be3 and resopond to a knight attacking it by simply dropping back to c1 (then on to a3) and not have to be dissrupting the communications between my rooks. As it is this is simply a mistake because by leaving my bishop hanging out to dry black can now play 17...Nxe4! or Bxe4
