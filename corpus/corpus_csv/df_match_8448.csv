1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"Hi everyone!

Have you ever been in a dodgy position against a lower rated player and considered trying to buy your way out of it with a draw offer in order to concede a few points to avoid the loss of many?  I certainly did in this game but guess what, my gut instinct kicked in and told me to hang fire.  I'm glad I listened to it because my opponent timed out!  Anyhow on with the action, white kicks off with 1. Nf3 the Reti Opening."
