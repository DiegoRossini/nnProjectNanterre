1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Trompowski Attack.  This line is quite distant from the beaten track, and can lead to some bizarre-looking positions.  Eccentric as it is, the 'normal' rules for the placement of pieces and pawns don't always apply in this sort of game."

4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3p2B1/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,Reasonable developing move.  Black has plenty of other options.
5,e3,e2e3,r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3p2B1/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,Solid.  Also playable was 3.Nf3 - the Torre Attack.
6,f6,f7f6,r1bqkbnr/ppp1p1pp/2n2p2/3p2B1/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"In many popular openings, this sort of move doesn't get played at all.  But here is is fine: chasing the bishop and planning to establish a strong centre."
7,Bf4,g5f4,r1bqkbnr/ppp1p1pp/2n2p2/3p4/3P1B2/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,"Also playable was Bh4, but this is fine."
8,e5,e7e5,r1bqkbnr/ppp3pp/2n2p2/3pp3/3P1B2/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,Building a broad pawn centre at once.  Now you can see the real purpose of ...f6.
9,dxe5,d4e5,r1bqkbnr/ppp3pp/2n2p2/3pP3/5B2/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,There is no mileage to be got from Qh5ch(?).
10,fxe5,f6e5,r1bqkbnr/ppp3pp/2n5/3pp3/5B2/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,There is no mileage to be got from Qh5ch(?).
11,Bg3,f4g3,r1bqkbnr/ppp3pp/2n5/3pp3/8/4P1B1/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 6,There is no mileage to be got from Qh5ch(?).
12,e4,e5e4,r1bqkbnr/ppp3pp/2n5/3p4/4p3/4P1B1/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,"I will be honest here, and state that I do not know about this move.  My instinct suggests the pawns should be kept level (for the time being anyhow), keeping the g3-bishop locked up, and retaining a certain strategic flexibility.  Yet this advance does have its points: control of d3 and f3, and a slight crimp in White's K-side.  It's a judgement call."
13,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/ppp3pp/2n5/3p4/4p3/2N1P1B1/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 1 7,Striking the d5-pawn.
14,Be6,c8e6,r2qkbnr/ppp3pp/2n1b3/3p4/4p3/2N1P1B1/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 2 8,"Defending the d5-pawn.  Possibly 7...Nf6 was marginally the better option, but there isn't all that much in it."
15,Nh3,g1h3,r2qkbnr/ppp3pp/2n1b3/3p4/4p3/2N1P1BN/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 3 8,"In view of black's response, maybe Nge2 was the better option, still with the idea of Nf4 at some point.  Possibly White wanted to keep open the diagonal for the f1-bishop.  In that case, she might instead have played 8.Bb5, with 9.Nge2 to follow.  The line might have gone 8.Bb5 a6  9.Ba4 ... (9.Bxc6!? might tend to suit Black better) 9...Nf6  10.Nge2.  White can then follow with Bb3 and Nf4, adding to the pressure against Black's d-pawn."
16,Bxh3,e6h3,r2qkbnr/ppp3pp/2n5/3p4/4p3/2N1P1Bb/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 9,"A very interesting strategic decision.  For the 'minor exchange', Black doubles and isolates White's h-pawn, and generally mauls White' K-side structure.  But White need not in fact have allowed her K-side to be so mutilated.  See next..."
17,gxh3,g2h3,r2qkbnr/ppp3pp/2n5/3p4/4p3/2N1P1BP/PPP2P1P/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 9,"The obvious move, and just what Black was aiming for.  But White could instead have played 9.Qh5ch g6  10.Qxh3.  It is unlikely that Black would obtain anything but trouble after 10...d4? 11.exd4 and then 11...Nxd4 12.0-0-0 or 11...Qxd4  12.Rd1."
18,Nf6,g8f6,r2qkb1r/ppp3pp/2n2n2/3p4/4p3/2N1P1BP/PPP2P1P/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 10,"One might have preferred 10.Bb5, but by placing pressure against the Black centre in this way, White inhibits the advance of the Black d-pawn."
19,Bg2,f1g2,r2qkb1r/ppp3pp/2n2n2/3p4/4p3/2N1P1BP/PPP2PBP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 2 10,"One might have preferred 10.Bb5, but by placing pressure against the Black centre in this way, White inhibits the advance of the Black d-pawn."
20,g6,g7g6,r2qkb1r/ppp4p/2n2np1/3p4/4p3/2N1P1BP/PPP2PBP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 11,"This really is justified only if Black plans ...Bg7 to follow.  Otherwise is is simply a weakening move if (and when) Black castles on this wing.  Preferable seems ...Be7, or, better yet, ...Bb4.  After, say, 10...Bb4 11.0-0 Bxc3 12.bxc3, White would have been left with a mangled pawn structure right across the board.  The bishop pair and open files might not have compensated sufficiently for all the weaknesses incurred."
21,Qd2,d1d2,r2qkb1r/ppp4p/2n2np1/3p4/4p3/2N1P1BP/PPPQ1PBP/R3K2R b KQkq - 1 11,"Not so good, now, despite the 'double' pin (the knight is pinned against K and Q on the same diagonal).  White can drive the bishop off, or if Black does exchange, White gets to preserve the integrity of her Q-side."
22,Bb4,f8b4,r2qk2r/ppp4p/2n2np1/3p4/1b2p3/2N1P1BP/PPPQ1PBP/R3K2R w KQkq - 2 12,"Not so good, now, despite the 'double' pin (the knight is pinned against K and Q on the same diagonal).  White can drive the bishop off, or if Black does exchange, White gets to preserve the integrity of her Q-side."

Black's K-side is looking very porous, and White has the potential for developing a strong K-side attack: the open g-file; the weak dark squares, and the target sitting on g6, at which White's h-pawns might be aimed.

Instead 15.Bxe4 not only walked away with a pawn on account of the rook's pin on the d-file, but would have brought additional pressure against Black's centre and K-side.  E.g. 15.Bxe4 Nf6 16.Bd3 ... 17.Rag1."
