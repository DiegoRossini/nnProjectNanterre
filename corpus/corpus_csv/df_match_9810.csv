The main line is 1 ... d5, heading for a Dutch Defense Reversed with the main fight over control of e5, a line that can also be reached by way of the more flexible 1 ... g6.  Finally, for those who like immediate fireworks there's From's Gambit, 1 ... e5."

White decides to counter by forcing an immediate d2-d4, but Black already has a slight pull because of the awkwardness of White's pawn structure."

10,cxd4,c5d4,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppp1p/2n2np1/8/2Pp1P2/4PN2/PP4PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"The most logical way to attack White's pawn center.  This exchange and Black's next move remove pawn support for d4, fix White's d pawn as a target on the soon to be hot diagonal, and give Black the half-open c file.  If White then plays cxd5, he's left with an isolated d pawn and the pawn cover for his king has been disrupted on both wings.  For Black, 5 ... cxd4 and 6 ... d5 has the drawback of weakening e5, but White's weak pawns, lagging development and difficulty castling minimize the threat of a knight on e5."
