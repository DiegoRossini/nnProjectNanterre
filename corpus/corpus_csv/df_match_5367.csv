2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,Pretty standard opening for the Queen's pawn game.
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 2,Pretty standard opening for the Queen's pawn game.

6,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"This is the most popular option for black, you create an easy pocket to the attack the center pawn and you open the door for an easy king side castle."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"Nf3 is a good counter I think, white developments further and covers the center."
8,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,"Preparing the castle, but move is not as threatening."
9,Be2,f1e2,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 5,white responds by opening the door to his own king side castle. Be2 is better than Be3 because black can no longer pin the knight with Bg4.
10,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP1b1/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 4 6,As predicted.
11,O-O,e1g1,rn1qk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP1b1/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 5 6,"At this moment the position is a mirror image of the other, neither black or myself holds an advantage. That"
12,O-O,e8g8,rn1q1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PP1b1/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 6 7,"At this moment the position is a mirror image of the other, neither black or myself holds an advantage. That"
13,Bg5,c1g5,rn1q1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/6B1/3PP1b1/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 7 7,"At this moment the position is a mirror image of the other, neither black or myself holds an advantage. That"
14,Nbd7,b8d7,r2q1rk1/pppnppbp/3p1np1/6B1/3PP1b1/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 8 8,"This is I think the first mistake black makes. Nc6 would cutoff e5, which is where I want to push the offensive: right down the center."
15,e5,e4e5,r2q1rk1/pppnppbp/3p1np1/4P1B1/3P2b1/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 8,"From here on in, things start to get messy."
16,dxe5,d6e5,r2q1rk1/pppnppbp/5np1/4p1B1/3P2b1/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 9,"From here on in, things start to get messy."
17,dxe5,d4e5,r2q1rk1/pppnppbp/5np1/4P1B1/6b1/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 9,"From here on in, things start to get messy."
18,Ne8,f6e8,r2qnrk1/pppnppbp/6p1/4P1B1/6b1/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 1 10,"I think this move is also a mistake, Nh5 would be a better option because black doesn't have to surrender the initiative so much."
19,Nd4,f3d4,r2qnrk1/pppnppbp/6p1/4P1B1/3N2b1/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 2 10,"The pawn is not worth so much but e6, fx6, Nx6 leaves white in a pretty good place... or so it seems. If black takes the pawn, he removes a strategic threat but loses the bishop. Again the foresight of Be2, queen and bishop combinations work well together. But it was not meant to be; I made a mistake here. From here on in, black puts together a good combination to get the pawn off the table"
20,Bxe2,g4e2,r2qnrk1/pppnppbp/6p1/4P1B1/3N4/2N5/PPP1bPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 11,Forcing the trade
21,Qxe2,d1e2,r2qnrk1/pppnppbp/6p1/4P1B1/3N4/2N5/PPP1QPPP/R4RK1 b - - 0 11,"Black has gained a pawn, this was an error on my part since there is no way to easily recoup the material lose. Time to put together a counter attack"
22,Nxe5,d7e5,r2qnrk1/ppp1ppbp/6p1/4n1B1/3N4/2N5/PPP1QPPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 12,"Black has gained a pawn, this was an error on my part since there is no way to easily recoup the material lose. Time to put together a counter attack"

24,c6,c7c6,r2qnrk1/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/4n1B1/3N4/2N1Q3/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 13,Not sure why black makes this move. Maybe to protect the pawn so his queen can move out? But there isn't much of a threat to the pawn in the first place.
25,Rfd1,f1d1,r2qnrk1/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/4n1B1/3N4/2N1Q3/PPP2PPP/R2R2K1 b - - 1 13,"I am down material, but perhaps wining in terms of position."
