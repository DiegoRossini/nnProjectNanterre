1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I was so close to winning this game, and I was thinking at that time that this would be my best checkmate ever on GK. Two fatal mistakes later and that was snatched away from me!"
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I;d like to try something different with my opening sometime, but for now, I'm happy with the Silican"

5,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,"this is supposed to be a bad response to the Silican, but I'm not sure how to take advantage of this move..."
6,g6,g7g6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,"so I continue with normal development, preparing to fianchetto that bishop (thank you cadavre)"
7,c3,c2c3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/2p5/2B1P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,I guess this move was played to stop me advancing my knight
8,Bg7,f8g7,r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/2p5/2B1P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 5,bringing out his center pawn - White need to think about castling to protect his king

11,Qd3,d1d3,r1bqk2r/pp1pppbp/2n2np1/2p5/2BPP3/2PQ1N2/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 2 6,I'm not too sure why White decided to play this...I'd consider 6.Nbd2
12,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp1pppbp/2n2np1/2p5/2BPP3/2PQ1N2/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 3 7,this is where my move of memorised moves end - any move I make after this is based on my own decisions
13,Bf4,c1f4,r1bq1rk1/pp1pppbp/2n2np1/2p5/2BPPB2/2PQ1N2/PP3PPP/RN2K2R b KQ - 4 7,"hmmm.... again, White's motives escape me...for now (I've decided when annotating that unless it's significant to my analysis, I'll speak without the benefit of hindsight)"
14,d5,d7d5,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2n2np1/2pp4/2BPPB2/2PQ1N2/PP3PPP/RN2K2R w KQ - 0 8,preparing to challenge the center...

18,Nxe5,c6e5,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/2pnn3/2BP4/2PQ1N2/PP3PPP/RN2K2R w KQ - 0 10,I decide to trade with knight instead
19,dxe5,d4e5,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/2pnP3/2B5/2PQ1N2/PP3PPP/RN2K2R b KQ - 0 10,"in my first game with fiver (my other team match - I'll annotate that one as well) he was kind enough to sent me some basic chess rules from his team forum around mid-game. Here's one of them in play now - 'always attack with the weaker piece' (in this case, White attacks with the pawn instead of the knight) I know anyone looking at this annotation probably already knows this but I just thought I'd throw this in"
20,e6,e7e6,r1bq1rk1/pp3pbp/4p1p1/2pnP3/2B5/2PQ1N2/PP3PPP/RN2K2R w KQ - 0 11,"? I thimk I played this to free up the black queen, but it blocks my own white bishop in"
