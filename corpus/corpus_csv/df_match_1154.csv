1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The queens pawn opening is my bread and butter. It takes you into slower, more closed off games, which are the type of games I've come to love."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,A flexible move which watches over the e4 square and gives black still a lot of options. He's not committed to 1 specific opening just yet.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Playing this, I was praying that the opponent wouldn't transpose into the benoni with c5. Not that the benoni is impossible to beat, but it starts off things far more quickly then I'd like and it has quite a lot of theory."
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"The King's Indian Defence, black commits himself with this move to a hypermodern defence. Can't say I face it too often, but it's a viable option for black. Here I was expecting him to transpose into the grünfeld defence. Not sure why, he just seemed like the sort of guy who'd play the grünfeld."
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"Developing a knight, more common is Nc3, but this works too."
6,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,And now we're playing the grünfeld if memory serves me right.
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 4,And now we're playing the grünfeld if memory serves me right.
8,d5,d7d5,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3p4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,And now we're playing the grünfeld if memory serves me right.
9,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3p2B1/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"For whatever reason I was expecting e6, but black is perfectly fine delaying e6 or perhaps not even playing it at all. Bf4 was also an idea and perhaps slightly better. That being said, it's not too bad."
10,c6,c7c6,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/2p2np1/3p2B1/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Defending the pawn, it blocks off the knight of the natural square c6, but openings like the slav have proven time in time again that this isn't really a problem. He'll develop it via Nd7."
11,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/2p2np1/3P2B1/3P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"Looking back at it, I'm not sure why I traded. Probably to try and simplify the position a bit and in the future take a stab at b7 and d5 with Qb3. That idea still needs A LOT of work, but you never know in these type of elo's."
12,Nxd5,f6d5,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/3n2B1/3P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"I think recapturing with the pawn would have been better, since now I have e4 with tempo. His knight doesn't have a good square except f6 so either he trades with my knight or he moves back to f6. This is more or less handing me the center."
13,e4,e2e4,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/3n2B1/3PP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,What's it gonna be?
14,Nxc3,d5c3,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/6B1/3PP3/2n2N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,"Surprisingly he chooses for this option. Black gets counterplay via Qa5 pinning the c pawn, but if white manages to hold on to the center he'll have a very good game."
15,bxc3,b2c3,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/6B1/3PP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,"Surprisingly he chooses for this option. Black gets counterplay via Qa5 pinning the c pawn, but if white manages to hold on to the center he'll have a very good game."
16,Qa5,d8a5,rnb1k2r/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/q5B1/3PP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 9,"A good move, which immediately complicates things due to his bishop attacking the a1-h8 file. It also indirectly puts pressure on my previously good bishop, which now doesn't look quite as amazing anymore."
17,Qd2,d1d2,rnb1k2r/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/q5B1/3PP3/2P2N2/P2Q1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 2 9,"This move took me a few minutes, since I was considering moving my bishop to d2 and then following up with something along the lines of c4. I figured that might be a bit too ambitious, this defends the c-file and protects the a2 pawn so my rook can maybe target down the b-file or support the center in the near future. This comes at the cost of my bishop being unable to go back to c1 or d2 and maybe target the other side of the board, but considering his queen is there, I highly doubt that'd be a good idea anyway. If he chases my bishop with pawns, I'll respond with Bf4 -> Bg3."
18,c5,c6c5,rnb1k2r/pp2ppbp/6p1/q1p3B1/3PP3/2P2N2/P2Q1PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 10,dxc5 or d5 aren't options since Bxc3 means game over. This move took me a few minutes to find as well.
19,Rc1,a1c1,rnb1k2r/pp2ppbp/6p1/q1p3B1/3PP3/2P2N2/P2Q1PPP/2R1KB1R b Kkq - 1 10,"cxd4 is met with Nxd4. If black wishes to get rid of the knight on d4 he'll have to give his bishop for it or play d5. Both ideas are unappealing since e5 indirectly blocks the a1-h8 diagonal and trading literally destroys the last bit of development he had. The plan in which he trades his bishop makes me lose my right to castle after 2 or 3 moves, but I doubt black will be able to take advantage of that since he'll be underdeveloped and have no pressure on the center."
20,Nc6,b8c6,r1b1k2r/pp2ppbp/2n3p1/q1p3B1/3PP3/2P2N2/P2Q1PPP/2R1KB1R w Kkq - 2 11,Developing and putting more pressure. Sadly for him the c3 issue is solved so I can put some pressure on it.
21,d5,d4d5,r1b1k2r/pp2ppbp/2n3p1/q1pP2B1/4P3/2P2N2/P2Q1PPP/2R1KB1R b Kkq - 0 11,"We have a saying over here which would roughly translate to the following. ""When you say A, you got to say B."" The diagonal is obstructed once more. That being said, that knight isn't going to be there for long."
22,Ne5,c6e5,r1b1k2r/pp2ppbp/6p1/q1pPn1B1/4P3/2P2N2/P2Q1PPP/2R1KB1R w Kkq - 1 12,"We have a saying over here which would roughly translate to the following. ""When you say A, you got to say B."" The diagonal is obstructed once more. That being said, that knight isn't going to be there for long."
23,Nxe5,f3e5,r1b1k2r/pp2ppbp/6p1/q1pPN1B1/4P3/2P5/P2Q1PPP/2R1KB1R b Kkq - 0 12,I don't want him to trade and create a double pawn on the f-file. I might have plans of castling in the future and this would eliminate that possibility.
24,Bxe5,g7e5,r1b1k2r/pp2pp1p/6p1/q1pPb1B1/4P3/2P5/P2Q1PPP/2R1KB1R w Kkq - 0 13,Kind of forced to take back the material.
