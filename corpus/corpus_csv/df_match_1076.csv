1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Haven't found a non e4-opening to stick with me yet, so we begin with the French defense!"
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Haven't found a non e4-opening to stick with me yet, so we begin with the French defense!"
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"For the most part, when Black tries to wade in via these more passive pawn-openers, I enjoy going for the center immediately. However, Black has an intriguing variation in mind..."
4,Qf6,d8f6,rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/4pq2/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"Just like that, it took my opponent merely two moves to rip us violently off of the databases."
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/4pq2/8/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 3,"Not e5 just yet. I want to make sure I have some decent stake in development before I start launching a Queen-chase. And frankly, f3 is an amazing square for White's knight in the openings."
6,h6,h7h6,rnb1kbnr/pppp1pp1/4pq1p/8/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Deterring Bg5, but honestly, even though one of my strongest moves just got blocked, the Black Queen is just too open to not end up suffering anyway."
7,c4,c2c4,rnb1kbnr/pppp1pp1/4pq1p/8/2PPP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,I eagerly grip more of the center. White has several options.
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1b1kbnr/pppp1pp1/2n1pq1p/8/2PPP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"Also playable is g6, perhaps stronger, considering. Black clearly wants control of b4."
9,Nc3,b1c3,r1b1kbnr/pppp1pp1/2n1pq1p/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,I really don't mind the idea of Bb4. My central development is nearly complete.
10,Bb4,f8b4,r1b1k1nr/pppp1pp1/2n1pq1p/8/1bPPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 3 6,"Black continues the plan to pin my knight, threatening a doubling of the c pawns."
11,e5,e4e5,r1b1k1nr/pppp1pp1/2n1pq1p/4P3/1bPP4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"Instead, I hit the queen. I could have played this several moves ago, but allowing Black to explore with other pieces almost seems to have cramped him worse than if I let my enemy remain virtually sealed by just chasing immediately all those moves ago."
12,Qe7,f6e7,r1b1k1nr/ppppqpp1/2n1p2p/4P3/1bPP4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,"Black's Queen doesn't have many places to go. If Qg6, then forced becomes Nh4! Qh7, Bd3 g6, or else the Queen must be given up. In this line, the kingside is cramped and misplaced, and slightly more defensible for Black would appear to be aiming for a O-O-O. But this would require at least two more moves of development, and White already has an attacking synergy. If Qd8, O-O-O is virtually outright discouraged and Black has lost massive amounts of tempo. White has a clear advantage here already- which you're about to see me blow completely."
13,d5,d4d5,r1b1k1nr/ppppqpp1/2n1p2p/3PP3/1bP5/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"Ugh. When I was looking through this, I was telling myself that I didn't really care so much had Black played Bxc3, because if Bxc3+, bxc3 seems to help White move control of the center along. White would have pawns on c3-d4-e5, which allows my side of the board more space to pressure Black for being too cramped in. The doubled pawn on c4 could go to c5, and help me control virtually every dark square that I'd need to pressure Black's King wherever they decide to castle. So I play this, thinking I can keep boxing Black in, while completely forgetting that this was just about my worst possible move. d4 was so central to all of my attacking and defending plans. This was just an awful case of a brain lapse on my part."
14,exd5,e6d5,r1b1k1nr/ppppqpp1/2n4p/3pP3/1bP5/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,"I mean- seriously, I told myself my Queen had this square covered, but how in the heck did I forget the fact that my king now has two pieces pinned to it?!"
15,Qxd5,d1d5,r1b1k1nr/ppppqpp1/2n4p/3QP3/1bP5/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 8,"So I continue my plan to capture on d5 with the Queen, (cxd5 would come under fire after Qxe5+, which I can tell is coming at this point), but in hindsight, I was cursing at myself for being so greedy and careless. A huge White advantage thrown at me within the first two moves of the match, just for me to throw it right back in one huge overstep. I was pretty flustered by this point."
16,Nf6,g8f6,r1b1k2r/ppppqpp1/2n2n1p/3QP3/1bP5/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 1 9,I was really going wild with how much I hated my 7th at this point. :P
17,Qd3,d5d3,r1b1k2r/ppppqpp1/2n2n1p/4P3/1bP5/2NQ1N2/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 2 9,"Not Qd2. I wasn't comfortable putting my queen in front of the king with the Bishop there. Also not Qd1, as allowing c4 and e4 to have fewer defenders would be dangerous at this point."
18,Nxe5,c6e5,r1b1k2r/ppppqpp1/5n1p/4n3/1bP5/2NQ1N2/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 0 10,"Black gives me back more control of d4, while costing me my better knight."
19,Nxe5,f3e5,r1b1k2r/ppppqpp1/5n1p/4N3/1bP5/2NQ4/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 10,Forced.
20,Qxe5+,e7e5,r1b1k2r/pppp1pp1/5n1p/4q3/1bP5/2NQ4/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 0 11,"And here's the dropkick. Do I block with a bishop, or the Queen?"
21,Be2,f1e2,r1b1k2r/pppp1pp1/5n1p/4q3/1bP5/2NQ4/PP2BPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 1 11,"I figured the option that allows me quicker castling was probably safer at this point. Now that Black's energy has returned to the board, trading Queens probably wouldn't be in my interests either."
