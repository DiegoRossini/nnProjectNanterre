6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/2B1Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 4,Interesting. Never saw this move before this game. I think the game database had good stats on this move but I think the game shows it does not quite work for black.

9,Nf3,g1f3,r1b1kbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/6q1/2BPPp2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 5,Already black's lost too many tempo's for the extra pawn. Neglecting development is always very dangerous in the king's gambit and perhaps more so in the Bishop lines.

13,Bxf7+,c4f7,r1b1kbnr/pppp1Bpp/2n5/8/3PPp2/5N1q/PPP4P/RNBQK1R1 b Qkq - 0 7,"My opponent missed that the bishop can not be taken. Still after e.g. 7. Kd8 Bxf4 white has a huge lead in development, an enemy king trapped in the centre, a advanced queen to harass and will most likely win."
