1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"In this game, we enter a doubled-edged, but known position, where white has sacrificed a pawn but in return has ample compensation. My opponent is the first to deviate from the opening databases I am using. I try to prove his deviation wrong, by a bold attack on his rook by my bishop. He ignores this attack and offer the rook which I take. He offers a second pawn which I also take, and then a third which I also takes. He then finds a stunning bishop sacrifice, which leads to mate in 5 if I take. I decline the bishop, and he quickly regains all his sacrificed material and my position is a wreck. I struggle on, but it is hopeless!"

12,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/2P5/P4PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 7,"Reuben Fine in his excellent book ""The idea behind Chess Openings"" (1943) stated that black had to play 6....c7-c5 before white could stop it with Ba3. However soon afterwards it was found that Ba3 could be met with Nd7! followed by c7-c5! and white's pawn formation is shattered if the pawn is accepted. Playing Bg7 and 0-0 before c7-c5 does also have the advantage of avoiding lines where white checks on b5 with the Bf1 - not that those lines are particularly good for white - but it saves me from having to learn the theory!"
13,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 7,"For decades, theory held that the correct method of development was with Bc4 and Ne2, often followed by 0-0 and f4–f5, playing for a central breakthrough or king-side attack. It was generally thought that an early Nf3 was weak in the Exchange Variation because it allowed Black too much pressure on the centre with ...Bg4. In the late 1970s, however, Karpov, Kasparov and others found different methods to play the Exchange Variation with White, often involving an early Rb1 to remove the rook from the sensitive a1–h8 diagonal, as well as attempting to hinder the development of Black's queen-side. So this move rather signals that he will adopt one of these more modern approaches."

21,Bd2,c1d2,rnb2rk1/pp2ppbp/6p1/q7/3PP3/5N2/P2BBPPP/1R1QK2R b K - 2 11,White boldly sacrifices the a pawn rather than submit to an exchange of queens - and the loss of attacking possibilities which goes with it - by Qd2.

27,Re1,f1e1,rn3rk1/pp2ppbp/4q1p1/6B1/3PP1b1/5N2/4BPPP/1R1QR1K1 b - - 5 14,"He centralised his rook as in San Segundo Carrillo, Pablo (2483) vs. Alonso, Salvador (2339). From my point of view, this is where I had to start to think for myself - I didn't want to follow the game above, with h6, as white won! Of course I can't take on e4 as he has Ba6! discovering an attack on my queen and after my queen moves he has Bxb7 and BxRa8. I wanted to develop my knight to c6, but of course to play it immediately allows the fork d4-d5, so how about Qe6-d7 keeping the protection of e7, protecting b7 and preparing to develop the knight to c6."
28,Qd7,e6d7,rn3rk1/pp1qppbp/6p1/6B1/3PP1b1/5N2/4BPPP/1R1QR1K1 w - - 6 15,So I played it!
29,d5,d4d5,rn3rk1/pp1qppbp/6p1/3P2B1/4P1b1/5N2/4BPPP/1R1QR1K1 b - - 0 15,And he stops it again.
30,Bc3,g7c3,rn3rk1/pp1qpp1p/6p1/3P2B1/4P1b1/2b2N2/4BPPP/1R1QR1K1 w - - 1 16,"This seemed to me to be a very logical move - I thought either he was forced to move his rook back to f1 or to block my attack with knight or bishop to d2, allowing exchanges which are favourable to me, the side with the extra pawn. Foolishly I didn't even consider other moves where white sacrifices the exchange. Gameknot gives 15. Bc3 as a mistake and recommends Na6 and I think its right.
archduke_piccolo: H'mmm. Bold and unexpected. There are so many ways to respond to this aggression. Which to choose...? Big think time me-erm-thinks..."
