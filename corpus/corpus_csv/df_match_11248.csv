1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Not long after winning the 2002 US Championship, I was approached by the good people at Ubisoft to try my luck against their famous chess program Chessmaster 9000. I have a healthy respect playing against computers and I knew that CM9k would be a very worthy opponent.

After some discussion with the CM9k team, it was decided to play the match online at the Internet ""chessclub.com"". The time control would be brisk, but manageable. I was not likely to face severe panic inducing time scrambles that inevitably lead to gross errors.

A large crowd of online kibitzers and spectators were drawn to the bout. I was probably a slight favorite going into the match, but with humans there is the, well … human factor!  

Just one stupid little move could cost me the game and match. Fatigue, eye strain, psychology etc. all play a prominent role in human chess and I had to steel myself to try and play like a machine. I went into the match with guarded optimism.

Playing against a program like Chessmaster 9000 is not a walk in the park. CM9k is absolutely merciless punishing errors, is annoyingly patient and has a perfect memory for openings and endgames. Computers almost never blunder tactically, although they can make major strategic errors.  

It was this strategic deficiency that I wanted to exploit vs CM9k. I hoped to steer our battles to quiet maneuvering trench warfare that requires judgment and foresight rather than brute calculating ability.

This defense prepared before-hand is known as the Caro-Kann Defense - a very solid system that has a reputation for being effective against attacking maniacs and computers."

There is a  basic principle in the opening that a player should not move the same piece twice unless he has a very good reason.  CM’s move does come with a threat, 10 Nxc6, but that can be easily parried.  There is no long-term positive benefit that result from this violation of principle, so 9 Ne5 must be classified a mistake."

This is a very agreable move from Black’s point of view. Black’s pawn structure is strengthened markedly. He once had two weak queenside pawns and now only has one. Further, Black’s control of the center has been increased - squares like e4 and c4 have come under Black’s possesion.

Black is clearly better now for the following reasons.  First, his pawn structure is iron-clad. White cannot dent that compact chain of pawns. Second, Black can attack two weaknesses on Whites’s side of the board. The d4 pawn is isolated and weak and White’s queenside survivors are also vulnerable.

Black's plan is to use his a-pawn as a battering-ram to soften up the white queenside and create a new weakness. Generally speaking, one can defend with only one weakness. However, two weaknesses are usually fatal."
