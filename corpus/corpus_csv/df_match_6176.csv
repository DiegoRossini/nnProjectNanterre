1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I choose to play a Classical response.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I choose to play a Classical response.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,An interesting variation. White is clearly aiming to control his Q5.
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2P1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,I choose a reply that develops and counterattacks.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2P1P3/2N5/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 3,"The advantage of White's second move is that now his QN is not blocking his QBP, in spite of being developed on its natural square."
6,Bc5,f8c5,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/2b1p3/2P1P3/2N5/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 3 4,I give my King the option of K-side castling.
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/2b1p3/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 4 4,"With this move, White confirms he is playing for a light-square game. The position is somewhat resemblant of an English Opening."
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 5 5,"With this move, White confirms he is playing for a light-square game. The position is somewhat resemblant of an English Opening."

10,Ng4,f6g4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2P1P1n1/2NP1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,"Inconsistent with his earlier moves. I would play 6 B-K3 instead. Black can win a Pawn in the ensuing exchanges, but I end up a Pawn ahead anyway after the move actually played, and 6 B-K3 would enable White to maintain strong central Pawns as compensation."
11,d4,d3d4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2PPP1n1/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"Inconsistent with his earlier moves. I would play 6 B-K3 instead.

13,Ne2,c3e2,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b5/2PpP1n1/5N2/PP2NPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 7,Reestablishing my threat to fork Q and R.
14,d3,d4d3,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b5/2P1P1n1/3p1N2/PP2NPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,Reestablishing my threat to fork Q and R.
15,Ned4,e2d4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b5/2PNP1n1/3p1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 8,The only way to counter both the fork and the Pawn threat on the Knight.
16,Nxd4,c6d4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/8/2b5/2PnP1n1/3p1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 9,"Ah, who needs Knights anyway? I ended up ahead one Pawn in the scuffle."
17,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/8/2b5/2PNP1n1/3p4/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 9,"Ah, who needs Knights anyway? I ended up ahead one Pawn in the scuffle."

20,Qf6,d8f6,r1b1k2r/pppp1ppp/5q2/8/2PbP1Q1/3p4/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 1 11,"Since my adavanced QP is likely to fall soon, I add a second Pawn to my gains."
21,Qf3,g4f3,r1b1k2r/pppp1ppp/5q2/8/2PbP3/3p1Q2/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 2 11,"Since my adavanced QP is likely to fall soon, I add a second Pawn to my gains."

23,Qxf6,f3f6,r1b1k2r/pppp1ppp/5Q2/8/2P1P3/3p4/Pb3PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 12,"Exchanging off the Queens while down in material, even if we assume my advanced QP will fall, seems a dubious idea. White seemed to have a betetr line with 12 BxB QxB 13 Q-Q1, keeping the Queens on the board and ensuring the fall of the advanced QP. Now I can play for an endgame advantage."
24,Bxf6,b2f6,r1b1k2r/pppp1ppp/5b2/8/2P1P3/3p4/P4PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 0 13,"We've now reached the endgame, and I'm up a Pawn and have two Q-side targets [White's isolated P's on the QB and QR files]. I fancy my chances."
