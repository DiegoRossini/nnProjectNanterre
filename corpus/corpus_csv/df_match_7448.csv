1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This game is from a team match.
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,The French Defense has been somewhat of a favourite of mine lately.
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"As white I like to play 2.d3 and transpose into the King's Indian Attack (Nd2, Ngf3, g3, Bg2, O-O, and so on)."

8,exd5,e6d5,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/1b1P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"Normally black will trade his dark-squared bishop in the Winawer, but that's after 4.e5 c5 5.a3 and now Bxc3+ (5...Ba5 is possible). Here, however, I saw no reason to relinquish the two bishops, so that's the reason for this retreat."

I wanted to reposition my knight (to e6 or g6) but I've given up control of the e5 square temporarily. I wasn't afraid of 15.Ne5 Bxd3 16.Qxd3 Ne6 (or Ng6, trying to simplify), but I thought I might have had better. 14...Bxd3 15.Qxd3 Nf8 (Qb6!?) also seemed a bit uninspiring. But the truth of the position seems to be I didn't really have a good active plan and I just had to wait for white to show his cards and only then react accordingly."

Possible alternatives may be 15.Ne5 Bxd3 16.Qxd3 as mentioned in the previous comment, or 15.Kg2 Ne6 16.Bg3. 15.Nh4 may have been the best try, I'd probably have replied 15...Bxd3 (15...Bd6!?) 16.Qxd3 g6, preventing the knight from hopping to f5, but also creating some dark square weaknesses."
