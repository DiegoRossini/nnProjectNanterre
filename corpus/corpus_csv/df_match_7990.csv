1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Hi everyone.  This is the first of two losses against chesstico.  In both of these I think my endgame technique was found lacking.  The purpose of the annotations is to ask the question: how?  So I may skip a bit of the earlier stages.
