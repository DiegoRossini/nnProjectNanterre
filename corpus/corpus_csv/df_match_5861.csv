1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Here is my return match against Coach Ion in the Traxler MT.  I will be annotating that one two but this one is quite fascinating because although I lost this match there were so many pieces on both sides that were en prise!  This will be a good lesson in tactics to us all, including myself, The Beginner.   Here is the link to the game which has Gameknot Analysis:-http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=14875035&fb=1&rnd=0.8882096860666713  I will start the commentary on Move 5."
