1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I open with my usual opening d4.  I find the queen's gambit to be a very powerful opening with quick development and strong centre control.
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The main weakness of the queen's gambit is that e3 is in the mainline and it is hard for the dark squared bishop to join the game, but since there is no real pressure on my c4 pawn I can move my bishop out early and hopefully trade it off for one of blacks minor pieces."

6,e6,e7e6,r1bqkbnr/pppn1ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP1B2/8/PP2PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"To the untrained eye moving his knights like this seems like a good defensive strategy, but is in fact quite dangerous.  His pawn on f7 is still very weak and trapping his king like that makes it possible to checkmate with a bishop or knight."
