6,Nge7,g8e7,r1bqkb1r/ppppnppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,"But I wasn't expecting this.  Turns out that this is part of the Cozio Defense.  In this line the Black king bishop is supposed to make its way to g7.  I was at first figuring on things like a6, Bc5, or Nf6 instead, with usual development, so this is an early deviation from my game plan.  Nge7 would prevent doubled pawns in case of Bxc6, but it also temporarily leaves that KB on ice (therefore postponing castling) and puts the e7-knight on a less central square.  I don't know, dude might be planning f5 at some point."

I don't want to trade on c6 because that would let him bring the other knight up from e7 as well as free up the king bishop.  Retreating to e2 seems too passive.  Putting it on c4 will occupy a decent diagonal and focus on f7.  If then Na5 or b5 to attack it then I probably would be forced to send it back to e2 after all to avoid trading bishop for knight.

Then it would have been either put the bishop on b3 and risk trading it off its good diagonal after Na5, or scurry back to e2.  Now I have time to prevent b5.  The bishop's current diagonal looks pretty good since the f7 square is lightly defended and he's still a few moves away from castling.  However, h6 stops my knight from joining the fray.
