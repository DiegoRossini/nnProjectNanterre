It was to decide who goes to the next round. I was half a pt behind to iamthundercat, so the only way I advance is if I win. He wins or we draw, he moves on, and I am out. So we begin..."

I don't see immediate threat that would at the same time develop black. So I shift the Queen on the side where I expect he will Castle. Also the Queen provides additional support to g2 pawn attacked by the black Bb7.

However, this was a weak move. It weakens protection to the g2 pawn, as well as it doesn't account for the following move by the black...."

Note that if I exchange Queens, his Knight assumes h4 position, which will cause either loss of pawn, or loss of Castling options (g2 pawn is then under the attack by both Bb2 and Kg4... I can't advance the pawn as it is protecting a Rh1 from Bb2 attack, and I am not hot about playing Kf1). If I move Queen in any other way, my Nd4 is history as it is attacked then by both Bc5 and Qh4."

My hold on the center is not so important at this point, he is managing to develop as planned, he is attacking me in the middle of all places, and my development so far is fairly useless. My overagressive play seems to have backfired this time."
