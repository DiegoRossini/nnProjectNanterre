1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"1. e4 has many good points.  It attempts to secure space in the center, and open lines for the f1 bishop and the queen.  The g1 knight might also develop via e2 in some lines.  Two of the fundamental elements of chess: space and time, are well served by the move.  There is a slight weakening to the d4 and f4 squares, which should also be noted."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Just as logical for black as for white.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"A developing move that centralizes the knight and attacks black's e-pawn.  Centralization is a key concept in chess, because peieces tend to grow stronger nearer the center.  A piece's power is tied to its mobility, and centralized pieces tend to be more mobile."
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"A playable, but passive defense.  It secures the e-pawn, but also hinders the development of the f8 bishop."
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"Siezing more space, and opening a line for the c1 bishop.  It again threatens to win the e-pawn.  Developing, while making threats, is a sign of the initiative.   The initiative is another critical concept in chess, where one side is pressing the other and limiting their choices."
6,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/3PP1b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,"An overly aggressive move that is actually seen fairly often in similar positions, by developing players, until they learn about its drawbacks.  This is a tactical solution to the defense of the e-pawn that has a strategic drawback, which will become clear."
7,dxe5,d4e5,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4P3/4P1b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,Capturing on e5 with the d-pawn is the correct play.
8,Bxf3,g4f3,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4P3/4P3/5b2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"4. ...dxe5 loses material to 5. Qxd8  Kxd8 6. Nxe5.  Material, or force, is another basic element in chess.  You must maintain the material status quo, or risk being overwhelmed.  Notice how the bishop has moved twice to capture a knight, which has only moved once.  Black is beginning to lag behind in development, or in the element of time."
9,Qxf3,d1f3,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4P3/4P3/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"5. gxf3 is possible, but it would result in a defect in white's pawn structure.  Pawn structure is another critical elelment in understanding chess.  In this case 5. gxf3 would give white doubled pawns on the f-file.  The pawns cannot defend one another and the f2 pawn's mobility is restricted.  White has continued his development, by recapturing with the queen, and secured the two bishops."
10,dxe5,d6e5,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Black has restored material equilibrium,  but at the cost of the two bishops.  Two bishops are more mobile than bishop and knight, and they are usually easier to coordinate.  Notice that white has one piece developed and is on the move, while black has no developed piece."
11,Bc4,f1c4,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 1 6,"With the not-so-subtle threat on f7.  Developing, while making threats, reduces your opponent's options.  White is making good use of the initiative."
12,Qf6,d8f6,rn2kbnr/ppp2ppp/5q2/4p3/2B1P3/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 2 7,"Propably hoping for 7. Qxf6 Nxf6, where black has caught up in development.  White, however, has no intention of helping out his opponent in that way.  Better was 6. ...Nf6, but 7. Qb3 still leads to an advantage, as in the famous game Paul Morphy vs. Duke Karl and Count Isouard. 6. ...Qe7 is another try."
13,Qb3,f3b3,rn2kbnr/ppp2ppp/5q2/4p3/2B1P3/1Q6/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 3 7,Creating a nice bishop-queen battery along the a2 g8 diagonal. and threatening 8. Qxb7.  The absence of black's light square bishop is felt almost immediately.
14,Bc5,f8c5,rn2k1nr/ppp2ppp/5q2/2b1p3/2B1P3/1Q6/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 4 8,A counter threat that gets white's attention.
15,O-O,e1g1,rn2k1nr/ppp2ppp/5q2/2b1p3/2B1P3/1Q6/PPP2PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 5 8,"White, unlike black, can respond to the threat with a natural developing move.  Castling secures the king behind a phalanx of pawns, and allows the rook to get into the game."
16,b6,b7b6,rn2k1nr/p1p2ppp/1p3q2/2b1p3/2B1P3/1Q6/PPP2PPP/RNB2RK1 w kq - 0 9,8. ...b6 does not help black's development and further weakens the white squares.  8. ...Bb6 was probably better.
17,Nc3,b1c3,rn2k1nr/p1p2ppp/1p3q2/2b1p3/2B1P3/1QN5/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 1 9,"Another centralizing, developing move with the threat of 10. Nd5 gaining even more time, because of the attack on the queen."
18,Bd4,c5d4,rn2k1nr/p1p2ppp/1p3q2/4p3/2BbP3/1QN5/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 2 10,"9. ...Ne7 would've challenged white's control over d5.  Black has moved an already developed piece twice, before completing the development of his other pieces. 9. ...Bd4 is a waste of time in a position where black already trails white in that element.  Neglecting development is one of the most common mistakes in chess."
19,Nd5,c3d5,rn2k1nr/p1p2ppp/1p3q2/3Np3/2BbP3/1Q6/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 3 10,"Now, white gets a free move, since black must save the queen."
20,Qd8,f6d8,rn1qk1nr/p1p2ppp/1p6/3Np3/2BbP3/1Q6/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 4 11,"White has three pieces developed to black's one, and it is white's turn to move.  An advantage in the element of time is a temporary one.  Ideally, you want to cash it in for an advantage in a more permament elelment such as material.  A lead in development means that open lines and attack are the order of the day.  Play passively and your opponent will catch right up to you in terms of time."
