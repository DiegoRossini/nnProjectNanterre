1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"In this game, I gain positional advantages which eventually lead to the win of a pawn. My opponent sacs another pawn to keep my knight hemmed in. I sac it to go into an ending a knight for 2 pawns down, but my king is so active, it is very hard to defend. I honestly couldn't see all the posibilities to the end. I wonder - would a computer have played this sac? Perhaps someone with Fritz or a decent chess computer can tell me please? Was there a defence?"
