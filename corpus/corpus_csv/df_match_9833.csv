1,b3,b2b3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"hello again
this annotation thing i pretty fun :)
i can share my thoughts at the time the game was played and show my (rare, VERY rare) good sacrifices 
and hopefully someone can learn a thing or two from my games (which i doubt)
here i'm black again although i like playing white pieces more(and i play better as white)
i was confused with this opening and made a few mistakes ( i noticed that i every single game i play i make an error and i'll do my best to fix that and go above 1700 )"
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"ok, mistake #1
if he moves Bb2, it's stopping my pawn from e5 next move"
3,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/1P2P3/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,but since he didn't play Bb2....
4,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/8/1P2P3/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,but since he didn't play Bb2....
5,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/2P5/1P2P3/P2P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"wow
what to play now?
obviously i won't take it since Bxc4 develops his bishop"
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3pp3/2P5/1P2P3/P2P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,so i ignore that and continue my game
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3pp3/2P5/1P2PN2/P2P1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,now i'm ready to castle
8,Bd6,f8d6,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/3b1n2/3pp3/2P5/1P2PN2/P2P1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 3 5,now i'm ready to castle
9,Bb2,c1b2,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/3b1n2/3pp3/2P5/1P2PN2/PB1P1PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 4 5,defending the pawn and developing

11,d3,d2d3,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2nb1n2/3pp3/2P5/1P1PPN2/PB3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"almost all his moves make no sense to me
i've never seen opening like this before and i'm starting to think that i'll win this easily"
12,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2nb1n2/3pp3/2P5/1P1PPN2/PB3PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQ - 1 7,"wrong place for that knight
Nc3 is way better, attacking my pawn"

this was a mistake
i guess i had that Nc3 in my mind and put my bishop on e6 in a second...
and when i clicked ""submit"" i just wanted to slap myself
wanted to play Bg4"
