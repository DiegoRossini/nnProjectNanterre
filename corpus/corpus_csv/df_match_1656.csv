1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Today's entertainment is a fun game I completed recently against odisant, who has been putting up steadily tougher resistance in our games, despite the discrepancy in our levels of experience. This game is no exception, with opportunities to learn from the mistakes of both sides. I make a questionable positional decision in the hopes of making the game 'interesting', and it sure does work!"

5,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4PP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 3,"This Knight plugs the hole in White's defenses, and asks of Black whether he's truly ready to commit to a fight over the defense of e4."
6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4PP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 3 4,By far more popular choices are 3...exf4 (accepting the gambit a move late) or 3...f5. The text gives White a chance to begin a Knight hunt!
7,fxe5,f4e5,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4P3/4P3/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"Chasing the Knight. This seems to block in White's light Bishop, but since the Black Knight only has one refuge--c5--this pawn will get another chance to advance with tempo, so the momentary blockage is acceptable."

10,Nc5,e4c5,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/2n1P3/8/3P1N2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,"With no pawns left to kick it away, e4 is now a relatively safe haven for Black's Knight--at least for the moment. If White attacks it with a piece, e.g. 7.Bd3, Black can respond with ...d5, significantly solidifying his position."

14,Nb4,c6b4,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/3PP3/1n2n3/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,"? This Knight probably should have retreated to e7 or even b8. Now White can force Black's Knights practically off the board, after all their movement, and be left with a great position, e.g. 8.a3 Na6 9.Qe2 Nec5 10.Nc3 (covering the a4 square and threatening to trap the Knight with a pawn thrust) 10...Nb8 (vacating a6 for the other Knight's retreat) 11.b4 Nca6, leaving Black with one developed piece--a Knight on a6--and White with the initiative, an advanced center, and a huge lead in development."
15,a3,a2a3,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/3PP3/1n2n3/P4N2/1PP3PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,"?! Then again, even all that might have been preferable to just giving up the Knight immediately. On the plus side, this move does have the benefit of breaking up White's pawn center."

The computer suggests 10.Bc4, threatening mate on f7 and forcing Black to move his Knight yet again, to interpose on e6."
