1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"It's an interesting game I played some time ago actually. Once players start to realize that the queen is worth a limited amount of wood(minor pieces/rooks) their evaluation of that piece drop significantly. However, the queen can still dominate the pieces in many occasions. It happens when the greater number of pieces cannot coordinate."

One big problem many players have is that they play the same opening setup against all openings, even if it is not optimal. I remember that I used to always do the King's Indian Setup, without thinking about the opponent. It's a horrible mistake many players make."

The unfortunate thiing is that black has the extra space in the center, and has contact between the pawns, so the pawn structure is dynamic and black can open it at the right moment. Since white has broken the principles of the opening, black can also do it if he wants."
