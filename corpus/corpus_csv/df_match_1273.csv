1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I went with the e4 opening.  Since I know how to play against the Sicilian with c3, I don't shy away from e4 any more."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,King's Pawn Opening.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"I developed, attacking the pawn.  I didn't have a clear strategy yet, just developing."
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,Continued development.
5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 3,"I thought this would be a perfect little spot for my Bishop along the a2-g8 diagonal.  I was eyeing down on that f7 square.  At this point I thought if I could get my Queen over, I could form a pretty successful attack on the King side."
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 4,Adding an attacker on the d5 square.
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 4,"Adding another defender on the d5 square.  Now, 4. Nc3 d5 5. exd5 Nxd5 6. Nxd5(or Bxd5) ... and I have successfully defended against the attack."
8,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/3p1n2/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 4 5,Further development.
9,h3,h2h3,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/3p1n2/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N1P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,Eliminating the possibility of a Bg4 pin.
10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/3p1n2/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N1P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQK2R w KQ - 1 6,"Now that he castled I knew his King was going to stay there, so I can begin my assault.  First, I open up my Bishop to get involved.  I was weary of closing off my light square Bishop from joining the attack, but it was already involved by putting pressure on the f7 square."
11,d3,d2d3,rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/3p1n2/4p3/2B1P3/2NP1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 6,"Now that he castled I knew his King was going to stay there, so I can begin my assault.  First, I open up my Bishop to get involved.  I was weary of closing off my light square Bishop from joining the attack, but it was already involved by putting pressure on the f7 square."
12,Nh5,f6h5,rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/3p4/4p2n/2B1P3/2NP1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R w KQ - 1 7,I believe this was an attempt to form an attack.  It opened up the way for his Bishop to come over.
13,Be3,c1e3,rnbq1rk1/ppp1bppp/3p4/4p2n/2B1P3/2NPBN1P/PPP2PP1/R2QK2R b KQ - 2 7,"Now I saw the possible benefits of having my Bishop and Queen on the same diagonal.  I believe I was considering 8. Qd2 ... 9. Bg4 Bxg4, then I could either exchange Queens or accept the extra Bishop, but a better opportunity arose..."
14,Bh4,e7h4,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p2n/2B1P2b/2NPBN1P/PPP2PP1/R2QK2R w KQ - 3 8,"...With this move.  I could see he was looking to trap me into 8. Nxh4 Qxh4, and he would have an active Queen on the King side.  So, I continued my attack preparations hoping he would hold off on Bxf2."
15,Qd2,d1d2,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p2n/2B1P2b/2NPBN1P/PPPQ1PP1/R3K2R b KQ - 4 8,"I think this rather halted the proposition of Bxf2, since it would now give me the opportunity to bring my Queen over."
16,Nc6,b8c6,r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p2n/2B1P2b/2NPBN1P/PPPQ1PP1/R3K2R w KQ - 5 9,"Now I take the Bishop, since after 9. Nxh4 Qxh4 10. Bh5 ... his Queen is trapped."
17,Nxh4,f3h4,r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p2n/2B1P2N/2NPB2P/PPPQ1PP1/R3K2R b KQ - 0 9,"Now I take the Bishop, since after 9. Nxh4 Qxh4 10. Bh5 ... his Queen is trapped."
18,Qxh4,d8h4,r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p2n/2B1P2q/2NPB2P/PPPQ1PP1/R3K2R w KQ - 0 10,Now he falls into my trap.
19,Bg5,e3g5,r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p1Bn/2B1P2q/2NP3P/PPPQ1PP1/R3K2R b KQ - 1 10,Traps the Queen and serves the dual purpose of forming the attack that I'd wanted from the beginning.
20,Ng3,h5g3,r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p1B1/2B1P2q/2NP2nP/PPPQ1PP1/R3K2R w KQ - 2 11,I liked this move.  I was expecting Qxg5.  I couldn't take the Knight because fxg3 would lead to Qxg3 and he would preserve his Queen.
21,Bxh4,g5h4,r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/2B1P2B/2NP2nP/PPPQ1PP1/R3K2R b KQ - 0 11,"Now the sequence is finished.  After Nxh1, O-O-O traps his Knight."
22,Nxh1,g3h1,r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/2B1P2B/2NP3P/PPPQ1PP1/R3K2n w Q - 0 12,"Bingo.  He can't preserve the Knight, either."
23,O-O-O,e1c1,r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/2B1P2B/2NP3P/PPPQ1PP1/2KR3n b - - 1 12,"Bingo.  He can't preserve the Knight, either."
