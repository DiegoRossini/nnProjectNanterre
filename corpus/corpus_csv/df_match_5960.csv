1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"When I ventured e4 against Joanne, I ""only"" drew, so, playing for a win, I opened d4."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"She doesn't play the same openings every time, so it was no surprise that she deviated from Nf6 which she played, and lost, against me."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"So I played the Queen's Gambit, offering a temporary sacrifice of a pawn."
4,dxc4,d5c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2pP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Which is Cambrudge-based Candidate Expert accepted. It is quite sound to accept it - what is normally bad for Black is to accept it and then try and hang on to the extra pawn.
5,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2pPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"I pick a sharp variation, which scores well for white (40%)"
6,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4p3/2pPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"And she picks the most-played variation. If I now take on e5, she can exchange queens on d1 and then play Be6 protecting her pawn on c4. I think that would be good for Black, so I elect for another option."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4p3/2pPP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"This is the most played move, and scores quite highly (39%)"
8,exd4,e5d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/8/2ppP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Again, taking on d4 is by far the most popular option, according to the Gameknot World opening database."
9,Bxc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/8/2BpP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"White recaptures one of his pawns. Again, the most popular continuation."
10,Bb4+,f8b4,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/8/1bBpP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 6,"Black again continues with the most popular move, but I was quite happy. In the database I was using, White scores 41% compared to 22% for Black and 36% draws."
11,Nbd2,b1d2,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/8/1bBpP3/5N2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 6,So I continue with the tried and tested way.
12,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2n5/8/1bBpP3/5N2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 3 7,As does my opponent.
13,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2n5/8/1bBpP3/5N2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 4 7,"I ignore the other option, a3, all the 3 games in the database went to Black wins."
14,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/8/1bBpP3/5N2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 5 8,This is the most common move again.
15,Qb3,d1b3,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/8/1bBpP3/1Q3N2/PP1N1PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 6 8,"This move was questioned by the after-game computer analysis, which suggested e5 as better. Certainly e5 is more commonly played at this point, but Qb3 has scored well in practice."
16,Qe7,d8e7,r1b1k2r/ppp1qppp/2n2n2/8/1bBpP3/1Q3N2/PP1N1PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 7 9,"This move is also questioned by the computer, but it is the only one in the opening database. Computer suggested O-O 8. e5 Ng4 9. Re1 Be7 10. e6 fxe6 11. Bxe6+ Kh8 12. Bxg4 Bxg4 13. Qxb7 Qd7 14. b3 Be6 as better, although I am not convinced!"
17,e5,e4e5,r1b1k2r/ppp1qppp/2n2n2/4P3/1bBp4/1Q3N2/PP1N1PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 0 9,"This advance scores well on the opening database - White wins both the games on the world database, while the alternative, a3 only scores one draw."
18,Nd7,f6d7,r1b1k2r/pppnqppp/2n5/4P3/1bBp4/1Q3N2/PP1N1PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 1 10,"Aha, a break from the databases! Ng4 is normally played, although White won both the games on the world database, on the Gameknot database, it is one win and one loss. So now I had a good think. Could I take advantage of the knight being on d7 rather than g4? 10. e6 fxe6 11. Bxe6 Nc5 wouldn't be so clever, white is losing material. But there must be something based on e6. Hang on, what if I play Bxf7 first?"
19,Bxf7+,c4f7,r1b1k2r/pppnqBpp/2n5/4P3/1b1p4/1Q3N2/PP1N1PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 0 10,So here we go.
20,Qxf7,e7f7,r1b1k2r/pppn1qpp/2n5/4P3/1b1p4/1Q3N2/PP1N1PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 0 11,Black is forced to take.
