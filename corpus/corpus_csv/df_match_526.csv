1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is a very short game, with white rather surprisingly getting mated!"
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,So it starts as a Sicilian Defence.
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,This seems to indicate the closed variations.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,I reply in kind.
5,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 3,White develops her other knight.
6,d6,d7d6,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,I keep my options open.
7,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/2p5/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,And white transposes now into the Open Sicilian.
8,cxd4,c5d4,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/8/3pP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,So I take.
9,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,She takes back.
10,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,"I continue to develop, with the main line."
11,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 2 6,"She continues with the Richter-Rauzer Attack, probably the strongest line for white."
12,e6,e7e6,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2nppn2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"And this is the most common reply, although other moves are quite playable."
13,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2nppn2/1B4B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 7,This is a bit unusual. 7. Qd2 and 8. 0-0-0 is more common.
14,Bd7,c8d7,r2qkb1r/pp1b1ppp/2nppn2/1B4B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 8,I have to defend against the double attack on Nc6
15,O-O,e1g1,r2qkb1r/pp1b1ppp/2nppn2/1B4B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 3 8,She castles to safety.
16,Be7,f8e7,r2qk2r/pp1bbppp/2nppn2/1B4B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 4 9,I develop. All this has been seen before.
17,Re1,f1e1,r2qk2r/pp1bbppp/2nppn2/1B4B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 b kq - 5 9,Normal development.
18,O-O,e8g8,r2q1rk1/pp1bbppp/2nppn2/1B4B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 w - - 6 10,I castle too.
19,Nxc6,d4c6,r2q1rk1/pp1bbppp/2Nppn2/1B4B1/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 b - - 0 10,"Although it has been played before, I don't like this move for white. It is not the sort of move I would ever play as white. After the recapture with the pawn, Black's pawn centre is strengthened."
20,bxc6,b7c6,r2q1rk1/p2bbppp/2pppn2/1B4B1/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QR1K1 w - - 0 11,Not only that I am now attacking the bishop.
