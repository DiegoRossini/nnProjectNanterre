30,Nb3,a5b3,r3r1k1/p1p2ppp/1p3n2/3q4/3P4/Pn1QPN2/3B1PPP/R4RK1 w - - 2 16,here i was expecting Nc4 and after 16Rfc1 16...b5 and black has a fix on the c4 square.its not bad though.
31,Rab1,a1b1,r3r1k1/p1p2ppp/1p3n2/3q4/3P4/Pn1QPN2/3B1PPP/1R3RK1 b - - 3 16,Nxd2 was an option but i wanted a better control of d4 in the event of c5.

37,Rbc1,b1c1,r3r1k1/p4ppp/1p6/2pq4/3Pn3/P3PN2/2Q2PPP/2R2RK1 b - - 1 19,more of a waiting move on my part. i wanted to see what black will do here. there were other options like dxc5 or even Rfd1.
38,Rac8,a8c8,2r1r1k1/p4ppp/1p6/2pq4/3Pn3/P3PN2/2Q2PPP/2R2RK1 w - - 2 20,the key moment. white had to play dxc5 because black was threatening b5 and c4 and the pawns on the queen side are rolling. But now he has to deal with the c-pawn.

43,Rcb1,c1b1,2r1r1k1/pq3ppp/8/2p5/Q3n3/P3PN2/5PPP/1R3RK1 b - - 1 22,whites task is to hold that pawn from reaching the first rank. exchanging pieces along the way is acceptable since passed isolated pawns are weaker in the endings.
