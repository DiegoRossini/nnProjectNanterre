2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Sicialian defense, it's been and still one of the most popular reply to 1. e4 among players of all levels, it was fischer's favorite when he played with black pieces."
3,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Quite strange, white's usually plays Nf3 or Nc3 at this point, but this move is quite agressive and declares that white is eager for a rather early fight."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,Black should play Nc6 but instead he's wasting time by pawn moves!
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/4PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 3,Black should play Nc6 but instead he's wasting time by pawn moves!
