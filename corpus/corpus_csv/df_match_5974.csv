14,Kd7,e8d7,rn1q1b1r/pp1kpBpp/2p5/6N1/4pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 1 8,I really wanted Black's K to move to c7 and then b6.

21,Bxg4,e6g4,rn1qkb1r/pp2p1pp/2p5/6N1/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 0 11,"White has to mobilize his pieces and create an attack as quickly as possible, while constraining Black or White gives away the advantage."

24,exf4,e5f4,rn1qkb1r/pp4pp/2p5/6N1/4ppB1/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 0 13,This is where the N is happiest.

29,d3,d2d3,rn2k2r/pp2b1pp/1qp1N3/8/4NpB1/3P4/PPP3PP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 0 15,"I was prepared to give up b2 to the Queen to launch an attack.  As White in this tourney, I think it's a mistake to play passively.  Perhaps 16. Bxf4 Qxb2 17. O-O  I'm not sure if this would be correct but this was my idea."
30,Bh4+,e7h4,rn2k2r/pp4pp/1qp1N3/8/4NpBb/3P4/PPP3PP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 1 16,"This move surprised me.  I was expecting the N to come out (perhaps 15...Nd7, 16...Nf6) to disrupt White's attack and get another piece into the action.  I wasn't sure of the purpose of Bh4+, except perhaps to disrupt White's K-side pawn structure and make O-O less desirable."
31,g3,g2g3,rn2k2r/pp4pp/1qp1N3/8/4NpBb/3P2P1/PPP4P/R1B1K2R b KQ - 0 16,Forced or the Rook goes bye-bye.

35,Nd6+,e4d6,rn2k2r/pp4pp/1qpNNb2/8/6B1/3P2P1/PPP5/R1B1K2R b KQ - 2 18,"Black's Q has very few safe squares, particularly given the discovered check by White's LSB."

38,Qb4+,b6b4,rn5r/pp1k2pp/2p1Nb2/8/1qN3B1/3P2P1/PPP5/R1B1K2R w KQ - 5 20,"Black's plan is to withdraw the Q safely (obviously).  However, this allows the DSB to develop with tempo."
39,Bd2,c1d2,rn5r/pp1k2pp/2p1Nb2/8/1qN3B1/3P2P1/PPPB4/R3K2R b KQ - 6 20,White's N is pinned but protected from any attack.  Black's N has not move nor has either of his Rooks.
40,Qe7,b4e7,rn5r/pp1kq1pp/2p1Nb2/8/2N3B1/3P2P1/PPPB4/R3K2R w KQ - 7 21,White's N is pinned but protected from any attack.  Black's N has not move nor has either of his Rooks.
41,O-O-O,e1c1,rn5r/pp1kq1pp/2p1Nb2/8/2N3B1/3P2P1/PPPB4/2KR3R b - - 8 21,"Breaking the pin, connecting the rooks, and the preparing for a full assault on the King."
42,Ke8,d7e8,rn2k2r/pp2q1pp/2p1Nb2/8/2N3B1/3P2P1/PPPB4/2KR3R w - - 9 22,21...Ke8 loses the Q with 22 Rhe1.  dmaestro told me after the game that he considered 21...Qxe6  22. Bxe6  Kxe6 with even material.  I think that would have been interesting but White would still have held the advantage given that his other pieces were developed and his King was safely tucked away.
43,Rhe1,h1e1,rn2k2r/pp2q1pp/2p1Nb2/8/2N3B1/3P2P1/PPPB4/2KRR3 b - - 10 22,And Black resigns.  My thanks to dmaestro for the game.  This is a really interesting tourney.  I wonder if freddy will be able to come up with The Annotation Project IV?
