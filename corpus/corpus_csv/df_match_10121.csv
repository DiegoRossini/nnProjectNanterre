7. ... Ba5 ?! is to be considered : 8. b4 Nxd4 9. bxa5 Qxb2 10. Nxd4 (If 10. Bc3, Nc2  -) Qxd4 11. Ra2, Qxe4 . Two central pawns for the Bishop, one of them free, and also weakness in White position (doubled pawn on column a). But White has his/her pair of bishops and to obtain a concrete advantage for Black seemed too difficult to me."
