21,Re1,f1e1,r1b1kb1r/1p3ppp/p2qpn2/8/2BN4/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 b kq - 1 11,Interestingly in the game I was following black had started with 10...Qc7 11.Qe2 a6 12.Re1 so I played this hoping to transpose back to the game. I never considered weather the slight move order difference means white might be able to improve. This is still a good move anyway.
22,Qc7,d6c7,r1b1kb1r/1pq2ppp/p3pn2/8/2BN4/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w kq - 2 12,transposing back to the game I was following. My main point is I wanted to hold off on Bg5 until black has played ...Bd6 as it sets up some interesting attacking ideas.

24,Bd6,f8d6,r1b1k2r/1pq2ppp/p2bpn2/8/2BN4/8/PPP1QPPP/R1B1R1K1 w kq - 4 13,"In the game In was following, white played 13.h3, eventually dropped the bishop back to b3 and whilst he had a good position and chances to play for a win I felt there was room for improvement. Now was where my prep kicked in as I had found an improvement for white"
25,Bg5,c1g5,r1b1k2r/1pq2ppp/p2bpn2/6B1/2BN4/8/PPP1QPPP/R3R1K1 b kq - 5 13,"Instead of h3, it turns out that white can offer the h pawn as a sacrifice 
14...Bxh2+ 15.Kh1 Bf5 16.Nxe6! Bxe6 17.Bxe6 0-0 (Bxg5?? 18.Be7 mating) 18.Bxf6 where best for black is apparently fxe6 19.Qxe6+ and whites a pawn up with and has a beautiful position. if 15...Bd6 16.Nf5! turns out to be very dangerous ...Bf8 and either 17.Rad1 or Nh6!? both leave blacks king in the center and under heavy pressure with 16...0-0 17.Nxd6 apparently leaving white with a massive advantage according to the computer"
26,O-O,e8g8,r1b2rk1/1pq2ppp/p2bpn2/6B1/2BN4/8/PPP1QPPP/R3R1K1 w - - 6 14,"Seeing that taking the pawn is dangerous for black, he opts to hoick the king out of the center before all hell breaks loose. At this point in my prep the computers first suggestion was 14.Bxf6 which led to some awesome stuff in many lines and gave white a great game but looking over reams of different lines I came to the conclusion that black had ways to equalize and even gain advantage with accurate play. However I felt there must be something better for white."
27,Bd3,c4d3,r1b2rk1/1pq2ppp/p2bpn2/6B1/3N4/3B4/PPP1QPPP/R3R1K1 b - - 7 14,"[!] Something of a Eureka moment for me, after some time I was able to determine that this forces matters nicely as now black comes under heavy attacks in all lines."
28,Bxh2+,d6h2,r1b2rk1/1pq2ppp/p3pn2/6B1/3N4/3B4/PPP1QPPb/R3R1K1 w - - 0 15,Black only has two good moves in the position. This and the other being 14...Nd5!? to which I had ready 15.Qh5 applying the pressure and forcing and forcing black to weaken his king ...h6? is met with the very dangerous 16.Bxh6! gxh6 17.Qxh6 f6 is blacks best defense and the computer suggests 18.Nxe6 and announces that if black defends accuratly white must play a perpetual. But I was able to prove to it after some work that infact stronger is 18.Rxe6!? Bxe6 once again the engine insists that white must play a perpetual but actually it turns out that white can still play for a win without the rook. in any case it is hard to imagine any black player willingly entering 14...Nd5 15.Qh5 h6?! 16.Bxh6 gxh6 17.Qxh6 f6 as its clear only white can play for a win there so instead I'd expect 15...g6 16.Qh4 and with blacks weakened dark squares white will have a pleasant long lasting initiative on the kingside with the advantage and good game. Black didnt go for any of that though.
29,Kh1,g1h1,r1b2rk1/1pq2ppp/p3pn2/6B1/3N4/3B4/PPP1QPPb/R3R2K b - - 1 15,"Believe it or not black only has one move in the position. 15...Bf5 is now forced with the continuation 15...Bf5 16.Bxf6 gxf6 17.Qg4+ and in my analysis I found white gets a very strong attack in all lines with trouble occurring on h2, or black losing a bishop with g3/F4 and possible trouble on the h file I would have been comfortable with that line."
30,Bd6,h2d6,r1b2rk1/1pq2ppp/p2bpn2/6B1/3N4/3B4/PPP1QPP1/R3R2K w - - 2 16,[??] black falls for one of the many devious traps I had prepared in the position. After this black is lost and falls apart very quickly indeed.
31,Bxf6,g5f6,r1b2rk1/1pq2ppp/p2bpB2/8/3N4/3B4/PPP1QPP1/R3R2K b - - 0 16,first white weakens blacks king and removes the defender to h7

But this move aside from being both more forcing and more daunting to meet OTB, also happens to be much more aesthetically pleasing"
