1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"commetry by, Crazyeye180 (Black) and Davidtornheim (White)

the second in a series of (so far) two very very close games: the first was a queens gambit 1-0 (crazyeye180 white), and the third is currently in progress - a sicillian, Davidtornheim with the white pieces."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,"Black :this has always been my response to Nf3, it seems to be solid and catches people who expect knight moves unaware. It also allows black to steer white away from e4 opening traps – which I hate. It also fits in fairly well with my queens pawn opening play as white as some of the ideas seem to be the same.

White: I agree and play the same.  When Reti first played 1.Nf3, his master opponents played either d5 or Nf6, still the most common replies today and approved by Rybka and Fritz.  I too play d5 when black, as 2. c4 d4 followed by 3. ... c5 quickly establishes a troublesome cramping outpost in the midst of White's undeveloped space, which will only get worse if ignored."

Black hasn’t got a black bishop any more so there’s no threat of the pin on the queen, and white has time before black can activate his other pieces, and due to the black queen’s position …f5? To challenge the knight isn’t strong as it practically damns the knight and limits black’s castleing options. Though this line is interesting and might be worth looking into.

White: Rybka gives:  Be2 (0.10), Rd1 (0.03), O-O-O (0.02)."
24,Nf6,g8f6,r1b1k2r/ppp1qppp/5n2/4p3/2P1N3/3P4/PP1QBPPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 3 13,"Black:  I don’t understand this. White’s knight is in a much better position than black’s and it’s moved more – therefore it’s worth more. Whilst this move does kind of force white to win another tempo on the queen white kills his own attack. Perhaps castling would be better. – let black deal with it and keep the initiative.

White: White and Rybka disagree with the above,and find castling on either side slightly inferior.  Rybka rates Nxf6+ at 0.13-0.18 and castling at 0.08 and O-O-O at -0.10 , a slight but significant difference.   White expected (and Rybka strongly advises)  13. … Nxe4 14. dxe4, because black would not tolerate the presence of this centralized knight.  Regardless of how that knight got to such a strong presence, white assumes his opponent will make the strongest move and it will be gone in one move.  Given its doom, white must decide:   is it better to be taken or to do the taking?  If white waits to be taken by black, he is left with two unprotected pawns and the Queen  wide open for attack by a rook on the d-file, that rook protected by the Queen safely at e7.    On the other hand, if white takes black’s knight first, black does not gain any tempo, because his Queen will have to expend a move recapturing.  This recapture move by black does not improve the his Queen’s position.   In fact, with O-O, the black Queen is in danger of the castled rook, which White hoped would be unveiled unexpectedly at a time inconvenient for black.  f4 nicely accomplishes this on the next move, a move that an overconfident White unfortunately overlooked. 

So black’s Queen was safer at e7, and the recapture move was of no benefit and if anything lost time.   So, white chose to do the taking to prevent the undesired scattering of his pawns by the recapture preferring black’s recapture putting his queen in a possible line of fire at f6.


White did not seriously consider O-O-O because the King is a bit too vulnerable with the stray c-pawn, which can be easily attacked by Be6, a move Rybka recommends.   However, White concedes that O-O-O does appear to have a strong attack up the center, but with the Queen in the lead, and black’s queen side rook about to come out, it looks more like the attacking Queen would get ambushed rather than the reverse.

Black: Ok, perhaps this is a matter of taste. personally i would rather have the pawns on e and c unprotected and the fully open file with my rook and queen down the centre."

White admits to being asleep at the wheel with b4.  Rybka ranked it as the 20th best move.

With 75% of the minor pieces off the board and White's King was safely defended and could start looking towards the end game.  White's plan was to win with better pawn positions by quicker movement on the queen-side:  The idea was to move his a and b pawns two squares forward depriving his opponent the same move and slowing him down. White could also increase the length of the pawn chain.

 

The drawback was that with the rapid advance of the b-pawn, it could not longer defend the c-pawn, which was later captured undefended.  White failed to take into account the activity soon to come from the undeveloped rooks.
