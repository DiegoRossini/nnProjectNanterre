c5 (as later discovered by me) is totally playable. It frees c6 for the Knight, attacks d4 (if 5. dxc5 0-0 a3 Bxc5 7. Nf3 b6 8. Bf4 Bb7 is good for Black.

9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/1bPP4/2N2N2/PPQ1PPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"Another thing: always look what the opponent's move does and take advantage of its downsides if possible. The move Nc3 is playable, because there are still may transposition possibilities left but the main move here is  dxc5 according to the database."
10,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk2r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/2p5/1bPP4/2N2N2/PPQ1PPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 2 6,"If 5. ...cxd4 6. Nxd4 , and I eventually have to play Nc6, which White can take, simplifying the position, which I don't want, since the simpler the position, the lower the possibilities in it.

So Nc6, towards the center. Attacking d4 again, in fact threatening to capture it, and developing. My plan here was ready: to control the center with pieces and later push it in White's face. I always like to move pieces rather than pawns since I seek positions where I can develop pawns with tempo."
11,e3,e2e3,r1bqk2r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/2p5/1bPP4/2N1PN2/PPQ2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"As I said, look for the downside of enemy moves. This move is too passive since it does nothing than freeing 2 (!) more squares to a bishop and defending a pawn which is attacked by a PAWn so they can capture each other. Much better and more forcing here is 6. dxc5 Bxc5 7. Bg5 (pinning a piece which controls some center squares and developing a piece).

I can play 6. ... d5 now, which is probably best, but that would lead to some simplifying for example: 7. a3 Bxc3+ 8. bxc3 0-0 9. Bd3 Qc7 10. 0-0 dxc4 11. Bxc4 e5 12. Bd3 Re8 13. Nxe5 Nxe5 14. dxe5 Qxe5."

However now White has some edge with 7. a3 cxd4 8. exd4 Bxc3+ 9. bxc3 solving the pin on c3, simplifying and soon he can play Rb1 attacking my Queen with tempo. That would be bad for me... but to my fortune, he also likes to play moves in the center... whatever move that is. It seems that he also don't know the Nimzo... but then why 3. Nc3?"

Bxc5 is slightly better... but I don't like my mishop facing to a ""stonewall"" of f2-e3... and to think further, what he can achieve with the flank attack? Nothing I think. So I play to his tempos."

But first I decided to get rid of the c4 pawn to create some threats of the undefended Queen: if now 9. cxd5 Nxd5 and the d5 Knight cannot be taken in view of the pin on c3 - and if he plays 10. e4 then simply 10. ... Nxc3 11. bxc3 and whoops, one more ""pawn group"", an isolated pawn - and the pin on c3 still stands."
