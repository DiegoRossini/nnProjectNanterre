4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/6P1/PPPP1P1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,attacking the e4 pawn thus gaining an early initiative and gaining more of the center

10,Bxh3,c8h3,rn1qk2r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/2b1p3/4P3/2N2QPb/PPPP1P1P/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 0 6,first bloodshed in the battle ... I cannot afford to lose the initiative and play passively ... I may have played Nb-d7 but this will give him the initiative
11,Nxh3,g1h3,rn1qk2r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/2b1p3/4P3/2N2QPN/PPPP1P1P/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 0 6,now he has a non-defended knight on edge ... which is not good

getting nearer to achieve my plan (1. castle queen-side 2. attack king-side toward whites king)"
