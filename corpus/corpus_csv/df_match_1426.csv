1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hot on the previous night's lucky win for the 1st Team, last night was a return to Earth with this exciting game, lost in a rush of blood to the head on my part.  I open with my usual 1. e4 - I prefer tactical scrambles to strategic tussles on the whole, even though I'm prone to slipping up in the process ..."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The Sicilian, an opening to prefer to play as Black, as it's very resourceful in counter-attacking options."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Typical of the Najdorf or the Dragon variations.
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,Typical of the Najdorf or the Dragon variations.
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,Typical of the Najdorf or the Dragon variations.
6,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,Typical of the Najdorf or the Dragon variations.
7,Nxd4,f3d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,Typical of the Najdorf or the Dragon variations.
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,Typical of the Najdorf or the Dragon variations.
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,Typical of the Najdorf or the Dragon variations.
10,a6,a7a6,rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,Typical of the Najdorf or the Dragon variations.
11,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"I've liked this move ever since I went to see the 17th game in the Short - Kasparov World Championship match in London.  6. Bg5 is probably the most common alternative, though the English Attack, characterised by f3 and Be3 is also very popular."
12,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/8/2BNP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,Confirming the Najdorf rather than the Dragon (6....g6).
13,Bb3,c4b3,rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/8/3NP3/1BN5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,"I usually play this immediately as it cuts out the trick ...Nxe4, Nxe4, ...d5, forking B and N.  It also gets the B off the semi-open c-file and covers the queenside pawns in the event of queenside castling, though I usually castle kingside in this opening."
14,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/1p2bppp/p2ppn2/8/3NP3/1BN5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 8,"The standard move to prepare kingside castling.  Another approach is to develop the queenside to allow queenside castling or at least to disturb White's troop of minor pieces there, with 7....b5 followed by queenside fianchetto, though Black has to keep an eye on potential White tricks on e6, or 7...Nbd7 followed by ...Nc5, forking Bb3 and pawn on e4"
15,f4,f2f4,rnbqk2r/1p2bppp/p2ppn2/8/3NPP2/1BN5/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,I've found this to be a more aggressive and flexible move than immediate castling.  My worries in this line usually concern my e-pawn when Black puts his B on b7.
16,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk2r/1p2bppp/p1nppn2/8/3NPP2/1BN5/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 9,Quite unusual in my experience and less daunting than 8...b5 as explained previously.
17,Be3,c1e3,r1bqk2r/1p2bppp/p1nppn2/8/3NPP2/1BN1B3/PPP3PP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 2 9,"I didn't want to swap the Ns yet, as the Nd4 provides me with so many possible plans.  In a previous annotation, I explained why I swapped on c6 at the first opportunity in terms of establishing an isolated pawn for Black.  It was pointed out to me that Black's mass of central pawns and half-open b-file more than compensated.  This B move develops it centrally and defends the Nd4 so that the Q can also develop freely."
18,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/1p2bppp/p1nppn2/8/3NPP2/1BN1B3/PPP3PP/R2QK2R w KQ - 3 10,Standard.
19,Qf3,d1f3,r1bq1rk1/1p2bppp/p1nppn2/8/3NPP2/1BN1BQ2/PPP3PP/R3K2R b KQ - 4 10,"I immediately prepare to attack the castled king, keeping my options open about where to put my king."
20,e5,e6e5,r1bq1rk1/1p2bppp/p1np1n2/4p3/3NPP2/1BN1BQ2/PPP3PP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 11,"With the N deprived of its most natural retreat square, Black attacks it."
21,Nxc6,d4c6,r1bq1rk1/1p2bppp/p1Np1n2/4p3/4PP2/1BN1BQ2/PPP3PP/R3K2R b KQ - 0 11,"Now I swapped, removing a defender of e5.  I didn't want to retreat the N and I rejected 11. Nf5 as I didn't like 11...Bxf5 12. exf5 d5 when I wasn't sure how to respond."
22,bxc6,b7c6,r1bq1rk1/4bppp/p1pp1n2/4p3/4PP2/1BN1BQ2/PPP3PP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 12,"I played this quickly, without really thinking.  I was keen to prosecute the kingside attack, so it made sense to shut off Black's QB, but I think I should have planned a bit more carefully around here.  If Black counter-attacked in the centre, the pawn could become weak and my king exposed."
23,f5,f4f5,r1bq1rk1/4bppp/p1pp1n2/4pP2/4P3/1BN1BQ2/PPP3PP/R3K2R b KQ - 0 12,"I played this quickly, without really thinking.  I was keen to prosecute the kingside attack, so it made sense to shut off Black's QB, but I think I should have planned a bit more carefully around here.  If Black counter-attacked in the centre, the pawn could become weak and my king exposed."
24,Ne8,f6e8,r1bqnrk1/4bppp/p1pp4/4pP2/4P3/1BN1BQ2/PPP3PP/R3K2R w KQ - 1 13,Unexpected but it makes sense.  Black wants to swap the DSBs before White's attack gets going.
25,O-O-O,e1c1,r1bqnrk1/4bppp/p1pp4/4pP2/4P3/1BN1BQ2/PPP3PP/2KR3R b - - 2 13,"Now seemed a propitious time to castle queenside, allowing me to prepare an all-out kingside assault.  The king seems quite safe here as Black's pieces are more suitably arranged for kingside defence than queenside attack."
26,Bg5,e7g5,r1bqnrk1/5ppp/p1pp4/4pPb1/4P3/1BN1BQ2/PPP3PP/2KR3R w - - 3 14,"Black pursues his plan to eliminate the DSBs.  My B is, of course, pinned against my K, so I can't avoid the swap but I can influence how it happens.  I didn't want his Q coming to g5, hence my reply."
27,h4,h2h4,r1bqnrk1/5ppp/p1pp4/4pPb1/4P2P/1BN1BQ2/PPP3P1/2KR3R b - - 0 14,"As I let go of the piece, I thought, ""Oh dear, he can just take the pawn"" but then decided that, if he did, I could happily play Qh3..."
28,Bxe3+,g5e3,r1bqnrk1/5ppp/p1pp4/4pP2/4P2P/1BN1bQ2/PPP3P1/2KR3R w - - 0 15,Black reactivates the backward N as soon as possible.  The N covers g4 and h5 and inhibits my N and Q by attacking e4.
29,Qxe3,f3e3,r1bqnrk1/5ppp/p1pp4/4pP2/4P2P/1BN1Q3/PPP3P1/2KR3R b - - 0 15,Black reactivates the backward N as soon as possible.  The N covers g4 and h5 and inhibits my N and Q by attacking e4.
30,Nf6,e8f6,r1bq1rk1/5ppp/p1pp1n2/4pP2/4P2P/1BN1Q3/PPP3P1/2KR3R w - - 1 16,Black reactivates the backward N as soon as possible.  The N covers g4 and h5 and inhibits my N and Q by attacking e4.
