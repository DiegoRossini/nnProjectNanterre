23,Bb5+,e2b5,r1b1kb1r/pp2pppp/3p4/1B1Pq3/8/8/P4PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 12,I think 12.. Bd7 would have been OK here too
24,Kd8,e8d8,r1bk1b1r/pp2pppp/3p4/1B1Pq3/8/8/P4PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 2 13,I think 12.. Bd7 would have been OK here too

39,Bxd6,f4d6,r1bk1b1r/6pp/3Bp3/pB3q2/Q7/8/P4PPP/2RR2K1 b - - 0 20,Black resigns. It does look bad for black but I wasn't seeing a clear cut mate. 21... Bxd6 22. Rxd6  Ke7 then maybe 23 Qd4
