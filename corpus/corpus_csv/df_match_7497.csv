1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I probably face 1.e4 more than any other opening move in correspondence chess. Either acolytes of ""best by test"" or lots of people prefer open games to closed games."
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"As for me, I prefer semi-open or closed games :-)"
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,By eschewing 2.d4 my opponent is inviting any one of a number of unorthodox moves to avoid any mainline French theory.
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,I do not oblige him.
5,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3P4/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,So d4 is finally played and we have the beginning of a familiar/drawish French exchange setup.

8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"6...Bg4 is playful more than anything else. There are a number of other moves just as good and more solid, but I'm sensing my opponent is hoping for just that: solid defensive play. Better to play around and see if any holes develop!"

13,h3,h2h3,rn1qk2r/ppp1bppp/5n2/3p4/3P2b1/2NB1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,I've already goaded him!
14,Bh5,g4h5,rn1qk2r/ppp1bppp/5n2/3p3b/3P4/2NB1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 8,? This is a mistake that should cost me a pawn. I took my opponent's previous move as cautious and complacent and so I started really horsing around when I'm now in serious danger of blowing the opening. The continuation to lose the pawn would be: 9.g4 Bg6 10.g5 Nh5 11.Nxd5
15,Be3,c1e3,rn1qk2r/ppp1bppp/5n2/3p3b/3P4/2NBBN1P/PPP2PP1/R2QK2R b KQkq - 2 8,? This is a mistake that should cost me a pawn.

17,g4,g2g4,r2qk2r/pppnbppp/5n2/3p3b/3P2P1/2NBBN1P/PPP2P2/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 9,"Here, I thought my opponent saw it and I was close to resigning already. Thankfully, my favorite chess motto is ""Never Resign!"""
18,Bg6,h5g6,r2qk2r/pppnbppp/5nb1/3p4/3P2P1/2NBBN1P/PPP2P2/R2QK2R w KQkq - 1 10,"Aha! 10.g5 is missed and so now I have a chance to save my loose pawn. I'm not sure what my opponent hopes to gain here as the pawn is already bolstered on the g5 square by the DSB. As we will see, the rook is misplaced, not only in preventing castling, but will need to defend h2 very soon."
19,Rg1,h1g1,r2qk2r/pppnbppp/5nb1/3p4/3P2P1/2NBBN1P/PPP2P2/R2QK1R1 b Qkq - 2 10,"Aha! 10.g5 is missed and so now I have a chance to save my loose pawn.

I haven't castled yet, nor I have I made any threatening moves. It's like we're both waiting for the other to do something. I, however, have already been planning. His kingside is a shambles, I must provoke to start stirring the pot."
22,Ne4,f6e4,r2qk2r/pp1nbppp/2p3b1/3p4/3Pn1P1/P1NBBN1P/1PP2P2/R2QK1R1 w Qkq - 1 12,"I love this move! The white king is still stuck in the center (I can castle at my leisure) and now my knight occupies the valuable real estate at e4. He can't be exchanged for the knight at c3 because of the impending pawn fork, but exchanging him for the LSB is almost worse since then my bishop pair gives me a lot more latitude should the position open up. The best thing for the moment would be to just leave him there, except that should I exchange at c3, the queenside gets airy and the white king has nowhere to go should things get ugly."
23,Bxe4,d3e4,r2qk2r/pp1nbppp/2p3b1/3p4/3PB1P1/P1N1BN1P/1PP2P2/R2QK1R1 b Qkq - 0 12,My opponent cannot risk being unable to castle and so gambles the longterm threat of my bishop pair (and potential light square weaknesses) against removing the threat immediately and maybe even winning the soon-to-be black e4 pawn in the process.

27,Rh1,g1h1,r3k2r/ppqnbppp/2p3b1/8/3Pp1P1/P1N1B2P/1PPN1P2/R2QK2R b Qkq - 3 14,"Correcting the error as best he can. I would prefer 14.Rg2 myself, although that would be a mistake if he pushed the g-pawn, which he later does. So the best he could do given his situation and inclinations."
28,Nf6,d7f6,r3k2r/ppq1bppp/2p2nb1/8/3Pp1P1/P1N1B2P/1PPN1P2/R2QK2R w Qkq - 4 15,"This is a gamble. I'm hoping to provoke a response, buying time for a longterm defense of the pawn and keeping my opponent's position cramped. Should he ignore my e-pawn and try to develop his king to the queenside a very different game than the one I imagined should arise."
29,g5,g4g5,r3k2r/ppq1bppp/2p2nb1/6P1/3Pp3/P1N1B2P/1PPN1P2/R2QK2R b Qkq - 0 15,He takes the bait!
30,Nd5,f6d5,r3k2r/ppq1bppp/2p3b1/3n2P1/3Pp3/P1N1B2P/1PPN1P2/R2QK2R w Qkq - 1 16,"The pawn can now be taken, but not without serious consequences: 16.Nxe4 Nxe3 17.fxe3 Bxe4 18.Nxe4 Bxg5 ... if now 19.Nxg5 then 19...Qg3+ pickes up the knight, an extra pawn, and leaves the king dislodged on his decimated kingside. Not a won game to be sure, but an uncomfortable one, all things considered."
