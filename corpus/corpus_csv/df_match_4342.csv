5,Nxe5,f3e5,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,And now the French attack variant.
6,d6,d7d6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,The standard continuation is unfolding...
7,Nf3,e5f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"This is now the classical attack variant, all moves according to book."
8,Nxe4,f6e4,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/4n3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"This is now the classical attack variant, all moves according to book."
9,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p4/8/3Pn3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"This is now the classical attack variant, all moves according to book."
10,d5,d6d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3Pn3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"This move is designed to stake a claim to the center and post my knight to be a constant thorn in white's side.  An early priority should be to dislodge my knight or attack the d5 pawn, all while developing your own pieces."
11,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3Pn3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,Book response.
12,Bd6,f8d6,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/3b4/3p4/3Pn3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 7,"Book, and for those chess monkeys, it's called the Marshall variation."
13,O-O,e1g1,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/3b4/3p4/3Pn3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 3 7,Castling is a good idea here as it frees up the rook to play as well.
14,c6,c7c6,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/2pb4/3p4/3Pn3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,This move was designed to give my knight and the d5 pawn some staying power.  I anticipated that his c pawn of remaining knight will come into play soon.
15,c4,c2c4,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/2pb4/3p4/2PPn3/3B1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,"And there it is.  This is a great move as it puts pressure on my d pawn but also allows his knight to develop as well, to bring on the heat.  There are a lot of good possibilities here for white."
16,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/2pb4/3p4/2PPn3/3B1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 1 9,Time to castle in case I need to bring my rook into the game.
17,cxd5,c4d5,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/2pb4/3P4/3Pn3/3B1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 0 9,This is one of the most typical responses at this point and white is attacking just like he should.
18,cxd5,c6d5,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/3b4/3p4/3Pn3/3B1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 0 10,No other response worth considering.
19,Nc3,b1c3,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/3b4/3p4/3Pn3/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 10,"Continuing an aggressive attack, white is in good shape.  I have a few options here."
20,Bg4,c8g4,rn1q1rk1/pp3ppp/3b4/3p4/3Pn1b1/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 2 11,"This was perhaps not my strongest play, but I wanted to put some pressure on white's knight and see what shook loose.  I also didn't want to give white the chance to shift another pawn to his center, giving him a stronger center advantage.  My d pawn is weak and isolated, but if it is, I'd rather his was too.

If white takes Nxd5, Bxh2+ regains parity."
21,Nxe4,c3e4,rn1q1rk1/pp3ppp/3b4/3p4/3PN1b1/3B1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 11,Effectively earning a pawn advantage.
22,dxe4,d5e4,rn1q1rk1/pp3ppp/3b4/8/3Pp1b1/3B1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 12,No other choice.
23,Bxe4,d3e4,rn1q1rk1/pp3ppp/3b4/8/3PB1b1/5N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 12,And now white is ahead a pawn.  I have only a few responses that can save me from real damage on my queenside rook.
24,Nc6,b8c6,r2q1rk1/pp3ppp/2nb4/8/3PB1b1/5N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 13,"I prefer this move to Qc7 as it continues development, but also puts some added pressure on his d pawn, and maybe something good can happen.  So far white is playing superb."
