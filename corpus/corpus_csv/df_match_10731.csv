1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,This is a game played with the Reti opening system in which black neglects development and makes an inexplicable opening 14 moves of which 11 are pawn moves.  He then fails to capitalise on some inaccuracies by white and finally overlooks a mate threat by getting greedy for material.
2,a5,a7a5,rnbqkbnr/1ppppppp/8/p7/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,"This is an unorthodox response to the Reti, more common are ...Nf6; ...d5; ...e6; ...Nc6 and ...f5"
3,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/1ppppppp/8/p7/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,Perhaps 2.d4 or 2.Nc3
4,a4,a5a4,rnbqkbnr/1ppppppp/8/8/p3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"Black had the opportunity to transpose back into a relatively normal line but instead makes this move. As a general rule a piece should not be moved twice in the first about 12 moves, especially if its a wing pawn."
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/1ppppppp/8/8/p2PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,Now white has a strong foothold in the centre.  This becomes important later as black tries to challenge it but doesn't have the firepower and white crashes through on the uncastled black king with a stunning attack.
6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/4p3/8/p2PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Probably black's best bet at this stage, another possibility is 3...Nf6"
7,Qe2,d1e2,rnbqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/4p3/8/p2PP3/5N2/PPP1QPPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"I can't remember whether I had a good reason for playing this move at the time, but looking back it is a pretty appalling move, the queen is on a bad square and relocates in a few moves anyway and she also blocks in the kings bishop"
8,h6,h7h6,rnbqkbnr/1ppp1pp1/4p2p/8/p2PP3/5N2/PPP1QPPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Black has various opportunities to develop one of his knights or his kings bishop. This pawn move is unnecessary (5.Bg5 loses tempo for white although it does create a weakness in black's structure, but 4...Be7 is much better for black)"
9,a3,a2a3,rnbqkbnr/1ppp1pp1/4p2p/8/p2PP3/P4N2/1PP1QPPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"perhaps not the best move, but I felt at the time that it was best to oppose blacks a pawn"
10,g5,g7g5,rnbqkbnr/1ppp1p2/4p2p/6p1/p2PP3/P4N2/1PP1QPPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"This kingside pawn expansion might be OK if black had pieces developed and was planning on castling queenside, but right now its just another waste of tempo and weakens the kingside squares, particularly h5"
11,Be3,c1e3,rnbqkbnr/1ppp1p2/4p2p/6p1/p2PP3/P3BN2/1PP1QPPP/RN2KB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"Simply building up an advantage in development which black seems desperate to hand to me anyway, I have read somewhere (I think in a GK annotation) that the best way to meet unorthodox openings with lots of pawn moves is to develop as quickly as possible.  I have a feeling my opponent was simply trying to throw me out of book, so I think this is the best way to meet that sort of thing. (In any case, I don't really have much opening knowledge except in the Ruy Lopez and, to a lesser extent the Petrov)"
12,b6,b7b6,rnbqkbnr/2pp1p2/1p2p2p/6p1/p2PP3/P3BN2/1PP1QPPP/RN2KB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"6...Bg7 would follow logically from blacks 5th move, perhaps he is planning Ba6 to harry my queen and potentially stop me castling kingside.  Better were ...Bg7 and ...Ne7"
13,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/2pp1p2/1p2p2p/6p1/p1PPP3/P3BN2/1P2QPPP/RN2KB1R b KQkq - 0 7,Gains me space and blocks up the f1-a6 diagonal
14,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/3p1p2/1pp1p2p/6p1/p1PPP3/P3BN2/1P2QPPP/RN2KB1R w KQkq - 0 8,Plenty of better moves: ...Nc6; ...Bg7; ...d6; ...g4 etc.
15,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/3p1p2/1pp1p2p/6p1/p1PPP3/P1N1BN2/1P2QPPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 1 8,"cementing the central squares and coordinating my pieces a bit more, also a sound developing move."
16,Ba6,c8a6,rn1qkbnr/3p1p2/bpp1p2p/6p1/p1PPP3/P1N1BN2/1P2QPPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 2 9,"And black finally gets off the back rank.  Taking a look at the positions now, white is well developed except his poorly placed queen and trapped kingside bishop, he has a vice-like grip on the centre and his c-, d- and e-pawns are very commanding.  He is ready to castle queenside which can be done perfectly safely despite his queenside pawns having moved.  Black, on the other hand has 7 pieces at home, a weak kingside, and pawn-structure generally, with holes at h5, f6 and d6 of which only f6 is adequately defended.  His king can't castle for at least 3 moves (4 if he wants to castle queenside, which would be safer given the state of his kingside) and his pieces are hemmed in, with none of them able to advance beyond the 6th rank.  White is in control."
17,Qc2,e2c2,rn1qkbnr/3p1p2/bpp1p2p/6p1/p1PPP3/P1N1BN2/1PQ2PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 3 9,"Makes my 4th move look silly, which of course it was, the queen had to move to make way for the Bf1 and is also safer off the a6-f1 diagonal.  I think this is the best place to move"
18,Nf6,g8f6,rn1qkb1r/3p1p2/bpp1pn1p/6p1/p1PPP3/P1N1BN2/1PQ2PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 4 10,"development was necessary, but this just allows the knight to be chased, either back home or out to h5 where it will be hastled for a few more moves and become a liability as black tries to get into a middle game.  The bottom line is that this piece should have developed ages ago, but right now the best place for it was e7"
19,h3,h2h3,rn1qkb1r/3p1p2/bpp1pn1p/6p1/p1PPP3/P1N1BN1P/1PQ2PP1/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 10,"I know why I made this move before e5, it was to prevent ...Ng4, but of course ...Ng4 would be poor anyway, so this was basically a wasted move"
20,b5,b6b5,rn1qkb1r/3p1p2/b1p1pn1p/1p4p1/p1PPP3/P1N1BN1P/1PQ2PP1/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 11,"the d pawn was the one to push here, giving the black pieces a bit more breathing room and punishing white for delaying e5 by making a good escape square for the knight on d7 and also guarding e5.  This also makes blacks light square bishop horribly bad and also weakens the queenside dark squares generally.  This is the second move by the b pawn - another loss of tempo"
