1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"....... a DRAW with the Master Mater!

Hi everyone!

This is my longest ever game with Master Freddy and I am pleased to say that after 50 losses I finally opened my account with the Master Mater who is not called that for nothing!  Operation Joblock finally triumphed.  Anyhow, this marathon started off with Freddy playing 1. c4 which is the English Opening."
