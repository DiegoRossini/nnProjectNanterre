1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Me v William helping to improve his play.  Queen pawn 2 nice standard opening
2,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I'll follow up with this
3,h4,h2h4,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/3P3P/8/PPP1PPP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Strange opening. I think this is pretty weak IMO as it is not attacking the centre squares.
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppppp1pp/5n2/5p2/3P3P/8/PPP1PPP1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,I'll continue my development
5,h5,h4h5,rnbqkb1r/ppppp1pp/5n2/5p1P/3P4/8/PPP1PPP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,This is confusing because it is unorthodox.  I obviously cant take it yet and now it cant go anywhere so I think it is a wasted move.
6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp2pp/4pn2/5p1P/3P4/8/PPP1PPP1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,So I am moving here which might look pretty weak but it is now opening up access for my bishop and queen.
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppp2pp/4pn2/5p1P/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPP1/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,That's more of a standard move attacking the centre of the board.
8,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk2r/pppp2pp/4pn2/5p1P/1b1P4/2N5/PPP1PPP1/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 5,I will pin his knight and develop my bishop.
9,Qd2,d1d2,rnbqk2r/pppp2pp/4pn2/5p1P/1b1P4/2N5/PPPQPPP1/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 3 5,Don't see the point of this move as he still cant move his knight without sacrificing his queen.
10,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk2r/pppp2pp/2n1pn2/5p1P/1b1P4/2N5/PPPQPPP1/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 4 6,So i'll attackd4 and develop my knight
11,a3,a2a3,r1bqk2r/pppp2pp/2n1pn2/5p1P/1b1P4/P1N5/1PPQPPP1/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 0 6,I don't mind this move.  He obviously wants my bishop to move.  I first thought of taking his knight but.....
12,Ne4,f6e4,r1bqk2r/pppp2pp/2n1p3/5p1P/1b1Pn3/P1N5/1PPQPPP1/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 1 7,I thought about attacking his queen.  he cant capture my knight or bishop without losing his queen and when I do capture his knight next move I assume he will have to capture my knight back with his b pawn disturbing his pawn formation.
13,Qd3,d2d3,r1bqk2r/pppp2pp/2n1p3/5p1P/1b1Pn3/P1NQ4/1PP1PPP1/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 2 7,As I thought
14,Bxc3+,b4c3,r1bqk2r/pppp2pp/2n1p3/5p1P/3Pn3/P1bQ4/1PP1PPP1/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 0 8,now I check him capturing knight and doubling up his pawn
15,bxc3,b2c3,r1bqk2r/pppp2pp/2n1p3/5p1P/3Pn3/P1PQ4/2P1PPP1/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 0 8,Pawns doubled
16,b6,b7b6,r1bqk2r/p1pp2pp/1pn1p3/5p1P/3Pn3/P1PQ4/2P1PPP1/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 0 9,now lets give my bishop a chance to come out
17,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqk2r/p1pp2pp/1pn1p3/5p1P/3Pn3/P1PQ1N2/2P1PPP1/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 1 9,Developing his knight
18,Bb7,c8b7,r2qk2r/pbpp2pp/1pn1p3/5p1P/3Pn3/P1PQ1N2/2P1PPP1/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 2 10,Outcomes my bishop.  I believe this gives me a strong attack of the diagonal
19,Ne5,f3e5,r2qk2r/pbpp2pp/1pn1p3/4Np1P/3Pn3/P1PQ4/2P1PPP1/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 3 10,I'm not sure why he's done this.  Perhaps bring out the f pawn to move my knight
20,Nxe5,c6e5,r2qk2r/pbpp2pp/1p2p3/4np1P/3Pn3/P1PQ4/2P1PPP1/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 0 11,I'll take it anyway and double up two more pawns still controlling the diagonal with my bishop
