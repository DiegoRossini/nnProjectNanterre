a subtle mistake, but one that loses. i believe Be3 was the only move to save, as the bishop was vulnerable to capture from the rook. the reason the bishop is so important to white is he must take the knight with it at some stage, though not yet, or he loses material. now he cannot capture the knight, and as such is in deep trouble. i cannot be 100% sure, but i think black now has mate in 12, assuming best play from both. if anyone feels like analysing, feel free to post your findings. i spent hours analysing this part of the game, and i reckon mate in 12. i get there quicker, though."

taking the pawn drops the knight after Bxe5 , blocking allows Bxe6 , forcing my rook or knight to take and allowing him to escape mate, and Ke8 is out of the question as he can queen with check, thus winning."
