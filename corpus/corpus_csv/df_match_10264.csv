1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Here is my first ever competitive game over the board with a long(ish) time control.  It is the first round of the Glasgow Polytechnic Club Championship which I joined a week before this game was played.  My opponent was also a new member of the club and had a bit less experience than me but was still a reasonable opponent.  I will hopefully get round to posting some more of my OTB games here soon, in particular those from my club championship.  Hope you enjoy."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I have recently taken to playing the Sicilian and thought that one of Glasgow's top chess clubs would be a great place to practice.  I have also bought John Emms' book on the Sicilian recently so watch out for that in a couple of months time, my dragon should be red hot."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"I am pleased to see my opponent head for the open Sicilian.  I love playing the anti-Sicilians (particularly Morra Gambit) as white, but hate to meet them as black."
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,My usual
5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 3,"The Italian variation.  Not one I see often, I think it is a little too committing for white.  Better is 3.d4"
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 4,getting to play for my pet dragon a move early
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/2p5/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 4,White defends his hanging pawn
8,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p1np1/2p5/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,signaling my intention to play the dragon.  My opponent could still transpose back to the main line with 5.d4 cxd4 6.Nxd4 Bg7 7.f3 O-O
9,d3,d2d3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p1np1/2p5/2B1P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"?! I got the first inkling that this might just be my night, a feeling which grew stronger as the evening went on.  This move is downright passive, something you cannot afford in any Sicilian, much less the dragon.  Much better is 5.d4"
10,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2p5/2B1P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 6,"continuing with my dragon set-up, clears the way to castle."
11,O-O,e1g1,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2p5/2B1P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 2 6,"white bundles his king to safety.  With his play already passive after just 5 moves, white is best castling kingside rather than going for an attack race with a QSC."
12,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2p5/2B1P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 3 7,My king is now where he belongs; time to develop my queenside and hopefully exploit the weak d4
13,Bg5,c1g5,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/2p3B1/2B1P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 4 7,"an aggressive move.  I did not know yet that my opponent's game plan was to exchange off as many pieces as possible, I quickly wised up and prevented it."
14,Nc6,b8c6,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/2p3B1/2B1P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 5 8,continuing with my development; I am currently behind in that respect but my position is better
15,Bxf6,g5f6,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1Bp1/2p5/2B1P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 8,"My opponent goes for the exchange.  I was surprised by this move as his bishop was quite a good piece.  This gives me the two bishops 'advantage', which I personally think is overrated, but as you will see, my opponent soon divests himself of his knights too."
16,Bxf6,g7f6,r1bq1rk1/pp2pp1p/2np1bp1/2p5/2B1P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 9,"The bishop recapture is obvious, keeping my pawns in shape and keeping a watch over the long diagonal"
17,d4,d3d4,r1bq1rk1/pp2pp1p/2np1bp1/2p5/2BPP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 9,? Losing a pawn.  This should have been played on move 5 when it would have led to an equal exchange.  Black is better.
18,cxd4,c5d4,r1bq1rk1/pp2pp1p/2np1bp1/8/2BpP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 10,"Snapping up the pawn.  This is the best recapture as I want to keep pieces on the board while my opponent appears keen to swap, the fact that I am a pawn up does not mean that I want to be boring and swap down to an endgame where I can grind out a win."
19,Nd5,c3d5,r1bq1rk1/pp2pp1p/2np1bp1/3N4/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 10,This looks quite active but it is really just an attempt to swap off the dragon
20,Bg7,f6g7,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np2p1/3N4/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 2 11,I have no desire to let the dragon bishop go so I put him back in his lair
