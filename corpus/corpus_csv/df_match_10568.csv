Also this avoids the classical mainline which has traditionally give white a superior edge. The main line continues 4. ...Bf5 8. Ng3...Bg6 6. H4 h6 7. Nf3 Nf6

The positional basis of 7. ...Nf6 is that black tempts white into playing Ne5 and then after the retreat 8. ...Bh7 black tries to prove that the well placed Knight on e5 is a target. Traditional plans for black to undermine the e5 knight are c6-c5 or attacking it directly with moves like bd6, Nb-d7, and Qc7. 

This follows the general chess principle that a peice does not control the square it is sitting on. So by going to e5 the knight has given up control of e5 and d4."

So I transposed into the Korchonoi system with fxe6, which in my experience is a very resourceful line. The main advantage of the Korchonoi system is that black achieves free and rapid development. As well, black has great chances of controlling the e file. Finally, Black has an extra pawn on the king-side. I like blacks pawn structure on the king-side because it can be very defensive.
