1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Hi everyone!  I am black in this game of my 1700-1800 mini-tournament and I end up having an early bath.  I merely follow the database but my opponent tries to hold on to his extra pawn with great cost as you will see.  My opponent's rating at the time was 1674 so even an intermediate player can blunder his queen!
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,2. Nc3 - the Vienna Opening - this is a versatile opening and can transpose into quite a few openings including the Bishop's Opening which starts with Bc4 instead of Nc3.

4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,3. g3 - white has played the Vienna Opening with 2. Nc3 and now plays an unusual g3.  This is another way to support the e4 pawn.

I looked at the board to see why he had done this and saw that I will net the Wicked Witch of the West and his rook on a1 into the bargain!  No wonder he resigned without waiting for my reply.  White is no beginner, in fact, his current rating is 1800+ and he is top of the 1700-1800 tournament table as I write."
