1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This common, monotonous, mundane, nullifying almost reprehensible move lacked the innovation i desired for an entertaining game... oh well"
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,i countered it with the favourite of the cowards and minds of those where the kindling of a brain had never begun in the first place- i sort of just insulted myself
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,he was not hampered by my decision and adhered to enhancing his control over the center of the board
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,unique in the sense it isn't played often but cowering in the depths and allowing the cold war style tension to bring is my cup of tea.
5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 3,shame... it appears he has plans for my pieces- a fate which isn't ideal in my opinion
6,h6,h7h6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/3p3p/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,enforcing my defense and playing along with my own creation of a pawn jig.
7,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/3p3p/4p3/2BPP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,oh no- now i had to make the deadly decision of allowing him to draw blood first or be taken array with this extremely tempting bait...
8,exd4,e5d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/3p3p/8/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,couldn't resist- not really my style but through this game i do develop a ruthless personality in an urge for greater power and control!
9,Qxd4,d1d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/3p3p/8/2BQP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 5,rough- atleast it saVED me the burden of dutifully caRING for that measley pawn and i did expect that to happen
10,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/ppp2pp1/2np3p/8/2BQP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 1 6,bring on my own strikem whilst simultaneously advancing my superiority in this game
11,Qd1,d4d1,r1bqkbnr/ppp2pp1/2np3p/8/2B1P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 6,retreat- cowering among his own barracks
12,Bg4,c8g4,r2qkbnr/ppp2pp1/2np3p/8/2B1P1b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 3 7,a nice pin to disable that threatening peice- but it is probably only going to be a temporary thing
13,h3,h2h3,r2qkbnr/ppp2pp1/2np3p/8/2B1P1b1/5N1P/PPP2PP1/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,this person appears to have a penchant of being attacking and generally a nuisance
14,Bh5,g4h5,r2qkbnr/ppp2pp1/2np3p/7b/2B1P3/5N1P/PPP2PP1/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 8,"that allows me to retain the pin, unless white is foolishly willing to play g4, weakening his right hand side of the board"
15,Nc3,b1c3,r2qkbnr/ppp2pp1/2np3p/7b/2B1P3/2N2N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 8,"there he goes, taking advantage of my undeveloped side and thus trundling on in his own fight for control in the board"
16,Nf6,g8f6,r2qkb1r/ppp2pp1/2np1n1p/7b/2B1P3/2N2N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 3 9,im not to be left behind
17,Bf4,c1f4,r2qkb1r/ppp2pp1/2np1n1p/7b/2B1PB2/2N2N1P/PPP2PP1/R2QK2R b KQkq - 4 9,"uh? looking at it briefly it appears to do little to my impermeable defence structure though i must grudgingly accept allows his queen and rook to connect, which can engender further threat in the approaching, daunting future of this so thrilling a game!"
18,Be7,f8e7,r2qk2r/ppp1bpp1/2np1n1p/7b/2B1PB2/2N2N1P/PPP2PP1/R2QK2R w KQkq - 5 10,an attempt to get a placid castling done to put my king away in the realms of safety
19,g4,g2g4,r2qk2r/ppp1bpp1/2np1n1p/7b/2B1PBP1/2N2N1P/PPP2P2/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 10,this opponent is really pestering and tenacious. Atleast the advancing foolishly of these pawns reduces any chance of his king castling on this side- unless he is feeling extremely ambitious and optimistic!
20,Bg6,h5g6,r2qk2r/ppp1bpp1/2np1nbp/8/2B1PBP1/2N2N1P/PPP2P2/R2QK2R w KQkq - 1 11,not much choice there for me
