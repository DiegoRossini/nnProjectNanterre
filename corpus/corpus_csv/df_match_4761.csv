However, I have gained real threats in g4 and b4. 

The real value for me in the move 10. ...g4 is that it actively strikes at the heart of white main idea which is to break through with e4-e5. By forces white to play Ne5 prematurely it forces white to weaken is his control of e5. Thus allowing me to exchange of knights white loses a value piece in the conquest of play e4-e5. Black on the other hand at this point in time retains the option of playing b5-b4"
