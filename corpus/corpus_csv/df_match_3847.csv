1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"2....d5. The French Defense, Reversed Philidor Variation. I'm not to familiar with this line, but I don't think that I like it."
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"2....d5. The French Defense, Reversed Philidor Variation. I'm not to familiar with this line, but I don't think that I like it."
3,d3,d2d3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"2....d5. The French Defense, Reversed Philidor Variation. I'm not to familiar with this line, but I don't think that I like it."
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"2....d5. The French Defense, Reversed Philidor Variation. I'm not to familiar with this line, but I don't think that I like it."
5,Qf3,d1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/4P3/3P1Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 1 3,3.Qf3? This move is strange. I think that White should develop.
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/3p4/4P3/3P1Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"3....Nc6 Develops, keeping tabs on e5 and d4."
7,Nh3,g1h3,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/3p4/4P3/3P1Q1N/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 3 4,"4.Nh3? White should have probably played 4.Ne2, then fianchettoed his Light Squared Bishop, since it has little future in the French center."
8,b6,b7b6,r1bqkbnr/p1p2ppp/1pn1p3/3p4/4P3/3P1Q1N/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"4....b6 I prepare for a fianchetto. This also allows Bc5, aligning the Bishops."
9,Ng5,h3g5,r1bqkbnr/p1p2ppp/1pn1p3/3p2N1/4P3/3P1Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"5.Ng5. Ahh, so that's what he was getting at. No, White should develop instead of attacking. Two pieces is hardly a battle-ready force."
10,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/p1p2ppp/1pn1pn2/3p2N1/4P3/3P1Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 2 6,5...Nf6. This develops and blocks the mate threat on f6.
11,c3,c2c3,r1bqkb1r/p1p2ppp/1pn1pn2/3p2N1/4P3/2PP1Q2/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"6.c3. Preparing a d4 pawn push, which would be follows by d4, e5, and my Dark Squared Bishop would be obsolete."
12,g6,g7g6,r1bqkb1r/p1p2p1p/1pn1pnp1/3p2N1/4P3/2PP1Q2/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 7,6....g6. This allows me to get my Dark Squared Bishop to a more useful location than his dying future on the a3-f8 diagonal.
13,d4,d3d4,r1bqkb1r/p1p2p1p/1pn1pnp1/3p2N1/3PP3/2P2Q2/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 7,7.d4. The aforementioned pawn push.
14,Bh6,f8h6,r1bqk2r/p1p2p1p/1pn1pnpb/3p2N1/3PP3/2P2Q2/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 1 8,7....Bh6. This pins the Knight to the Bishop on c1.
15,e5,e4e5,r1bqk2r/p1p2p1p/1pn1pnpb/3pP1N1/3P4/2P2Q2/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 8,8.e5. Now White controls the dark squares. And here is my first miscalculation.
16,Bxg5,h6g5,r1bqk2r/p1p2p1p/1pn1pnp1/3pP1b1/3P4/2P2Q2/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 9,8....Bxg5?? This miscalculation allows Black to win a minor piece.
17,Bxg5,c1g5,r1bqk2r/p1p2p1p/1pn1pnp1/3pP1B1/3P4/2P2Q2/PP3PPP/RN2KB1R b KQkq - 0 9,"9....O-O. I cannot move the Knight, because of the pin, and I had to castle to avoid losing even more material."
18,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/p1p2p1p/1pn1pnp1/3pP1B1/3P4/2P2Q2/PP3PPP/RN2KB1R w KQ - 1 10,"9....O-O. I cannot move the Knight, because of the pin, and I had to castle to avoid losing even more material."
19,Bxf6,g5f6,r1bq1rk1/p1p2p1p/1pn1pBp1/3pP3/3P4/2P2Q2/PP3PPP/RN2KB1R b KQ - 0 10,10....Qe8. Now everything goes downhill.
20,Qe8,d8e8,r1b1qrk1/p1p2p1p/1pn1pBp1/3pP3/3P4/2P2Q2/PP3PPP/RN2KB1R w KQ - 1 11,10....Qe8. Now everything goes downhill.
21,Qh3,f3h3,r1b1qrk1/p1p2p1p/1pn1pBp1/3pP3/3P4/2P4Q/PP3PPP/RN2KB1R b KQ - 2 11,"11.Qh3. This prepares for 12.Qh6, then mate is unavoidable."
22,h5,h7h5,r1b1qrk1/p1p2p2/1pn1pBp1/3pP2p/3P4/2P4Q/PP3PPP/RN2KB1R w KQ - 0 12,11....h5. Only option.
23,Qe3,h3e3,r1b1qrk1/p1p2p2/1pn1pBp1/3pP2p/3P4/2P1Q3/PP3PPP/RN2KB1R b KQ - 1 12,12.Qe3. White is relentless. 13.Qh6 is unavoidable mate.
24,Kh7,g8h7,r1b1qr2/p1p2p1k/1pn1pBp1/3pP2p/3P4/2P1Q3/PP3PPP/RN2KB1R w KQ - 2 13,"12....Kh7. Once again, the only defense."
25,Be2,f1e2,r1b1qr2/p1p2p1k/1pn1pBp1/3pP2p/3P4/2P1Q3/PP2BPPP/RN2K2R b KQ - 3 13,13.Be2. Probably preparing for a sac on h5 to rip away my defense.
