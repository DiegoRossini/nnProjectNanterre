1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Not a very inspiring move and usually an opponent that plays like this denotes either a beginner or someone that is strong player but who avoids opening theory. More often than not, it's usually the first case but in this game it would prove to be the latter."

3,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/ppppppp1/7p/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Occupying the center in accordance to chess theory.
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1pp1/4p2p/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,It looks like Black is aiming for a French defense but with an early h6.
5,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1pp1/4p2p/8/2PPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,Trying build a strong pawn center with cxd5 in case Black plays d5.
6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/4p2p/3p4/2PPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Which he does.
7,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/4p2p/3P4/3PP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,The center has been fixed now and the structure is something similar to the French but slightly better for Black because his LSB isn't hemmed in by its own pawns.
8,exd5,e6d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/7p/3p4/3PP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,The center has been fixed now and the structure is something similar to the French but slightly better for Black because his LSB isn't hemmed in by its own pawns.

13,a3,a2a3,rnbqk2r/ppp1npp1/7p/3pP3/1b1P4/P1N5/1P3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 7,Trying to win the Bishop pair and strengthen my center pawn chain.
14,Bxc3+,b4c3,rnbqk2r/ppp1npp1/7p/3pP3/3P4/P1b5/1P3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 8,Black has castled early and he is now poised to strike at my center.
15,bxc3,b2c3,rnbqk2r/ppp1npp1/7p/3pP3/3P4/P1P5/5PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 8,Black has castled early and he is now poised to strike at my center.
16,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1npp1/7p/3pP3/3P4/P1P5/5PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQ - 1 9,Black has castled early and he is now poised to strike at my center.
17,Rb1,a1b1,rnbq1rk1/ppp1npp1/7p/3pP3/3P4/P1P5/5PPP/1RBQKBNR b K - 2 9,9.Bd3 doesn't stop 9...Bf5 so I played this to delay Black a little longer from developing his Bishop.
18,Nbc6,b8c6,r1bq1rk1/ppp1npp1/2n4p/3pP3/3P4/P1P5/5PPP/1RBQKBNR w K - 3 10,"Black is no hurry to play c5, he can develop his pieces to nice, active squares without having to bust up the center first."
19,Bd3,f1d3,r1bq1rk1/ppp1npp1/2n4p/3pP3/3P4/P1PB4/5PPP/1RBQK1NR b K - 4 10,Now that the immediate Bf5 can't be played I developed my LSB to its best possible place.
20,b6,b7b6,r1bq1rk1/p1p1npp1/1pn4p/3pP3/3P4/P1PB4/5PPP/1RBQK1NR w K - 0 11,"Blunting out the Rb1, preparing for a future c5 and planning to play Bf5 on the next move."
21,Qc2,d1c2,r1bq1rk1/p1p1npp1/1pn4p/3pP3/3P4/P1PB4/2Q2PPP/1RB1K1NR b K - 1 11,So I delay my Knights development in order to stop Bf5.
22,f6,f7f6,r1bq1rk1/p1p1n1p1/1pn2p1p/3pP3/3P4/P1PB4/2Q2PPP/1RB1K1NR w K - 0 12,But Black can make use of his better development and play it anyway.
23,f4,f2f4,r1bq1rk1/p1p1n1p1/1pn2p1p/3pP3/3P1P2/P1PB4/2Q3PP/1RB1K1NR b K - 0 12,This looks risky since the f-file will be open and I will have difficulties castling but holding the center intact is much more important.
24,fxe5,f6e5,r1bq1rk1/p1p1n1p1/1pn4p/3pp3/3P1P2/P1PB4/2Q3PP/1RB1K1NR w K - 0 13,Finally gets to play Bf5 and exchange my best light piece. Now after the forced Bishop swap my advantage is almost non-existent. Black has solved all the opening problems and equalized fully.
25,fxe5,f4e5,r1bq1rk1/p1p1n1p1/1pn4p/3pP3/3P4/P1PB4/2Q3PP/1RB1K1NR b K - 0 13,Finally gets to play Bf5 and exchange my best light piece. Now after the forced Bishop swap my advantage is almost non-existent. Black has solved all the opening problems and equalized fully.
26,Bf5,c8f5,r2q1rk1/p1p1n1p1/1pn4p/3pPb2/3P4/P1PB4/2Q3PP/1RB1K1NR w K - 1 14,Finally gets to play Bf5 and exchange my best light piece. Now after the forced Bishop swap my advantage is almost non-existent. Black has solved all the opening problems and equalized fully.
27,Ne2,g1e2,r2q1rk1/p1p1n1p1/1pn4p/3pPb2/3P4/P1PB4/2Q1N1PP/1RB1K2R b K - 2 14,"Delaying castling again, which would have been possible sooner after 14.Nf3, but the best place for the Knight is f4 and that's where it's heading."
28,Bxd3,f5d3,r2q1rk1/p1p1n1p1/1pn4p/3pP3/3P4/P1Pb4/2Q1N1PP/1RB1K2R w K - 0 15,Now the white central squares are very weak and can be exploited wonderfully by Black's Knight pair.
29,Qxd3,c2d3,r2q1rk1/p1p1n1p1/1pn4p/3pP3/3P4/P1PQ4/4N1PP/1RB1K2R b K - 0 15,Now the white central squares are very weak and can be exploited wonderfully by Black's Knight pair.
30,Qd7,d8d7,r4rk1/p1pqn1p1/1pn4p/3pP3/3P4/P1PQ4/4N1PP/1RB1K2R w K - 1 16,Controlling the blockade of the e-pawn and closing the f-file so I can castle.
31,Nf4,e2f4,r4rk1/p1pqn1p1/1pn4p/3pP3/3P1N2/P1PQ4/6PP/1RB1K2R b K - 2 16,Controlling the blockade of the e-pawn and closing the f-file so I can castle.
