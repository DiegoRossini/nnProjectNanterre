1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"The Reti Opening. My first thoughts were 'Well, it looks like I'll be learning how to play against this opening'. I have only played this opening once, a long time ago."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,The usual follow-up for the Reti.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,The usual follow-up for the Reti.
4,dxc4,d5c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2p5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,I capture. Is the Reti a kind of temporary gambit?
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2p5/2N2N2/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,Why is e4 rarely played at this point? It develops a central pawn and lets the LSB attack the pawn on c4.
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/8/2p5/2N2N2/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,"I try to catch up in development, as well as contest e5 so my e-pawn can move there."
7,e4,e2e4,r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/8/2p1P3/2N2N2/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,White grabs some of the centre.
8,e5,e7e5,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/4p3/2p1P3/2N2N2/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"We are now equal in material again, with white having a positional edge."
9,Bxc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP1P1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"We are now equal in material again, with white having a positional edge."
10,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP1P1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 6,Developing my DSB.
11,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP1P1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 2 6,Castling and removing his king from possible danger later on.
12,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PP1P1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 3 7,"White is still ahead in development, but the pawns on d2 and b2 are going to hinder the development of his DSB slightly."
13,a3,a2a3,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/P1N2N2/1P1P1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,"I don't really know why this was played. I guess to prevent Bb4, but I wouldn't threaten his knight with my bishop while it's defended."
14,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/P1N2N2/1P1P1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 8,I castle. Our levels of piece development are now equal.
