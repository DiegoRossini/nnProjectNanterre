1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

This game got off to another slow start for me, but later on in the game, white overlooked a knight fork winning the exchange.  This was not a family fork, that came later and finished off my opponent at the end.  The first mistake, however, put this skids right on.  So how did this happen?  Well, read on.  Here is the computer analysis: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=16201874&fb=1&rnd=0.03848212663100348.  The first four moves are the main line Ruy Lopez."
