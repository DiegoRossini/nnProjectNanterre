These days, I much less afraid of playing 4. d4. These days, I feel that the consequences for white of black responding cxd4 are not disturbing enough to justify Anti-Sicilian play."

This is probably pretty playable (especially against weaker opposition?) but was this perhaps the first sign of over-confidence from black?"

Nc3 probably better."
