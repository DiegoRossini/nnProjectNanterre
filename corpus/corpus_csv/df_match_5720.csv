1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,A short game this but I think it demonstrates the advantage of early pressure at a lower-middling level of play on the mental side.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"An opening with which I am unfamiliar, though I plan to research it more in future as I'm getting a little bored of 1. e4, e5."
3,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,"Not having dealt with this opening before I elect to play this rather than my usual Nc3, looking to restrict the early pawn movement."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 3,Looking back I feel I could have played Nf6 instead and considered pushing my pawn forwards. Maybe next time.
5,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 3 3,Looking back I feel I could have played Nf6 instead and considered pushing my pawn forwards. Maybe next time.
6,d6,d7d6,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/2p5/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 4,"I never like this kind of play early. While you should never let your pawns be isolated, this kind of play is too safe and restricts your own options."
7,Qf3,d1f3,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/2p5/2B1P3/2N2Q2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 1 4,"The computer says this was a poor move and I agree, however I was looking to see what agression would to to such a defensive-seeming postion."
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/2p5/2B1P3/2N2Q2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 2 5,A sensible response.
9,Nd5,c3d5,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/2pN4/2B1P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 3 5,"Again pushing further than I should have but in for a penny, in for a pound..."
10,Bg4,c8g4,r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1n2/2pN4/2B1P1b1/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 4 6,"?? I can see the objective here, push the Queen around without allowing a safe retreat but this move ignores my advanced knight. Ng4 leading to Nge5 would have caused real trouble. Instead Black will come out behind by a bishop."
11,Nxf6+,d5f6,r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/2np1N2/2p5/2B1P1b1/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 0 6,While it may have appeared sensible to give the rook freer movement all this move really does is give up the g-pawn and unleashed nasty pressure on the king.
12,exf6,e7f6,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/2np1p2/2p5/2B1P1b1/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 0 7,While it may have appeared sensible to give the rook freer movement all this move really does is give up the g-pawn and unleashed nasty pressure on the king.
13,Qxg4,f3g4,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/2np1p2/2p5/2B1P1Q1/8/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 0 7,While it may have appeared sensible to give the rook freer movement all this move really does is give up the g-pawn and unleashed nasty pressure on the king.
14,Be7,f8e7,r2qk2r/pp2bppp/2np1p2/2p5/2B1P1Q1/8/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 1 8,While it may have appeared sensible to give the rook freer movement all this move really does is give up the g-pawn and unleashed nasty pressure on the king.
15,Qxg7,g4g7,r2qk2r/pp2bpQp/2np1p2/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 0 8,"Preventing Qxf7. I think Kd7 may have served better here, the mobility of the King should not be forgotten."
16,Rf8,h8f8,r2qkr2/pp2bpQp/2np1p2/2p5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQq - 1 9,"Preventing Qxf7. I think Kd7 may have served better here, the mobility of the King should not be forgotten."
17,Nf3,g1f3,r2qkr2/pp2bpQp/2np1p2/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQq - 2 9,"Even when you are agressive early on, one should not neglect to continue developing pieces. Any immediate attempt to continue pressure on the king risks turning successful early pressure into an all-in attack which could easily fail."
18,Qd7,d8d7,r3kr2/pp1qbpQp/2np1p2/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQq - 3 10,Looking to get the king out of trouble with a queenside castle.

20,O-O-O,e8c8,2kr1r2/pp1qbpQp/2np1p2/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 5 11,Offering the exchange to undouble his pawns.
21,d3,d2d3,2kr1r2/pp1qbpQp/2np1p2/2p5/2B1P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 0 11,Offering the exchange to undouble his pawns.

23,Nxe5,f3e5,2kr1r2/pp1qbpQp/3p1p2/2p1N3/2B1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 0 12,Accepted.
24,fxe5,f6e5,2kr1r2/pp1qbpQp/3p4/2p1p3/2B1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 0 13,Snapping up the loose pawn and reminding my opponent of the Queen's presence.
25,Qxh7,g7h7,2kr1r2/pp1qbp1Q/3p4/2p1p3/2B1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 0 13,Snapping up the loose pawn and reminding my opponent of the Queen's presence.
26,Rfh8,f8h8,2kr3r/pp1qbp1Q/3p4/2p1p3/2B1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 1 14,The hoped-for reaction allowing me to snaffle another pawn and set up shop on the a2-g8 diagonal.
27,Qxf7,h7f7,2kr3r/pp1qbQ2/3p4/2p1p3/2B1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 0 14,Looking to pin the Queen against the king with Be6 and seal the game.
28,Qg4,d7g4,2kr3r/pp2bQ2/3p4/2p1p3/2B1P1q1/3P4/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 1 15,?? The final blunder. I presume my opponent was looking to threaten my king with rook and Queen but even ignoring the fork at e6 this effort would be foiled by h3 forcing Black to spend more time extricating his Queen and allowing Qxe7 to increase my lead yet further. Kb8 or Qe8 would have forced me to accept an even exchange or to retreat and try a new angle.
