25,h3,h2h3,r4rk1/p1pnqppp/2pp4/8/4PPb1/2PB3P/P1PQ2P1/R1B1R1K1 b - - 0 13,"? Well, that's basically a mistake, that could cost quite a lot. The point is that I've moved my queen to f-file which undoubtedly will be opened after capture at g6. Actually quite stupid move and blacks could save their bishop by a simple answer 16... h6

Now if 17. fg?! fg 18. Qg3 Rf3 (18... Nf3?+ returns some material, but it seems rather weak, since blacks attack will weaken without a knight) with threat Qh4 so white will have to play precisely just not to lose in few moves. 19. Qg2 (19. Qh2? Qh4 with threat of Rxh3 followed by Nf3+) Qh4 20. Re3 Raf8 -+ white pieces are paralyzed, while black keep threats Rg3 and Rf2

Thus whites would have to refuse to capture the black bishop to maintain significant advantage (+/- black bishop will be off game basically), so i wouldn't definitely say that 16... h6 was a better choice. Sometimes it's better to go into mathematically worse variation, but giving some counter-play and practical chances to save/win the game. Let's say both 16... h6 and 16... Re8 deserve consideration (!?)."
