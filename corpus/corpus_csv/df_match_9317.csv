1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone, I have only just recently got back from my holiday in Devon and have been religiously catching up on my moves - finally I have something to annotate.  In this game I incur a material deficit but, with some imprecise kingside pawn moves, hoping for a kingside pawn storm should I decide to castle short I turned the tables on him.  I double-crossed him by leaving Henry in the centre!  Later on an exchange of bishops brings Glenda to the g file with disastrous consequences for white.  Have a nice read - Joanne!"

Be7?! - this move was recommended in the World Database and in fact two strong experts played this move and won.  It loses a pawn, however.   The excalmation mark part of the move is that at least black will have the bishop pair, but is it enough?  I am now ready to castle, but as you will see, I never got round to it!"

Qxa4 - sure enough the a pawn drops, worse it brings out the Wicked Witch of the West to a pretty good square - my a pawn is pinned - white has such a clear advantage that it seems inconceivable that he will cop Old Matey just ten moves from this diagram, especially as the mating piece, Glenda is just sitting passively on her home square."
