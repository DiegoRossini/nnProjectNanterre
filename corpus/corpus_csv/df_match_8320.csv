1,h3,h2h3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/7P/PPPPPPP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"It's the Potato opening. Of my invention and I play it against the strong as well. You'll see how it's really amazing : Ok it hands initiative to blacks but what if I tell you that 98 % of blacks response would be non-ideal reply moves ? That is true and that is the philosophy behind this opening. Keep the opponent play for some moves, try to see the weakness in his entry then exploit that. Moreover why take a risky initiative ? Why play with a line that is common to theorists ?"

7.Nc3 followed by Bc4 and the queen can not prevent it because Qe6 is replied with d5.

Thus whites can get the time to achieve kin-side development."

Now blacks can play a6 which results in development problems for whites king-side pieces.
The only problem of Per-correspondance game is that the train of thought can be lost : we forget the previous calculation and previous plan in the new moves."

The plan is obvious for blacks : develop Bg7 then short castle (queen side is bad for castle)."

22,Bc6,d7c6,rn1qkb1r/4np1p/p1b3p1/1p1p4/3Pp3/PBN1P2P/1P2NPP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 12,Bc6 is blocking Nc6.

( Be7, Ra=>g7, 0-0,etc). But looking at I noticed that d5 is really posing a problem to blacks. It's difficult to relocate Bc6 or Ne7 without fearing to lose that pawn. Moreover Nf4 was eminent."

If blacks pushes f5, and take e4 (after the planned fxe4) with the f5 then they will have to suffer from an open f-rank. Otherwise blacks are going to give me a precious open d-rank in case of dxe4. Consequently I was all expecting exf3."

If : 15.d5 (threat on c6 and threat Qd4 attacks two rooks)
Then
15..Rd7. annihilating dxc and strengthening attack on d5.

So Nf4 was there to gather more attacking pieces."

By Qb6 blacks are hoping for 
18. ...Bxc3 19. bxc3 and the c rank is closed which reduces my attack possibilities (mainly the rook c1). Note that in case of Bx : blacks respond with Qxe3+. This explains my next move."
