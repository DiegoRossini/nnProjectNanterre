I don't like c4 as I cannot easily defend it and it gives white the threat of Bb6.

Bd6 allows me to follow with Qe7 and Nd7 will allow me to start pushing back on the kingside.

Rc-d8 lessens the defence on the c5 pawn, which cannot now have a pawn for support. Rf-d8 makes a later f5 pawn push less effective, and leaves the c8 rook with nowhere to go. In each of these cases white can just play c4 and I have no threats.
