A GK game shows Ne7, with the bishop retreating but I don't like because of BxN which forces the trade. Although I could get good play with the open file, he still has not committed to castling. So it could wind up destroying the king side with no compensating attack.

Be3, Bg4 Think I prefer Be3"
