5,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3p4/3P1B2/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 3 3,"Other options are h3, e3, and, of course, c4. But this is just the move I want to avoid. This is not because it is bad, of course, but because it leads the game to too-well-known paths."
6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3p4/3P1B2/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 4 4,"Other options are h3, e3, and, of course, c4. But this is just the move I want to avoid. This is not because it is bad, of course, but because it leads the game to too-well-known paths."

8,e6,e7e6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/3p4/3P1B2/5N2/PPPNPPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Without the black's lsb in f5, N or B b4 are not dangerous at all."
9,e3,e2e3,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/3p4/3P1B2/4PN2/PPPN1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"I don't want to challenge the center right now. This is ok. If black Nh5, I'll invest a tempo in playing Bg3, and after the exchange, the semiopen column is in my favour. You can guess I am planning to castle - if ever - queenside."
10,Bd6,f8d6,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2nbpn2/3p4/3P1B2/4PN2/PPPN1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,Normal.
11,Ne5,f3e5,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2nbpn2/3pN3/3P1B2/4P3/PPPN1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 2 6,"Being the knight in f6, my knight can't be kicked quickly. Note that Nh5 is not possible now."

13,dxe5,d4e5,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/3pP3/5B2/4P3/PPPN1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,This is always a surprise.
14,Ne4,f6e4,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/3pP3/4nB2/4P3/PPPN1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,"This is the natural square for the knight, and it seems very well placed, indeed... but..."
15,Qg4,d1g4,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/3pP3/4nBQ1/4P3/PPPN1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 2 8,...this move causes some apprehension to black. Is not easy to defend g7.
16,Nxd2,e4d2,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/3pP3/5BQ1/4P3/PPPn1PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 9,"My opponent thought about forcing me to move my king. I'll show him that he just gave me a tempo, because my threats are more dangerous than the knight he took."
17,Qxg7,g4g7,r1bqk2r/ppp2pQp/2n1p3/3pP3/5B2/4P3/PPPn1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 9,"I expected Rf8. I can, of course, go Qxf7+, exchange the queens, then I can take the knight and go on with a good game, but I wanted to get more."
18,Kd7,e8d7,r1bq3r/pppk1pQp/2n1p3/3pP3/5B2/4P3/PPPn1PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 1 10,"I expected Rf8. I can, of course, go Qxf7+, exchange the queens, then I can take the knight and go on with a good game, but I wanted to get more."
19,Bg5,f4g5,r1bq3r/pppk1pQp/2n1p3/3pP1B1/8/4P3/PPPn1PPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 2 10,This was not a good move. Black has...
20,Qg8,d8g8,r1b3qr/pppk1pQp/2n1p3/3pP1B1/8/4P3/PPPn1PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 3 11,"Better would have beeh Qf8 (with a glance to b4, just in case...). Anyway, white's attack is not as deadly as it seems. Now I am the one that has to find the right way to get out of this."
21,Bf6,g5f6,r1b3qr/pppk1pQp/2n1pB2/3pP3/8/4P3/PPPn1PPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 4 11,"He can save the knight, but will lose a rook."
22,Ne4,d2e4,r1b3qr/pppk1pQp/2n1pB2/3pP3/4n3/4P3/PPP2PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 5 12,"The alternative was QxQ, BxQ, Rg8, B moves, KxN. Definitely better, since now black falls behind in material."
23,Qxh8,g7h8,r1b3qQ/pppk1p1p/2n1pB2/3pP3/4n3/4P3/PPP2PPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 0 12,"Black realizes that after exchanging the queens he will have few chances to draw, so goes for a counterattack."

26,Qxg2,g4g2,r1b4Q/pppk1p1p/2n1pB2/1B1pP3/4n3/4P3/PPP2PqP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 14,"He will remember this, methink..."
