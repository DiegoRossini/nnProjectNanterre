4,Bc5,f8c5,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"So I decline the gambit.  White doesn't dare play fxe5 now, as Qh4  wins for black."
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/4PP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 3,"All standard developing moves for both sides so far -- this is a standard KGD position.  My move here as black is aimed at getting that knight off the board, as it controls too much of the center here."

14,Bxf3,g4f3,r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/2b1p3/2B1PP2/2NP1b1P/PPP3P1/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"A much better recapture than gxf3 positionally, but black has a nice move here..."

17,Qd1,f3d1,r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/2b1p3/2BnPP2/2NP3P/PPP3P1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 9,"This was the best move I could find in the position, threatening Qh4  and a strong attack.  This is all still stuff that's in the GK game DB, though -- nothing new yet."
18,Nd7,f6d7,r2qk2r/pppn1ppp/3p4/2b1p3/2BnPP2/2NP3P/PPP3P1/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 3 10,"This was the best move I could find in the position, threatening Qh4  and a strong attack.  This is all still stuff that's in the GK game DB, though -- nothing new yet."

In principle, it's desirable to eliminate the dark-squared bishop, but Qh4  is very strong for black, and he simply doesn't have the time for this."
20,Qh4+,d8h4,r3k2r/pppn1ppp/3p4/2b1p3/N1BnPP1q/3P3P/PPP3P1/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 5 11,"A good move -- this is why I expected Ne2.  Now, white has only three legal moves, g3 (which leads to Qxg3  and a worse situation), Kf1, which leads to all sorts of kingside mating threats and a definite loss of material after 11. Kf1 Nf5 (threatening mate with Qf2) 12. Nxc5 Ng3 , or Kd2, as played in the game."
21,Kd2,e1d2,r3k2r/pppn1ppp/3p4/2b1p3/N1BnPP1q/3P3P/PPPK2P1/R1BQ3R b kq - 6 11,"This seems like the best attempt, but it turns out to walk into mate..."
22,Bb4+,c5b4,r3k2r/pppn1ppp/3p4/4p3/NbBnPP1q/3P3P/PPPK2P1/R1BQ3R w kq - 7 12,"!  White resigns.  Although White probably sees only 12. c3 (or Nc3) Qf2  13. Qe2 Qxe2#, there is a sprightly forced mate after 12. Ke3, which I was excited to find when I played Bb4 .  It goes 12. Ke3 Qg3  13. Qf3 exf4  14. Kxd4 c5  15. Nxc5 (or 15. Kd5 Qg5  16. Kxd6 Qe5#) dxc5  16. Kd5 Qg5  17. Kd6 Qe5#

I was disappointed that my opponent didn't give me a chance to play my (I thought quite beautiful) mating combination, but it's still a wonderful demonstration how sometimes all it takes is one bad move out of the opening book to totally cook your goose!"
