1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

This was the closest I have ever been to becoming The-Black-Queen.  Right until the end I had a winning advantage over Michael, but, due in large part to Old Matey (in the form of Michael's queen) sniffing around Henry, I ended up forcing a queen trade and immediately hitting the offer draw button.  Michael duly accepted the offer.  Little did I know that the gameknot analysis was about to show that I had a winning alternative continuation to initiating the queen trade.  I now feel as though I bottled it.  So, how did this all happen?  Well, here is the gameknot analysis below:-  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=22336553&rnd=0.7168277988215053"
