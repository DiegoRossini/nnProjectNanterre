I saw that in most of his games, he always goes for the conventional openings on d3, e3, d4, or e4 or using Kb3 and Kf3. It was then i decided to also use a more common opening, aiming to throw a few unusal moves in as the game went on.."

9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/4N3/4p3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"Although I didnt want to retreat the knight off e5, it would mean a more conventional Bf4, which takes the middlegame into a basic, standard route, and that as mentioned before was not my intention. It's at this point i determined to attempt to put my opponent into a position on the chessboard that he had never seen.

While I'm no master at naming certain openings or plays, or even strategies, I could see from this point, that the game could easily take a turn, where simply setting up an attack and/or exchanging pieces was not going to get either player anywhere, forcing the situation so, that, the first to make a mistake, would be the one that loses, not the one that outsmarts the other."

A simple b5 or Bg4 would have been too blatant for the opponent, and the goal of this match was to surprise him into over thinking, and/or making a fatal error"

It was also at this point where the aforementioned ""over thinking"" came into play i would say. He is deliberating about the Bc3 fork, the Bishop and Knight combining to come together towards the King's side, and also the blatant Queen threat, and just overlooked the next move."
