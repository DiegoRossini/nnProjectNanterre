1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,My opponent opens with a normal move: e4.
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I have been trying the Scandinavian Defense in response to e4 lately, because it is emminently safe, and it forces my opponent to play ""on my turf."" The downside is that it is rather unambitious and doesn't challenge white's opening initiative. At a strategic level, I am happy to trade a bunch of wood and head into an endgame even or with a small advantage. I have pretty good success in endgames, although I don't fancy myself as the next Rubenstein :)"
3,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,The normal continuation.
4,Qxd5,d8d5,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"And again, the main line."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,Developing with tempo against the queen.
6,Qa5,d5a5,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/q7/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"And here is the first choice I must make. Although it is perfectly acceptable to play the queen back to d8, I prefer the more aggressive a5 square."
7,d4,d2d4,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/q7/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"The main line, although Nf3 is playable. Also mentioned in MCO-13 (I never bothered to upgrade to 14) is 4. h3 Nf6 5. Nf3 e6 6. Bc4 without the pressure of lines that allow ...Bg4."
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/q7/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"The main line, although a game with Adolph Anderssen's 4...e5 is given in a footnote of MCO. White won in 29 moves."
9,Bd2,c1d2,rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/q7/3P4/2N5/PPPB1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 2 5,"And here is the first variance from the main lines. Normal are Bc4 and Nf3, fighting for the center, but the text does suggest itself to the amateur, since it sets up a discovery against the queen."
10,c6,c7c6,rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/q7/3P4/2N5/PPPB1PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"And so I must give my queen an escape square on c7, while at the same time limiting the scope of the c3-knight."
11,Ne4,c3e4,rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/q7/3PN3/8/PPPB1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 1 6,"And the ""trap"" springs, but to no bad effect for black."
12,Qf5,a5f5,rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/5q2/3PN3/8/PPPB1PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 2 7,I have to eschew the c7 square in order to protect my kingside pawn structure.
13,Nxf6+,e4f6,rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2N2/5q2/3P4/8/PPPB1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 7,"As I said in the opening, I am content to trade some pieces in the early going, and especially as his piece moved three times and took a piece that had only moved once."
14,Qxf6,f5f6,rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2q2/8/3P4/8/PPPB1PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 8,The point of the queen going to f5 was to keep the pawns intact with this recapture.
15,Nf3,g1f3,rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2q2/8/3P4/5N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 8,Continuing development with a normal move.
16,Bg4,c8g4,rn2kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2q2/8/3P2b1/5N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 9,And this is the normal square for the bishop in this opening.
17,Be2,f1e2,rn2kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2q2/8/3P2b1/5N2/PPPBBPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 3 9,"White has chosen a very conservative development scheme, so I am pleased with the position, although I am slightly behind in development."
18,Bxf3,g4f3,rn2kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2q2/8/3P4/5b2/PPPBBPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 10,"This wasn't an easy choice, as I like to keep the two bishops when I can, but it wasn't a hard choice either, as I get to trade more wood and his bishop is on a diagonal that is shut down by the c6-pawn. The fact that this removes the defender of the d4-pawn is good too :)"
19,Bxf3,e2f3,rn2kb1r/pp2pppp/2p2q2/8/3P4/5B2/PPPB1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 10,"The expected recapture, although gxf3 followed by castling long did cross my mind as a possibility. I wonder if my opponent considered it?"
20,Qxd4,f6d4,rn2kb1r/pp2pppp/2p5/8/3q4/5B2/PPPB1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 11,"Hard to believe the pawn is just hanging, but it is. I am glad to win a pawn, as that is usually enough to ensure a draw and give me winning chances in an endgame. I am behind in development, and my queen is exposed, so there is some danger in taking the pawn, but in the balance I thought it was safe enough."
