2,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"4. e4 - now here is the transposition, it has turned into the Pirc/Robatsch Defense - this is when black usually responds d6 (Pirc) or g6 (Robatsch) to white's opener e4.  My next move, f4 will make this the 4 pawn or Austrian Attack.  Here white builds a fine pawn centre, but this can be very deceptive as I am about to find out."

In a post match pm, Ion had this to say ""There was nothing wrong, by the way, with snapping up the b-pawn at move 15.Nxb5. Black can try to exploit the WQ's conflict of interest, but it costs the exchange: 15...Qb6 16.Qd3 Nxe4 17.Bxe4 Rxe4 18.Qxe4 Qxb5. White's b-pawn is probably unsalvagable, so 19.Rad1 or 19.Qe7, putting pressure on the centre might be the way to go. Otherwise, 15.Nxb5 Qb6 16.Qd3 c4? 17.Bxb6 cxd3 18.Bxa7 looks great for White.""

Qb1? - this move gives black a very strong initiative - he now adds weight to his strong queenside pawns by putting his knight on c5.  I moved Glenda to b1 in order to remove her from the c file and to maintain protection of e4 - but as you will see, this does not wash.  Here it is folks, when I am met with an attack like this I do tend to go on the defensive - it is a good habit to break and I am trying to do this, but occasionally I may slip up and this is one of them.

I waved the white flag as at best I would get a pawn for the rook - no way near enough.  Incredibly I overlooked this block but I don't think it changed the result in any way as if I had moved Glenda to the back rank instead of to c4 then I would have been the exchange down in a totally passive position - so I tried to complicate things but it did not work.
