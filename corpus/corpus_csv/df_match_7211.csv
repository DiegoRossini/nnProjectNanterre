2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,h5 was unexpected.  Wonder if he has some kind of trap.  Will go ahead and take the pawn

8,Nf6,g8f6,rnb1kb1r/pppp1pp1/5n2/4N2p/4P2q/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 3 5,"It blocks the mate but it seems to isolate his Queen.  Two attacks on the e pawn, guarded only once.  Nc3 will defend the e pawn and get a Knight out.  He will probably chased the knight at some point.  If he doesn't chase the Knight, I will either do d4 or Bc4.  Bc4 would give an attack on Black's f pawn."
