2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Gotta love the sicilian.
3,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"The grand prix attack, a variation I do not face as much although interestingly I had read an annotations of jstevens1 on another game where she played this just before our game commenced!"
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,The mainline of course being 3. ed5 This move tempts black to play 3... de4 but after either 4. Ng5 or 4. Ne5 white has a very solid knight in the center that will take time to remove meanwhile cramping black's development severely.
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/4PP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,The mainline of course being 3. ed5 This move tempts black to play 3... de4 but after either 4. Ng5 or 4. Ne5 white has a very solid knight in the center that will take time to remove meanwhile cramping black's development severely.
6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2pp4/4PP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Wary of ""allowing"" that knight to take the time to find a good post I play this move instead."
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2pp4/4PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"Now we've transposed into a position more commonly reach as a closed Korchnoi sicilian. The move order usually used to reach this position is 1. e4 c5 2.Nc3 e6 3. f4 d5 4.Nf3 White has a lead in development but the pawn structure is certainly weaker, a point exploited by my next move."
8,dxe4,d5e4,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2p5/4pP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,Finally black develops a piece! All these moves are typical for this type of position. While black has allowed white a knight in the center it is certainly not as strong as the earlier variation would have allowed and can be easily threatened with Nf6.
9,Nxe4,c3e4,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2p5/4NP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,Finally black develops a piece! All these moves are typical for this type of position. While black has allowed white a knight in the center it is certainly not as strong as the earlier variation would have allowed and can be easily threatened with Nf6.
10,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2p5/4NP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,Finally black develops a piece! All these moves are typical for this type of position. While black has allowed white a knight in the center it is certainly not as strong as the earlier variation would have allowed and can be easily threatened with Nf6.
11,g3,g2g3,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2p5/4NP2/5NP1/PPPP3P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"Given white's already poor structure around the king this move surprised me and the GK engine agrees, allocating me a +.37 advantage, although with no variations. Unless black plans to move e6 any time soon (unlikely) then the LSB is certainly going to be developed to either b7 or a6, this move seems to just help black to decide which route to take. And after the bishops have been traded there is one less defender on White's kingside whereas black's queenside will not be hurting. That being said it is the second most common continuation in this position (6. Bb5 being the major alternative) and has the best score in the DB. However one we get to a crucial position I chose a strong lesser-played variation that really tests white's setup."
12,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk1nr/pp2bppp/2n1p3/2p5/4NP2/5NP1/PPPP3P/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,"The main idea in all the lines around g3, to castle Kingside and keep many minor pieces surrounding the king to cover the gaps."
13,Bg2,f1g2,r1bqk1nr/pp2bppp/2n1p3/2p5/4NP2/5NP1/PPPP2BP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 7,"The main idea in all the lines around g3, to castle Kingside and keep many minor pieces surrounding the king to cover the gaps."

16,Rb8,a8b8,1rbqk2r/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/2p5/5P2/5NP1/PPPP1NBP/R1BQK2R w KQk - 5 9,"! Probably not worth an exclamation but certainly the most logical move to me in this position, remove the threat of the b2 bishop and support an eventual black bishop on b7, trade off the LS bishops and attack white's plan, to use minor pieces to protect the king, and white's king!"
17,O-O,e1g1,1rbqk2r/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/2p5/5P2/5NP1/PPPP1NBP/R1BQ1RK1 b k - 6 9,"The DB game has 10. b3 so we've reached a novelty. I'm not too threatened by this move, my king is ready to castle and get off the e-file when necessary, no need to slow the plan."

22,O-O,e8g8,1r1q1rk1/pb2bppp/1pn1pn2/2p5/5P2/2P2NP1/PP1P1NBP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 1 12,Whatever the case it's time for black to castle and complete his development.

Despite starting with three pawn moves I've finished my development before white. The center is still up for grabs but I have the semi-open d-file and hope to trade off the LS Bishops soon. +.3 from the GK engine.
24,Ne8,f6e8,1r1qnrk1/pb2bppp/1pn1p3/2p5/5P2/2PP1NP1/PP3NBP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 1 13,"GK engine doesn't like this move, dropping us back to an even keel but my idea was to help activate the DSB and get it on the a1-h8 diagonal. I also want a knight at d5, either entice c4 and strengthen that bishop's diagonal or let white decide to leave it there, but I don't want to play 12... Nd5 yet because I'm still looking to trade off those bishops so I eye the Ne8-Nc7-Nd5 path."
