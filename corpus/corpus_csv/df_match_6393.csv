Either the dark square bishop or the queen can do this job just fine, but since the two pieces have already moved it seems a bit awkward.

She centralises her knight while leaving TWO pawns hanging - the pawn on e5 and the freshly undefended pawn on a2. In fact, you've probably noticed by now but Shredder can win both of these pawns!"

How dare that Shredder should do such a thing! [I'd like to explain for the benefit of the two machines in this game that my last comment was filled with sarcasm :P]"

If, now, 15...Nxe5?! 16.Nf6+! gxf6 17.Bxf6+ Rg8 18.Bxe5 and the open position favours Rybka's developed position. Perhaps Shredder could have also tried 15...Nc6 but that, too, may be dubious; 16.Nb3 Qxe5 with a lot more tempo attacks on the queen to come [only unlike in the continuation, Shredder can't play Qa5+ - the queen is stuck on the kingside, which would lead Rybka with plenty of tactical tricks - e.g. 17.Bg3 Qf5 18.Nd6+ Bxd6 19.Bxd6]"

Yes - yes she is! Readers have probably noticed by now that Shredder's pawn grabbing has left him severely lagging in development (especially on the queenside). This means that Rybka needs to act fast if she wants to take advantage of it. Also, look at the centre control from Rybka's two knights! [you know, being three pawns down can also happen to White in the Evans Gambit if his opponent goes pawn hunting. Most of the time, Black gets punished heavily for that :)]"

Evidently Shredder must have calculated that getting rid of Rybka's central control was more important than preventing her from castling..."
