1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Had a duel with the Master Mater I would much rather forget, but I must see if I can learn something from this - the only recurring theme seems to be that I tend to get rid of my opponent's pawns only to find myself in a killer pin - ouch and double ouch!  This is the Kings Indian Defense 4 pawns attack opening which is a thematic tournament.  The non-set up moves start on move 6 where I played Nf3 which is the main line in the World DB."

Very reminiscent of a Sicilian Dragon/Naijdorf setup later on with both sides castling on opposite sides.  Well, I don't even get started on my attack."

You can safely say here, Coach Ion, that my tactics were well and truly up the Swanney - Joanne"
