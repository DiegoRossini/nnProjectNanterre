1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is a standard move for many players. Although not statistically significantly better than 1. d4, it is still a very strong move as it attacks two center squares and opens lines for pieces."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,This move is the second most played move next to 1. ...c5. It refutes my center control and opens lines for his pieces.
3,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"This position is known as the King's Gambit. The goal of the opening is to get a long-term queen-side attack by removing Black's center pawn and having surplus pawns than the opponent. It is not very frequently played as the games are often too short and risky for class players, and Black has a good chance of equalizing in grand master games."
4,exf4,e5f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Black accepts the gambit and loses all control of the center for a while. However, White's king-side is worsened and no pieces are developed. Likewise, Black does not either. In order to make something out of the game, White must attack ferociously or immediately recapture to compensate for the lost pawn."
5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/2B1Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 3,"If I remember, I first saw this move being played not too long ago, and White won in ten or so moves. After 3. ...Qh5 4. Kf1, the king is somewhat safe and Black has an out-standing queen in the sense that it is prematurely developed. For a player who is testing out the King's Gambit, or in other words me, I would recommend 3. Nf3 as a start."
6,h5,h7h5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1pp1/8/7p/2B1Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 4,"The objective of this move was to prevent Qh5, which attacks f7 and puts the queen in an attacking position, and start a king-side forward offense/defense. More typical is 3. ...g5 or a knight move. 3. ...Qh5 is also possible as an instance move."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1pp1/8/7p/2B1Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"Now I play Nf3 to prepare to castle. I should have played d3 or d4, but I wanted to attack to see how far I would get."
8,g5,g7g5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p2/8/6pp/2B1Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"This move makes it difficult to recapture on f4 and now the king-side is hard to break from the respective side. On the flip side, Black is severely down in development and I have plenty chance to recuperate."
9,Ne5,f3e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p2/8/4N1pp/2B1Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,"I targeted f7 without thinking about my move. I am not familiar with the main line, but I think that d3, d4, or even h4 would have lead to a better game than did here."
10,Nh6,g8h6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1p2/7n/4N1pp/2B1Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 6,This move develops the knight and protects the f7 pawn albeit keeps the knight on the rim. The h5 pawn is now undefended.
11,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1p2/7n/4N1pp/2BPPp2/8/PPP3PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"I played this move without thinking, entranced by the opening rush. I overlooked Qxh5, which seems like a very strong move because it equalizes the gambit made earlier and undermines the f7 pawn with a pin."
12,Qe7,d8e7,rnb1kb1r/ppppqp2/7n/4N1pp/2BPPp2/8/PPP3PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 7,"The queen has to defend the attack; otherwise the game may as well be lost. The bishop  can fianchetto on g7 and have a strong diagonal. In all truth, I would have played this move, but Nc6 seems like a  good move to consider."
13,Qxh5,d1h5,rnb1kb1r/ppppqp2/7n/4N1pQ/2BPPp2/8/PPP3PP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 7,"I finally realize that I could have played this move, and not much time is lost."
14,Qf6,e7f6,rnb1kb1r/pppp1p2/5q1n/4N1pQ/2BPPp2/8/PPP3PP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 1 8,"This was played to protect the rook should I play Nxf7. This way, Black's knight can recapture. At this point, my arrogance lead me to my downfall. I probably should have retreated here."
15,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1kb1r/pppp1p2/5q1n/4N1pQ/2BPPp2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 2 8,"My intentions with this move were to develop another piece and move it to d5 with a triple fork. At this point in the game, I was making simple one-move threats hoping to get one to slide, which is exactly how not to win a chess game. Retreating the queen to d1 or e2 would have been much better in my opinion."
16,c6,c7c6,rnb1kb1r/pp1p1p2/2p2q1n/4N1pQ/2BPPp2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 0 9,This move protects against my meager threat.
17,g3,g2g3,rnb1kb1r/pp1p1p2/2p2q1n/4N1pQ/2BPPp2/2N3P1/PPP4P/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 0 9,"I wanted to attack at all costs. If Black accepts this gambit, I would play Rf1 which will finally get to the f7 pawn."
18,d6,d7d6,rnb1kb1r/pp3p2/2pp1q1n/4N1pQ/2BPPp2/2N3P1/PPP4P/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 0 10,This chases my knight away. I have no use for it if my rook gets on a semi-open f-file.
19,gxf4,g3f4,rnb1kb1r/pp3p2/2pp1q1n/4N1pQ/2BPPP2/2N5/PPP4P/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 0 10,"I capture and get rid of one f-pawn. If black captures the knight, I capture back with my f-pawn."
20,gxf4,g5f4,rnb1kb1r/pp3p2/2pp1q1n/4N2Q/2BPPp2/2N5/PPP4P/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 0 11,"He captures my f-pawn, and at this point I would prefer to be Black. My queen is overdeveloped and my pieces are too entwined within the enemy position and blocked from retreat by my own pieces."
