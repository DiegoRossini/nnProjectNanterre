After Bisguier moved him, hell was unleashed. Note the features of the board however, the e-file is lost on Black, most notably e5, and the repercussion of a fork on e5 is brutal. Also, Black can't castle thanks to the pin on e7, and this tied down piece means that White is in essence a piece up."

After spending 40 minutes, staring at the board, several grandmasters watching the game were astounded that Browne was taking so long on such a relatively common line! Despite looking bizarre on every level, the analysis explains itself.
If Bisguier plays the face-value 14...gxh6, it will turn out that this is bad after 15. Re5 Qd7 16. Rad1 Be6 17. d5!... (freeing the crucial c3-h8 diagonal) ...cxd5 18. Rxe6! fxe6 19. Qxh8+ Bf8 20.
