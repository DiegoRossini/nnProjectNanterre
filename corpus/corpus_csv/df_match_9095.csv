1,g4,g2g4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/6P1/8/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I don't really know what ""partie de plaisir"" means... my opponent, pliko, chose the title.  Anyway, all I've got to say about this game (other than what I said in the title) is this: stick around.  There will be fireworks.

(?!) Grob's attack, also known as the Spike opening.  A very unusual opening, and I had yet to see it personally.  My guess is that White plans to fianchetto the bishop to at g2, and slash at any pawns I try to put up in the center."

3,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/6P1/8/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,I probably wouldn't have thought of this on my own; credit the database here.  The point is that it forces a weakening of the kingside pawn structure no matter what White does.

5,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1pp1/8/4p2p/6P1/4P3/PPPP1PBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 3,"Definitely better than 3. f3??, though maybe there's some merit to 3. Bf3."
6,hxg4,h5g4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1pp1/8/4p3/6p1/4P3/PPPP1PBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 4,The Queen capture allows me to get a big center with gain of time.
7,Qxg4,d1g4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1pp1/8/4p3/6Q1/4P3/PPPP1PBP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 0 4,The Queen capture allows me to get a big center with gain of time.
8,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/8/3pp3/6Q1/4P3/PPPP1PBP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 0 5,The Queen capture allows me to get a big center with gain of time.
9,Qa4+,g4a4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/8/3pp3/Q7/4P3/PPPP1PBP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 1 5,"Now the question becomes, what do I use to block the attack?"
10,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp3pp1/2p5/3pp3/Q7/4P3/PPPP1PBP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 0 6,"I chose the pawn for the reason that it could signal the start of a pawn chain that would severely curtail the power of White's bishop on the long diagonal.  5... Bd7 and 5... Nc6 seemed okay too, but I was a bit concerned for the safety of my d-pawn."
11,Ne2,g1e2,rnbqkbnr/pp3pp1/2p5/3pp3/Q7/4P3/PPPPNPBP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 1 6,"My goal was to get this stallion to c5.  Yeah, I know, ""knight on the rim..."", but I wanted to keep the diagonal open for my light-squared bishop."
12,Na6,b8a6,r1bqkbnr/pp3pp1/n1p5/3pp3/Q7/4P3/PPPPNPBP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 2 7,"My goal was to get this stallion to c5.  Yeah, I know, ""knight on the rim..."", but I wanted to keep the diagonal open for my light-squared bishop."
13,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pp3pp1/n1p5/3pp3/Q2P4/4P3/PPP1NPBP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 7,"Bah.  So much for Nc5.  I could close the position with 7... e5, but I felt that a closed position would make it that much harder to attack."
14,Bd6,f8d6,r1bqk1nr/pp3pp1/n1pb4/3pp3/Q2P4/4P3/PPP1NPBP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 1 8,"Defending the e-pawn.  My idea was to start poking around the kingside, or centralizing the bishop after an exchange between the center pawns."
15,Bxd5,g2d5,r1bqk1nr/pp3pp1/n1pb4/3Bp3/Q2P4/4P3/PPP1NP1P/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 8,"(!)  Damn.  I completely forgot that 7... Bd6 removed the only defender of the d-pawn, since my f-pawn is pinned."
16,Bd7,c8d7,r2qk1nr/pp1b1pp1/n1pb4/3Bp3/Q2P4/4P3/PPP1NP1P/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 1 9,"At the very least I can gain a lead in development and tempo.  White's bishop has to retreat, and his queen is prone to a discovered attack."
17,Bg2,d5g2,r2qk1nr/pp1b1pp1/n1pb4/4p3/Q2P4/4P3/PPP1NPBP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 2 9,"I was tempted to play c5 immediately, but I couldn't see any real way to continue harassing the queen after Qb3.  Nor did I stand to gain my pawn back (9... c5 Qb3 cxd4 exd4 exd4 Nxd4)."
18,Nf6,g8f6,r2qk2r/pp1b1pp1/n1pb1n2/4p3/Q2P4/4P3/PPP1NPBP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 3 10,So I decided instead to add to my lead in development.  I can always play f4 later if the opportunity arises.
19,dxe5,d4e5,r2qk2r/pp1b1pp1/n1pb1n2/4P3/Q7/4P3/PPP1NPBP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 10,Time for bishop centralization.
20,Bxe5,d6e5,r2qk2r/pp1b1pp1/n1p2n2/4b3/Q7/4P3/PPP1NPBP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 11,"(?!) Blocks the diagonal, but White is also restricting his queenside development... his dark-squared bishop can only go to d2, which would only give his knight the unappealing Na3.  And if the knight goes to d2, the poor bishop (not to mention the rook) is hemmed in.  Furthermore, with the bishop fianchettoed, the d3 square is looking awfully weak."
21,c3,c2c3,r2qk2r/pp1b1pp1/n1p2n2/4b3/Q7/2P1P3/PP2NPBP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 11,"(?!)

23,Qc2,a4c2,r2qk2r/pp1b1pp1/2p2n2/2n1b3/8/2P1P3/PPQ1NPBP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 2 12,"Not 12. Qd1, which would force a queen exchange and give me a wide-open d-file to play with."
24,Ng4,f6g4,r2qk2r/pp1b1pp1/2p5/2n1b3/6n1/2P1P3/PPQ1NPBP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 3 13,"(!?) It was with this move that I started to see the inkling of an initiative on White's kingside pawn formation.  There are a couple threats: I can win back my lost pawn with Nxh2 or Rxh2 (though I suppose I could have done that a move earlier), or I can seriously menace his majesty with Qh4.  (Edit: as Ion said, Qc7 is probably more solid.)"
