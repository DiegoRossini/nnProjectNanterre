1,g4,g2g4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/6P1/8/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The absurd Grob 'attack.' Despite being shunned by normal humans it has a small cult following, along with it's sister 1. e4 g5. It's biggest problem is that it's user can't really castle safely. Luckily i have some knowledge of how to play this opening, which means i should make the game competitive. If so, this opening can lead to very wacky games"
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/6P1/8/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The best move, forcing white to play a passive move covering the pawn?"
3,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/6P1/8/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,"No. When black takes, white often aims c4 followed by Qb3, intending to win back the pawn by taking b7."
4,Bxg4,c8g4,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/6b1/8/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 3,"White obliges, but i've got a trump card to play."
5,c4,c2c4,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2P3b1/8/PP1PPPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 3,"White obliges, but i've got a trump card to play."
6,dxc4,d5c4,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2p3b1/8/PP1PPPBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 4,?! Black gives up the A rook for superior development. Infact Rooks don't help much at all for most of this game.
7,Bxb7,g2b7,rn1qkbnr/pBp1pppp/8/8/2p3b1/8/PP1PPP1P/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 4,"Now Black rules the h1-a8 diagonal, which white wanted for themself. White has no development on their side except three empty squares."
8,Nd7,b8d7,r2qkbnr/pBpnpppp/8/8/2p3b1/8/PP1PPP1P/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 5,"Now Black rules the h1-a8 diagonal, which white wanted for themself. White has no development on their side except three empty squares."
9,Bxa8,b7a8,B2qkbnr/p1pnpppp/8/8/2p3b1/8/PP1PPP1P/RNBQK1NR b KQk - 0 5,"Now Black rules the h1-a8 diagonal, which white wanted for themself. White has no development on their side except three empty squares."
10,Qxa8,d8a8,q3kbnr/p1pnpppp/8/8/2p3b1/8/PP1PPP1P/RNBQK1NR w KQk - 0 6,"Now Black rules the h1-a8 diagonal, which white wanted for themself. White has no development on their side except three empty squares."
11,f3,f2f3,q3kbnr/p1pnpppp/8/8/2p3b1/5P2/PP1PP2P/RNBQK1NR b KQk - 0 6,"A horrible looking move, blocks in the knight, weakens the kingside and doesn't even threaten the bishop. I'd have preferred Nf3 even though black can give white doubled pawns by taking."
12,e5,e7e5,q3kbnr/p1pn1ppp/8/4p3/2p3b1/5P2/PP1PP2P/RNBQK1NR w KQk - 0 7,"The natural continuation, normal development with the D8-H4 diagonal looking tasty following whites f3."
13,Qa4,d1a4,q3kbnr/p1pn1ppp/8/4p3/Q1p3b1/5P2/PP1PP2P/RNB1K1NR b KQk - 1 7,Eyeing the c and a pawn.
14,Be6,g4e6,q3kbnr/p1pn1ppp/4b3/4p3/Q1p5/5P2/PP1PP2P/RNB1K1NR w KQk - 2 8,"Bit annoying to have to move the same piece twice early, but that pawn makes d3? look dodgy for white, so i don't think it should be taken yet. With whites kingside almost undevelopable, i know i will still have a stronger position in the long term."
15,Na3,b1a3,q3kbnr/p1pn1ppp/4b3/4p3/Q1p5/N4P2/PP1PP2P/R1B1K1NR b KQk - 3 8,Still eyeing the c pawn. Nc3 looks more natural.
16,Qd8,a8d8,3qkbnr/p1pn1ppp/4b3/4p3/Q1p5/N4P2/PP1PP2P/R1B1K1NR w KQk - 4 9,Here we go...
17,Kf1,e1f1,3qkbnr/p1pn1ppp/4b3/4p3/Q1p5/N4P2/PP1PP2P/R1B2KNR b k - 5 9,"I expected h4 there, to try and rouse the Rook and prevent my next move."
18,Qh4,d8h4,4kbnr/p1pn1ppp/4b3/4p3/Q1p4q/N4P2/PP1PP2P/R1B2KNR w k - 6 10,Whites queen finds time for some munchies. I don't think this game will be decided by who has the most pawns. More of a problem is the Qa8+ threat. black could have played Bc5 last move to cover it whilst continuing normal development.

21,Qa8+,a7a8,Q3k1nr/2pn1ppp/4b3/2b1p3/2p4q/N4P2/PP1PP2P/R1B2KNR b k - 2 11,"Only move for white. This appears to box in the knight, but i believe sacrificing the rook to develop it might be beneficial. White must play e3 next, which will leave a very weak f pawn."
