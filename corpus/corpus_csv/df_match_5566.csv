1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,e4 is a strong sensible opening which immediately places a pawn in the center and opens up line for the queen and bishop.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"A good response to e4, for the same reasons as white."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Nf3, a strong move that places pressure on the black pawn at e5."
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"d6 is not the best move to make, to a cautious player it may be worth playing but d6 creates a cramped position for black."
5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 3,"Bc4, this places whites bishop on a strong square to extend control."
6,f6,f7f6,rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/3p1p2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,"f6, a weak move as now three pawns have been moved without a single piece having developed. f6 also takes away the knights strong developing square."
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/3p1p2/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"Nc3, now all of the knights for white are developed as well as a bishop, black has just three pawns."
8,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkbnr/ppp3pp/3p1p2/4p3/2B1P1b1/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,Black expects the knight to be pinned to the queen.
9,Nxe5,f3e5,rn1qkbnr/ppp3pp/3p1p2/4N3/2B1P1b1/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,The beginning of Legall's mate. Surprise! WHat is this white has made a blunder and has lost his queen to the black bishop and it is only move 5.
10,Bxd1,g4d1,rn1qkbnr/ppp3pp/3p1p2/4N3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BbK2R w KQkq - 0 6,Black took the bait. Checkmate in two moves.
11,Bf7+,c4f7,rn1qkbnr/ppp2Bpp/3p1p2/4N3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BbK2R b KQkq - 1 6,Notice the white knight on e5 protects the bishop and stops the king from moving to d7.
12,Ke7,e8e7,rn1q1bnr/ppp1kBpp/3p1p2/4N3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BbK2R w KQ - 2 7,Forced.
13,Nd5#,c3d5,rn1q1bnr/ppp1kBpp/3p1p2/3NN3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/R1BbK2R b KQ - 3 7,The knight from c3 seals the deal. A tip to avoid this situation if you are black is to avoid taking the queen.
