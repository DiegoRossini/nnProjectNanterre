""Kann That Caro

I feel I'd be a happier man...if I could play the Caro-Kann.
But as it seems to me...when I play pawn to 'Qb3'
White gets a Knight upon 'K5'...and then, as sure as I'm alive
My Rook file's opened and my Queen...exposed to dangers unforeseen
By Nimzowitsch and all that lot...who think the Caro rather hot.

Then if I reach the middle game...my play is lifeless, cold and tame.
White's game is logical and bright...while nothing I can do is right.
I grow so tired of 'Check', 'Check', 'Check'...that I become a nervous wreck
And get into a hopeless pin, allowing white an easy win.
Tell Nimzowitsch it's all a plant. The opening's really Caro-Can't!""
