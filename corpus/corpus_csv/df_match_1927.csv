1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is not a slip. I didn't want to get into the well-known lines, and I play with a scheme in mind. 1. c6 is the only move that makes me think. When playin ""my"" line, I have to play c3 to be able to defend b2 after Qb6 with Qc2, that is a kind of developing move. Black will try to play Bf5, and there it comes a well-known battle white can win. So, I tried to play the ""countermove"" as early as black opened the way for the queen to b6. Of course, white has other good ways to defend the pawn, but they lead the game outside of the boundaries I feel confortable with."

5,Bf4,c1f4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3P1B2/2P5/PP2PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"The London bishop, I'd call it. A target, but..."
6,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3P1Bb1/2P5/PP2PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"Better was, in this case, Bf5, so white has to think how to respond to Qb6. I have to make black ""pay"" for his mistake, but... how?"
7,Nd2,b1d2,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3P1Bb1/2P5/PP1NPPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 3 4,"The usual move. I'm not in a real hurry to throw away the bishop, and of course, f3 is dangerous, despite the push on d4 to follow."
8,e6,e7e6,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3p4/3P1Bb1/2P5/PP1NPPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,Very funny.
