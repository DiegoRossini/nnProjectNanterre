The lines are really difficult to see here; I won't try to write them all out but Black's Queen is, in fact, trapped now. Correct was 17...Nc4, as I mentioned above. All the next moves are terrifically complex, each move wholly different from the last. I strongly suggest you look carefully at each of the next several positions, focusing on White's threats to trap the Black Queen--there are rather a lot of false trails and traps; the positions are really interesting."
