1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Here is Round 2 of the Dentist against Master Freddy.  The Dentist does better this time, although he does create a few too many cavities with too many pawn moves and later on, Freddy ensures he has a major dose of both heartache and toothache!   He starts off with a QP opening with 1.d4.  Before I go any further, here is the Gameknot Analysis version for you to refer to as you run through the moves. http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=14069274&rnd=0.039215609280492836"
