1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was a close tactical game involving the Advance Variation of the Caro Kann. Although it was decided by a mistake, it is of some interest for me to analyse some of the departures from theory in the late opening and the complicated position that arose in the middle game."

8,Qb6,d8b6,rn2kbnr/pp2pppp/1qp5/3pPb2/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 3 5,The main alternative to 4. ...e6. Black opts to steer the game into other channels.

I won with that in another annotated game (vs caimig), but was a bit unconvinced by it, and opted for this aggressive lunge instead. Strategically the idea is similar, to take advantage of black's slow and slightly cramped development."
