The recommended line does still have both queens out and about before a few of minor pieces though - theory isn't always reflected in practice! Early queen action is probably OK here because neither can be easily ""chased"" by the minor pieces (and then they are swapped off following a few developing moves)."

I may be missing something, but in the ""Best"" line, why would Black take the Knight (17. ...Qxd5) when that line causes so many problems for Black?

It does seem like advancing a pawn on the Queenside isn't the best idea when your Kingside is heavily under attack... But in the given ""best"" line, Black swaps his only developed minor piece! I suppose the trade is that by removing White's knight on f5, some White's threats against the Kingside are removed and Black gets chance to regroup."
