1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"My good friend Graeme and I are closing in on our 100th game against each other. I give blackbaron full credit for the game title:) Floyd, anyone?????????"
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Graeme's head would spontaneously combust if he played anything other than 1. e4 against me. Lately, I've been exploring the Caro Kann. I'm quite sure he expected 1...d5:)"
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Heading into Two Knight's territory, which is giving me fits as I learn this system. Main line reflects 2. d4."
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,Consistent with the 1. c6 theme.
5,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pP3/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,A very interesting choice. White appears to want to lock down the pawn structures early. I was really expecting 3. Nc3.
6,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pP3/6b1/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,Developing quickly and clearing d7 for my Nb8.
7,d4,d2d4,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pP3/3P2b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,Natural and good.
8,e6,e7e6,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3pP3/3P2b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"This is a prototypical pawn structure of a Caro Kann. At first glance (at least to me), it's just not that sexy. However, what this position lacks in pizzaz it more than makes up for with potential. Black can get fully developed relatively quickly and many times can delay castling or even forego castling very safely. This is definitely a defensive system for black."
9,Be2,f1e2,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3pP3/3P2b1/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,"I think I have correctly assumed that blackbaron is out of his comfort level as well. Since the Two Knights is not in effect, he simply hastens 0-0 with a good developing move. When you have played the same opponent so many times, you get a feel for his play. This is all new ground to us. The exciting part of chess is exploring new lines of play with cool adversaries:)"
10,a6,a7a6,rn1qkbnr/1p3ppp/p1p1p3/3pP3/3P2b1/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,?! The first step in recovery is admitting you have a problem. I am continually PLAGUED by voices inside my head telling me to play moves like this. I opt to neglect development and prepare b5 because I feel the kingside can hold for a bit. Somebody.....please.......stop me! Is there a pill for this behavior?
11,h3,h2h3,rn1qkbnr/1p3ppp/p1p1p3/3pP3/3P2b1/5N1P/PPP1BPP1/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"Putting the question to my bishop, which I feel is proper."
12,Bh5,g4h5,rn1qkbnr/1p3ppp/p1p1p3/3pP2b/3P4/5N1P/PPP1BPP1/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 7,"? BxN is seen so much more often in this position. At this point, I'm beginning to get worried about my own development. White is about to take a big lead in that department."
13,Bf4,c1f4,rn1qkbnr/1p3ppp/p1p1p3/3pP2b/3P1B2/5N1P/PPP1BPP1/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 2 7,Developing and preparing Nbd2.
14,Nd7,b8d7,r2qkbnr/1p1n1ppp/p1p1p3/3pP2b/3P1B2/5N1P/PPP1BPP1/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 3 8,"My kingside is going to take a few moves to develop, so I entertain the idea of 0-0-0 and develop another piece. Backwards thinking? Maybe......"
15,Qd3,d1d3,r2qkbnr/1p1n1ppp/p1p1p3/3pP2b/3P1B2/3Q1N1P/PPP1BPP1/RN2K2R b KQkq - 4 8,?! this moves just feels awkward. It is just begging for 8...Bg6.
16,Rc8,a8c8,2rqkbnr/1p1n1ppp/p1p1p3/3pP2b/3P1B2/3Q1N1P/PPP1BPP1/RN2K2R w KQk - 5 9,"? But, of course, I don't see it and play yet another ridiculous move. It's almost as if I am intentionally playing bad moves."
17,Nbd2,b1d2,2rqkbnr/1p1n1ppp/p1p1p3/3pP2b/3P1B2/3Q1N1P/PPPNBPP1/R3K2R b KQk - 6 9,As planned.
18,c5,c6c5,2rqkbnr/1p1n1ppp/p3p3/2ppP2b/3P1B2/3Q1N1P/PPPNBPP1/R3K2R w KQk - 0 10,I go ahead and prosecute my idea of action on the c file. If he takes my kingside development question is answered.
19,c3,c2c3,2rqkbnr/1p1n1ppp/p3p3/2ppP2b/3P1B2/2PQ1N1P/PP1NBPP1/R3K2R b KQk - 0 10,"Of course, Graeme sees this and most certainly won't assist me in that endeavor. However....."
20,c4,c5c4,2rqkbnr/1p1n1ppp/p3p3/3pP2b/2pP1B2/2PQ1N1P/PP1NBPP1/R3K2R w KQk - 0 11,!? Cements some boundary lines on the queenside and threatens the enemy queen.
