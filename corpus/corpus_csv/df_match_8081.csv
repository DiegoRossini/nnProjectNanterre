1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I usually strive for a Stonewall, as it is the opening that I've studied the most."
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Black's play is ideal for the Stonewall set-up.  What I don't like to see is a play by the c8 Bishop to g4, which complicates matters.  Nor do I like to see g7-g6, which blunts the power of the Stonewall Attack."
3,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"White's move makes the c1 Bishop a problem Bishop, but is part of the overall Stonewall strategy which is to build a pawn wall at c3, d4, e3 and f4."
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"White wants to get in c3, f4, Nf3 and 0-0.  Black's play makes White's task easy as he has yet to develop a piece.  Often, White wants to play Nb1-d2 to prevent a Knight coming in at e4 and to prepare for an eventual pawn push in the center."
5,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3P4/3BP3/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 3,"White wants to get in c3, f4, Nf3 and 0-0.  Black's play makes White's task easy as he has yet to develop a piece.  Often, White wants to play Nb1-d2 to prevent a Knight coming in at e4 and to prepare for an eventual pawn push in the center."
6,a6,a7a6,rnbqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p3p3/3p4/3P4/3BP3/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 4,"Black still hasn't developed a piece, and this move seems to waste time."
7,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p3p3/3p4/3P1P2/3BP3/PPP3PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 4,"White seizes firm control of e5, the hoped for home of the g1 Knight."
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1n1p3/3p4/3P1P2/3BP3/PPP3PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 5,White doesn't want the Knight to come to b4
9,c3,c2c3,r1bqkbnr/1pp2ppp/p1n1p3/3p4/3P1P2/2PBP3/PP4PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,The Stonewall Formation is complete.
10,b5,b7b5,r1bqkbnr/2p2ppp/p1n1p3/1p1p4/3P1P2/2PBP3/PP4PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,A waste of time.  And now the Knight is hanging.
11,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/2p2ppp/p1n1p3/1p1p4/3P1P2/2PBPN2/PP4PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,White's development is natural.  0-0 is next.
12,Bd6,f8d6,r1bqk1nr/2p2ppp/p1nbp3/1p1p4/3P1P2/2PBPN2/PP4PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 7,"The Bishop is ""biting on granite"" as the f4 pawn is well defended."
13,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk1nr/2p2ppp/p1nbp3/1p1p4/3P1P2/2PBPN2/PP4PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 3 7,Black is dilly dallying.  He may be seeing ghosts or thinking of an ill-advised pawn push on the K-side.
14,h6,h7h6,r1bqk1nr/2p2pp1/p1nbp2p/1p1p4/3P1P2/2PBPN2/PP4PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,Black is dilly dallying.  He may be seeing ghosts or thinking of an ill-advised pawn push on the K-side.

An alternative is Ne5, with an opening of the f-file in the offing.  The text may be better as it develops a piece, takes control of e4 (with e3-e4 contemplated), and would be available to defend the N on e5."

22,dxe4,d5e4,r1bq1rk1/2p1npp1/p1n1p2p/1p2P3/3Pp3/2PB4/PP1N2PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 12,This was probably a mistake.  Better would be to let White capture on d5 and recapture with the pawn to free the c1 Bishop.  White considers which piece is best for the recapture.
