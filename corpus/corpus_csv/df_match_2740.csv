1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This is one of the games where I think I played reasonably well. I began with 1. e4 instead of 1. d4 which I usually play.

11,Be2,f1e2,rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"I usually play this variation, because it feels to me like the most natural place to put the bishop."
12,e5,e7e5,rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2p1n2/4p3/3NP3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"8. O-O is the most common move, but I don't think it makes a big difference."
13,Nb3,d4b3,rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2p1n2/4p3/4P3/1NN5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,"8. O-O is the most common move, but I don't think it makes a big difference."

16,Be6,c8e6,rn1qk2r/1p2bppp/p2pbn2/4p3/4P3/1NN1B3/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 4 9,10. Qd2 is another alternative. But I want to prevent Black from playing b5.
17,O-O,e1g1,rn1qk2r/1p2bppp/p2pbn2/4p3/4P3/1NN1B3/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 5 9,10. Qd2 is another alternative. But I want to prevent Black from playing b5.
18,O-O,e8g8,rn1q1rk1/1p2bppp/p2pbn2/4p3/4P3/1NN1B3/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 6 10,10. Qd2 is another alternative. But I want to prevent Black from playing b5.
19,a4,a2a4,rn1q1rk1/1p2bppp/p2pbn2/4p3/P3P3/1NN1B3/1PP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 10,10. Qd2 is another alternative. But I want to prevent Black from playing b5.
20,Nbd7,b8d7,r2q1rk1/1p1nbppp/p2pbn2/4p3/P3P3/1NN1B3/1PP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 1 11,This is an aggressive move. Again 11. Qd2 is more often seen on the board.
21,f4,f2f4,r2q1rk1/1p1nbppp/p2pbn2/4p3/P3PP2/1NN1B3/1PP1B1PP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 11,This is an aggressive move. Again 11. Qd2 is more often seen on the board.
22,Rc8,a8c8,2rq1rk1/1p1nbppp/p2pbn2/4p3/P3PP2/1NN1B3/1PP1B1PP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 1 12,This is a natural response that puts the rook on the open file.
23,Qe1,d1e1,2rq1rk1/1p1nbppp/p2pbn2/4p3/P3PP2/1NN1B3/1PP1B1PP/R3QRK1 b - - 2 12,This has not been seen in grandmaster games. My plan is to transfer the queen to the king side.
24,Ng4,f6g4,2rq1rk1/1p1nbppp/p2pb3/4p3/P3PPn1/1NN1B3/1PP1B1PP/R3QRK1 w - - 3 13,And Black reacts immediately by threatening the bishop. This was not possible with the queen on d1.
25,Bd2,e3d2,2rq1rk1/1p1nbppp/p2pb3/4p3/P3PPn1/1NN5/1PPBB1PP/R3QRK1 b - - 4 13,I want to keep my bishop.
26,Qb6+,d8b6,2r2rk1/1p1nbppp/pq1pb3/4p3/P3PPn1/1NN5/1PPBB1PP/R3QRK1 w - - 5 14,"And Black takes control of the weakened g1-a7 diagonal. Although the Qb6-Ng4 setup looks dangerous, it is not enough to create serious troubles for the king. Perhaps Black is little better here."
27,Kh1,g1h1,2r2rk1/1p1nbppp/pq1pb3/4p3/P3PPn1/1NN5/1PPBB1PP/R3QR1K b - - 6 14,Black brings the knight to a more active square. The drawback is that the retreat square of the g4-knight is now occupied. I think this is a positional mistake that allows me to make progress.
28,Ndf6,d7f6,2r2rk1/1p2bppp/pq1pbn2/4p3/P3PPn1/1NN5/1PPBB1PP/R3QR1K w - - 7 15,Black brings the knight to a more active square. The drawback is that the retreat square of the g4-knight is now occupied. I think this is a positional mistake that allows me to make progress.
29,a5,a4a5,2r2rk1/1p2bppp/pq1pbn2/P3p3/4PPn1/1NN5/1PPBB1PP/R3QR1K b - - 0 15,The queen does not have any good squares on the g1-a7 diagonal. Either it has to give up the diagonal or go to a7.
30,Qa7,b6a7,2r2rk1/qp2bppp/p2pbn2/P3p3/4PPn1/1NN5/1PPBB1PP/R3QR1K w - - 1 16,And it goes to a7. This is probably the best alternative.
31,Bd3,e2d3,2r2rk1/qp2bppp/p2pbn2/P3p3/4PPn1/1NNB4/1PPB2PP/R3QR1K b - - 2 16,"I was thinking about 16. f5 which was probably objectively best, but for some reason I began to envision an attack where the bishop belonged to d3."
32,d5,d6d5,2r2rk1/qp2bppp/p3bn2/P2pp3/4PPn1/1NNB4/1PPB2PP/R3QR1K w - - 0 17,And Black just allows me to make my dreams true. Black could give his knight a good square by 16...exf4 17. Bxf4 Ne5.
33,exd5,e4d5,2r2rk1/qp2bppp/p3bn2/P2Pp3/5Pn1/1NNB4/1PPB2PP/R3QR1K b - - 0 17,Another good move was 18. f5 with a complicated position.
34,Nxd5,f6d5,2r2rk1/qp2bppp/p3b3/P2np3/5Pn1/1NNB4/1PPB2PP/R3QR1K w - - 0 18,Another good move was 18. f5 with a complicated position.
35,Nxd5,c3d5,2r2rk1/qp2bppp/p3b3/P2Np3/5Pn1/1N1B4/1PPB2PP/R3QR1K b - - 0 18,Another good move was 18. f5 with a complicated position.
36,Bxd5,e6d5,2r2rk1/qp2bppp/p7/P2bp3/5Pn1/1N1B4/1PPB2PP/R3QR1K w - - 0 19,But I preferred to keep it simple and just take the pawn.
37,fxe5,f4e5,2r2rk1/qp2bppp/p7/P2bP3/6n1/1N1B4/1PPB2PP/R3QR1K b - - 0 19,But I preferred to keep it simple and just take the pawn.
38,Bxb3,d5b3,2r2rk1/qp2bppp/p7/P3P3/6n1/1b1B4/1PPB2PP/R3QR1K w - - 0 20,"This makes Blacks position even worse. He exchanges a perfectly good and active bishop for a knight that does not do much. Doubling the pawns is not an issue here, because the activity of the bishop pair more than compensates for the stratural weakness."
39,cxb3,c2b3,2r2rk1/qp2bppp/p7/P3P3/6n1/1P1B4/1P1B2PP/R3QR1K b - - 0 20,"Black continues to play on the g1-a7 diagonal. However, the threat of Nf2+ does not scare me as I can always sacrifice an exchange and there are no more threats on the king."
40,Bc5,e7c5,2r2rk1/qp3ppp/p7/P1b1P3/6n1/1P1B4/1P1B2PP/R3QR1K w - - 1 21,"Black continues to play on the g1-a7 diagonal. However, the threat of Nf2+ does not scare me as I can always sacrifice an exchange and there are no more threats on the king."
