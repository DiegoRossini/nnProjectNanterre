I really hope that you, dear GK player, can enjoy this match!"

Black offers a pawn, breaking the center. A brave move, which can somewhat remind the Marshall gambit (1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. 0-0 Be7 6. Re1 b5 7. Bb3 00 8. c3 d5!?). Here black has already moved the d-pawn on his 7th move, and now is pushing it again. Perhaps someone can think it can be a strategical blunder, since is a good idea not to move twice the same piece in the opening without a good reason, but everyone knows that these rules must be considered ""cum grano salis""."

15. Nh5: seems an aggressive move, since it menaces the f-pawn and the knight looks the pawn at g7 which seems to be somewhat appetizing.
15. Nf1, 15. Nh1: passive moves, especially the second, but playable.
15. Ne2?!: after the expected 15. ... f3, will lead to another transfer. I think is not a good idea."

Perhaps white can ignore the menace and allow the black to take in g2, or defend with 16. g3, which seems better than g4."

After an eventually 18. ~ Qxh3 only 19. Qxf3 would ""save"" the King, with the Queen giving her life in order to let his husband not to be captured too soon. Obviously, after 18. Re4, white can answer with 19. Qf1 to 18. ... Qxh3.

To free the first rank and the access of f1-square to Queen, could white have also played 18. Re5?"
36,Nf4,d5f4,r1b2rk1/2p3pp/p2N4/np6/4RnPq/2P2p1P/PPBP1P2/RNBQ2K1 w - - 3 19,"Here, kitty kitty kitty!
Black is threatening a nice mate: 19. ~ Nxh3  20. Kh1 Nxf2   (20. Kh2 doesn't change the combination, but the double check is always an interesting event!) 21. Kg1 Qg3  22. Kf1 Qg2  23. Ke1 Qg1#.

In order to answer to the question of the previous move: if white played 18. Re5, after 18. ... Nf4 the mate threat is the same. 19. Ne4 would protect the f2 weak point, but would not be enough. 19. ... Qxh3 followed by 20. ... Qg2# is unavoidable!

So, it is clearly visible that the only move can save is 19. Rxf4."
