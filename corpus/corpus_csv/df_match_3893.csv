1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"A40 Queen's Pawn Opening. The Queen's Pawn opening move is somewhat slower than the popular e4, because White will not be able to castle for three more moves. Its advantage is that it gives White more control over tactical surprises and often provides more lasting initiative and pressure."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"A45 Indian Defense. The immediate development of the Knight is the most supple response to the Queen's Pawn opening, allowing transposition into virtually every type of defense at Black's disposal."
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 2,"A45 Indian Defense. By blocking the c-pawn, White forces the game out of normal Queen-pawn opening lines. Transposition to the French Defense is now possible, or White may intend the Blackmar-Diemer Gambit."
