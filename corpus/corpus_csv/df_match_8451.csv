14. f3, preventing the N to go to g4 (but... is this N a threat, there?). If Nf5, I can play Bf4, since he cannot threat it with his pawns, since the N would be hanging. I will lose the bishop pair, but I will win some other pawn. But I cannot stop Nf5 - Bd6.
14. Nc3, developing and making him harder to push e5. With Nf5, he allows his bishop to d6, thus exchanging it with mine. And the only way I have to stop it is BxN, but this is ugly, even if he gets a doubled pawn (not easy to take advantage of it)."

So, the best plan maybe was Kd7, and push the central pawns e4, f4... but I feared to get only a blocked center or, worse, an open column it was not completely clear to whom would have been an advantage to. 
So I went to another direction, among the many possible (e. g. o-o-o): b4, pushing and try to get advantage of the weakness of his 7ยบ rank, due to the bad collocation of his pieces.
