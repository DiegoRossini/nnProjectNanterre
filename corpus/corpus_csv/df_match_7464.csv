The center is locked up, and pushing my kingside pawns would be suicide (because my kingside is already too weak as it is.) Thus, I found the plan of trying to open up the board on the queenside.

However, this plan has a serious defect: It's going to be very difficult for me to find a way to get my bishop on c8 into the game."
