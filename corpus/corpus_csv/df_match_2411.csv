4,f6,f7f6,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,Damiano Defense - an inferior response
5,Nxe5,f3e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"Damiano Gambit - poison chess at it's greatest.  It's an enticing capture that should be avoided, because that ""piece"" offering comes with bad intentions."
6,fxe5,f6e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Gambit accepted, a common mistake taking the knight - which I refer to as the Trojan Horse"

11,Bc4+,f1c4,rnbq1bnr/pppp1kpp/8/4Q3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 2 6,"Continued development for White, all while Black's future options are continuing to look bleak"
12,Kg6,f7g6,rnbq1bnr/pppp2pp/6k1/4Q3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 3 7,"Bad option for Black, sacrificing the Queen's Pawn in order to free up the Queen's Bishop, while attacking White's KB, would have been a more prudent option"
