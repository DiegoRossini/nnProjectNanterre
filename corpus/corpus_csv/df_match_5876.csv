10,Bxf2+,c5f2,r1bqk2r/pppp1Npp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1bPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,...and the normal follow-up - Black has to do this if he wants to get anything out of this variation
11,Kf1,e1f1,r1bqk2r/pppp1Npp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1bPP/RNBQ1K1R b kq - 1 6,By far the safest option - the next two moves are also normal for this mini-tournament...
12,Qe7,d8e7,r1b1k2r/ppppqNpp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1bPP/RNBQ1K1R w kq - 2 7,"!? It seems that mainline here is 7...d5 but there has to be playability in this move - by allowing the dark-square bishop to stay on the board, Black can exert considerable pressure on the a7-g1 diagonal [I think I'll be playing more of this move as the mini-tournament goes on...]"
13,Nxh8,f7h8,r1b1k2N/ppppq1pp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1bPP/RNBQ1K1R b q - 0 7,"!?

15,Nc3,b1c3,r1b1k2N/ppppq1pp/1bn2n2/4p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQ1K1R b q - 2 8,"Naturally, Joanne needs to develop her pieces as fast as possible to repel any attacking attempts from Black"
16,d5,d7d5,r1b1k2N/ppp1q1pp/1bn2n2/3pp3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQ1K1R w q - 0 9,"Developing with a tempo attack on the bishop, and White has two pieces and a pawn to choose from in which to recapture, although GK analysis prefers Qc5"
17,Bxd5,c4d5,r1b1k2N/ppp1q1pp/1bn2n2/3Bp3/4P3/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQ1K1R b q - 0 9,"?! Not the best recapture, even though Black can't capture the queen with Bg4. I had considered that, but rejected it due to Bxc6+ [the knight pair can be a monster in this variation] That was, however, the best move according to the GK analysis, but I get confused by the line it gives - 9.Bxg5 Bg4 10.Bxc6+ bxc6... but then the line continues Ne2, which allows Nxe4... why Qe1 wasn't considered by GK analysis, I don't know."
18,Nd4,c6d4,r1b1k2N/ppp1q1pp/1b3n2/3Bp3/3nP3/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQ1K1R w q - 1 10,"?! At any rate, I opt to keep my knight - however, Bg4 is a plan in the immediate future..."

It seemed such a strong move at the time, opening up the f-file for my queen while posting my knight on a strong square... but there was a refutation that the GK analysis picked up on; 11.Bf7+ Kf8 12.Nd5!, and the black queen has no squares for intrusion on the f-file. It is true, though, that the knight cannot be taken right now..."
21,hxg4,h3g4,r1b1k2N/ppp1q1pp/1b6/3Bp3/3nP1P1/2N5/PPPP2P1/R1BQ1K1R b q - 0 11,?? As will be demonstrated in the next couple of moves!

25,Ke2,e1e2,r1b1k2N/ppp3pp/1b3q2/3Bp3/4P1P1/2N5/PPnPK1P1/R1BQ3R b q - 1 13,"Here, Black's advantage is +6.66... ;)"

30,Nxa1,c2a1,r3k2N/ppp3pp/1b3q2/3Bp3/4P3/2NK4/PP1P2P1/n1BR4 w q - 0 16,"...and then the black knight captures White's rook - Black just went from -9 to +4! Joanne resigned at this point, and with Black's material and positional advantage, who can blame her? I'm going to have to be careful though - she'll be sure to be looking for revenge in our second game! :P"
