1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,White opens up with the centre game - one I have never encountered much myself
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,White opens up with the centre game - one I have never encountered much myself
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,White opens up with the centre game - one I have never encountered much myself
4,exd4,e5d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3pP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Black captures...
5,Qxd4,d1d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"and White recaptures, bringing the queen into early development. According to the database, more popular here is the Danish Gambit with 3.c3"
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"the most logical move, driving away the queen while developing a piece"
7,Qe3,d4e3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/4P3/4Q3/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 2 4,"I expected Qa4 here (as with a main line in the Scandinavian defence; 1.e4 d5 2.exd5 Qxd5 3.Nc3 Qa5) but again, the DB says that this is the most common response to Black's last move, so it can't be bad"
8,g6,g7g6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1p1p/2n3p1/8/4P3/4Q3/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"?! the main response is Nf6 (again, according to the DB - this will be the last time I refer to it in this annotation) What I had in mind was [of course] Bg7, followed by a future Bd4 to pressure the queen once more"
9,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1p1p/2n3p1/8/4P3/2N1Q3/PPP2PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 1 5,"White continues queenside development, and is two steps away (if he chooses) from queenside castling"
10,Bg7,f8g7,r1bqk1nr/pppp1pbp/2n3p1/8/4P3/2N1Q3/PPP2PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 2 6,Of course
11,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqk1nr/pppp1pbp/2n3p1/1B6/4P3/2N1Q3/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 3 6,"The first aggressive attack from White, threatening to double up the pawns on the c-file."
12,a6,a7a6,r1bqk1nr/1ppp1pbp/p1n3p1/1B6/4P3/2N1Q3/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 0 7,"maybe 6...Qf6 would have been better in this situation, but my thinking here was that Black's pieces would have more room after the recapture with the d-pawn (and by pieces, I mean the queen and bishop)"
13,Bxc6,b5c6,r1bqk1nr/1ppp1pbp/p1B3p1/8/4P3/2N1Q3/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 0 7,The next couple of moves are just simple development

Of course, White doesn't need to double up pawns - he can easily retake with the queen - but I wanted to place the bishop on e5, then the queen on d6 (actually, I did it the other way around in the game) to pressure on h2. The most logical defence to this would be g3, which may provide weaknesses in the kingside position, but the real 'Catch 22' of this idea is that the best way to exploit the weakness would be the Queen and bishop on the h3 and f3 squares...."
16,Bg4,c8g4,r2qk1nr/1pp2pbp/p1p3p1/8/4P1b1/2N1QN2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 2 9,"?!

20,Qd6,d8d6,r3k1nr/1pp2pbp/p1pq2p1/8/4P3/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 1 11,going through with my plan anyway - there could still be a way to make it a weakness
21,e5,e4e5,r3k1nr/1pp2pbp/p1pq2p1/4P3/8/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 0 11,"? gives up a pawn for nothing. Maybe White thought that Black would recapture with the bishop, at which point White would play 12.Bf4!, then 13.Bxc7 next move, preventing Queenside castling (12...Qe7?? is not possible because of 13.Rfe1!) Of course, Why would Black recapture with the queen when he has the bishop? [another interesting variation, which still ends up with an equal trade-off, was 11...Qxe5 12.Bg6 Bxh6 13.Rfe1 Qxe1 14.Nxe1+ Ne7, with a pawn, a bishop and a rook for Black's queen]"
