5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"Bad. Obviously something had to be done about the e-pawn, and 3. ...Nc6 is not good enough in view of 4. dxe5, dxe5; 5. Qxd8 , Kxd8; when Black can't castle and White gets a lead in development. But this move shuts off a square that either the King's Knight or the Queen badly needed - and now they plus the Bishop are all fighting over e7, and three into one won't go.

To make matters worse, the move weakens both diagonals running through f7, meaning that after White's next Black will be unable to castle for some time to come, and will be at risk of a check from h5 (see move 10).

Better is either 3. ...Nd7, 3. ...Nf6 or even the ambitious 3. ...f5."
