1,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Bird's opening. I use it myself sometimes.
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Not the best move. the main lines here are 2.g3 and 2.e3 (2.b3 is similar to 1.b3 openenig).
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P1P2/8/PPP1P1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Not the best move. the main lines here are 2.g3 and 2.e3 (2.b3 is similar to 1.b3 openenig).
4,b6,b7b6,rnbqkbnr/p1p1pppp/1p6/3p4/3P1P2/8/PPP1P1PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"What's the point?
The bishop can move freely on the c8-h3 diagonal, why weakening the queen-side?"
5,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/p1p1pppp/1p6/3p4/3P1P2/4P3/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,4.c3 would give white the stonewall position (like black plays in the dutch opening).
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/p1p1pppp/1p3n2/3p4/3P1P2/4P3/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,4.c3 would give white the stonewall position (like black plays in the dutch opening).

8,c6,c7c6,rnbqkb1r/p3pppp/1pp2n2/3p4/3P1P2/2N1P3/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,now we can see that b6 was not in place. instead black could already play Nbd7 or e6.
