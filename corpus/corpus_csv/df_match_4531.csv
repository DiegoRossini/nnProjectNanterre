1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I know this game is not an impressive one, but I'm showing someone who is new at the game what NOT TO DO in the opening. Said that, I proceed.

He starts with Kings pawn."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I reply with kings pawn too.
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"He wants to offer a pawns exchange or to have a strong center after d5 if I ignore his pawn. Personally, I think this is a bad idea, since, he'll have to play immediate queen capture or will have to fight tougher to recapture the pawn later. And for those who don't know why queen can't be brought out before other pieces have developed, just continue viewing the game."
4,exd4,e5d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3pP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"So, I take it..."
5,Qxd4,d1d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"Queen capture, the guy doesn't believe in delayed recaptures with minor pieces, or in the troubles his queen could get into by developing too early..."
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 1 4,Development of knight and attacking the queen.
7,Qd5,d4d5,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/3Q4/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 2 4,"Keeps the queen near, guess he is planning an attack."
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/3Q4/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 3 5,"Okay, let's keep the development and forcing him to play defensive."
9,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/3Q2B1/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RN2KBNR b KQkq - 4 5,Nice pinning.
10,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/2n2n2/3Q2B1/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RN2KBNR w KQkq - 5 6,"Now my knight is pinned... But developing my bishop while also opening way for castling looks the best here for me. It also counterpins my knight, so now he has his queen en-prise again."
11,Bxf6,g5f6,r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/2n2B2/3Q4/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RN2KBNR b KQkq - 0 6,"He takes it, of course. He would have regretted not doing so."
12,Bxf6,e7f6,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2b2/3Q4/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RN2KBNR w KQkq - 0 7,"I recapture, my bishop ends up challenging his b-pawn, so, again, he's got to lose tempo in defense."
13,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2b2/3Q4/2B1P3/8/PPP2PPP/RN2K1NR b KQkq - 1 7,Looks like he's determined to put me in trouble. He's menacing mate in f7.
14,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2n2b2/3Q4/2B1P3/8/PPP2PPP/RN2K1NR w KQ - 2 8,"Ah, I just castle, my king is safe. Now, where were we? Ah yes, threatening his b-pawn... You'll defend it?"
15,Nf3,g1f3,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2n2b2/3Q4/2B1P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN2K2R b KQ - 3 8,"No! He totally forgot his b pawn... this is bad for him... maybe he'll bring up more power against my f7 square, but I can neutralize it and after I do, he'll be in so much trouble."
16,Bxb2,f6b2,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2n5/3Q4/2B1P3/5N2/PbP2PPP/RN2K2R w KQ - 0 9,"Well, b-pawn is gone, and nothing can help that rock now."
17,Ng5,f3g5,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2n5/3Q2N1/2B1P3/8/PbP2PPP/RN2K2R b KQ - 1 9,Trying to gang up on f7... Now there's 3 attackers and 2 defenders... I'm losing there...
18,Qf6,d8f6,r1b2rk1/pppp1ppp/2n2q2/3Q2N1/2B1P3/8/PbP2PPP/RN2K2R w KQ - 2 10,"Well, that's it, now I'm good. 3 defenders... If exchanges take place, I'll lose my queen and rock against his queen, bishop and knight, so, pretty welcome. He can't push the e-pawn. I'd immediately capture it with Queen giving him a check. He either moves his king or exchanges queens, and this will be over much faster."
19,h4,h2h4,r1b2rk1/pppp1ppp/2n2q2/3Q2N1/2B1P2P/8/PbP2PP1/RN2K2R b KQ - 0 10,I guess he wants to keep his grip on my castle there.
20,h6,h7h6,r1b2rk1/pppp1pp1/2n2q1p/3Q2N1/2B1P2P/8/PbP2PP1/RN2K2R w KQ - 0 11,I try to encourage him to start exchanging or to back off completely.
