1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is a game I played shortly after starting to read through Vladimir Vukovic's ""The Art of the Attack in Chess""; specifically, the section on the attack on the king stuck in the centre.   The ideas in the book helped me to a quick win in this game."
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,d4 is the most common here.   I find 2. Nf3 usually indicates a weaker player unfamiliar with the French.   It's also a sign that the French exchange is on the way.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,d4 is the most common here.   I find 2. Nf3 usually indicates a weaker player unfamiliar with the French.   It's also a sign that the French exchange is on the way.
