First and foremost, my biggest thanks to hityerclock for commenting on my annotations. Next, I just don't know what has been happening to my game lately.  I have been falling for a rash of one move blunders lately and this game has been one of them, although I was lost the previous move.  This game started off as a Sicilian Dragon type game with both sides castling on opposite sides, white on the queenside and black on the kingside.  We are in the book for quite a while before I decided to challenge rooks on the c column.  Black then threw me a curve with a piece for 2 pawn sac which proved decisive later on.  So, how did all this happen, well, read on.  Gameknot analysis is provided here. http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=16090381&rnd=0.8934997643125019"
