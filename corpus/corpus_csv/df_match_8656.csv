1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I think I initiated this challenge against a higher-rated player with a higher score in D1. I adopted a suitably conservative opening move.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"An interesting move order.  I have vague memories of having been stuffed by White after playing this after 3. cxd5 Nxd5 but I can't believe it's actually wrong.  As White, I continue to take a conservative approach."

5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,Develops a piece and piles pressure on d5.
6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Now we're in QGD Orthodox territory.
7,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,Now we're in QGD Orthodox territory.
8,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 2 5,"a sound continuation, leading to a typical Slav-type position.  I'm not sure exactly which one... nuntar to the rescue?"
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 3 5,"a sound continuation, leading to a typical Slav-type position.  I'm not sure exactly which one... nuntar to the rescue?"

11,e3,e2e3,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/2p1pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,I'd expected 7.....dxc4 8. Bxc4 which seeks to prove that White has wasted a tempo with 7. Bd3 but this is a perfectly acceptable continuation for Black.
12,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bqk2r/pp1nbppp/2p1pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,I'd expected 7.....dxc4 8. Bxc4 which seeks to prove that White has wasted a tempo with 7. Bd3 but this is a perfectly acceptable continuation for Black.
13,Bd3,f1d3,r1bqk2r/pp1nbppp/2p1pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 2 7,I'd expected 7.....dxc4 8. Bxc4 which seeks to prove that White has wasted a tempo with 7. Bd3 but this is a perfectly acceptable continuation for Black.
14,h6,h7h6,r1bqk2r/pp1nbpp1/2p1pn1p/3p2B1/2PP4/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 8,I'd expected 7.....dxc4 8. Bxc4 which seeks to prove that White has wasted a tempo with 7. Bd3 but this is a perfectly acceptable continuation for Black.
15,Bh4,g5h4,r1bqk2r/pp1nbpp1/2p1pn1p/3p4/2PP3B/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 8,"White prefers to keep the 2 bishops, if possible.  He needn't worry about Black's KN exposing an attack on the Bh4 because Black can't take any White pieces in the process of revealing the attack and White can merely swap on e7."
16,b6,b7b6,r1bqk2r/p2nbpp1/1pp1pn1p/3p4/2PP3B/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 9,Black prepares to fianchetto his q-side B.  His pawn structure already restricts this B.  White's Bishops are much better because of their greater freedom of movement and influence on the position.

Qc7 for example)"

They say that chess is often about choosing the right moment to convert one sort of advantage into another and I think I just about got this right, though Black's Bishops do now look strong."
