2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Standard QGD moves so far, the DSB develops to g5 before white plays a solidifying e3 push, so as the dear bishop doesn't end up trapped behind his own pawns."

9,e3,e2e3,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p2B1/1bPP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"This I don't agree with, as trading a bishop for a knight so early is ill-advised in my eyes (unless provoked), seeing as it's much easier to open a position than to close it. These doubled pawns are of no trouble to White either, as c3 further strengthens the all important d4 pawn, and c4 does a good job contesting d5, and can always be traded off if need be. Better than this was 5...O-O, 5...Nbd7 and 5...Nc6"
