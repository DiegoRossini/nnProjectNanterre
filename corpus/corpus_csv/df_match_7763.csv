1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Yay, a game where I play white! My first one since joining gameknot. I open with my standard king's pawn, which I think is the best opening move of a game. From here there are alot of options, but basically I prefer to play without the slow build-ups which e4 tends to avoid."
2,h5,h7h5,rnbqkbnr/ppppppp1/8/7p/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"After the match, the internets tell me this is the Pickering Defense. Completely stupid move, doesn't help black to develop and essentially surrenders the centre to white. The only thing black can possibly be aiming at is getting his rook out quickly, which is easily countered by. . ."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppppppp1/8/7p/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"d4. Now white's ds-bishop is blocking blacks rook, preventing any sensible player from moving Rh6. Not only that, but white has complete control of the centre, black is in serious trouble."
4,Rh6,h8h6,rnbqkbn1/ppppppp1/7r/7p/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQq - 1 3,"Possibly the only move that was worse than the opening h5 move. . . Rh6 essentially sacrifices the king-side rook for a bishop. Not only that, but black forfeits his short-castle."
5,Bxh6,c1h6,rnbqkbn1/ppppppp1/7B/7p/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQq - 0 3,"Obvious move, with the likely Nxh6 to follow. However, at this point my opponent noticed the awful position he had put himself into and stopped playing. The game timed out at this point."
