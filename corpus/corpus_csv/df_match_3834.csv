That is a principle however, and principles tell us only moves we should put into our candidate moves, not play them immediately. For example,you could take a pawn and let your opponent destroy your position. You will put taking the pawn on the list, but after you see that it destroy's your position, you will reject it. This is not the case here, by the way. I am just stating an important fact. By the way, when considering taking material, and you arrive at a n unclear line which is not really that bad,but not so good for you, just always take the material if you are sure you analyzed correctly. Many players try to see deeper, thinknig about all sorts of things; This just confuses them and they have doubts about the position and their understanding of it. If anything is unclear, always go for your instinct: Your instinct is to play the unclear line, since you decided to look at it. If it is an unclear dubious line, then maybe you should not play it."
