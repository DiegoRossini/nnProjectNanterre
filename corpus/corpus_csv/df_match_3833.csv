He was one of few players, who mastered this opening strategy with both black, and white. Bobby would never have played 2. Nf3... Most likely, he would have played 2. f4 d6 (or e6) 3.

Since black can easily win the pawn back, he gains tempo... In other variations, black would strive for e6, Ne7, 0-0, followed by d5... If he can beat white to it... It is all about d5..."
