1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,mostly likely the best because 4. dxc5 Qa5+ wins back the pawn with a slight tempo for black.
2,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,mostly likely the best because 4. dxc5 Qa5+ wins back the pawn with a slight tempo for black.

8,e6,e7e6,rnbqk1nr/pp1p1pbp/4p1p1/2pP4/2P5/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"!? aiming to transpose into a favorable modern Benoni lines because I have already developed my bishop which in traditional move orders black has to give a small tempo to develop it. Also very interesting is 4. ...e5!? because I think it is good against computers, black aims to setup a Bermuda triangle pawn formation that many programs lose their way in."
9,e4,e2e4,rnbqk1nr/pp1p1pbp/4p1p1/2pP4/2P1P3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,The alternative 5. dxe6 is slightly favourable to black because he has a better Center to counteract the weakness on the f-file.
10,exd5,e6d5,rnbqk1nr/pp1p1pbp/6p1/2pp4/2P1P3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,5. ...e5!? 6. Nc3 d6 transposes to a king's Indian style of game.
11,exd5,e4d5,rnbqk1nr/pp1p1pbp/6p1/2pP4/2P5/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"6. cxd5 would be main line Modern Benoni. However, the game move even though it has been seen in many chess games has no reference point in the Gameknot database. Which means that my opponent is more than likely thinking on his own. I of course have my own internal database that is still in book. An chess engine may very well give white a slight advantage due to his space advantage in the centre and superior pawn structure but Black's dominating DSB more than compensates."
12,d6,d7d6,rnbqk1nr/pp3pbp/3p2p1/2pP4/2P5/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,A good idea to prevent ...Bg4 when black will seek to trade bishop for knight for good prospects to control e5 and the dark squares.
13,h3,h2h3,rnbqk1nr/pp3pbp/3p2p1/2pP4/2P5/5N1P/PP3PP1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,A good idea to prevent ...Bg4 when black will seek to trade bishop for knight for good prospects to control e5 and the dark squares.
14,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqk2r/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/2P5/5N1P/PP3PP1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,"? I normally do not criticize developing moves like this one but here the knight is poorly placed. It limits the scope of the strong DSB. Plus in such positions this knight is more active on e7 than on f6 where it supports f7-f5-f4. Furthermore, it takes away the option of a bishop sac on c3 with good play by black on the queen side. The alternative 7. ...Ne7 or 7. ...Nd7 is better"
15,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqk2r/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/2P5/3B1N1P/PP3PP1/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 8,"A good square for the future superstar of white's army. However, the alternative 8. Qe2 Qe7 9. Nc3 Qxe2 10. Bxe2 is better for white because of his superior piece development"
16,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bqk2r/pp1n1pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/2P5/3B1N1P/PP3PP1/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 3 9,?? It is funny during the game I played this because it looked so natural but it shows that my head is not in the game.
17,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk2r/pp1n1pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/2P5/3B1N1P/PP3PP1/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 4 9,?? White looks to be on cruise control and perhaps that is why he did not take a second look.
18,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp1n1pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/2P5/3B1N1P/PP3PP1/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 5 10,Now the immediate danger for black on the e-file has past and he will go on to equalize quickly. The lesson here is if you have a kill shot take it. When you are searching for candidate moves always include a offbeat one. Play it out in your mind or over a board and explore less common lines.
19,Nc3,b1c3,r1bq1rk1/pp1n1pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/2P5/2NB1N1P/PP3PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 6 10,So what has been the story up until this point. I would say it has to be black's poorly placed knights. What is even more disheartening is that the knights are only dominating their own team! So I am already in danger of getting overrun so I had to play aggressive. Which is the reason for my next move.
20,a6,a7a6,r1bq1rk1/1p1n1pbp/p2p1np1/2pP4/2P5/2NB1N1P/PP3PP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 11,!? fighting for time and space. This almost forces white into playing 11. a4 which will buy me a small amount of time to play Re8 contesting the e-file. Why not 10. ...Re8 right way you say? Well if I can get away with ...a6 and ...b7-b5 then I am doing well. If I play 10. ...Re8 right away I may not ever have the chance to play it.
21,a4,a2a4,r1bq1rk1/1p1n1pbp/p2p1np1/2pP4/P1P5/2NB1N1P/1P3PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 11,"Black achieves semi-equality based on his greater control of the e-file and neutralized queen side. However, position cramping and the problematic LSB still linger. The control of the e-file becomes the main battle ground for this game."

Bf4(attacking d6) it is hard to see how black can avoid playing 15. ...Rxe1 giving up the control of e-file to white. ***Tip*** avoid early rook exchanges as this usually benefits the defender. Also in the middle game direct your pieces toward weak pawns. This has the effect of binding your opponent."
