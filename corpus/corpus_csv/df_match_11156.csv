1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I personally dislike this opening because I find it usually makes for a restrictive and cramped middle game, however, according to the GK database, it is slightly better than 1.e4"
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,my usual response to 1.d4
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 2,"a strong follow up, playing by the book, c4 is perhaps a little more common"
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"to prevent 3.d5 which would seriously hinder black from developing; this move also fights for the centre of the board.
A45:Queens Pawn Game"
5,h3,h2h3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/2N4P/PPP1PPP1/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"a break from convention, surely a little early to play this move"
6,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p1b2/3P4/2N4P/PPP1PPP1/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"playing short, this is a strong post for my bishop"
7,Nf3,g1f3,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p1b2/3P4/2N2N1P/PPP1PPP1/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,"i like to move my e pawn to unleash the f bishop; this also strengthens d4, freeing my knight from defensive duty if necessary"
8,e6,e7e6,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p1b2/3P4/2N2N1P/PPP1PPP1/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"i like to move my e pawn to unleash the f bishop; this also strengthens d4, freeing my knight from defensive duty if necessary"
9,a3,a2a3,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p1b2/3P4/P1N2N1P/1PP1PPP1/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"a little too early for this move too, white should be thinking of developing pieces or gaining some space or tempo"
10,c5,c7c5,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp1b2/3P4/P1N2N1P/1PP1PPP1/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,giving me a lot more space on the queenside and opening up the d8-a5 diagonal for my queen
11,Be3,c1e3,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp1b2/3P4/P1N1BN1P/1PP1PPP1/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"good move, applying pressure to c5 and forcing me to defend"
12,b6,b7b6,rn1qkb1r/p4ppp/1p2pn2/2pp1b2/3P4/P1N1BN1P/1PP1PPP1/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"i hate having to defend, I'm a very attack minded person.  This move blocks off b6 and a5 from my queen, slightly better is maybe Qc7"
13,Ne5,f3e5,rn1qkb1r/p4ppp/1p2pn2/2ppNb2/3P4/P1N1B2P/1PP1PPP1/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 7,"a good knight outpost, restricting my development, invading my space and difficult to drive off"
14,Bd6,f8d6,rn1qk2r/p4ppp/1p1bpn2/2ppNb2/3P4/P1N1B2P/1PP1PPP1/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 8,develops the bishop to a useful square and opens the way to castle
15,Nxf7,e5f7,rn1qk2r/p4Npp/1p1bpn2/2pp1b2/3P4/P1N1B2P/1PP1PPP1/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,"?? Whites first real mistake, sacrificing a strongly placed knight for no real gain.
The only advantage I can see from this move is it prevents black from castling.
If the knight had remained on e5 there would be no danger of a swap for the d6 bishop as this would have the following reprecussions for black:
a)black would lose a tempo after 9.dxe5, being forced to flee from f6
b)white would gain a two bishops advantage
c)the white pawn on e5 would be a big threat to black and difficult to get rid of.
white would be better to play something like 8.g4, allowing 9.Bg2  10.O-O, contesting control of the centre, developing another piece and gaining space and tempo"

19,Bg2,f1g2,rn1q3r/p4kpp/1p1bpnb1/2pp4/3P2P1/P1N1B2P/1PP1PPB1/R2QK2R b KQ - 2 10,"aims at the central white squares and at the a8 rook, also clears for castling"
20,Nc6,b8c6,r2q3r/p4kpp/1pnbpnb1/2pp4/3P2P1/P1N1B2P/1PP1PPB1/R2QK2R w KQ - 3 11,this knight hould have been developed long ago
21,Qd2,d1d2,r2q3r/p4kpp/1pnbpnb1/2pp4/3P2P1/P1N1B2P/1PPQPPB1/R3K2R b KQ - 4 11,"since the e2 and c2 pawns are blocked, this is whites only real opportunity to develop his queen and clear the path to castle queenside, which is better than kingside castling in the current position"
