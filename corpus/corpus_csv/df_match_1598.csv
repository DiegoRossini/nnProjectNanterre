1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Once upon a time there was a queen. She had an insatiable appetite! She couldn't resist taking pieces whenever she could. This is a warning to you dear reader, of how such behaviour can get you into trouble!"
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"This game was played in the ""England plays the English tournament"", where every game has to start 1. c2-c4. However we quickly transpose back into a mainline Queen Pawn opening."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,So I play d4
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,He transposes into the Queen's Gambit Declined. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Gambit_Declined)
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,And I play the most common continuation.
6,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"With possible transposition to the Cambridge Springs (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Gambit_Declined,_Cambridge_Springs_Defense) or the semi-slav (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-Slav_Defense)"
7,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3p4/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,I seize the centre.
8,dxe4,d5e4,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/8/2PPp3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,He takes.
9,Nxe4,c3e4,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/8/2PPN3/8/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,I recapture.
10,Bb4+,f8b4,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/8/1bPPN3/8/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,He throws in a check.
11,Bd2,c1d2,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/8/1bPPN3/8/PP1B1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 2 6,I block with my bishop.
12,Qxd4,d8d4,rnb1k1nr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/8/1bPqN3/8/PP1B1PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,"The greedy queen takes the first pawn! This is a well-known sacrifice by white. One of no less than four gambits named after the great attacking American player, Frank Marshall. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Gambit"
13,Bxb4,d2b4,rnb1k1nr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/8/1BPqN3/8/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 7,So i take the bishop.
14,Qxe4+,d4e4,rnb1k1nr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/8/1BP1q3/8/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 8,"He takes the knight, otherwise he is just a material down."
15,Be2,f1e2,rnb1k1nr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/8/1BP1q3/8/PP2BPPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 1 8,"This is the riskiest continuation, offering a pawn. It also sometimes leads to a fascinating variation, starting 8.....Nb8-a6, 9. Bf8?! and the bishop cannot be taken otherwise Qd8 mate!"
16,Qxg2,e4g2,rnb1k1nr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/8/1BP5/8/PP2BPqP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 0 9,But the greedy queen takes another pawn!
17,Qd6,d1d6,rnb1k1nr/pp3ppp/2pQp3/8/1BP5/8/PP2BPqP/R3K1NR b KQkq - 1 9,So I threaten a horrible check on f8.
18,Nd7,b8d7,r1b1k1nr/pp1n1ppp/2pQp3/8/1BP5/8/PP2BPqP/R3K1NR w KQkq - 2 10,And he defends
19,O-O-O,e1c1,r1b1k1nr/pp1n1ppp/2pQp3/8/1BP5/8/PP2BPqP/2KR2NR b kq - 3 10,"I get my king to safety. Now the greedy queen realises if she eats the rook on h1, then Bf3 will trap her, as the white queen protects h2. So she eats something else."
20,Qxf2,g2f2,r1b1k1nr/pp1n1ppp/2pQp3/8/1BP5/8/PP2Bq1P/2KR2NR w kq - 0 11,"So I block the queen's retreat. Believe it or not, this has all been seen before, and I reached this position with white having been following the opening databases on Gameknot. This position is roughly equal. Although white is 3 pawns down, it is hard for black to complete his development."
21,Bf3,e2f3,r1b1k1nr/pp1n1ppp/2pQp3/8/1BP5/5B2/PP3q1P/2KR2NR b kq - 1 11,"So I block the queen's retreat.
