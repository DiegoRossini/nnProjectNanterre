8,Bxf3,g4f3,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4P3/4P3/5b2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,Relatively best. Worse would have been 4... dxe5 5. Qxd8 Kxd8 Nxe5 where I would have gained a pawn and where Black King would have been stuck in the center.
9,Qxf3,d1f3,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4P3/4P3/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 5,Up to this point the game has followed the famous Morphy one. Here Black deviates from it with a worse move.

More natural would have been 6... Nf6, as in the above mentioned game, or 6... Qf6."
13,Qb3,f3b3,rn1qkbnr/ppp3pp/5p2/4p3/2B1P3/1Q6/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 1 7,"The final blunder, probably he hasn't seen the checkmate coming."
