1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is a game at the Dutch youth championship. I'm black and play against an opponent with a rating of 2080. My rating then was 1520 (Although it should be about 1800 I think). After the opening I'm standing worse, and start to play for a draw, at which I succeed in the end."

I've tried several things and at the time I played King Indian. I didn't really know much of the opening and I now play differently against d4 (Albin Counter gambit).
