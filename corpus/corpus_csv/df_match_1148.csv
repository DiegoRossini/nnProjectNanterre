1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Bishop opening
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Bishop opening
3,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,Bishop opening
4,Qf6,d8f6,rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/5q2/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 3,It is not wise to move with the queen into the open board so early in the game. Theory recommends 2... Nf6 and black equalize pretty soon.
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/5q2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,???? a huge mistake. black leaves the e5  pawn and loses the f7 pawn afterwards. 4... d6 with Bg4 later on was inquired.
6,Bc5,f8c5,rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/5q2/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,???? a huge mistake. black leaves the e5  pawn and loses the f7 pawn afterwards. 4... d6 with Bg4 later on was inquired.
7,O-O,e1g1,rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/5q2/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 5 4,???? a huge mistake. black leaves the e5  pawn and loses the f7 pawn afterwards. 4... d6 with Bg4 later on was inquired.
8,Qg6,f6g6,rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/6q1/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 6 5,???? a huge mistake. black leaves the e5  pawn and loses the f7 pawn afterwards. 4... d6 with Bg4 later on was inquired.
9,Nxe5,f3e5,rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/6q1/2b1N3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 5,obviously
10,Qg5,g6g5,rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1N1q1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 6,in this poor situation I think 5... Qb6 was a slight better.
11,Nxf7,e5f7,rnb1k1nr/pppp1Npp/8/2b3q1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 6,why? White takes the rook and the queen will still be threatened...
12,Qg6,g5g6,rnb1k1nr/pppp1Npp/6q1/2b5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 7,why? White takes the rook and the queen will still be threatened...
13,Nxh8,f7h8,rnb1k1nN/pppp2pp/6q1/2b5/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b q - 0 7,white is practically won. 8. Bxg8 works too.
14,Qg5,g6g5,rnb1k1nN/pppp2pp/8/2b3q1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w q - 1 8,white is practically won. 8. Bxg8 works too.

16,Qe7,g5e7,rnb1k1nN/ppppq1pp/8/2b5/2BPP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w q - 1 9,it's somehow amazing. black didn't develop any piece... at all...
