I will now tell you a little story about this game.  It is another OTB trip down memory lane. In 1997 I was the captain of the Cambridge City C Team, although with my low rating I played on either boards 4 of 4 or 3 of 4.  All I asked of my team was that they just do their best and make sure they show up!  That evening, a team-mate Romalt, our top board player was taken ill and so could not play.  That meant I had to play on board 2 against a player rated much higher than myself.  Somehow, though, I did not mind being the under-dog.  One of my other team-mates got a draw and our team came away with 1 point out of 4 which at first sounds pretty poor but allowing for the fact that we each had to play one board higher than normal and we were one player short I think we acquitted ourselves reasonably well.  At the time Ian Webster was the highest rated player I had drawn against in a rated game so I was really chuffed at the time.  I did surpass this effort a few months later in the Roger Goldsmith Trophy by drawing against a player with a rating of 1560 - and he ended up being on the defending side!"
