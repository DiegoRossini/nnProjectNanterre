Interesting note, I finished this game and my other match game against this same opponent within minutes of each other - I played my final move as white in that other game, then switched to this game and entered a series of conditional moves. By the time I was done, my opponent had resigned in the other game and logged out, so I went to bed and woke up find this game had concluded while I slept. I like winning while I sleep; I think it sends me pleasant dreams..."
