9,Nxf7,g5f7,r1bqk2r/pppp1Npp/2n2n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"The knight capture of the f7 pawn also forks the h8 rook and the queen, winning material in the process. However, time and development are of crucial importance while the material is not. This opening is double-edged, as white has the material while black has the position."

18,Qf8,e7f8,r1b1kq1N/ppp3pp/2n2n2/3Np3/2p1P3/8/PPPP1bPP/R1BQ1K1R w q - 2 10,"! I place my queen on the same file as the white king, which is covered by two of my pieces. If I have the time to remove these pieces, I would have a winning attack..."
