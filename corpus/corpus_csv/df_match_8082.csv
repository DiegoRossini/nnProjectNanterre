3,Qh5,d1h5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p2Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 1 2,Quite the taboo in my book.  Every game I have played that has begun this way ended with the same ultimate result as this one.  I believe this game illustrates the flaws in this opening.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p2Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 2 3,"This is a ""double down"" on the previous mistake."

6,g6,g7g6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1p1p/2n3p1/4p2Q/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 0 4,"OK, let's compound the mistake.  It is true that black responses after e5 have been forced, but there is actually nothing wrong with black's play.  The continued pressure on f7 will force either Qf6 of Nf6.  White compells black into a set defence, but what does white really get out of constantly shuffling the queen from square to square?  Nuntar believes that Qf3 is the critical mistake, but I still contend that a fianchettoed kingside bishop is no real disadvantage.  Sure f6 and h6 are no longer controlled by a pawn, but fianchettos survive in top-level play today."
7,Qf3,h5f3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1p1p/2n3p1/4p3/2B1P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 1 4,"OK, let's compound the mistake.

8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1p1p/2n2np1/4p3/2B1P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 2 5,"After either Nf6 or Qf7, black is better developed and has the ""first move advantage.""  At any rate the queen here blocks the f pawn.  Deployed back to d1, White can place pawns on d3 and f4, a knight on e2, and continue the attack.  The real problem is Black gains time at White's expense.  I think best is 5.d3 Na5."
9,Nh3,g1h3,r1bqkb1r/pppp1p1p/2n2np1/4p3/2B1P3/5Q1N/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 3 5,"I would say at this point that the opening advantage for white is gone.  Every time I check the variations I see, I run into the same problem: White needs more preparation, but that preparation also allows Black to respond to the threats presented.  Nuntar and I have debated on whether Qf3 or Qh5 was a 'mistake' per se, but White's Nh3 allows Black the tempo he needs to start dictating the flow of the game.  I think it debatable whether Ne2 here was best largely because the White queen is impeded from d1 and because I really believe the best White plan includes f4.

One White variation keeps calling to me though: 5.Qb3 Nd5 6.Bxf7+ Ke7.  The white attack is complicated by Black rather quickly.  Take a look at http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=8062818 -I provided a clickable link in the comments-- Qb3 is played."
10,Nd4,c6d4,r1bqkb1r/pppp1p1p/5np1/4p3/2BnP3/5Q1N/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 4 6,"I think Qd1 is better, but that admits that Qh5 was a mistake.  Qf3 was entirely consistent with play up until this point.  Given that Qf3 forced Nf6, White should strongly consider Qd1, d3, and f4.  The White e pawn will fall, but the open files on e and f seem to suit the aggressive style of play that White sought until now."

Such play tends to force the weaker side to sluff off material to avoid mate, and consequently, if the game does make it to endgame play, moves towards an endgame that favors the attacker."
