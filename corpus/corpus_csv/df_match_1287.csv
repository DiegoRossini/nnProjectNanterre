9,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,Grabbing f5.

14,Be7,f8e7,r2qk2r/pppnbppp/5n2/3p2B1/3P2b1/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 6 8,Lsb is fine here. In the future will come c5.
15,Qd2,d1d2,r2qk2r/pppnbppp/5n2/3p2B1/3P2b1/3B1N2/PPPQ1PPP/RN3RK1 b kq - 7 8,"That gave me an idea. I can take advantage of BxN inmediately, but maybe he is planning to take advantage of this column. Not so easy. I have another trick in my sleeve."
16,Ne4,f6e4,r2qk2r/pppnbppp/8/3p2B1/3Pn1b1/3B1N2/PPPQ1PPP/RN3RK1 w kq - 8 9,"BxN, dxB, and Ne5 is not possible due to NxN (d4 is pinned to the WQ)."
17,Bxe4,d3e4,r2qk2r/pppnbppp/8/3p2B1/3PB1b1/5N2/PPPQ1PPP/RN3RK1 b kq - 0 9,"White saw it, and counterattacks. To keep the previous threat, I should play NxB, but then, Re1 is very strong. If f5?, Qg5+"

20,Qxe7,d8e7,r3k2r/pppnqppp/8/8/3Pp1b1/5N2/PPPQ1PPP/RN3RK1 w kq - 0 11,Still not bad.
21,Ne5,f3e5,r3k2r/pppnqppp/8/4N3/3Pp1b1/8/PPPQ1PPP/RN3RK1 b kq - 1 11,Ng5 looks bad after f5 (now possible) or h6. True white still has Re1.
22,Nxe5,d7e5,r3k2r/ppp1qppp/8/4n3/3Pp1b1/8/PPPQ1PPP/RN3RK1 w kq - 0 12,I'll take the pawn.
23,Qf4,d2f4,r3k2r/ppp1qppp/8/4n3/3PpQb1/8/PPP2PPP/RN3RK1 b kq - 1 12,"Interesting! White is winning back his piece with subtleties. Here, Nf3+, gxN, Bxc3 assures black a strong bind on the white king. g5 is not enough against Qg3, and nothing changes. Be2, Re1 just helps my opponent, so..."
24,f5,f7f5,r3k2r/ppp1q1pp/8/4np2/3PpQb1/8/PPP2PPP/RN3RK1 w kq - 0 13,"QxN was advisable, but black will have a better position."

26,g5,g7g5,r3k2r/ppp1q2p/8/4Ppp1/4pQb1/8/PPP2PPP/RN3RK1 w kq - 0 14,Infantry attack. It must get something!
27,Qd2,f4d2,r3k2r/ppp1q2p/8/4Ppp1/4p1b1/8/PPPQ1PPP/RN3RK1 b kq - 1 14,"I can take the pawn, but... I still can, later."
28,f4,f5f4,r3k2r/ppp1q2p/8/4P1p1/4ppb1/8/PPPQ1PPP/RN3RK1 w kq - 0 15,Probably I must have played Rd8 at once.
