1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,I like Nf3 because it is very flexible.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 2,Black maintains flexibility also
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,Usually it's good to place at least 1 pawn in the center during the opening.
4,b6,b7b6,rnbqkb1r/p1pppppp/1p3n2/8/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,I thought countering Black's fianchetto was the best option
5,g3,g2g3,rnbqkb1r/p1pppppp/1p3n2/8/2P5/5NP1/PP1PPP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,I thought countering Black's fianchetto was the best option
6,Ba6,c8a6,rn1qkb1r/p1pppppp/bp3n2/8/2P5/5NP1/PP1PPP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,"Black doesn't fianchetto, and instead attacks my c-pawn. I thought d3 was too committal here since I might want to play d4 later. b3 is better since at least it prepares Bb2."
7,b3,b2b3,rn1qkb1r/p1pppppp/bp3n2/8/2P5/1P3NP1/P2PPP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,I think d5 is better than wasting a tempo
8,e6,e7e6,rn1qkb1r/p1pp1ppp/bp2pn2/8/2P5/1P3NP1/P2PPP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,I think d5 is better than wasting a tempo
9,Bg2,f1g2,rn1qkb1r/p1pp1ppp/bp2pn2/8/2P5/1P3NP1/P2PPPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,I think d5 is better than wasting a tempo
10,Bb7,a6b7,rn1qkb1r/pbpp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2P5/1P3NP1/P2PPPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 6,I think d5 is better than wasting a tempo
11,d4,d2d4,rn1qkb1r/pbpp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2PP4/1P3NP1/P3PPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"This probably wasn't the strongest move, castling or Bb2 were probably better options."
12,Bb4+,f8b4,rn1qk2r/pbpp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/1bPP4/1P3NP1/P3PPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 7,"blunder, I missed Black's tactic and now I lose a pawn. I should've played Bd2"
13,Nbd2,b1d2,rn1qk2r/pbpp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/1bPP4/1P3NP1/P2NPPBP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 7,"blunder, I missed Black's tactic and now I lose a pawn. I should've played Bd2"
14,Bc3,b4c3,rn1qk2r/pbpp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2PP4/1Pb2NP1/P2NPPBP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 3 8,This is why I should've fianchettoed my bishop instead of playing the dubious d4.
15,Rb1,a1b1,rn1qk2r/pbpp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2PP4/1Pb2NP1/P2NPPBP/1RBQK2R b Kkq - 4 8,"My position isn't losing yet, since I'm only down a pawn, and I might have some compensation since I gain tempo chasing Black's bishop."
16,Bxd4,c3d4,rn1qk2r/pbpp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2Pb4/1P3NP1/P2NPPBP/1RBQK2R w Kkq - 0 9,"My position isn't losing yet, since I'm only down a pawn, and I might have some compensation since I gain tempo chasing Black's bishop."
17,O-O,e1g1,rn1qk2r/pbpp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2Pb4/1P3NP1/P2NPPBP/1RBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 9,This relieves the pressure on the diagonal while threatening the bishop
18,Bc5,d4c5,rn1qk2r/pbpp1ppp/1p2pn2/2b5/2P5/1P3NP1/P2NPPBP/1RBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 10,"I am slightly ahead in development, and after Qc2 I am directing pressure toward the kingside, but Black should be able to secure his pawn advantage and figure out a way to trade off into a winning endgame later."

Black cannot stop the double-threat of Ne7, which either takes the bishop or discovery checks the queen."
