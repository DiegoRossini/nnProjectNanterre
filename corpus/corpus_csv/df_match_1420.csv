1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Here is a refreshing reminder never to give up.  Or if you prefer, the stupid loss of a pawn is never the end of the game."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I have bee experimenting with the Center Counter (Scandinavian) Defense as an alternative to the French Defense and other fairly rock-ribbed defenses.  Especially when its reputation seems to be a bit suspect, both for the early forced arrival of the black queen to the center, and also for the easy development for white that buys time to build a strong position.  And yet, it does not die, making me think that if grandmasters play it, then I can certainly try it."

From my research, it appeared there were many instances of this very sequence in grandmaster practice.  Does an early queen trade presage an early draw?  In those games and in this, there is little opportunity for a draw.  I also considered 4...Qh5 5. Be2 Nc6 6. O-O  0-0-0  7. d3  Nf6 8. h3 Bd7 9. Bf4 Qf5 10. Bg3 g5 11. a4 h5 12. h4 gxh4 13. Nxh4 Qh7 from Westphal-Kiel, Landesliga Ost in 2002.  Kiel won this game, but only after some serious torture in the middle-game.  Still other options at black's fourth move include 4....Qa5, 4...Qd6, and 4...Qd8."
