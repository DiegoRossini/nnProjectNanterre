1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is the first notable move, avoiding all the Sicilian main lines, this is called the Chekhover Variation. I really didn't think this was good for white, and it probably wasn't, but my inaccurate moves probably cost me the game."

8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/8/3QP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"Initially, I've thought that this was my first mistake, but in actuality, I think it was my next move that was the mistake. I think that had I played 4... a6 before developing my knight to c6, my game would have been better, as in the next move I could attack the queen and gain some time to develop my other pieces."
9,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/1B6/3QP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 2 5,"That's fine, he's just protecting his queen."
10,a6,a7a6,r1bqkbnr/1p2pppp/p1np4/1B6/3QP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 6,"Here's where I think I go wrong. Yes, I'm forcing him to trade of his light squared bishop for a knight in an open game, but I am hindering my development far too much and this could have been what cost me the game."
11,Bxc6+,b5c6,r1bqkbnr/1p2pppp/p1Bp4/8/3QP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 6,White: Two developed pieces and controlling the center. Black: 0 developed pieces and cramped. Guess who will win.

13,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/4pppp/p1pp4/8/3QP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 1 7,Further increasing his development lead. I don't like my game too much at this point. His developed pieces and central control look overwhelming.
14,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/4pppp/p1pp1n2/8/3QP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 2 8,"Trying to get back into the game, but it seems to have been too late."
15,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqkb1r/4pppp/p1pp1n2/6B1/3QP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 3 8,"Trying to make him play some defensive moves in order to get my development going, but this might have been another mistake as well."

17,e5,e4e5,1rbqkb1r/4pppp/p1pp1n2/4P1B1/3Q4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQk - 0 9,"Great. I can't take the pawn because I'd just end up with a queen less game with my king stuck in the center and 1 minor piece developed vs 3 minor pieces developed, a castled king, and two active rooks."
18,Ng8,f6g8,1rbqkbnr/4pppp/p1pp4/4P1B1/3Q4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQk - 1 10,"So I retreat, and now I have zero minor pieces developed, my rook is kind of active but my development is so far behind that it doesn't matter. He has developed all his minor pieces plus the queen, and he can now castle either side if he wants."
19,O-O-O,e1c1,1rbqkbnr/4pppp/p1pp4/4P1B1/3Q4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/2KR3R b k - 2 10,"He castles queenside, now his king is safe, his rook has been activated and I have 0 minor pieces developed, and the rook barely counts as a developed piece as it's not doing enough to allow me some time to develop my other pieces."
20,Qc7,d8c7,1rb1kbnr/2q1pppp/p1pp4/4P1B1/3Q4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/2KR3R w k - 3 11,"I thought about Qb6 for a while here, offering my queen so that whatever attack was coming could be softened, but I realized that I would have been left with a completely undeveloped kingside which would probably take too long to develop. The same thing happened anyway, only with the Queens still on the board."
21,Rhe1,h1e1,1rb1kbnr/2q1pppp/p1pp4/4P1B1/3Q4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/2KRR3 b k - 4 11,Every one of his pieces is working towards the same goal. Central control and destroying my king. I was left with very few move options after this.
22,dxe5,d6e5,1rb1kbnr/2q1pppp/p1p5/4p1B1/3Q4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/2KRR3 w k - 0 12,"I was hoping for this. At least I will be up in material, even though I am far behind in development."

27,Nd6+,c4d6,1rb1kbnr/2q1p1pp/p1pN4/6p1/3Q4/2N5/PPP2PPP/2KRR3 b k - 1 14,Ouch. I can't take with the queen because he'd just win my queen for a knight and a bishop and my king would still be stuck in the center and very much in danger.
28,Kd8,e8d8,1rbk1bnr/2q1p1pp/p1pN4/6p1/3Q4/2N5/PPP2PPP/2KRR3 w - - 2 15,I decide to give him my rook if he wants it.
29,Nf7+,d6f7,1rbk1bnr/2q1pNpp/p1p5/6p1/3Q4/2N5/PPP2PPP/2KRR3 b - - 3 15,He does.
30,Ke8,d8e8,1rb1kbnr/2q1pNpp/p1p5/6p1/3Q4/2N5/PPP2PPP/2KRR3 w - - 4 16,Still trying to develop. This is move 17!!!! I haven't developed two minor pieces yet.
31,Nxh8,f7h8,1rb1kbnN/2q1p1pp/p1p5/6p1/3Q4/2N5/PPP2PPP/2KRR3 b - - 0 16,Still trying to develop. This is move 17!!!! I haven't developed two minor pieces yet.

33,Qd3,d4d3,1rb1kb1N/2q1p1pp/p1p2n2/6p1/8/2NQ4/PPP2PPP/2KRR3 b - - 2 17,"Trying to give his h8 knight an escape route. If my pieces stay the same and he goes Ng6 and I capture, I'd get mated in the next move."
