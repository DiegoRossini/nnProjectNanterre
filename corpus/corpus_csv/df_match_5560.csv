5,b3,b2b3,rnbqkbnr/pp1pppp1/7p/2p5/4P3/1P3N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,taking control of the long dark square diagonal as black has given me free rain to do so.

12,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp3pp1/2nppn1p/2p5/2B1P3/1PN2N2/PBPP1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 7,White now has an issue where is the light square bishop to go? Bb5 a6 Bxc6 only makes blacks center stronger.  Bd3 is silly and can be laughed at. As white really needs to play d4 soon.  d4 d5! exd5 exd5 Bd3?! (Be2 is now forced and black still has gained a lot of space) cxd4 looks good for black.  Be2 only serves to block the soon opening e-file. Wouldn't it be great if the Bishop could come to f1 and the Rook be on the open e-file after d4?  What is this you say it can lets see.
13,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkb1r/pp3pp1/2nppn1p/2p5/2B1P3/1PN2N2/PBPP1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 3 7,opening up f1 for the bishop.

19,Bf1,c4f1,r1bqk2r/pp2bpp1/2n2n1p/2pp4/8/1PN2N2/PBPP1PPP/R2QRBK1 b kq - 3 10,d4 was a decent way to attempt to challenge this plan.  But black lets me off easy this time. d4 Ne4 Nxe4 Rxe4 Bf5 giving black has nice space gain.

22,Be6,c8e6,r2q1rk1/pp2bpp1/2n1bn1p/2pp4/3P4/1PN2N2/PBP2PPP/R2QRBK1 w - - 1 12,Too passive g4 would bee a good plan for the bishop.
23,Ne2,c3e2,r2q1rk1/pp2bpp1/2n1bn1p/2pp4/3P4/1P3N2/PBP1NPPP/R2QRBK1 b - - 2 12,Planing on putting the knight on d4.

29,Nxd4,f3d4,r2q1rk1/pp3ppn/4b2p/2bp4/3N4/1P6/PBP2PPP/R2QRBK1 b - - 0 15,Better is Qd6

34,a6,a7a6,r4rk1/1p3ppn/p2qb2p/1Bbp4/3N4/1P6/PBP1QPPP/R3R1K1 w - - 0 18,Black would seem to be trading down queens here?  Via Qe3 or Qe5.  However white can finally win his pawn and gain an attack.  Though this also allows black to become dangerous.  I choose chaos.
35,Bd3,b5d3,r4rk1/1p3ppn/p2qb2p/2bp4/3N4/1P1B4/PBP1QPPP/R3R1K1 b - - 1 18,Black would seem to be trading down queens here?  Via Qe3 or Qe5.  However white can finally win his pawn and gain an attack.  Though this also allows black to become dangerous.  I choose chaos.

37,Nxe6,d4e6,r4rk1/1p3ppn/p3N2p/2bp4/5q2/1P1B4/PBP1QPPP/R3R1K1 b - - 0 19,!?
38,fxe6,f7e6,r4rk1/1p4pn/p3p2p/2bp4/5q2/1P1B4/PBP1QPPP/R3R1K1 w - - 0 20,black can trade down now with Qf7 but it will leave black down a pawn and with an isolated pawn.  Kh8 is out because of the game ending Qg6 and there is no way to defend mate on g7 and h7.
39,Qxe6+,e2e6,r4rk1/1p4pn/p3Q2p/2bp4/5q2/1P1B4/PBP2PPP/R3R1K1 b - - 0 20,black can trade down now with Qf7 but it will leave black down a pawn and with an isolated pawn.  Kh8 is out because of the game ending Qg6 and there is no way to defend mate on g7 and h7.
40,Rf7,f8f7,r5k1/1p3rpn/p3Q2p/2bp4/5q2/1P1B4/PBP2PPP/R3R1K1 w - - 1 21,Seems to be the only move. White has slowed down blacks attack but now what Rf1 doesn't seem to defend the f2 pawn...  Bg6 would be a an option.  Though trading my active bishop for a passive rook on a8 doesn't seem to be that good to me.  Besides it can stay in the cards.  Qg6 is also an option threating Qxh7+ Kf8 Qh8 mate but black simply plays Ng5 and brings another piece into the game for attack and defense.
41,Re2,e1e2,r5k1/1p3rpn/p3Q2p/2bp4/5q2/1P1B4/PBP1RPPP/R5K1 b - - 2 21,Expecting Bxf2+ making black expend a tempo to take the pawn.
