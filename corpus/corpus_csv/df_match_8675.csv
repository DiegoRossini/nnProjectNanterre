But now what? The plan is: 1 not to leave him castle. 2. Take advantage of the d column with the rook after exchanges and if he Rxb5, Ne4. In some variants, it threats both the bishop (after re-taking the N in F6) and the rook. But it doesn't work. 
So what?
So I choosed to solidifying my pawns and take advantage of them. Too bad he will castle."

19. Rad1... defends c3, because if Bxc3, Be5 and black loses the bishop since he has to defend his queen.
19. Rc1... defends c3, but allows the black queen to reach b5 and a6. I won't die because of that, but I'd like to ""squeeze"" him the most. So I considered
19. a4... the queen can go to c6, allowing him some freedom, and leaves c3.
19. Ne5. Prevents the black queen to go to c6, and BxN favours me, in theory. It's ok, apparently. But he has Nf5, to which I should play Rd1. This is the reason 19. Nd4 is slightly inferior. But Ne5 allows Qb5. Let's look for surprising and not natural moves: 
19, g4... prevents Nf5. But, again, loses c3.
19. Ng5... because if black f5, Dxe6. But again, it loses c3 without compensation. 

So, this is a very complicated position for me. I cannot say I did know how to manage it correctly, I had to play ""blind""."
