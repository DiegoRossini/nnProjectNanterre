The idea of King's Indian is to battle for the initiative right from the start and not just reacting to the opponents threats. You can come out on top if white gets lured by over-extending and also launching a counter-attack is blacks idea. It is not a big surprise that dynamic player like Kasparov used this opening during his career."

9,f3,f2f3,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2P2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"So white decided to go for S채misch variation. This is true King of the hill variation as for example: Tal, Spassky, Karpov, Kasparov, Kramnik, have all played the S채misch and they all are World Champions. So the idea of 5.f3 is to defend e4 securing stable centre and due this white can attack on kingside, lets say: Be3, Qd2, Bh6, g2-g4, h2-h4, can be used to carry out this plan. White can also attack on the queenside so S채misch can be called as a flexible variation. Also, Be3 can be played without worrying about ...Ng4. Well, okay, everyone can agree that knight on g1 seems to be on wrong square at the moment so S채misch has drawbacks and kingside development is rather clumsy."
10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2P2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR w KQ - 1 6,This has recently popped out again and it seems to be just change of move order. The knight on g1 wants to get out anyway and white usually just plays Be3 or Bg5 transposing into the main lines.

12,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bq1rk1/pppnppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2P2/PP2N1PP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 3 7,"This is one of the moves which I personally prefer. Lets say 6...Nc6 7.Bg5 and 6...e5 Bg5 have been slightly in White's favour. Books give 6...c5 as a reliable reply here and mention 6...a6!?(which I don't fully understand why) stated as flexible move. I would say the flexible one is to play 6...Nbd7 as white is going to show next is he going to play Bg5 or Be3. When 6...a6!? doesn't seem to have any very good reason to be played but after 6...Nbd7 you can't play knight to c6(then again, white can't drive it away with d5)."
13,Be3,c1e3,r1bq1rk1/pppnppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N1BP2/PP2N1PP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 4 7,So white decides to go for 7.Be3. Bg5 ideas were not considered very much in the past until it was found out that Be3 doesn't really do anything to prevent c7-c5. By playing Bg5 white plays bishop on more active square and black plays h7-h6 in some variations to drive it away. We would need to go deeper in King's Indian and go through many variations to show the differences between these two so lets continue with the game. 7.Be3 protects d4 whereas in Bg5 lines white may lack that protection of d4.
14,c5,c7c5,r1bq1rk1/pp1nppbp/3p1np1/2p5/2PPP3/2N1BP2/PP2N1PP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 8,"In King's Indian, black plays e7-e5 or c7-c5 at some point if dream of counterplay shall be taken as possibility(that is what you want to do and not to just stay still while hoping for miracles)."

16,Qa5,d8a5,r1b2rk1/pp1nppbp/3p1np1/q1p5/2PPP3/2N1BP2/PP1QN1PP/R3KB1R w KQ - 2 9,This is rare move here. It was in my head that 8...a6?! is possible and played here but then again why I would go for a move which I don't understand. What is exactly ...a6?! doing in this position as it seems to be waiting move only. If black is going to play ...b5 then it will be played anyway without preparing the move ...a6?!. So I was just thinking that I move Queen here as white surely doesn't want to castle queenside and meet the move ...b5 with a strong attack. If white tries to get hold on the kingside then Queen can jump there in some variations by doing knight maneuver to e6 aswell so that Queen won't be caught there.

White could have just played 9.dxc5 or 9.Nc1 which have been played earlier or maybe even interesting idea g2-g4, Bg7, 0-0, and surely black wont be the one attacking. Examples:

Even that taking the knight on b6 with a bishop seems like something you wouldn't like as it opens a-file."
