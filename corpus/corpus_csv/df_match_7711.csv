2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Not the best move for Black, because..."
3,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3P4/8/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"It forces the queen out too early, allows me to chase her around a bit and gives me a lead in development (I'd like to thank nuntar for pointing this out in an earlier annotation :) )"
4,Qxd5,d8d5,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"It forces the queen out too early, allows me to chase her around a bit and gives me a lead in development (I'd like to thank nuntar for pointing this out in an earlier annotation :) )"

6,Qc6,d5c6,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/2q5/8/8/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"i guess Black doesn't want a move wasted, so he keeps the Queen in play. However, it could lead to more wasted moves should I put pressure on it."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/2q5/8/8/2N2N2/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 4,"normally, I would play 4.g3, but that would sacrifice my rook for nothing"
8,Bg4,c8g4,rn2kbnr/ppp1pppp/2q5/8/6b1/2N2N2/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 4 5,threatening to double my pawns on the f file
9,e4,e2e4,rn2kbnr/ppp1pppp/2q5/8/4P1b1/2N2N2/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"I played this with the hope of not doubling my pawns, but I had just voluntarily pinned my knight"
10,Bxf3,g4f3,rn2kbnr/ppp1pppp/2q5/8/4P3/2N2b2/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Black's exchange saves me from this pin, thankfully"
11,Qxf3,d1f3,rn2kbnr/ppp1pppp/2q5/8/4P3/2N2Q2/PP1P1PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"instead of developing, Black seeks an exchange"

13,e5,e4e5,rn2kbnr/ppp1pppp/5q2/4P3/8/2N2Q2/PP1P1PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"This did mean losing my e-pawn, but I was planning to launch an attack on b7. Also, after 7... Qxe5 8.Bf2, I could simply get rid of the pin by castling"
14,Qxf3,f6f3,rn2kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/4P3/8/2N2q2/PP1P1PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 0 8,"?! Black trades off Queens, to double up my pawns on the f-file"

17,Bh3,f1h3,rn2kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/4P3/8/2N2P1B/PP1P1P1P/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 1 9,"I'm not sure why I did this either... it does put pressure on the d7 square, so I guess that's it, but it also covers the e6 square, which works out for me later"
18,e6,e7e6,rn2kbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/4P3/8/2N2P1B/PP1P1P1P/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 0 10,blocks my bishop
