7,d3,d2d3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/3p3p/4p3/2B1P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,"The computer analysis prefers 4. d4.  I wanted to avoid an early fight over d4.  A line like 4. d4 exd4 5. Nxd4 is probably fine for White, who maintains two centrally-developed pieces to Black's none.  In general, I would venture that when your opponent wastes a tempo you should be more willing than usual to seek out an open game to exploit the waste of time."

Neither player looks to have a particularly well-placed dsb, although Black's might be easier to free as it is his own men causing the problem, whereas White's is constrained by the Black pawns.  An alternative development plan for White could have involved Nbd2, b3 and Bb2, preparing d4 and a slightly better coordinated position in exchange for an uncastled king (although it's unpressured)"

Bh5 looks like a good option to maintain the pin and the tension since White can't really follow it with g4 without a horrible weakening of the kingside pawn cover and will struggle to protect the knight with something other than the g-pawn.
16,Bxf3,g4f3,r2qk2r/ppp1bpp1/2np1n1p/4p3/2B1P3/2NPBb1P/PPP2PP1/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 9,Black trades his lsb off for a White knight rather than give up his advanced bishop.  8. ...

Bxf7 is a tempting but probably unsound sacrificial attack that leaves the Black king in the centre (this would be even more tempting in the more open game starting from 4. d4 discussed earlier).  Bd5 looks best, continuing Nxd4 11. Nxd5, and if Black plays 11. ... c6 to push the knight back, 12. Nc3 is fine and Black must spot the threat of b4 on his knight or lose it, although if he does spot it, 12. ... b5 looks reasonably good for Black.  10. b4 just doesn't do very much.  If White is resigned to losing the bishop on its current square, b3 might be better, allowing White to recapture with the b-pawn and keep the d-pawn for opening up the central files."

Allows White to play Qg4, which attacks both the Black queen and knight, and allows an eventual material edge for White, who finishes the sequence (15. Qg4 Qxg4 16. fxg4 Ng3 17. Nxe7 Nxf1 18. Rxf1) with a small advantage."
