1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"c5 or e5 is played the most. c4 is the first move of the english opening. If someone donot know it, can symmetrical play for 3-5 moves."
2,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"c5 or e5 is played the most. c4 is the first move of the english opening. If someone donot know it, can symmetrical play for 3-5 moves."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"white moves his pieces to the centre, black wants to control it. So blacks' position will be passive for awhile, but with a c5 or e5 later can open the position."
4,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"the best place for the bishop by g6. g6 has its' problem. White can play later an h4-h5, if blacks' position not good enough."
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 3,white plays for developing. First the knights and then the bishops.
