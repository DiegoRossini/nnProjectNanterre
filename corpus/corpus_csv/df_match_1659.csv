2,f6,f7f6,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/5p2/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,Continuing toward my Queen's Gambit move order.

4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1p1pp/5p2/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"And we're there!  The move f6 seems out of place here, since it prevents black from bringing a knight out to defend the d5 pawn."
5,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1p1pp/5p2/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"And we're there!  The move f6 seems out of place here, since it prevents black from bringing a knight out to defend the d5 pawn."
6,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/5p2/3pp3/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Capturing on e5 would solve Black's development problems.  Capturing on d5 seems to win a pawn, but allows Black to develop the dark square bishop with tempo."

8,e4,e5e4,rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/5p2/3p4/2PPp3/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"I missed this reply, though.  Black disrupts my pieces and the f6 pawn protects e5.  However, I think I can still bring the night to d2 and then fianchetto.  The advanced pawn should be weak once I complete my development."

14,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp4pp/2n2p2/3p4/3Pp3/1NN5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 8,"Now I can play e3 and bring the knight to b5, putting pressure on Black's weak c7 square."
