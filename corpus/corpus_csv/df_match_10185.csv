1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is a terrible, inactive location for the Bishop. It blocks the d-pawn from advancing. d7-d6 would have been a reasonable way to protect the e-pawn because it is better to use pawns to protect pawns. If after 4... d6 5.Bxc6, then 5... bxc6 and White has given up the Bishop pair, and Black has good positional compensation with more pawns centrally located even thought the c-pawns would be stacked. It's a reasonable Ruy Lopez, exchange variation, opening.
Also, because White has protected his e-pawn with his d-pawn, Black, in using his Bishop to protect his e-pawn makes it much more difficult for him to deal with the pin that's created when White plays Bg5, and in this game, White exploits that weakness immediately."

After castling, if Black plays 6... h6, then 7.Bh4 g5 8.Nxg5 hxg5 9.Bxg5 with a good game for White because of the retained pin on the Knight and the exposed Black King.
