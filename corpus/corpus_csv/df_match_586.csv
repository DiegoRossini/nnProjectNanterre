10,Qe7,d8e7,rn2kb1r/ppp1qppp/4bn2/8/8/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,You're right: black will have a hard time freeing his dsb and defending from the aligning of the R on e1. I bet I can manage it in a blitz.
11,Be2,f1e2,rn2kb1r/ppp1qppp/4bn2/8/8/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 6,Good.
12,Bc4,e6c4,rn2kb1r/ppp1qppp/5n2/8/2b5/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 4 7,"? This is a little tricky: the Wlsb is pinned, so I can do this. But this is pointless, as you'll see. Bg4 is no better after o-o. It is a mistake due to the easy d3 answer by white, that makes me lose tempos in developement. My opponent didn't play it, and it was not a bad choice."
13,O-O,e1g1,rn2kb1r/ppp1qppp/5n2/8/2b5/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 5 7,"Of course. Now white threats BxB and Re1. I can retreat my B to e6, but this will be a two tempoes loss. No way. I have just few possible lines here. The point is that white didn't weakened himself with central pawn's moves, and this is the best for him in this situation."
14,Bxe2,c4e2,rn2kb1r/ppp1qppp/5n2/8/8/2N2N2/PPPPbPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,"If QxB, QxQ and everything is quiet."

16,Nbd7,b8d7,r3kb1r/pppnqppp/5n2/8/8/5N2/PPPPNPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 1 9,"From the beginning, my plan is to castle queenside and use the d column."
17,Nf4,e2f4,r3kb1r/pppnqppp/5n2/8/5N2/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 2 9,"None of my N can defend me from Re1, but this is the tempo I need to unpin the Q."
18,O-O-O,e8c8,2kr1b1r/pppnqppp/5n2/8/5N2/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 3 10,"Ng5 would be good, but QxNf4 is threatened."
19,Re1,f1e1,2kr1b1r/pppnqppp/5n2/8/5N2/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - - 4 10,"Ng5 would be good, but QxNf4 is threatened."
20,Qb4,e7b4,2kr1b1r/pppn1ppp/5n2/8/1q3N2/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 5 11,"Ng5 would be good, but QxNf4 is threatened."
21,Nd3,f4d3,2kr1b1r/pppn1ppp/5n2/8/1q6/3N1N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - - 6 11,"? Much better was d3, defending the N while developing. This move makes an unusual white's formation, joined with the extreme lack of a pawn's structure... leads to unexplored boundaries. Where to move the Q? I want to free my dsb, so out of his diagonal (f8-a3). I want to use white's weakness of f2: true is that it is defended twice now, but in the near future Nd3 must move, and if one of my N can reach e4 or g4... b6 seems a good place for this."
22,Qb6,b4b6,2kr1b1r/pppn1ppp/1q3n2/8/8/3N1N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 7 12,"It blocks the natural square for the black N on d7. But I am not forced to play it there. On this spot - note - my Q can't be one-move harassed by the White Knights. Now: which point is weak in my field, and why and how can white exploit it?"
23,b3,b2b3,2kr1b1r/pppn1ppp/1q3n2/8/8/1P1N1N2/P1PP1PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - - 0 12,"Oh, not at all. The idea to possess the diagonal and develop the B via b2 is good. But makes this the Nd3 safe and sure? Not at all..."
24,Nc5,d7c5,2kr1b1r/ppp2ppp/1q3n2/2n5/8/1P1N1N2/P1PP1PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 1 13,"Ok, the point is that forces white to react: black can play NxN now, and rxe3, winning a pawn. If white uses the tempo to play 13. Bg2, black can consider the previous line, winning a pawn, or RxNe3 (threats Qxf2+,so is practically forced) 14. cxe3, Nxe3, threatening to win back the exchange or NxBg2. The only reasonable way for white to get out of this is 15. BxNf6, NxRe1, 16. QxNe1, gxBf6. Black has scrambled pawns but a nice semi-open g column to play with, and the dsb. Not bad. I'll check this with the board later. On the other side, white's NxN allows Bxc5, threatening f2, stopping d4, and solving my dev problem. Not bad!"
25,Nde5,d3e5,2kr1b1r/ppp2ppp/1q3n2/2n1N3/8/1P3N2/P1PP1PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - - 2 13,"An alternate solution, that incidentally presses on my own weak spot, f7, with a fork. That will win an exchange. But my pressure on f2 is stronger. I must go on."
26,Nce4,c5e4,2kr1b1r/ppp2ppp/1q3n2/4N3/4n3/1P3N2/P1PP1PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 3 14,"If NxN, NxN and the threat remains the same. White can defend with Qe2, and MUST do it or... find black's next move if white plays (say) h3."
27,d4,d2d4,2kr1b1r/ppp2ppp/1q3n2/4N3/3Pn3/1P3N2/P1P2PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - - 0 14,"Well, white escaped Nc3! by black. Being d2 pinned, white would have lost his Q for N and R. Now, I sill can't take the pawn, but I can play Nc3, Q moves, Bb4, defending it. But then a3... no, I have to create complications... and free my last pieces. I already accepted Nxf7, and the exchange loss, so I have to make the most of my playing forces."
28,Bb4,f8b4,2kr3r/ppp2ppp/1q3n2/4N3/1b1Pn3/1P3N2/P1P2PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 1 15,"It is not good: Bd2 helps white's developement. But if Bd2, Nc3. And the Q is trapped, forcing to BxN, BxBc3, which forks both white's Rooks. This ""returns"" the fork white will play, Nxf7... and the crossed exchanges will go on. Crazy. Of course: If Be2, black can also think in Rxd4!?, with the following idea: NxR, QxN (Qxf2 is threatened). But white has Be3. So, I think that black will lose this, if white plays properly. But white didn'!"
29,Nxf7,e5f7,2kr3r/ppp2Npp/1q3n2/8/1b1Pn3/1P3N2/P1P2PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - - 0 15,"White goes for the exchanges. Now, this is a nice tactic mel√©e, as often. I don't use engines, so to work out the best move would take me too long. Nc3, Qd2, Nd5, Q moves gives me an exchange, but white has his own in return."
30,Bxe1,b4e1,2kr3r/ppp2Npp/1q3n2/8/3Pn3/1P3N2/P1P2PPP/R1BQb1K1 w - - 0 16,"This move forces white to retake the B and not one of the Rooks, because of Bxf2+. Black can play (and should) have played Be3, stopping once for all all black's threats and his fork is still active."
31,Nxh8,f7h8,2kr3N/ppp3pp/1q3n2/8/3Pn3/1P3N2/P1P2PPP/R1BQb1K1 b - - 0 16,?? The bad Rook. My other R is the dangerous one!
