7,Nxd4,f3d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,Attacking as yet undefended e4 pawn.

10,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3ppn2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"No more helpful hints from the Game DB. Now I have to start thinking. a2 is protected by knight. Black is probably looking to advance b pawn to try and open up the king's defence. Black is massively aggressive as I have found to my previous detriment, and is demonstrated by the early attack of queen before all minor pieces are developed. B4 is a key square defensively for white. Bishop to take b5 could have some merit, but opens up the a file for black. Black is yet to castle. Force queen to retreat with knight to b3. Still room for play in the centre and king side."
