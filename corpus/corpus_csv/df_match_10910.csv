1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,and do not underestimate the power of paying attention! many opening collapses are a result of subtle tactics.
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"here we get a position like the queen's gambit , but with the critical missing pawns on e3 and c6. therefore: Do Not Play Like Queen's Gambit!"

8,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3p1b2/2PP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"a strong square for the bishop ... ? 

notice his kingside is underdeveloped, so he will be slow castling. and notice that his queenside, especially the a4-e8 diagonal, is wide open via the missing c6 pawn."
9,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3p1b2/2PP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 5,white gets to keep the knight.
10,Nf6,g8f6,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p1b2/2PP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 3 6,"i paused a moment here wondering about this. you may see nothing immediately wrong with e6, and i didn't, but something didn't seem right about it. perhaps it was the fact that the bishop is now blocked on one side of the pawn chain, i wasn't sure.
anyway, no point attacking the bishop yet (which may be to his advantage). but you can see it could get trapped . 

i also realised here that if white was careless, he could fall quickly to a knight fork on c2. hense the following move."

13,Qb3,d1b3,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/3p1b2/2PP4/1QN2N2/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 1 7,"i saw this in another game, and i liked the idea. it attacks d5 and b7, while stopping the pin Bb4, and xrays f7, and nobody's around to complain.

it also puts black to the question. white now sees an interesting continuation, which requires black to immediately sense something is up..."

c6 has critically weakened."

i would reject winning a, possibly poisoned, pawn here in favor of a winning attack."
