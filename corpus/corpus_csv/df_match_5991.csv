Black's best defense is 4. ... d5, which wastes a move as he has already played 2. ... d6. Black should probably focus on getting his dark-squared bishop and knight on g8 out and moving before attacking White's pieces."

9,Nxe5,f3e5,rn1qkbnr/ppp2p1p/3p2p1/4N3/2B1P1b1/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"White's knight was seemingly pinned against his queen by Black's bishop, but Legall had calculated ahead. It is reputed that Legall accidentally touched his knight on f3 and immediately took his hand away from it. When reminded by Saint Brie that he now had to move the piece, Legall analysed the position before playing this move. To those unfamiliar with this game, it looks like the best move, under the circumstances, as White gets a pawn back for the loss of his queen. But that's not the reason at all."

Legall's legacy is one that still lives on today. And after seeing this game, it's not hard to see why. If you wish to leave me a suggestion for an annotated game, or want to leave me feedback, please drop me a message. Your help is appreciated."
