4,exd4,e5d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3pP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"An interesting idea, as after 3.c5 4.c3 4.dxc3 5.Nxc3 white has now sacrificed a pawn in a line similar to the Marshall Gambit in the center game with an extra tempo, which is very useful."
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"An interesting idea, as after 3.c5 4.c3 4.dxc3 5.Nxc3 white has now sacrificed a pawn in a line similar to the Marshall Gambit in the center game with an extra tempo, which is very useful."
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,Black decides to transpose back into normal King Pawn openings.
7,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 4,The Scotch Gambit. From here italian games and 2 knight defenses can be reached  depending on black's move.
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 5,Now the game has become a line in the 2 knights where white sacrifices a pawn after 0-0.
9,c3,c2c3,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/2BpP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"Though white tries to mix things up in the center. Black can win a pawn in many ways here but black decides to get into the italian game where black equalizes instead of having to get barraged by an attack, even if it might not be sound."
10,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b5/2BpP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 6,Known to be the safer choice as after Nc3 Nxe4 white is struggling for equality.

14,Bxd2+,b4d2,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/2BPP3/5N2/PP1b1PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 8,A crucial move as it destroys the strong white center.

20,Nce7,c6e7,r1bqk2r/ppp1nppp/8/3n4/2BP4/1Q3N2/PP1N1PPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 2 11,All of the moves up to now have been theory and black has obtained an equal game.
21,O-O-O,e1c1,r1bqk2r/ppp1nppp/8/3n4/2BP4/1Q3N2/PP1N1PPP/2KR3R b kq - 3 11,"?! A bold move as the white king will definiltly come under fire in the near future. One very basic idea for black is kingside castling and a queenside pawnstorm, when white's half open c- file and misplaced queenside pieces should cause the attack to accelerate."
22,c6,c7c6,r1bqk2r/pp2nppp/2p5/3n4/2BP4/1Q3N2/PP1N1PPP/2KR3R w kq - 0 12,Cementing the d5 square and preparing b5.
23,Ne4,d2e4,r1bqk2r/pp2nppp/2p5/3n4/2BPN3/1Q3N2/PP3PPP/2KR3R b kq - 1 12,Placing the knight on an active square and threatening to go to c5.
24,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp2nppp/2p5/3n4/2BPN3/1Q3N2/PP3PPP/2KR3R w - - 2 13,Now white's knights look powerful so black decides to slowly drive them back.
25,Ne5,f3e5,r1bq1rk1/pp2nppp/2p5/3nN3/2BPN3/1Q6/PP3PPP/2KR3R b - - 3 13,Now white's knights look powerful so black decides to slowly drive them back.
26,f6,f7f6,r1bq1rk1/pp2n1pp/2p2p2/3nN3/2BPN3/1Q6/PP3PPP/2KR3R w - - 0 14,Taking the king off of the annoying pin on the a2 g8 diagonal.
27,Nd3,e5d3,r1bq1rk1/pp2n1pp/2p2p2/3n4/2BPN3/1Q1N4/PP3PPP/2KR3R b - - 1 14,Taking the king off of the annoying pin on the a2 g8 diagonal.
28,Kh8,g8h8,r1bq1r1k/pp2n1pp/2p2p2/3n4/2BPN3/1Q1N4/PP3PPP/2KR3R w - - 2 15,Taking the king off of the annoying pin on the a2 g8 diagonal.
29,h3,h2h3,r1bq1r1k/pp2n1pp/2p2p2/3n4/2BPN3/1Q1N3P/PP3PP1/2KR3R b - - 0 15,Preparing a kingside pawn storm with g4 and f4. G4 also locks out my light squared bishop.
30,Nc7,d5c7,r1bq1r1k/ppn1n1pp/2p2p2/8/2BPN3/1Q1N3P/PP3PP1/2KR3R w - - 1 16,?! A tricky move and I'm unsure if it's a good one. The logic is that b5 wins the bishop so the d3 knight has to move again and then after b5 and a5 black will win tons of tempo on the misplaced queenside pieces.
31,Nf4,d3f4,r1bq1r1k/ppn1n1pp/2p2p2/8/2BPNN2/1Q5P/PP3PP1/2KR3R b - - 2 16,But black still has to figure out what to do with the light squared bishop .
32,b5,b7b5,r1bq1r1k/p1n1n1pp/2p2p2/1p6/2BPNN2/1Q5P/PP3PP1/2KR3R w - - 0 17,But black still has to figure out what to do with the light squared bishop .
33,Be2,c4e2,r1bq1r1k/p1n1n1pp/2p2p2/1p6/3PNN2/1Q5P/PP2BPP1/2KR3R b - - 1 17,But black still has to figure out what to do with the light squared bishop .
34,a5,a7a5,r1bq1r1k/2n1n1pp/2p2p2/pp6/3PNN2/1Q5P/PP2BPP1/2KR3R w - - 0 18,But black still has to figure out what to do with the light squared bishop .
35,Nc5,e4c5,r1bq1r1k/2n1n1pp/2p2p2/ppN5/3P1N2/1Q5P/PP2BPP1/2KR3R b - - 1 18,Jumping on the tasty c5 square.
36,Ncd5,c7d5,r1bq1r1k/4n1pp/2p2p2/ppNn4/3P1N2/1Q5P/PP2BPP1/2KR3R w - - 2 19,"?! An intersting exchange sacrifice based on the idea that white has been moving his knights almost every move for the last 8 moves. Black thinks that by getting rid of  white's only two active pieces, the black knights on d5 and c4 will be more powerful than the enemy rook and bishop."
