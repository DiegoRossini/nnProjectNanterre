1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

I decided to take part in Concordborn's MT because I would be playing against players within 200 rating points of my own rating.  In this game I was matched up against a Class B player.  This is a themed MT which explores a certain branch of the Sicilian Defense.  I get into a good position in the middlegame only to be floored by a double exchange sacrifice.  Henry is then subjected to a Deadly Dash from the Wicked Witch of the West and is driven to the h column where he does manage to stay out of Old Matey's shadow.  Unfortunately Henry could not dodge Ye Olde Perpetualle and I had to concede a Low Draw.  How did this happen?
