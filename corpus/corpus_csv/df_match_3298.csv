1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

This is my second game in my match, Jo against The Titans.  It is against my Master buddy Janet.  Things seemed ok until the middlegame when Fou Leblanc got caught in a Noah's Ark type of trap but this time it was on the kingside.  I played on and tried to counter-attack but unfortunately her extra piece proved way way stronger than my pawn and her rook and bishop were enough to ensure that I had to choose between losing ruinous amounts of material or allowing sudden death.  I allowed the latter.  How did this happen?  Well, here is the game: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=18563516&fb=1&rnd=0.8143384377108815"
