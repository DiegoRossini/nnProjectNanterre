Since I am not confident with many of the Q pawn variations, I decided to avoid miscalculating my ability to eventually take that pawn back or gain tempo/positional advantage over him."

Was thanking my lucky stars his bishop was not in position to take full advantage of it!) that I know I will have to carefully squirm away from."
20,Bxc3,b4c3,rn2k2r/ppp2ppp/2b1p1q1/8/3PP3/2bB1N2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 11,"Seriously, my decision to make this move left me wondering if I had calculated it right. I decided not to yield the pawn. That bishop's maximal remaining damage is a pawn + rook before it is taken. His Queen can take my bishop and otherwise did not seem in a position to do additional harm (ie. no Qxg2 sac magic seemed plausible on the horizon).

I was effectively trying to gain the necessary tempo to retake the piece while not losing the pawn."

Rb1 was intended to allow Bb5 to draw his bishop out of position or to simply exchange it away (which is nice, because that exchange would grant me tentative control of the b file."

Will find out when I run the game through an engine to match my thoughts with ""reality"". I think I preferred this to g3 was because g3 allowed 18. ...,Nh3+ which shoves my King into a corner with no way of getting out and leaves me very vulnerable to a pretty devastating 19. ...,f4."
36,Qg5,g6g5,r4rk1/p1p3pp/2p1p3/4Ppq1/3P1n2/1RP2Q2/P2N1PPP/5RK1 w - - 6 19,Protecting his Knight and gunning for a discovered attack on my dangling and undefended Knight at d2.
37,Qxc6,f3c6,r4rk1/p1p3pp/2Q1p3/4Ppq1/3P1n2/1RP5/P2N1PPP/5RK1 b - - 0 19,"I think I calculated that my opponent did not have enough resources to properly execute Nh3+ and gain my Knight or apply a serious mate threat to my King. So, I quite suddenly became aggressive, taking a pawn and threatening to clean up his pawns (as long as I felt I had the tempo). Clearing the pawns there has the added advantage of increasing my b3 Rook's capabilities (currently very limited thanks to my pawn chain)."
38,h5,h7h5,r4rk1/p1p3p1/2Q1p3/4Ppqp/3P1n2/1RP5/P2N1PPP/5RK1 w - - 0 20,My opponent decides to be very aggressive too. I thought I was in rather serious trouble at this point. My only hope was to somehow pull his f4 Knight off it's perch so I could do a Qxe6+ and inflict more damage on him at the cost of his tempo.
39,Kh1,g1h1,r4rk1/p1p3p1/2Q1p3/4Ppqp/3P1n2/1RP5/P2N1PPP/5R1K b - - 1 20,"I think I was pre-empting Nh3+. I think I was also preparing for g3 to try and dislodge his Knight. While my King was at g1, g3 is a useless gesture and I was sure my opponent knows it!"
