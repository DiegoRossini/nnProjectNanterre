1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The e4 opening by white is both popular and efficient because it opens the diagonals for white's queen and bishop, can lead to an early castle to the king side, and immediatly contests for the center squares."
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The Caro-Kann defense is becoming a favorite of mine. I rarely see it used by my opponents, and most people do not know any book moves for the opening, which often works to my advantage. This defense centers around a strong point at d5, and is just as an effective counter to white's e4 opening as the Sicilian Defense or e5."
3,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,"This is an awful move by white, which is known as the Hillbilly Attack. It winds up wasting white's time while black gains the center with 2. d5 3. exd5 cxd5."
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 3,Logical.
5,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3P4/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 3,"I am not sure if this was better than Bb5 or not, but with white's blunder on his 6th move, he probably should have moved Bb5."
6,cxd5,c6d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3p4/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 4,"I am not sure if this was better than Bb5 or not, but with white's blunder on his 6th move, he probably should have moved Bb5."
7,Bb3,c4b3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3p4/8/1B6/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 4,"I am not sure if this was better than Bb5 or not, but with white's blunder on his 6th move, he probably should have moved Bb5."

13,Bxb5,a4b5,rn1qkb1r/p2bpppp/5n2/1B1p4/8/1P6/P1PP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 7,"Logical, so that white's pawn formation is not destroyed."
