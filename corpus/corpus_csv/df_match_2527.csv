1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,E4. My favorite.
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Black chooses the French Defense with e6.
3,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/4P3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"I decide to take him out of book, and test his knowledge. Of COURSE this isn't the best move. Played intentionally, however."
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3pp3/4P3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,My opponent chooses the correct response...
5,exd6,e5d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3Pp3/8/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"And I decide to not let things transpose back into the french, and trade off the pawn. This of course gives away most of white's advantage of moving first, but I still retain the initiative, so I often don't mind doing this just to not follow known book lines, although no doubt the position ends up in some known line. There's only so many chess moves in the opening one can do after all that don't give the game away."
6,Bxd6,f8d6,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3bp3/8/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Again, the strongest reply. Black seems to be playing very well so far, and me? Ha ha ha! Well, that's what chess IS to me: fun. Is this still a French? What is this now? I really don't know, but I don't think it's a French, even though Black still has a structure that seems like one. At any rate, now it's time for white to begin to play in earnest..."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/3bp3/8/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"Not the recommended move order by Fritz. Fritz prefers I move my d pawn or white bishop out before the knight. Not sure this move order is so significant at this point, however."
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2nbp3/8/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,"Fritz liked Nd7 better, and an eventual fianchetto of black's light-squared bishop. This should be considered an inaccuracy by black that might have implications later in the game."
9,d4,d2d4,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2nbp3/8/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,So I choose the best reply here. D4.
10,Bd7,c8d7,r2qk1nr/pppb1ppp/2nbp3/8/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,"Again Fritz preferred another move, Nf6. Seems black has been a bit lulled by my odd play earlier in the opening and does not have a plan as a result. To be honest, nor do I at this point. The game is going to end up, just looking at the pieces, as an open game; and it's hard to have a plan without seeing how the pawn structure will end up. Notice, however, that black does have structure to his pawns; hence Fritz's disagreements earlier to black's moves. I however am still not sure at all what to do, so my plans will wait until I can see something more clearly. That's what I like most about chess; the ability to create plans from a position where none may be apparent to those of us who enjoy chess more as a hobby."
11,a3,a2a3,r2qk1nr/pppb1ppp/2nbp3/8/3P4/P4N2/1PP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"I choose a waiting move. Fritz preferred a bishop move by me here, but I'm not so sure where my bishops should go yet. Some may say it's a wasted move, but I am also preparing a future b4 here, as my play will be on the queenside most likely. Oh, that's the other problem with being out of book; known openings have known strategies while only at move 6, as here in this game. Now this a pawn move by me is easily countered by black with say, a5, if he were to choose to do that. The game is pretty equal here, and although I like black's pawns, I don't like his piece position so much."
12,Nf6,g8f6,r2qk2r/pppb1ppp/2nbpn2/8/3P4/P4N2/1PP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,"Fritz did not like this move either, preferring to add tension to the center with e5, and open up the board for his bishops, which pieces could suddenly be much better by so doing. Black, however, wishes to get his king to safety, hence the night move."
13,Bg5,c1g5,r2qk2r/pppb1ppp/2nbpn2/6B1/3P4/P4N2/1PP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 2 7,"Now here Fritz wanted me to move Be2, or my other knight out. This move wastes a tempo, but after black's response, I'll have a better idea of what I should plan... i.e., will he move h6 or move the bishop? Since it pretty much does waste a move, Fritz is not too impressed with this move, giving black a small advantage."
14,Be7,d6e7,r2qk2r/pppbbppp/2n1pn2/6B1/3P4/P4N2/1PP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 3 8,"And Fritz thinks this is not the best reply. H6 or castling was Fritz' choice here, but the game is still basically equal, slight advantage now for white."
15,Bd3,f1d3,r2qk2r/pppbbppp/2n1pn2/6B1/3P4/P2B1N2/1PP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 4 8,"I choose the best continuation here according to Fritz. Black's pieces look very symmetrical, although not sure that e pawn should be sitting on e6 for long."
16,O-O,e8g8,r2q1rk1/pppbbppp/2n1pn2/6B1/3P4/P2B1N2/1PP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQ - 5 9,Black chooses to castle....
17,O-O,e1g1,r2q1rk1/pppbbppp/2n1pn2/6B1/3P4/P2B1N2/1PP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b - - 6 9,And I also castle; again the best response according to Fritz at this point.
18,Nd5,f6d5,r2q1rk1/pppbbppp/2n1p3/3n2B1/3P4/P2B1N2/1PP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - - 7 10,"And Black makes the natural looking move Nd5, a top pick of Fritz."
19,Bd2,g5d2,r2q1rk1/pppbbppp/2n1p3/3n4/3P4/P2B1N2/1PPB1PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b - - 8 10,"Fritz seemed to like trading the bishops off, but I'm not quite ready to do that. So I go ahead and retreat to d2; white still has a small advantage. I like, however, at this point, my potential mobility better than black's."
20,f5,f7f5,r2q1rk1/pppbb1pp/2n1p3/3n1p2/3P4/P2B1N2/1PPB1PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - - 0 11,"Black chooses the aggressive f5, but I don't think this is good; black's king defense is weakened, and the white bishop remains very passive. It's not clear where the black knights should go - d5 won't be an outpost for too long, and a knight on g4 is easily chased away. And although it's early in the game, black is beginning to look uncoordinated to me."
