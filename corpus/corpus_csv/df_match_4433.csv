The big lesson to learn here is that you and your opponent can both screw up early in the game. Don't make automatic moves in the first few turns. Really study what your opponent is doing and see if you can take advantage. If you can (and it doesn't really cost you development), go on the offensive early."

If he takes the rook with his king, I can play Nxb5 and get his rook with a fork. These types of moves are often overlooked by junior players and my opponent gave me a ""nice move"" comment after this one. The game was already over at this point, but this move sealed the deal, as it were. 

Take a look at where pieces end up AFTER the captures are complete, and see if you can leverage a fork to regain parity. Often times people only look to see ""Oh, that knight is protected by my king"" and don't think any further. As my friend mythas once told me, dream a bit and see what would happen if a piece is no longer there, or a piece can be made to move a square. Engineer those moments and you will be a better chess player and catch people off guard. I hope this little teaching moment was useful."
