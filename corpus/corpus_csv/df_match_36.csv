1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This was played in the first round of the British Over 50s Chess Championships in Llandudno. Although I was out-rated I managed to draw the game.

3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"The King's Indian is a hypermodern opening, where Black deliberately allows White control of the centre with his pawns, with the view to subsequently challenge it with the moves ...e5 or ...c5. Until the mid-1930s, it was generally regarded as highly suspect, but the analysis and play of three strong Soviet players in particular—Alexander Konstantinopolsky, Isaac Boleslavsky, and David Bronstein—helped to make the defence much more respected and popular. It is a dynamic opening, exceptionally complex, and a favourite of former world champions Garry Kasparov, Bobby Fischer, and Mikhail Tal, with prominent grandmasters Viktor Korchnoi, Miguel Najdorf, Efim Geller, John Nunn, Svetozar Gligorić, Wolfgang Uhlmann, and Ilya Smirin having also contributed much to the theory and practice of this opening. In the early 2000s the opening's popularity suffered after Vladimir Kramnik scored excellent results against it, so much so that even Kasparov gave up the opening after relentless losses to Kramnik. However, Kramnik himself won a fine game on the black side of the KID in 2012, and current top players Hikaru Nakamura, Teimour Radjabov and Ding Liren all play the opening."

7,e4,e2e4,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"This is Sämisch variation, a subtle blockading system and a critical challenge to the King's Indian.[1] It is named after the German Grandmaster Friedrich Sämisch. The Sämisch has been played by numerous grandmasters, including world champions Mikhail Botvinnik, Mikhail Tal, Tigran Petrosian, Boris Spassky, Anatoly Karpov and Garry Kasparov.

Bobby Fischer had trouble against the Sämisch. Mednis' How to Beat Bobby Fischer showed that five of Fischer's losses were against the Sämisch King's Indian, and remarked that Fischer eventually avoided the King's Indian if he believed he would face the Sämisch.[2] Fischer faced the Sämisch five times against Boris Spassky in their 1992 rematch, however—winning two, drawing two and losing one.

In the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings (ECO), the Sämisch Variation is covered in chapters E80 to E89"
