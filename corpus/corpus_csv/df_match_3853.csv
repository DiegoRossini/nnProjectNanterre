1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is one of the longest blitz games I've played, with both of us getting right down to the wire on our timers. A big pawn block develops in the center and some slow positional play develops with two Bishops facing off against a Bishop and a Knight. I open with the English and the bind I set up on d5 leads to the central pawn structure the last fifty moves of the game revolve around. Thanks for the game, finicius!"

5,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p1n2/8/2P5/6P1/PP1PPPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 3,"Black's pawn on d6 makes me think he's intending ...e5 or ...c5, which could leave the d-pawn weakened and make it more difficult to advance to give Black's DSB space to maneuver. With that in mind, I choose a standard developing move that continues to bear down on d5."

I should have played 8.d4 here, with the chance to advance to d5 if necessary, and preventing ...Nc6 for the time being (8.d4 Nc6 9.d5 wins a piece)."
