28,g4,g5g4,r2q1rk1/p1pn1pb1/1p1pp2p/8/2QPP1p1/2N2NP1/PPP3PP/3R1RK1 w - - 0 15,Driving a wedge into White's position and forcing  him into a cramped game.

31,dxc5,d4c5,r2q1rk1/p2n1pb1/1p1pp2p/2P5/2Q1P1p1/2N3P1/PPP3PP/3RNRK1 b - - 0 16,I would say that I can improve on this by playing 16. ...Nxc5. Keeping the c file open and creating a nice advanced post for my knight.  The advantage of Nxc5 is that my knight would be able to jump to D5 were it would dominate the board. I also have prepared a positional trap in case of 17. Rxd6.

34,Qe7,d8e7,r4rk1/p2nqpb1/3Rp2p/2p5/2Q1P1p1/2N3P1/PPP3PP/4NRK1 w - - 1 18,The next few moves are forced

41,Nd1,c3d1,1r3rk1/p3qpb1/4p2p/4n3/2p1P1p1/6P1/PPPRQ1PP/3NNRK1 b - - 3 21,This is very nice for black. All of white's peices are behind the  3rd rank
42,Bf6,g7f6,1r3rk1/p3qp2/4pb1p/4n3/2p1P1p1/6P1/PPPRQ1PP/3NNRK1 w - - 4 22,The bishop is headed for g5 were it will be able to exert more influence over the board.
