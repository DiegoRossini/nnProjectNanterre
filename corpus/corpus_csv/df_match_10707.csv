1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"""A logical and sound move to start the game, grabbing central space and opening lines for quick developement of the Bf1 and queen. Other pawn pushes with no real drawbacks include 1. d4 and 1. c4. And for our hypermodern players, there is always 1. Nf3, controlling the center with pieces and not commiting to a set pawn structure. ""
Morphy one and only true love, his confidence never wavered with the best move ""best by Test"" Bobby Fischer."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,This is so White can't create a huge pawn centre unnopposed.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Developing a knight to its best square, attacking the pawn, 
controlling two center squares."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"The best move to defend. Also attacks two squares and develops 
a piece."
5,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,The Italian game. An old opening that is now thought to be rather dull and boring. Black now has two main options here 3....Bc5 the Giuoco Piano or 3... Nf6 The Two Knight's Defence. The Italian game can evolve into the romantic Evans Gambit if 3...Bc5 then 4. b4!?
6,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,"The Guicco Piano. This is less agressive than the Two Knight's defence. Moprhy now has the chance to play his and my fave as I have already mentioned, the Evan's Gambit 4.b4!?"
7,b4,b2b4,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/1PB1P3/5N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,"This the move that signals the beginning of the Evans.  White sacrifices a pawn for center control and a kingside Initiative with a quick attack on the Black king which will hopefully end in mate. Most  gambits like these give White an early initiative, however  if Black can defend accurately, he stands better in the ensuing endgame, with plenty of chances for a win. When people tell me this I simply reply "" I don't give a crap, I don't plan letting Black get into an endgame position anyway. Lol."""
8,Bxb4,c5b4,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/1bB1P3/5N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,It is often said that the way to refute a gambit is to accept it. Black grabs a pawn so as to have the option of uploading it in a later stage in the game in order to neutralize whites resulting initiative. This is atleast what Black  is meant to try and do!
9,c3,c2c3,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/1bB1P3/2P2N2/P2P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,This is the plan of giving away the b4 pawn to gain tempo by forcing black to move his bishop repetitively while he gains  momentum in the centre.
10,Bc5,b4c5,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/P2P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 6,Retreating to a powerful square that won't be his for long because of the oncoming 6.d4! Better would have been 5... Ba5
11,d4,d2d4,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2BPP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"Grabbing the pawn center, unleashing the dark squared bishop, and attacking the c5 bishop all with one move. Remember the best moves accomplish multiple goals or hit multiple targets"
12,exd4,e5d4,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b5/2BpP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,An exchange in the centre.
13,cxd4,c3d4,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b5/2BPP3/5N2/P4PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,Keeping the pressure on the d-pawn. However it is obvios that White has the edge in this positiion.
14,Bb6,c5b6,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/1bn5/8/2BPP3/5N2/P4PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 8,Keeping the pressure on the d-pawn. However it is obvios that White has the edge in this positiion.
15,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/1bn5/8/2BPP3/5N2/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 2 8,"Castliing is not only a defensive move, but also an offensive move. Notice that now the f rook is in the game, and surely will be moving to the powerful and 
open e-file soon."
16,Na5,c6a5,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/1b6/n7/2BPP3/5N2/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 3 9,Moving the knight to an inferior square where it no longer attacks the center.
17,Bd3,c4d3,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/1b6/n7/3PP3/3B1N2/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 4 9,Not wanting to trade that good bishop for that half-knight stranded passively on the side of the board where it will find it hard to affect the game.
18,d5,d7d5,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/1b6/n2p4/3PP3/3B1N2/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 10,"With the bishop gone, black is able to challenge white's awesome pawn center. Not a bad idea although flawed because it gives Paul the opportunity to open the e-file."
19,exd5,e4d5,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/1b6/n2P4/3P4/3B1N2/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 10,Luring the queen out early. Not good for Paul's Dad!
20,Qxd5,d8d5,r1b1k1nr/ppp2ppp/1b6/n2q4/3P4/3B1N2/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 11,"Bringing the queen out early is very dangerous, because white can attack it with his developing pieces, there are no other options though if he wants to regain the material deficit."
21,Ba3,c1a3,r1b1k1nr/ppp2ppp/1b6/n2q4/3P4/B2B1N2/P4PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 1 11,"Developing the bishop to a powerful square where it will prevent black from castling, pressure the critical squares around the king, and pin the king to the middle of the board,, sometimes in the Evan's Gambit Black play the pawn move d7-d8 but oh woops Blacks excanged all his central pawns while his King is stuck in the centre."
