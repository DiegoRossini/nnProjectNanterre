At this point, you can read the shape of the rest of the game:  white's going to be trying to loosen up his pieces and form them into an attack force, and black will just (1) ward off any threats as they come and (2) advance a pawn whenever possible.  The feasibility of (1) is the key question, of course.  I reckoned that white's inactive bishop on g2 meant that the actual active material was still pretty even. 

I simply haven't got enough experience to decide if this was a really sound plan or not; perhaps readers will weigh in.  The computer strongly dislikes it, but the hoped-for advantage is a rather far-off one."
