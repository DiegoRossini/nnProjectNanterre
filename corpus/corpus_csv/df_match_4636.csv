1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"black emerged from the opening having equalized the game, a symmetrical structure, less space, but a better light squared bishop, after some exchanges black was able to make a pawn break and convert in to an endgame with R+3P vs B+N, with two passed pawns and a pawn majority on the opposed wing white had trouble coordinating his pieces in defence of all threats so finally black achieved a win in a well played game"
