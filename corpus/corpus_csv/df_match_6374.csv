10,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqk2r/pp1pppbp/5np1/8/2Pp4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,This move seems a little unwise to me as it relinquishes some control over the centre
11,exd4,e3d4,rnbqk2r/pp1pppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"Perhaps this move is a little premature, I am not under any pressure. Is Be3 or g5 better?"

14,d6,d7d6,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 8,Opening a line for his lsb though this is described by the computer analysis as an innacuracy
15,O-O,e1g1,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 8,I decide to play safe
16,Nc6,b8c6,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 2 9,preparing for a queen side pawn storm. Also preventing Nb4.
17,a3,a2a3,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/2PP4/P1N2N2/1P2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 9,preparing for a queen side pawn storm. Also preventing Nb4.
18,Bg4,c8g4,r2q1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/2PP2b1/P1N2N2/1P2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 10,"Although this removes a defender from the d4 pawn it doesnt' seem that strong a move to me. I was expecting something like Bf5, followed later by Ne4"
19,Be3,c1e3,r2q1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/2PP2b1/P1N1BN2/1P2BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 2 10,Protecting the pawn. At the moment I am quite happy with my dsb on the c1 h6 diagonal
20,Rb8,a8b8,1r1q1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/2PP2b1/P1N1BN2/1P2BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 3 11,I guess here he is preparing to defend against a pawn storm
21,b4,b2b4,1r1q1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/1PPP2b1/P1N1BN2/4BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 11,As he is outnumbered in pawns I decide to go for it
22,e6,e7e6,1r1q1rk1/pp3pbp/2nppnp1/8/1PPP2b1/P1N1BN2/4BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 12,"This was a bit of a suprise. I think black is playing a patient game, waiting for a mistake that he can pounce on"
23,b5,b4b5,1r1q1rk1/pp3pbp/2nppnp1/1P6/2PP2b1/P1N1BN2/4BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 12,"Continuing my push, black has limited options for the knight and if I can get in a c5 it could be 3 of my pawns against 2 of his.

The analysis here suggests this is an inaccuracy and offers b3 as a better move. I had considered that but didn't want to disturb the pawns in front of my king needlessly"
24,Ne7,c6e7,1r1q1rk1/pp2npbp/3ppnp1/1P6/2PP2b1/P1N1BN2/4BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 1 13,threatening the d4 pawn
25,Rc1,a1c1,1r1q1rk1/pp2npbp/3ppnp1/1P6/2PP2b1/P1N1BN2/4BPPP/2RQ1RK1 b - - 2 13,threatening the d4 pawn
26,Nf5,e7f5,1r1q1rk1/pp3pbp/3ppnp1/1P3n2/2PP2b1/P1N1BN2/4BPPP/2RQ1RK1 w - - 3 14,threatening the d4 pawn
27,Bf4,e3f4,1r1q1rk1/pp3pbp/3ppnp1/1P3n2/2PP1Bb1/P1N2N2/4BPPP/2RQ1RK1 b - - 4 14,I need to be careful here as black is building a strong assault

30,f6,f7f6,1r1q1rk1/pp4bp/3pppp1/1P3nBn/2PP2b1/P1N2N2/4BPPP/2RQ1RK1 w - - 0 16,I expected Bf6
31,Bd2,g5d2,1r1q1rk1/pp4bp/3pppp1/1P3n1n/2PP2b1/P1N2N2/3BBPPP/2RQ1RK1 b - - 1 16,Blacks queen is pretty restricted. I had figured that he would want to bring it in to play yet his options are limited at the moment and the line of pawn he has from g6-d6 could become a nice target
32,Bxf3,g4f3,1r1q1rk1/pp4bp/3pppp1/1P3n1n/2PP4/P1N2b2/3BBPPP/2RQ1RK1 w - - 0 17,"This move is pretty much forced as I had the threat of h3, can I take advantage of the bishop pair?

The analysis however calls this a mistake and suggests Bh6"
33,Bxf3,e2f3,1r1q1rk1/pp4bp/3pppp1/1P3n1n/2PP4/P1N2B2/3B1PPP/2RQ1RK1 b - - 0 17,"The analysis suggests that this is an inaccuracy and that g4 is better, however I again was reluctant to disturb the pawns in front of my king and felt that this would weaken the black pawns"
34,Nxd4,f5d4,1r1q1rk1/pp4bp/3pppp1/1P5n/2Pn4/P1N2B2/3B1PPP/2RQ1RK1 w - - 0 18,"The analysis suggests that this is an inaccuracy and that g4 is better, however I again was reluctant to disturb the pawns in front of my king and felt that this would weaken the black pawns"
35,Bxh5,f3h5,1r1q1rk1/pp4bp/3pppp1/1P5B/2Pn4/P1N5/3B1PPP/2RQ1RK1 b - - 0 18,"The analysis suggests that this is an inaccuracy and that g4 is better, however I again was reluctant to disturb the pawns in front of my king and felt that this would weaken the black pawns"
