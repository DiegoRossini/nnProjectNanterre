1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"White opens things up with the Queen's Pawn, a good opening."
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Black goes on with what was their usual strategy. I don't like the openings I use anymore, and this game was the beginning of change, as this game will show, my opening will be a bit different. Today though, if I am black and white opens with the Queen's Pawn like this, I will respond with the Queen's Pawn Keres Defense, which is what this move is."
3,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Well this is not part of the book, thus the book ends. White is giving his pawns structure."
4,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"At the moment, this is still part of my original opening pattern. I don't think it's bad in this position."
5,d5,d4d5,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2pP4/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"White didn't take and I decided to do the same. Computer analysis says this was a mistake though. Well I don't agree with that. It says 3. exd5 was the best move. Maybe, but taking is not always best, and I felt it was better to not take in this case."
6,e5,e6e5,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/8/2pPp3/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"White didn't take and I decided to do the same. Computer analysis says this was a mistake though. Well I don't agree with that. It says 3. exd5 was the best move. Maybe, but taking is not always best, and I felt it was better to not take in this case."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/8/2pPp3/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"Well that I actually expected, but it will be easy to protect the pawn."
8,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/3p4/2pPp3/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"I could of played 4. Bd6, but I think connecting the pawns was best."
9,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/3p4/2pPp3/4P3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,For sure white is preparing to castle.
10,h6,h7h6,rnbqkbnr/pp3pp1/3p3p/2pPp3/4P3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"Well this did go along with my old strategy. My opening is different when you look at the board, but this was a wasted move. I realize that now, but I didn't see that then."
11,O-O,e1g1,rnbqkbnr/pp3pp1/3p3p/2pPp3/4P3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 6,Castle as expected.
12,Ne7,g8e7,rnbqkb1r/pp2npp1/3p3p/2pPp3/4P3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 7,"Computer analysis sees this as an inaccuracy. I agree with that, it would of been better to play the best move, Nf6, which would of allowed a little better development and better limited white's forces on the king-side."
13,Nbd2,b1d2,rnbqkb1r/pp2npp1/3p3p/2pPp3/4P3/3B1N2/PPPN1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 3 7,"White puts pressure on black's d6 pawn, but that can be countered easily."
14,Nd7,b8d7,r1bqkb1r/pp1nnpp1/3p3p/2pPp3/4P3/3B1N2/PPPN1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 4 8,"White puts pressure on black's d6 pawn, but that can be countered easily."
15,Nc4,d2c4,r1bqkb1r/pp1nnpp1/3p3p/2pPp3/2N1P3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 5 8,"White puts pressure on black's d6 pawn, but that can be countered easily."
16,Nb6,d7b6,r1bqkb1r/pp2npp1/1n1p3p/2pPp3/2N1P3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 6 9,"Okay, it's going pretty good for black right now, the start isn't bad. For the most part, black is actually countering white's moves pretty well, and I am happy with that."
17,Ne3,c4e3,r1bqkb1r/pp2npp1/1n1p3p/2pPp3/4P3/3BNN2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 7 9,"White again does not take, which I am not surprised with. By the looks of things, he is going to advance his knights king-side. When this game was occurring then though, I was expecting that, thus I was not going to make it easy for white."
18,Ng6,e7g6,r1bqkb1r/pp3pp1/1n1p2np/2pPp3/4P3/3BNN2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 8 10,"I'd say this move was to keep my knight from advancing further. Good move by white, for if he didn't play that, I likely would of advanced my knight too, but this move does allow me to advance my bishop."
19,g3,g2g3,r1bqkb1r/pp3pp1/1n1p2np/2pPp3/4P3/3BNNP1/PPP2P1P/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 10,"I'd say this move was to keep my knight from advancing further. Good move by white, for if he didn't play that, I likely would of advanced my knight too, but this move does allow me to advance my bishop."
20,Bh3,c8h3,r2qkb1r/pp3pp1/1n1p2np/2pPp3/4P3/3BNNPb/PPP2P1P/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 1 11,Of course white will move his rook. That is really the best move to make.
21,Re1,f1e1,r2qkb1r/pp3pp1/1n1p2np/2pPp3/4P3/3BNNPb/PPP2P1P/R1BQR1K1 b kq - 2 11,"I am trying to advance king-side myself too, as well as castle."
22,Be7,f8e7,r2qk2r/pp2bpp1/1n1p2np/2pPp3/4P3/3BNNPb/PPP2P1P/R1BQR1K1 w kq - 3 12,"I am trying to advance king-side myself too, as well as castle."
23,a4,a2a4,r2qk2r/pp2bpp1/1n1p2np/2pPp3/P3P3/3BNNPb/1PP2P1P/R1BQR1K1 b kq - 0 12,Castled as planned.
24,O-O,e8g8,r2q1rk1/pp2bpp1/1n1p2np/2pPp3/P3P3/3BNNPb/1PP2P1P/R1BQR1K1 w - - 1 13,Castled as planned.
25,b3,b2b3,r2q1rk1/pp2bpp1/1n1p2np/2pPp3/P3P3/1P1BNNPb/2P2P1P/R1BQR1K1 b - - 0 13,Looks like white is connecting his queen-side pawns. There is not much to do on the king-side anyway.
26,Nd7,b6d7,r2q1rk1/pp1nbpp1/3p2np/2pPp3/P3P3/1P1BNNPb/2P2P1P/R1BQR1K1 w - - 1 14,I decide to get my knight out of there in case white plays 14. a5. I also feel I should get the other knight involved on the king-side as well.
