18,Nd7,f6d7,r1bq1rk1/pp1n1ppp/2nbp3/3p4/2pP1P2/2P1PN2/PPBN2PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 6 10,"Though Black seems to have a completely different idea for that knight! I remember playing this myself to prepare to capture on e5 should White move his knife there and/or to drive it away with f6, so I don't think it's that bad of a move (though Ng4 would probably be stronger)"

Of course, White wouldn't have done that straight away (the outpost is too good) but Black may have plans of chasing the knight away [interestingly enough, Black can do the same with Nxe5, but the semi-open f-file can prove to be sufficient compensation]"
21,Qf3,d1f3,r1bq1rk1/pp1nnppp/3bp3/3pN3/2pP1P2/2P1PQ2/PPBN2PP/R1B2RK1 b - - 9 11,"Staying true to the sample game on the Knights of Honour forum -  White's plan is g4, then g5, then Bxh7!!, which leads to an overwhelming kingside attack! I was hoping that my opponent would be inexperienced enough to fall into this attack."

Is this the best move? turns out it works to  my advantage in this case, but that's only because Black missed out on two better moves to protect h7 (g6, and Ng6) perhaps h4, or the more cautious Qg3 (preventing any nasty tricks) would have sufficed..."

Black, realising that his kingside is going to need support, brings his knight over to defend... but again, I'm unsure about this move - in fact, when I first saw this move I only saw it as a way to give White a free tempo - I plan to start advancing my h-pawn soon"

33,h4,h2h4,r3qrk1/pp1bb1pp/4p1n1/3p1pP1/2pP1P1P/2P1P1Q1/PPBN4/R1B2RK1 b - - 0 17,"White plans to play h5 next move, and Black ought to see that too - the only square that he will have is the h8 square, which just looks ugly! There are two alternatives to that move; 1) 17...Rf7 18.h5 Nf8, where Black will have quite a job unravelling his pieces! 2)Moving the dark square bishop so that Ne7 can be played. This - might - have been best, but it would mean admitting his last move was a mistake."
