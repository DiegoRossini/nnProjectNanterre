1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"A short game that starts very quietely, and suddenly goes wild. It shows a somewhat thematic sacrifice from black, with a tense tactic moment. Enjoy."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"A different outcome for the Scandivian! White concedes the pawn and developement, but I will have to think."
3,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"A different outcome for the Scandivian! White concedes the pawn and developement, but I will have to think."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"A different outcome for the Scandivian! White concedes the pawn and developement, but I will have to think."
5,d6,d5d6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3P1n2/8/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"A different outcome for the Scandivian! White concedes the pawn and developement, but I will have to think."
6,exd6,e7d6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/8/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,cx would have kept my pawn to the center. But my style of game will lead me to feel unconfortable without the c pawn to shield any B or N incursion. This option will lead to a very passive game from my part.
7,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/8/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,Guarding d5 without double-moving the d pawn. The icelandic plan Qe7 - Bc5+ is still possible.
8,Be6,c8e6,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/3pbn2/8/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,Guarding d5 without double-moving the d pawn. The icelandic plan Qe7 - Bc5+ is still possible.
9,h3,h2h3,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/3pbn2/8/3P4/7P/PPP2PP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"A waste of time, but white (maybe) remembers some lines in which black plays Ng4..."
10,Nbd7,b8d7,r2qkb1r/pppn1ppp/3pbn2/8/3P4/7P/PPP2PP1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,"Allowing the c pawn to move. I play this position with the dsb ""out of the box"", on b6. But it was not possible with this opening, so maybe I should have gone for cxd6 after all."
11,Nf3,g1f3,r2qkb1r/pppn1ppp/3pbn2/8/3P4/5N1P/PPP2PP1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 6,"Very, very passive for my standards, but hey, I'm playing black!"
12,Be7,f8e7,r2qk2r/pppnbppp/3pbn2/8/3P4/5N1P/PPP2PP1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 3 7,"Very, very passive for my standards, but hey, I'm playing black!"
13,g3,g2g3,r2qk2r/pppnbppp/3pbn2/8/3P4/5NPP/PPP2P2/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"Very slow, but it is a normal - though somewhat passive - way of developement. I am glad I kept the c pawn for c6."
14,O-O,e8g8,r2q1rk1/pppnbppp/3pbn2/8/3P4/5NPP/PPP2P2/RNBQKB1R w KQ - 1 8,I can't recognize my style of playing! :-)
15,Bg2,f1g2,r2q1rk1/pppnbppp/3pbn2/8/3P4/5NPP/PPP2PB1/RNBQK2R b KQ - 2 8,"So simple, so neat."
16,c6,c7c6,r2q1rk1/pp1nbppp/2ppbn2/8/3P4/5NPP/PPP2PB1/RNBQK2R w KQ - 0 9,"So simple, so neat."
17,O-O,e1g1,r2q1rk1/pp1nbppp/2ppbn2/8/3P4/5NPP/PPP2PB1/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 1 9,"I'm without a plan! But Ng5 was annoying, I don't want to concede the lsb for a N."
18,h6,h7h6,r2q1rk1/pp1nbpp1/2ppbn1p/8/3P4/5NPP/PPP2PB1/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 0 10,"I'm without a plan! But Ng5 was annoying, I don't want to concede the lsb for a N."
19,Nc3,b1c3,r2q1rk1/pp1nbpp1/2ppbn1p/8/3P4/2N2NPP/PPP2PB1/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 10,"Nb6-Qd7 was a line. White would have defended with the usual Kh2, and I would have had the thematic sacrifice Bxh3... that sometimes gets score, sometime doesn't."
20,Kh8,g8h8,r2q1r1k/pp1nbpp1/2ppbn1p/8/3P4/2N2NPP/PPP2PB1/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 2 11,"I went for this idea: to attack with g5, supporting it with the r. g3 will be my target."
21,Kh2,g1h2,r2q1r1k/pp1nbpp1/2ppbn1p/8/3P4/2N2NPP/PPP2PBK/R1BQ1R2 b - - 3 11,"As foreseen, but not really necessary. White should throw in a plan."
22,g5,g7g5,r2q1r1k/pp1nbp2/2ppbn1p/6p1/3P4/2N2NPP/PPP2PBK/R1BQ1R2 w - - 0 12,"I throw in mine, for sure."
23,Re1,f1e1,r2q1r1k/pp1nbp2/2ppbn1p/6p1/3P4/2N2NPP/PPP2PBK/R1BQR3 b - - 1 12,"A normal developement move, as if on the Kingside nothing will be happening."
24,g4,g5g4,r2q1r1k/pp1nbp2/2ppbn1p/8/3P2p1/2N2NPP/PPP2PBK/R1BQR3 w - - 0 13,h4 can't be played because the N is en prise.
25,Nh4,f3h4,r2q1r1k/pp1nbp2/2ppbn1p/8/3P2pN/2N3PP/PPP2PBK/R1BQR3 b - - 1 13,"This N can be convenientely exchanged for the Be7 to open up the king's position... but it is not so straight forward, because white still has f4 to interpose."
26,h5,h6h5,r2q1r1k/pp1nbp2/2ppbn2/7p/3P2pN/2N3PP/PPP2PBK/R1BQR3 w - - 0 14,"I don't want HIS Q entering my kingside, or I'll be lost! Due to my risky plan, the game popped out in a tactic and tense battle. Very intense, by now."
27,Ne4,c3e4,r2q1r1k/pp1nbp2/2ppbn2/7p/3PN1pN/6PP/PPP2PBK/R1BQR3 b - - 1 14,"Looking for exchanging material, which benefits me since my pieces are cramped."
