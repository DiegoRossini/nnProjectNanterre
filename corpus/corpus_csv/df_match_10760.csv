Hope you enjoy the game :)"

i'll play b4 everytime :)"

8,Bxb4,c5b4,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/1bB1P3/5N2/P1PP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,This is the usuall reply. Black could decline the gambit but this is seen as inferior due to the lost of tempo and nothing gained.
9,c3,c2c3,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/1bB1P3/2P2N2/P2P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"c3 chases the bishop away forcing it to move for a 3rd time in just the first 5 moves, although black is compensated by having the pawn advantage."
10,Ba5,b4a5,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/b3p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/P2P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 6,"Ba5 is the most common move, Be7 is another alternative."
11,d4,d2d4,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/b3p3/2BPP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,Whites bishops can become very strong later on in the game. d4 gives them move room to manouver while also contesting the center.
12,exd4,e5d4,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/b7/2BpP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"Nxd4!? is an option here as it stops black from gaining any extra pawns. This however would allow black the chance to castle after 7. ....Nf6  8. 0-0 Nxd4  9. Qxd4 0-0.
Or even cxd4 as a different option.
Personally i prefer to give black the chance to take the 3rd pawn as i'd rather black did not castle."

I'd like to say thanks to Magicking for the game, and i look forward to the return game where i am certain he'll show how strong the Evans gambit is too :)"
