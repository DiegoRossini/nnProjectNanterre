1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This game was a battle.  I had to use all of my chess knowledge to beat this fine opponent.  It was also a team match and I played stronger to not let my team down.  I opened with the Sicilian which is my favorite opening for black.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I wanted to open with the familiar d6 but I wanted to throw my opponent off just a bit.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,I wanted to open with the familiar d6 but I wanted to throw my opponent off just a bit.

5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 3,My opponent surprised me as I was expecting the typical 3.d4 exd4 4.Nxd4
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 4,In the Sicilian it is typical to bring the c-knight out first to control d4
7,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 4,He foregoes castling to develop his c-knight.
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/2p5/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 4 5,I develop a second knight and am not worried about 5. e5 because Ng4 wins the pawn.
9,d4,d2d4,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/2p5/2BPP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,White is attempting to control d5 so I counter with cxd4
10,cxd4,c5d4,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/8/2BpP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,It took me a long time to understand why the small center is important in the Sicilian.  6..d6 prevents 7.Bf4 allowing me to keep control of e5

13,Nxc6,d4c6,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2Nppn2/8/2B1P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,White takes my knight moving it twice before castling.  I still have good pawn structure when I take back even though the c6 pawn is undefended.
14,bxc6,b7c6,r1bqkb1r/p4ppp/2pppn2/8/2B1P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,unpinning the knight and preparing for kingside castling
15,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqkb1r/p4ppp/2pppn2/6B1/2B1P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 8,unpinning the knight and preparing for kingside castling

17,f4,f2f4,r1bqk2r/p3bppp/2pppn2/6B1/2B1PP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 9,notice that white compromises his kingside pawn structure for a fruitless attack.  He wants 10. e5 dxe5 11.Qxd8+ Kxd8 so I cant castle.  I ignore his subtle threat and castle
18,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/p3bppp/2pppn2/6B1/2B1PP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QK2R w KQ - 1 10,Whites plan is to castle queenside and pawn storm my castled position.  He is also indirectly attacking my undefended c6 pawn on the next move.
19,Qf3,d1f3,r1bq1rk1/p3bppp/2pppn2/6B1/2B1PP2/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/R3K2R b KQ - 2 10,Whites plan is to castle queenside and pawn storm my castled position.  He is also indirectly attacking my undefended c6 pawn on the next move.
20,Bb7,c8b7,r2q1rk1/pb2bppp/2pppn2/6B1/2B1PP2/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/R3K2R w KQ - 3 11,I now protect the c6 pawn with my bishop and I dont have to worry about 11.e5
21,O-O-O,e1c1,r2q1rk1/pb2bppp/2pppn2/6B1/2B1PP2/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/2KR3R b - - 4 11,As expected white castles queenside
22,Ne8,f6e8,r2qnrk1/pb2bppp/2ppp3/6B1/2B1PP2/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/2KR3R w - - 5 12,11..Ne8?  A risky move on my part but the plan was to keep d6 defended and force an exchange of dark squared bishops.
23,Bxe7,g5e7,r2qnrk1/pb2Bppp/2ppp3/8/2B1PP2/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/2KR3R b - - 0 12,White immediately goes to attacking my castled position.  Notice my knight is not on its ideal square of f6
24,Qxe7,d8e7,r3nrk1/pb2qppp/2ppp3/8/2B1PP2/2N2Q2/PPP3PP/2KR3R w - - 0 13,White immediately goes to attacking my castled position.  Notice my knight is not on its ideal square of f6
25,Qh3,f3h3,r3nrk1/pb2qppp/2ppp3/8/2B1PP2/2N4Q/PPP3PP/2KR3R b - - 1 13,White immediately goes to attacking my castled position.  Notice my knight is not on its ideal square of f6
26,h6,h7h6,r3nrk1/pb2qpp1/2ppp2p/8/2B1PP2/2N4Q/PPP3PP/2KR3R w - - 0 14,H6 was probably a mistake.  Better was a5 attacking his castled position.  Now white is going to shred my kingside position with g4!
27,g4,g2g4,r3nrk1/pb2qpp1/2ppp2p/8/2B1PPP1/2N4Q/PPP4P/2KR3R b - - 0 14,14..Kh8?  15. g4! Kh7 but this did not happen as white goes in for the kill with Bd3!
28,Kh8,g8h8,r3nr1k/pb2qpp1/2ppp2p/8/2B1PPP1/2N4Q/PPP4P/2KR3R w - - 1 15,14..Kh8?  15. g4! Kh7 but this did not happen as white goes in for the kill with Bd3!
29,Bd3,c4d3,r3nr1k/pb2qpp1/2ppp2p/8/4PPP1/2NB3Q/PPP4P/2KR3R b - - 2 15,Im fighting for my life here as I try to block the d3- h7 diagonal.
