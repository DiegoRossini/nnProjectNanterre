1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"richkitch v saguaro.  This was a Team Match. 
Saguaro opens. Saguaro does not open e4 or d4."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,Black responds forcefully.
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,White mirrors.
4,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p1b2/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 3,"Now, Black is developing the Queen Bishop common in the Caro-Kann defense....a good move."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p1b2/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 3,White develops along a lot of paths to deal with this.
6,e6,e7e6,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p1b2/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,Black does another Caro-Kann move to make infantry and Q bishop on defense and ready attack.
7,Bg5,c1g5,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p1bB1/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,All Black has to do for this is attack the bishop in a common Caro-Kann fashion...
8,f6,f7f6,rn1qkbnr/ppp3pp/4pp2/3p1bB1/3P4/2N2N2/PPP1PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,...and so he does!
9,Bh4,g5h4,rn1qkbnr/ppp3pp/4pp2/3p1b2/3P3B/2N2N2/PPP1PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,Bishop backs off.
10,Nc6,b8c6,r2qkbnr/ppp3pp/2n1pp2/3p1b2/3P3B/2N2N2/PPP1PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,Usually in Caro we want the knights to work as a pair as in a pair of rooks.  Black manages to achieve this with a more forward move ready to have the King Knight to become a duo pair....
11,e3,e2e3,r2qkbnr/ppp3pp/2n1pp2/3p1b2/3P3B/2N1PN2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,White is opening for the King Bishop and reinforcing while doing so.
12,g5,g7g5,r2qkbnr/ppp4p/2n1pp2/3p1bp1/3P3B/2N1PN2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,Black is on the attack now forcing the Queen Bishop to g3....
13,Bg3,h4g3,r2qkbnr/ppp4p/2n1pp2/3p1bp1/3P4/2N1PNB1/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 7,...and there it is.
14,Nb4,c6b4,r2qkbnr/ppp4p/4pp2/3p1bp1/1n1P4/2N1PNB1/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 8,Now I am realizing Black is being rather offensive considering Black is usually defensive. Perhaps Black wants to advance more infantry (c6) while netting White into a restrictive environment.
15,Bd3,f1d3,r2qkbnr/ppp4p/4pp2/3p1bp1/1n1P4/2NBPNB1/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 3 8,Black realizes taking the King Bishop is as the cost of developing White's Queen!
16,Nh6,g8h6,r2qkb1r/ppp4p/4pp1n/3p1bp1/1n1P4/2NBPNB1/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 4 9,"Black decides to do another Caro-Kann move moving a night into a ""corner"" where it serves while Black develops at the cost of White."
17,Bb5+,d3b5,r2qkb1r/ppp4p/4pp1n/1B1p1bp1/1n1P4/2N1PNB1/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 5 9,Immediately I see c6 for Black...
18,c6,c7c6,r2qkb1r/pp5p/2p1pp1n/1B1p1bp1/1n1P4/2N1PNB1/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 10,And so it is!
19,Ba4,b5a4,r2qkb1r/pp5p/2p1pp1n/3p1bp1/Bn1P4/2N1PNB1/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 10,The King Bishop on White is now backing up!
20,Ng4,h6g4,r2qkb1r/pp5p/2p1pp2/3p1bp1/Bn1P2n1/2N1PNB1/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 11,I'd swear Black knows the Caro-Kann.  Black is doing from a modified Caro-Kann when White opens Knight to f3--really a weak open by White. In my world White Opens e4 or d4 or loses.
