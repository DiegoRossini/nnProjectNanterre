20,Bxf6,e7f6,rnbq1rk1/p4ppp/5b2/2pp4/8/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 11,Of course if 11... Qxd5?? then 12. Bxh7 . But here my main intention was to target the black King and the knight was already aiming to e7.

23,Rb1,a1b1,rnbq1rk1/p4ppp/8/2pN4/8/3BPN2/Pb3PPP/1R1QK2R b K - 1 12,Black tries to counter by attacking the queen side. By forcing black to precipitate an attack White is slowing down Black's development.
24,Qa5+,d8a5,rnb2rk1/p4ppp/8/q1pN4/8/3BPN2/Pb3PPP/1R1QK2R w K - 2 13,Black tries to counter by attacking the queen side. By forcing black to precipitate an attack White is slowing down Black's development.
25,Nd2,f3d2,rnb2rk1/p4ppp/8/q1pN4/8/3BP3/Pb1N1PPP/1R1QK2R b K - 3 13,This is great move. White blocks the check and in the same time opens the diagonal so that later the Queen can attack the Black's King

28,Bxd2,c3d2,rnb2rk1/p4ppp/8/q1pN4/8/3BP3/P2b1PPP/1R1Q1RK1 w - - 0 15,A very bad move for Black. Black should have taken measures to protect the King. For example 14... g6.
29,Bxh7+,d3h7,rnb2rk1/p4ppB/8/q1pN4/8/4P3/P2b1PPP/1R1Q1RK1 b - - 0 15,15. Bxh7! A big blow.
30,Kh8,g8h8,rnb2r1k/p4ppB/8/q1pN4/8/4P3/P2b1PPP/1R1Q1RK1 w - - 1 16,Of course if 15 ...Kxh7 will be mate in two: 16.Qh5  Kg8 17. Ne7
31,Qh5,d1h5,rnb2r1k/p4ppB/8/q1pN3Q/8/4P3/P2b1PPP/1R3RK1 b - - 2 16,Now the only defence is for Black to threat the White Queen. Otherwise Bg6 followed by Qh7.
32,Bg4,c8g4,rn3r1k/p4ppB/8/q1pN3Q/6b1/4P3/P2b1PPP/1R3RK1 w - - 3 17,The only option.
33,Qh4,h5h4,rn3r1k/p4ppB/8/q1pN4/6bQ/4P3/P2b1PPP/1R3RK1 b - - 4 17,The only option.
34,Qd8,a5d8,rn1q1r1k/p4ppB/8/2pN4/6bQ/4P3/P2b1PPP/1R3RK1 w - - 5 18,The only option.
35,Ne7,d5e7,rn1q1r1k/p3NppB/8/2p5/6bQ/4P3/P2b1PPP/1R3RK1 b - - 6 18,Black is running out of threats. Here I though the only way Black could delay defeat is by sacrificing the Queen with Qxe7.
36,g5,g7g5,rn1q1r1k/p3Np1B/8/2p3p1/6bQ/4P3/P2b1PPP/1R3RK1 w - - 0 19,Black resigned. Nothing can stop White from mating. Hope you enjoyed.
