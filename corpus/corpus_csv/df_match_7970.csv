2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Sicilian.
3,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p1P3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,This was a surprise. I can't say I've seen it before and I didn't know how to react.
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2ppP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq d6 0 3,"I think I had a pretty good solution. White's choice is whether or not to take d5 by en passant. If he does, his center pawns will be weak, and this is what I was gambling on."
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2ppP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"In retrospect I should have taken d4, forced his queen out for risk of losing a pawn, and then developed Kc6, putting black ahead in development and with initiative."
6,b6,b7b6,rnbqkbnr/p3pppp/1p6/2ppP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"In retrospect I should have taken d4, forced his queen out for risk of losing a pawn, and then developed Kc6, putting black ahead in development and with initiative."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/p3pppp/1p6/2ppP3/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,c4 indicates that he is planning to attack my d4 pawn.
8,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkbnr/p3pppp/1p6/2ppPb2/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,c4 indicates that he is planning to attack my d4 pawn.

10,e6,e7e6,rn1qkbnr/p4ppp/1p2p3/2ppPb2/2PP4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Into the damned French Defense. I use it only sparingly, since I always feel claustrophobic. Thankfully I freed my Queenside bishop first. Still regretting not taking d4 earlier. It becomes my primary target in the moves to come."
11,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qkbnr/p4ppp/1p2p3/2ppPb2/2PP4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,Still planning to attack my d4 pawn.

14,dxc4,d5c4,rn1qkb1r/p3nppp/1p2p3/2p1Pb2/2pP4/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"Black's main goal here is to open up the board. The French Defense is feeling a little constrained, and I'm tired of being on the defense and not having initiative."

23,Na4,c3a4,r2qkb1r/5ppp/ppn1p3/4Pb2/N2p4/5N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 12,A mistake. This loses the knight.

I'd like to keep the bishop pair, but it looks like I'm going to have to use a bishop to do the trade. Even so it looks like my best option for doing that is to fianchetto. That will also free up the king so I can finally castle, which I've put off so I could accomplish my previous goals."
