The gk computer doesn't disagree but only adjusts -.12.  As I write this, I haven't analyzed the game at all and do not know exactly where the game really went wrong.  So, let's see."

For one, I tend to want to conserve bishops.  For another, my games vs Pete are often characterized by a trade down leading to a painful endgame.  So I try to hang on to my men for a while this game."
