1,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/2N5/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 1,!.Nc3 again!  Nonetheless this move is highly transpositional as will be the case in this contest.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/8/2N5/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 2,A good reply!  1...d5 generally gives the 1.Nc3 player exactly what they are looking for.  There are lots of options for Black.  The French option with 1...e6 planning ...d5 soon is probably the most solid.  Ditto for 1...c6.
3,e4,e2e4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,A possible Alekhine or Center Counter?  A Sicilian was played here once with 2...c5 to which I replied 3.Nf3.  Interesting is 2...Nc6.
4,e5,e7e5,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Vienna?
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,No Vienna today.  One can get into a Center Game after 3.d4 exd4 4.Qxd4 Nc6 5.Qe3.
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,"Four Knights, but is it a Scotch 4N or a Spanish 4N?  This move order avoids some minor Three Knights lines.... ( For example, 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Nc3 f5 or 3....g6 )"
7,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1B2p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 4,Perhaps we end up in a Spanish Game: Modern Steinitz after move 8...a5.
