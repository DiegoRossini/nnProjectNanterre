3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,c6 doesn't mean you abandon the center. You are even not late. It is like a call on whites cards and intentions.

5,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3pP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"Caro-Kann Defense advance variation position
Blacks have options (Bf5/C5/F6!/etc.) even if there is an advanced e5.
This position gives me focus on e5 and d4. Once d5 is down whites are mostly done as I know that many players can not resist to play e5."
6,c5,c6c5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2ppP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"The first step to get ride of e5 is to attack strongly d4.
The game between V. Promyshlyanskiy vs Daniel Fridman during the LGA Premium Cup (09/08/2006) illustrates it."
