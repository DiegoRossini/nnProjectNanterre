1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

I bet you are asking yourselves, disaster for whom?  Well, you only need one guess.  This performance was as bad as the Fried Fox Pork Chop Affair.  I am taking part in a mini-tournament organised by the Master Mater called The Annotations Project.  This is where we will be brainstorming an opening which involves a Q for 2 piece sacrifice arising out of the Sicilian Grand Prix Attack.  The first seven moves were set up as forced moves.  The action therefore starts on move 8 after Henry was forced to go to d7."
