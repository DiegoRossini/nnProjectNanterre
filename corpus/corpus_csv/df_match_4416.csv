1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"My opponent starts off with the King's pawn opening. At this point, I decided to play an unusual, but well-known opening."
2,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,The King's Pawn Nimzovich Defence (B00).
3,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/1B6/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 2,"This wasn't one of the lines. 2.Nf3 and 2.d4 are continuations for this defence, and 2.b4 is the Wheeler Gambit."
4,Nd4,c6d4,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/8/1B6/3nP3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 3 3,"Since my opponent wasn't doing anything much to my Knight (such as pinning the Knight to the King), I decided to strike back at his Bishop, an unnecessary idea."
5,Bc4,b5c4,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2BnP3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 4 3,"Aftre this, I chose not to chase the bishop any further, but I am setting myself up to win one of his two pieces."
6,e6,e7e6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/2BnP3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 4,"White's knight attacks my Knight, but instead of retreating it, I take White's Knight."
7,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/2BnP3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"White's knight attacks my Knight, but instead of retreating it, I take White's Knight."
8,Nxf3+,d4f3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/2B1P3/5n2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"Whatever I do, I should never play e5 until one of those two white pieces moves away. In the meantime, I am still trying to play d5."

13,exd5,e4d5,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3P4/2B5/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 0 7,"I have no idea what White is trying to accomplish. If I had to take a guess, it would be that White is trying to achieve Queenside control."
14,cxd5,c6d5,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/3p4/2B5/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB2RK1 w kq - 0 8,"I have no idea what White is trying to accomplish. If I had to take a guess, it would be that White is trying to achieve Queenside control."
