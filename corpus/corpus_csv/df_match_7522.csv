1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Based to that game i made an chess puzzle. It's one of my best black game to this moment. Weak position of black king was not fully used. White made three big mistakes ended in five moves mate on lone white King. I hope you like it, it's not upper level game, still is one of my favorites."
