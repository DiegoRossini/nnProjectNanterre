14,Qc7,a5c7,rn2kbnr/ppq1pppp/2p5/5b2/3PN3/8/PPPBNPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 5 8,"THIS is bad. The knight must go to g3 in order to make black lose a tempo defending the bishop (or more likely, retiring it to g6)."

By the way: I have a ""lot"" of experience with this opening for black, and I know very good players will beat it, or at least make great pressure over me for all the game through. So I don't recommend it, it is just my personal challenge..."

So, f7 ""cannot"" be moved, and you have to look all the time for sacrifices on e6, and play consecuently. The other move black should be aware of is e5, taking advantage of the bad position of the black king. It is a tough game for black."

This is because black's most powerful weapon would be to open the h column for the rook, even at the cost of a sac like Ng4. To be kept in the ""what if"" agenda. And, of course, because white has to keep in mind at any next move the consecuences of h4 from black."

Not a real danger for white, anyway, but still white has to take it into account. The mate threat on h2 if the h column gets opens holds, for the known Bg1+(disc) pattern."

But The problem is that if black plays the card of h4 now, this knigh has no places to go but h1...  I think that Qe1 was a better way to avoid the exchange. Plus, it sets a piece on the e column and now white does threatens f5... if black doesn't play h4 first."
