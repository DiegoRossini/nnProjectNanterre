1,b3,b2b3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

First up - I hope you have all enjoyed your Christmas and I wish all of you a Happy New Year.  I will start the New Year with a brevity.  We have all been hit over the head with the rule, do not bring out your queen too early in the opening.  Also, pawn grabbing is widely condemned. Sometimes, however, there are exceptions to these rules and this game is one of them.  I decided to kick off with an opening which has previously been unsuccessful for me to see if I can improve on it.  That opening is Larsen's Opening with 1. b3."
2,f6,f7f6,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/5p2/8/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"1. ..... f6 - unusual but according to the World DB, playable, although it does open up the Fool's Mate diagonal."
3,Bb2,c1b2,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/5p2/8/8/1P6/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,2. .... Kf7 - interesting - this is very much like my 2 unsuccessful Fried Fox Pork Chop Openings that I tried against the Master Mater and dmaestro and in both Henry came to grief.  Can I punish black in the same way?  We shall see.
4,Kf7,e8f7,rnbq1bnr/pppppkpp/5p2/8/8/1P6/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQ - 2 3,2. .... Kf7 - interesting - this is very much like my 2 unsuccessful Fried Fox Pork Chop Openings that I tried against the Master Mater and dmaestro and in both Henry came to grief.  Can I punish black in the same way?  We shall see.
5,e4,e2e4,rnbq1bnr/pppppkpp/5p2/8/4P3/1P6/PBPP1PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQ - 0 3,3. e4 - I open a line but it is one that may facilitate a broomstick ride from Glenda to the square h5.
6,e6,e7e6,rnbq1bnr/pppp1kpp/4pp2/8/4P3/1P6/PBPP1PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQ - 0 4,4. Bc4 - attacking the BK on another diagonal.

12,Ke6,f7e6,rnbq1bnr/ppp3pp/4kp2/3p3Q/2B5/1P6/PBPP1PPP/RN2K1NR w KQ - 2 7,6. .... Ke6 - the BK comes further out into the open to defend the QP but can I exploit this?

15,Bxg6,d3g6,rnbq1bnr/ppp4p/4kpB1/3p3Q/8/1P6/PBPP1PPP/RN2K1NR b KQ - 0 8,9. Bd3 - Fou Leblanc beats a hasty retreat but stays on a useful diagonal.  I will try and get my remaining pieces out asap in order to exploit the position of the BK.

18,Nf7,h6f7,rnbq1b1r/ppp2n1p/4kp2/3p3Q/8/1P1B4/PBPP1PPP/RN2K1NR w KQ - 3 10,10. Qf5+ - after Nd7? this move will cost black another pawn as the BK will have to move as it is a check at close range.
19,Qf5+,h5f5,rnbq1b1r/ppp2n1p/4kp2/3p1Q2/8/1P1B4/PBPP1PPP/RN2K1NR b KQ - 4 10,10. Qf5+ - after Nd7? this move will cost black another pawn as the BK will have to move as it is a check at close range.
20,Kd6,e6d6,rnbq1b1r/ppp2n1p/3k1p2/3p1Q2/8/1P1B4/PBPP1PPP/RN2K1NR w KQ - 5 11,11. Qxf6+ - Glenda forces an exchange of queens and I will be going into the middlegame two clear pawns up.  Although the BK is well placed in the centre now that the queens are off the board I can feel confident of forcing a victory here.  My opponent thought so and waved the white flag.
21,Qxf6+,f5f6,rnbq1b1r/ppp2n1p/3k1Q2/3p4/8/1P1B4/PBPP1PPP/RN2K1NR b KQ - 0 11,11. Qxf6+ - Glenda forces an exchange of queens and I will be going into the middlegame two clear pawns up.
