I was in two minds whether to follow this up with Nxg6 if Black allowed.  I generally like to swap Ns for Bs but in this position White's N looks much stronger than Black's B, so it would be an odd swap unless there were some concrete tactical advantage to be gained."

On the other hand, White's king is looking exposed, so, if the attack fails, Black will probably mate White quickly (but such possibilities are a long way down the line at this stage)."
