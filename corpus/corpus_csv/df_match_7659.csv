White  is expected to castle kingside. For White, he is hoping to play a pawn advancing to queenside because Black's pieces is going to concentrate on Kingside. Let's see how this is going on this example.

Dalam pembelaan Hindia Raja, Hitam berharap bisa menyerang dengan bidak-bidak ke arah sayap raja. sedangkan putih berharap bisa memajukan bidak ke sayap ratu karena buah hitam akan lebih konsentrasi di sayap raja."
