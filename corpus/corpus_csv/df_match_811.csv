1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"An unusual option against the French Defence, transforming the game into species of King's Indian Attack.  White early announces an interest in K-side operations.  Things don't quite turn out that way!"
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"An unusual option against the French Defence, transforming the game into species of King's Indian Attack.  White early announces an interest in K-side operations.  Things don't quite turn out that way!"
3,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"An unusual option against the French Defence, transforming the game into species of King's Indian Attack.  White early announces an interest in K-side operations.  Things don't quite turn out that way!"
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Good counter-attacking choice.  It's good against 2.d4; even better against 2.f4.
5,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3pP3/5P2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"Keeping the centre closed, and possibly has ideas of cramping Black's K-side."
6,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/5P2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Aimed against a possible future d4 move by White.
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/5P2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"Maintaining control over d4.  White could still play d4 if she wanted, but after, say, 5.d4 cxd4  6.Nxd4 Qb6 Black would have every reason to be happy with his position.  White waits until well prepared before playing the d-pawn forward."
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2ppP3/5P2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,"Maintaining control over d4.

9,c3,c2c3,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2ppP3/5P2/2P2N2/PP1P2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"For the next several moves, White singlemindedly prepares for d2-d4.  She has alternatives that were probably as good: 5.Be2 or even 5.b3."
10,Nh6,g8h6,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1p2n/2ppP3/5P2/2P2N2/PP1P2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,"Black has a complementary scheme in mind, building up obstacles to White's plan.   The knight is headed, then, for f5."
11,Na3,b1a3,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1p2n/2ppP3/5P2/N1P2N2/PP1P2PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 6,"Black has piled a lot of power aimed at the d4-square,  but White has more! A good alternative was 7...0-0."
12,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2n1p2n/2ppP3/5P2/N1P2N2/PP1P2PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 3 7,"Black has piled a lot of power aimed at the d4-square,  but White has more! A good alternative was 7...0-0."

15,Be2,f1e2,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2n1p3/2ppPn2/5P2/2P2N2/PPNPB1PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 6 8,"White seems unconcerned about the possibility of 8...Bh4ch.  The bishop would have to be left strictly alone as after 9.Nxh4??Qxh4ch 10.Kf1 and Black has the choice of picking up two pawns for nothing after 10...Qxf4ch, or winning the Exchange after 10...Ng3ch 11.hxg3 Qxh1ch  12.Kf2 Qxd1.  But after 8...Bh4ch 9.Kf1!, White would have been well enough placed."
16,Bd7,c8d7,r2qk2r/pp1bbppp/2n1p3/2ppPn2/5P2/2P2N2/PPNPB1PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 7 9,"Rather than go in for ...Bh4ch cheapos, Black prefers to develop."
17,O-O,e1g1,r2qk2r/pp1bbppp/2n1p3/2ppPn2/5P2/2P2N2/PPNPB1PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 8 9,"Also possible here was to begin K-side operations BEFORE castling: 9.g4!? In the event, then, of 9...Bh4ch? White can respond 10.Kf1 Nh6  11.g5 Nf5  12.Ne3."
18,O-O,e8g8,r2q1rk1/pp1bbppp/2n1p3/2ppPn2/5P2/2P2N2/PPNPB1PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 9 10,"9....Qb6 was a thematic alternative, concentrating more power against d4."

Again, 10.g4 was an aggressive, though more committal, alternative, e.g.: 10.g4 Nh4  11.Nxh4 Bxh4  12.g5!? (12.d4 is good here) 12...f6  with an unclear position.  On the whole, White was probably wiser to take the more pragmatic approach.  After all, flank attacks are really justified only if, e.g. by closing it up, one can guarantee one's opponent has no counter-measures available in the centre."

27,b3,b2b3,r4rk1/pp1bbppp/1q2p3/3pP3/3P1P2/1P6/P3B1PP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 14,"Frees the Queen's Bishop, but perhaps more flexible would have been 14.Rf3!  The idea is that on the third rank, the rook can switch from flank to flank, threatening to drive off the Queen by Rb3, and later to switch back to the K-side for an attack against the King.  The Queen's Bishop could have been developed at d2, where it, too, would have something to say on either flank."
28,Bb5,d7b5,r4rk1/pp2bppp/1q2p3/1b1pP3/3P1P2/1P6/P3B1PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 15,"Forces off the light-square Bishops, whether White takes now, or leaves that chore to Black."
