1,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"White starts of with one of their usual two openings, either c4 or, in this case, e3. My openings are unique and most would say that it is bad, but it seems to do good for me. Unless I can learn a new and better opening and remember it, I'll stick with this opening of mine."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/8/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"Already black starts with an opening I'm not used to seeing, for I don't play higher rated players much."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2P5/4P3/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"White continues their opening with c4, which is what I would usually play."
4,e5,e7e5,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2P5/4P3/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"This kind of move can confuse me. Again I'm not used to playing high rated players, so this move made me think, ""What is this?"" Of course, for someone as high rated as him, this is all part of black's plan."
5,h3,h2h3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2P5/4P2P/PP1P1PP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"This is actually an inaccuracy, says the computer analysis at least. It also says the best move was 3. Nc3, which is actually part of my opening strategy usually. Well, this is also where I begin losing, believe it or not. Just take a look at the game analysis I showed at move 1. It's not much, but it is the beginning of the end for white, but the move made keeps black's f6 knight from advancing to g4. That is what I was thinking at the time."
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2P5/4P2P/PP1P1PP1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"Something I was kinda expecting actually, having both knights out early."
7,a3,a2a3,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2P5/P3P2P/1P1P1PP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,I planned this move the moment I saw the c6 knight. Now that knight can't advance to b4. All part of white's opening.
8,d5,d7d5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3pp3/2P5/P3P2P/1P1P1PP1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"This kind of move you wonder which is better, stay or take. When I look at this though, this is when having the b1 knight on c3 would of been helpful."
9,cxd5,c4d5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3Pp3/8/P3P2P/1P1P1PP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,I decide to take.
10,Nxd5,f6d5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/3np3/8/P3P2P/1P1P1PP1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"Of course he would take back, but really, it's looking like black is gaining a positional advantage here."
11,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/1B1np3/8/P3P2P/1P1P1PP1/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 6,"I decide here to pin the knight. It can't move at this moment because of the knight being the only thing between the king. Of course, I'm sure I'll have to move it soon because black would likely play a move like a6."
12,Qd6,d8d6,r1b1kb1r/ppp2ppp/2nq4/1B1np3/8/P3P2P/1P1P1PP1/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 7,"Not what I really expected. I expected black to bring their queen out soon, but after the move I made, I wasn't totally expecting that move. Of course black must be positioning himself."
13,Qc2,d1c2,r1b1kb1r/ppp2ppp/2nq4/1B1np3/8/P3P2P/1PQP1PP1/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 3 7,"I decide to do the same. Although the computer analysis says nothing, I'm pretty certain there were better moves than this."
14,a6,a7a6,r1b1kb1r/1pp2ppp/p1nq4/1B1np3/8/P3P2P/1PQP1PP1/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 0 8,"Now black plays a6, as I was still expecting."
15,Bxc6+,b5c6,r1b1kb1r/1pp2ppp/p1Bq4/3np3/8/P3P2P/1PQP1PP1/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 0 8,"Well, I think about this move, and I don't like it. It exchanges knight for a bishop. Both knights and bishops are valuable, but in this case, my bishop's position may of been better than a trade. Thus, I think 8. Ba4 or Bc4 were better moves than Bxc6+."
16,Qxc6,d6c6,r1b1kb1r/1pp2ppp/p1q5/3np3/8/P3P2P/1PQP1PP1/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 0 9,"I expected that move. Unfortunately I am not good with thinking ahead, otherwise I know I'd be way better at chess. With that, the next move is where white starts losing control."
17,Nc3,b1c3,r1b1kb1r/1pp2ppp/p1q5/3np3/8/P1N1P2P/1PQP1PP1/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 1 9,"My first mistake was this move. Again, I don't do well looking ahead. Here's what the computer analysis predicts: 9. Nc3 Nxc3 10. Qxc3 Qxg2. Those moves will happen. After that, it gets worse for white."
18,Nxc3,d5c3,r1b1kb1r/1pp2ppp/p1q5/4p3/8/P1n1P2P/1PQP1PP1/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 0 10,It was when I made this move for fair exchange between the knights that I realized I made a mistake. I should of played 10. f3. It would of helped. I'm sure you all know where black's queen is headed.
19,Qxc3,c2c3,r1b1kb1r/1pp2ppp/p1q5/4p3/8/P1Q1P2P/1P1P1PP1/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 0 10,It was when I made this move for fair exchange between the knights that I realized I made a mistake. I should of played 10. f3. It would of helped. I'm sure you all know where black's queen is headed.
20,Qxg2,c6g2,r1b1kb1r/1pp2ppp/p7/4p3/8/P1Q1P2P/1P1P1Pq1/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 0 11,"The best move now to make is 11. Qxe5+. Black would defend and then I could protect my rook by playing Qh2. The problem is, I didn't do that."
21,Qxc7,c3c7,r1b1kb1r/1pQ2ppp/p7/4p3/8/P3P2P/1P1P1Pq1/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 0 11,"I don't know what I was thinking here. The rook is lost now and black is winning, a big blunder for white."
