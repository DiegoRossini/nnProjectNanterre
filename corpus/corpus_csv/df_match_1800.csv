1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Here I'm white playing the sicilian in a blitz game.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Here I'm white playing the sicilian in a blitz game.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Well, Nc3 could could be fine, but I have a huge preference on open lines and attack. A lot of players on gameknot do Bc4, but I don't think it's that great because there is too much counterplay after that."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"?! There is a lot of good possibilities with the sicilian in the opening. Most of the time, people continue with Nc3 or Nb5 here but since it's rare that I come to that line, I wanted to try Bc4. Bc4 was not the best option here since e6 blocks the way to the king and sometime there is a lot of counterplay with Na5 or a6+b5. I think however that it can be useful later in the game."

10,Bb4+,f8b4,r1bqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/8/1bBNP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 6,?! It give too much of counterplay and tempo for white. Ne6 would have been a better option.
11,c3,c2c3,r1bqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/8/1bBNP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"I didn't wanted to do Nc3 because after Bxc3 bxc3, my pawn structure would have looked bad. It's true that I would have gained some open lines and the bishop but I don't think it was an enough compensation. Bd2 could have been a nice possibility giving me some nice tempo. c3 give the possibility to continue with b4 and a4 later and to secure the center."
12,Bc5,b4c5,r1bqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2b5/2BNP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 7,? Very bad idea. Black waste again some tempo and lose the center.

15,cxd4,c3d4,r1bqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2b5/2BPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,?! Black should have done Ne7 here to be able to castle quickly.
16,Bb6,c5b6,r1bqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/1b2p3/8/2BPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 9,?! Black should have done Ne7 here to be able to castle quickly.

21,exd5,e4d5,r1bqk1nr/1p1p1ppp/pb6/3P4/2B5/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 11,Thinking about to do Re1+.
