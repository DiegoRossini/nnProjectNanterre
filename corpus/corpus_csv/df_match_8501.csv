I find it comical that the description in Wikipedia says ""has gained popularity after having previously been widely regarded as inferior for many years, owing chiefly to the strategic demolition that Aron Nimzowitsch (playing as White) suffered at the hands of José Capablanca in one of their games at the New York 1927 tournament."" But that happened over 80 years ago, and it's only just now gaining popularity? Maybe that wiki article was written back in the 1930s?"

Black instead opts to pin the white knight, losing a tempo by moving his bishop a second time. In return, white defends with the queen's knight, a move I got, no doubt, from the GK DB, though I don't like it much myself. Now white's queen's bishop is blocked. More to my taste would have been 5. Bf4 followed by 6. Nbd2. I don't see anything wrong with that move order, but the DB doesn't favor it."
