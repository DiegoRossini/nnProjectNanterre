1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Never a bad choice.
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Matveeva decides against the Classical response.
3,d3,d2d3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Very conservative. The usual reply is to advance this Pawn TWO squares and form an ideal center.
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Matveeva proceeds as planned.
5,Nd2,b1d2,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4P3/3P4/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"Because of the timid second move, 3 N-QB3 is no longer possible, as 3... P-Q5 would drive the Knight from its post."

9,g3,g2g3,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/4P1b1/3P1NP1/PPPN1P1P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"I'm guessing this was intended as a prelude to fianchettoing the KB. However, it weakens the pinned Knight by depriving it of Pawn protection."

11,h3,h2h3,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/8/4p1b1/3P1NPP/PPPN1P2/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,Counterattacking the Bishop. But....
