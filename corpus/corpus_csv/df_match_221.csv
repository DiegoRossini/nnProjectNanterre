1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"In today's episode of I annotate a game I enjoyed playing, we play a peculiar opening, I sac a piece for an attack, my opponent defends reasonably well, I wonder if I'm winning, and then rely on a mass of pawns to carry me to victory. In all seriousness this game was a lot of fun to play and I think shows one possible way to break down a fiancetto structure and also shows some mistakes not to fall into. This was a game in a GK tournament against a lower rated opponent and I really wanted to play well. Let's see what happened."
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"""Ah, the French"" I think."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"I don't mind playing mainline French, normally preferring the Tarrasch variations."
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3pp3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Not the french after all. This is already something of an odd move that I don't see very much. This is a Lengfellner system and seems to be good for white. It's not that this is so much of a mistake as it is just very passive. Black can play g7 and b7 and aim for some sort of hedgehog system or something similar, but giving white this nice center and easy development seems not to be such a great idea. On the other hand if you play this a lot as black you'll run into people who don't know how to break such structures down and can get an opening advantage from just general lack of knowledge on how to play against these systems."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3pp3/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"Normal development. Nf3, c4, f4 all seem totally reasonable. Even some bishop move might be fine, if somewhat commital. I like this move or Nf3 because they are flexible."
6,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2p1p/3pp1p1/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,With the pawns on d6 and e6 black needs to develop somehow.
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2p1p/3pp1p1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"The most natural square for the Knight. It seems likely black will play Nf3 or Ne7, Bg7 and O-O. I might be able to jump into g5 and really pressure this structure with this move."
8,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk1nr/ppp2pbp/3pp1p1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,Of course.
9,Be3,c1e3,rnbqk1nr/ppp2pbp/3pp1p1/8/3PP3/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 3 5,A fine place for the bishop. I was currently thinking of Qd2 O-O-O and some sort of kingside attack.
10,Bd7,c8d7,rn1qk1nr/pppb1pbp/3pp1p1/8/3PP3/2N1BN2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 4 6,This move seems slow and as Nc6 is probably coming at some point kind of tangles up black's pieces in a needless way. If I were to play black I might suggest b6 aiming for Bb7. Not how I normally play but probably fine.
11,Qd2,d1d2,rn1qk1nr/pppb1pbp/3pp1p1/8/3PP3/2N1BN2/PPPQ1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 5 6,Carrying out my clever (read obvious) plan.
12,Ne7,g8e7,rn1qk2r/pppbnpbp/3pp1p1/8/3PP3/2N1BN2/PPPQ1PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 6 7,Still passive but probably reasonably solid. I wonder if this is aiming at some f5 break after O-O. Not sure if that's good as white is clearly going queenside and so opening the kingside seems better for white but it is a plan.
13,O-O-O,e1c1,rn1qk2r/pppbnpbp/3pp1p1/8/3PP3/2N1BN2/PPPQ1PPP/2KR1B1R b kq - 7 7,Plan achieved.
14,O-O,e8g8,rn1q1rk1/pppbnpbp/3pp1p1/8/3PP3/2N1BN2/PPPQ1PPP/2KR1B1R w - - 8 8,This right now looks dubious to me. At least some Nc6 here develops and lets black consider going queenside as well. This is asking white to jam the h-pawn up the board. So of course I...
15,Bh6,e3h6,rn1q1rk1/pppbnpbp/3pp1pB/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPPQ1PPP/2KR1B1R b - - 9 8,"don.t. Clever me. This move is actually fine and something I plan on playing. Bxh6 Qxh6 with N5 to follow is clearly not good for black so taking is kind of out of the question right now and the bishop is pinned to the rook so this structure isn't going anywhere. Any time white wants to they can take on g7 and rid black of his best defender. But if I were to do it again h4 h5 and g4 g5 are really asking to be played here. Not a mistake, but also not the best. Against this structure with opposite side castles always h4. Look at the dragon. Same idea."
16,f6,f7f6,rn1q1rk1/pppbn1bp/3ppppB/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPPQ1PPP/2KR1B1R w - - 0 9,This move is really as good as any. The computer gives white about a pawn up here. But it does for most moves. Even Bxh6 about a pawn. Not great but not dead either.
17,h4,h2h4,rn1q1rk1/pppbn1bp/3ppppB/8/3PP2P/2N2N2/PPPQ1PP1/2KR1B1R b - - 0 9,Better late than never. Taking on g7 already is also fine.
18,e5,e6e5,rn1q1rk1/pppbn1bp/3p1ppB/4p3/3PP2P/2N2N2/PPPQ1PP1/2KR1B1R w - - 0 10,"This is very weakening. Striking in the center is a good idea if you're being attacking in the flank to try to create some counterplay but here d5 looks better. The main reason why I like d5 so much more than e5 is because of the holes that lead straight to the king. Also Bxh6 is...ok. Not great with pieces gathering to attack, but ok. Maybe Nc6 is also fine. Nothing to panic about yet."
19,Bc4+,f1c4,rn1q1rk1/pppbn1bp/3p1ppB/4p3/2BPP2P/2N2N2/PPPQ1PP1/2KR3R b - - 1 10,Developing with tempo and forcing the king to a corner where white controls all the square around the black king.
20,Kh8,g8h8,rn1q1r1k/pppbn1bp/3p1ppB/4p3/2BPP2P/2N2N2/PPPQ1PP1/2KR3R w - - 2 11,The computer suggesting giving the d pawn to white with 10..d5 11. Nxd5 Be6 but to me that idea almost asks white to come and rip their position open with a nice easy 12. dxe5 and it looks like black is falling apart. This is not great either but perhaps white will make a mistake in the attack? so far material is equal.
