1,g3,g2g3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/6P1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"A surprise: Benko's opening. I didn't expect my opponent to play a rare opening, because it was a youth tournament and nearly everyone played 1.e4. The point of this opening move is to put the king's bishop on the h1-a8 diagonal, so it controls some key squares in the centre (e4 and d5). I didn't know the opening theory, so I decided to just follow the rules of the opening: put your pawns in the centre, develop as fast as possible and finally bring your king to safety."

9,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3pp3/8/2N2NP1/PPPPPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 5 5,This is the novelty according to the GameKnot database. 5...Bb4 and 5...Be7 have been played before. This bishop looks a bit passive on d6.

Therefore, I have to castle as soon as possible so my king will not come under attack. Moreover, this bishop is a bit passive on d7. My coach suggests 7...O-O as an improvement, while the computer gives 7...Be5 (I don't like the computer's move since it would be the second move of that bishop in the opening while other pieces are still waiting to be developed)."
