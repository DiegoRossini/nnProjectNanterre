2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/8/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"According to the database on 365Chess.com, which I've looked up for the purpose of this annotation, this is one of 17 continuations that has been played by White.  It's joint favourite with 2. f4. This looks like a typical Bent Larsen opening."

4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/8/1P2P3/P1PP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Heading for my usual King's Indian formation which should work quite nicely with White having already eschewed e4.

The text move prepares ...d5 and gives Black's Q options on the d8-a5 diagonal.  Unfortunately, it also deprives Black's QN of its best square but I suspect I'd already decided to develop it to d7 anyway, to support the Nf6"

11,Be2,f1e2,rnbq1rk1/pp1pppbp/2p2np1/8/8/1PN1PN2/PBPPBPPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 1 6,White has a sort of reverse Queen's Indian formation but Black is not as committed in the centre as White would be if this were a normal Queen's Indian.  We're both developing very slowly and carefully here.
12,d5,d7d5,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2p2np1/3p4/8/1PN1PN2/PBPPBPPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 7,This shuts in Black's wsb but I didn't see this as a problem because it had nowhere sensible to go anyway: g4 is a poor square for the wsb when Black has fianchettoed and f5 doesn't look much better.  e6 would just hem in the e-pawn

17,Nh2,f3h2,r1bq1rk1/pp1n1pbp/2p2np1/3pp3/8/1PN1P2P/PBPPBPPN/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 9,"in the face of which, White retreats his N into the newly created hole on h2.  Perhaps 8. h3 was not a ""waiting move"" after all.  Presumably White wants to advance his f-pawn or maybe play Ng4 or deploy his B along the d1-h5 diagonal.  I decide I need to contest g4..."

The immediate threat is to the c6 pawn but that threat is easily met by ... Rc8.  More worrying for Black is the disruption that the intruder can cause to his plans and its proximity to Black's K, so Black defends the c-pawn with a more aggressive Rook move, which temporarily cuts off his B from his e-pawn but does tell the Q to buzz off straightaway."

Black can also look to shut White's pieces in by advancing his c-pawn."
