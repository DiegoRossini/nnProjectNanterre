1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"black plays a very provocative opening which allows white to set up a large central pawn mass, it is debatable whether white is overextended or not. what follows is a soup of tactics, white misses an oportunity to win a piece which gives black an advantage. white immediatly sacrifices the exchange for the initiative which can be all important in crazy tactical positions; The gamble almost pays off but white buckles at the critical moment, missing the winning continuation. Whites attack keeps going but is missing the power it had, black defends well then counter attacks and quickly mates as the white attack runs out of steam. i hope you enjoy"
