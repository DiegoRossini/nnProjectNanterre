1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"this game was decided by a decisive attack against the white king due to 

1.concentration of forces on the kingside, which allows you to sac material and still have enough force.
2.The fact that the king had no pieces really guarding it."
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,the caro kann defence. A rock solid opening that gives black a good game where he can get active pieces.
3,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,"I have played caro kann for 3 years in Class C-B level chess otb, but I haven't encountered this before.
More common is maybe 2.d4 d5 and now 3.e5 Bf5 is the advance variation, 3.exd5 cxd5  4.c4 Nf6 is the panov attack, and 4.Bd3 Nc6  5.c3 Nf6 is common too. Others include the caro kann 2 knights and 2.c4, which I have played against sometimes."
