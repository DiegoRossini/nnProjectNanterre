1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"While I'm not an extremely strong player, I know how useful it is to get a glimpse into the mind of a fairly strong player, when you're looking to improve your game. I'm going to annote games that demonstrate a certain theme.

The theme of this game is the squandering of tempo, and the special attention players need to give c2, f2, c7 and f7."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"I play 1... Nf6 no matter what white plays. 1. e4 Nf6 is a lot of fun, though (moreso than 1. d4 Nf6)."
3,e5,e4e5,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/4P3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Leading to the 4-pawn attack, a line that black equalizes in easily."
4,Nd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/3nP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"Leading to the 4-pawn attack, a line that black equalizes in easily."

6,Nb6,d5b6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/1n6/4P3/2P5/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,Threatening Nxd4.
7,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/1n6/4P3/2PP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,Threatening Nxd4.
8,d6,d7d6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/1n1p4/4P3/2PP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,Threatening Nxd4.
9,f4,f2f4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/1n1p4/4P3/2PP1P2/8/PP4PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,Threatening Nxd4.
10,dxe5,d6e5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/1n6/4p3/2PP1P2/8/PP4PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,Threatening Nxd4.
11,fxe5,f4e5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/1n6/4P3/2PP4/8/PP4PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,Threatening Nxd4.
12,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/1nn5/4P3/2PP4/8/PP4PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 7,Threatening Nxd4.
13,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/1nn5/4P3/2PP4/5N2/PP4PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 7,"The knight moves are slightly out of order, and white suffers a bit because of it. White normally brings his king's knight out after Be3 and Nc3."
14,Bf5,c8f5,r2qkb1r/ppp1pppp/1nn5/4Pb2/2PP4/5N2/PP4PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 3 8,Normal continuation. Eyeing c2.
15,Nc3,b1c3,r2qkb1r/ppp1pppp/1nn5/4Pb2/2PP4/2N2N2/PP4PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 4 8,Be2 or c5 were best. Nb4 could then be defended by Na3.
16,Nb4,c6b4,r2qkb1r/ppp1pppp/1n6/4Pb2/1nPP4/2N2N2/PP4PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 5 9,"Threatening Nc2. Black normally plays this move to play c5, since white would normally have his queen's bishop at e3 and the rook can go to c1. I'm not convinced that this move is best for black, though. 8... e6 Be3 and then Nb4, perhaps, was better."
17,Kf2,e1f2,r2qkb1r/ppp1pppp/1n6/4Pb2/1nPP4/2N2N2/PP3KPP/R1BQ1B1R b kq - 6 9,Avoiding the check.
18,Nc2,b4c2,r2qkb1r/ppp1pppp/1n6/4Pb2/2PP4/2N2N2/PPn2KPP/R1BQ1B1R w kq - 7 10,Might as well carry on.
19,Be3,c1e3,r2qkb1r/ppp1pppp/1n6/4Pb2/2PP4/2N1BN2/PPn2KPP/R2Q1B1R b kq - 8 10,10 Rb1 isn't much better. 10... e6 11 g4 Bg6 12 Bd3 Nxd4 and white stands poorly (Nxc4 will result).
20,Nxa1,c2a1,r2qkb1r/ppp1pppp/1n6/4Pb2/2PP4/2N1BN2/PP3KPP/n2Q1B1R w kq - 0 11,"I went about 6 moves deep into Nxe3, but it leads to nothing lasting. Don't get too exotic when you can pocket material."
21,Qxa1,d1a1,r2qkb1r/ppp1pppp/1n6/4Pb2/2PP4/2N1BN2/PP3KPP/Q4B1R b kq - 0 11,Is white's lead in development and strong center adequete compensation for the exchange? Looking at this position I was concerned that I'd just get steamrolled from here. I think I like white's chances here.
22,e6,e7e6,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/1n2p3/4Pb2/2PP4/2N1BN2/PP3KPP/Q4B1R w kq - 0 12,"Opens the door for my king's bishop, holds up the e pawn so the f pawn can attack it, makes d5 impractical."
23,a3,a2a3,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/1n2p3/4Pb2/2PP4/P1N1BN2/1P3KPP/Q4B1R b kq - 0 12,"? White here squanders any compensation he might get from giving up the exchange (his superior development, his strong center). This move, ultimately, serves no purpose. Black can now at least develop enough to soften white's advantage.

White should have played, oddly enough, 12. h3!, preparing g4, h4 and g5 with a kindside pawn attack."
24,f6,f7f6,r2qkb1r/ppp3pp/1n2pp2/4Pb2/2PP4/P1N1BN2/1P3KPP/Q4B1R w kq - 0 13,12. a3? allows black to take a move to hit at the white center. The lag in development won't matter quite so much after cracking white's center.
25,Be2,f1e2,r2qkb1r/ppp3pp/1n2pp2/4Pb2/2PP4/P1N1BN2/1P2BKPP/Q6R b kq - 1 13,"exf6 or Rg1 is best. Rg1's a hard one to see here, but the threat of g4 and g5 isn't to be taken lightly. after 13. Rg1 Bg4 then 14. Ne4 or 14. exf6 and white fights on, with Bxf3 being restained by the spectre of the opening of the g-file for the rook."
26,Bg4,f5g4,r2qkb1r/ppp3pp/1n2pp2/4P3/2PP2b1/P1N1BN2/1P2BKPP/Q6R w kq - 2 14,"Threatening Bxf3, where white's faced with capturing with the king and further exposing his majesty, capturing with the g pawn and leaving the h pawn isolated and weak, or capturing with the bishop, allowing Nxc4."
27,Rf1,h1f1,r2qkb1r/ppp3pp/1n2pp2/4P3/2PP2b1/P1N1BN2/1P2BKPP/Q4R2 b kq - 3 14,"? Does nothing, threatens nothing, restrains nothing. I like 14. Ne4 Be7 here."
28,Bxf3,g4f3,r2qkb1r/ppp3pp/1n2pp2/4P3/2PP4/P1N1Bb2/1P2BKPP/Q4R2 w kq - 0 15,"Nimzowitsch's idea of 'putting the question' to pinning pieces can be applied to a capture like this. Up the exchange, I make a routine trade now, when the method of recapture determines the further play. White has 3 choices, none of them good."
