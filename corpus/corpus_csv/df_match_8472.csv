1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"In between reading the writing on TV adverts and the Sun newspaper, I happened across the Queen's Pawn opening in a book. A little knowledge is a dangerous thing and it is exclusively how I open as white."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"A45 Indian Defense. The immediate development of the Knight is the most supple response to the Queen's Pawn opening, allowing transposition into virtually every type of defense at Black's disposal."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Click-whirr...auto-pilot engaged.
4,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Uh? You're not supposed to do that. Apparently, this is the Benoni Defence."
5,d5,d4d5,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2pP4/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"A56 Indian Defense / Modern Variation 2.c4 c5.

Glad this has a name - I didn't want to relinquish the centre."
6,b5,b7b5,rnbqkb1r/p2ppppp/5n2/1ppP4/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"A57 Indian Defense / Benko Gambit. The Benko Gambit is a distinct pawn-offer, promising long-term pressure on White's Queenside.

Won't he leave that pawn alone?"
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/p2ppppp/5n2/1ppP4/2P5/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,"Out of Opening Book. cxb5 would have been in the Indian Defense / Benko Gambit book opening. Slightly better is cxb5. 

Back to click-whirr..."
8,bxc4,b5c4,rnbqkb1r/p2ppppp/5n2/2pP4/2p5/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"Slightly better is b4.

I figure I can pick that back up later with my bishop."
9,Bf4,c1f4,rnbqkb1r/p2ppppp/5n2/2pP4/2p2B2/2N5/PP2PPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 1 5,I ought to have moved my pawn to E4.
10,d6,d7d6,rnbqkb1r/p3pppp/3p1n2/2pP4/2p2B2/2N5/PP2PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,I ought to have moved my pawn to E4.

12,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/p3pp1p/3p1np1/2pP4/2p2B2/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"Attacks Black's pawn at c4.

Ah, did it finally."
13,e4,e2e4,rnbqkb1r/p3pp1p/3p1np1/2pP4/2p1PB2/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"Attacks Black's pawn at c4.

Ah, did it finally."
14,Qa5,d8a5,rnb1kb1r/p3pp1p/3p1np1/q1pP4/2p1PB2/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,"Pins White's knight at c3.

Chessmaster wasn't a big fan of this move. Keep an eye on his bishop on C8."
15,Ng5,f3g5,rnb1kb1r/p3pp1p/3p1np1/q1pP2N1/2p1PB2/2N5/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 2 8,"Leads to 8...h6 9.Nf3 Nxe4 10.Bxc4 Nxc3 11.bxc3 Qxc3+ 12.Nd2 Qf6 13.Be3 Bg7 14.Rb1 O-O 15.O-O, which wins a knight and a pawn for a knight and two pawns. Better is Nd2, leading to 8...Qb4 9.Bxc4 Nh5 10.Be3 Qxb2 11.Nb5 Na6 12.Rb1 Qf6, which wins a pawn for a pawn. This was white's most significant mistake, but white was still able to manage a draw. 

To add to that last comment....""because it guarantees a win overall for his opponents team"" ;-)"
16,Nbd7,b8d7,r1b1kb1r/p2npp1p/3p1np1/q1pP2N1/2p1PB2/2N5/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 3 9,"As soon as I had moved my knight, I realised he should have done H6. It would have forced me to move my knight again and I would have lost the pawn on E4. I didn't move the knight though - why not compound mistakes?"
17,Bxc4,f1c4,r1b1kb1r/p2npp1p/3p1np1/q1pP2N1/2B1PB2/2N5/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 9,"Blocks Black's pawn at c5 and makes way for a castle to the kingside. White wins a pawn. Material is even.

Instead, Chessmaster says I should have brought my knight down to F3 and then D2."

I agonised over this move. Things felt like they were going downhill fast from here."

More pressure on the A1 diagonal. I desperately wanted to get rid of that bishop of his."
