As is well known, two knights cannot force mate against a bare king, because at the crucial moment the defender's king will be stalemated. However, if the defender has a pawn, the stalemate does not arise, so it is possible to force mate. Almost all of the research on this endgame was carried out by the legendary Russian analyst and study composer, Alexey Troitzky, in the early years of the 20th century. Troitzky's achievement is remarkable, as he analysed the endgame single-handedly, with no prior published theory or practice on which to build, and, of course, no computer help. He identified the basic plan, the techniques for corralling the defender's king, and he even worked out precisely where the defender's pawn needs to be, on each file, in order for the position to be a win. A few later analysts tidied up some loose ends, but almost all of the credit for solving this ending goes to Troitzky. The biggest compliment to the quality of his work came in 1995, when John Nunn published Secrets of Minor Piece Endings. This was part of a series of books in which Nunn updated and corrected established endgame theory for new discoveries thrown up by the early This ending is one of the most tech-generations of computer endgame tablebases.

The basic technique for winning the endgame is always the same, and consists of three stages: 1. The stronger side blockades the enemy pawn with one of his knights. 2. He then drives the defender's king into a corner, using his own king and the other knight. 3. Having cornered the king in the corner, he brings over the blockading knight to effect mate.
Obviously, when he commences stage 3, he has to release the blockade on the pawn, which will then advance. It is important that the pawn cannot promote before the knights are ready to give mate, and this in turn means that the pawn needs to be blockaded far enough back to ensure that this is the case. For various reasons, the line behind which the pawn must stand is not uniform, and it varies depending on which file the pawn stands. Troitzky identified the full line, which is as follows (the diagram assumes that White is the stronger side and that we therefore have a black pawn): 
Despite Troitzky's analysis, the end­ing is extremely complicated and far from easy to handle well, even for top grandmasters. In practice, when this ending arises, it tends to be drawn rather more often than it is won.

He then drives the defender's king into a corner, using his own king and the other knight. 3. Having cornered the king in the corner, he brings over the blockading knight to effect mate.
Obviously, when he commences stage 3, he has to release the blockade on the pawn, which will then advance.

He then drives the defender's king into a corner, using his own king and the other knight. 3. Having cornered the king in the corner, he brings over the blockading knight to effect mate.
Obviously, when he commences stage 3, he has to release the blockade on the pawn, which will then advance. It is important that the pawn cannot promote before the knights are ready to give mate, and this in turn means that the pawn needs to be blockaded far enough back to ensure that this is the case. For various reasons, the line behind which the pawn must stand is not uniform, and it varies depending on which file the pawn stands. Troitzky identified the full line, which is as follows (the diagram assumes that White is the stronger side and that we therefore have a black pawn):

He identified the basic plan, the techniques for corralling the defender's king, and he even worked out precisely where the defender's pawn needs to be, on each file, in order for the position to be a win. A few later analysts tidied up some loose ends, but almost all of the credit for solving this ending goes to Troitzky.

The basic technique for winning the endgame is always the same, and consists of three stages: 1. The stronger side blockades the enemy pawn with one of his knights. 2. He then drives the defender's king into a corner, using his own king and the other knight. 3. Having cornered the king in the corner, he brings over the blockading knight to effect mate.
Obviously, when he commences stage 3, he has to release the blockade on the pawn, which will then advance. It is important that the pawn cannot promote before the knights are ready to give mate, and this in turn means that the pawn needs to be blockaded far enough back to ensure that this is the case. For various reasons, the line behind which the pawn must stand is not uniform, and it varies depending on which file the pawn stands. Troitzky identified the full line, which is as follows (the diagram assumes that White is the stronger side and that we therefore have a black pawn): 
Despite Troitzky's analysis, the end­ing is extremely complicated and far from easy to handle well, even for top grandmasters. In practice, when this ending arises, it tends to be drawn rather more often than it is won.

The basic technique for winning the endgame is always the same, and consists of three stages: 1. The stronger side blockades the enemy pawn with one of his knights. 2. He then drives the defender's king into a corner, using his own king and the other knight. 3. Having cornered the king in the corner, he brings over the blockading knight to effect mate.
Obviously, when he commences stage 3, he has to release the blockade on the pawn, which will then advance. It is important that the pawn cannot promote before the knights are ready to give mate, and this in turn means that the pawn needs to be blockaded far enough back to ensure that this is the case. For various reasons, the line behind which the pawn must stand is not uniform, and it varies depending on which file the pawn stands.

The basic technique for winning the endgame is always the same, and consists of three stages: 1. The stronger side blockades the enemy pawn with one of his knights. 2.

Obviously, when he commences stage 3, he has to release the blockade on the pawn, which will then advance. It is important that the pawn cannot promote before the knights are ready to give mate, and this in turn means that the pawn needs to be blockaded far enough back to ensure that this is the case.

He identified the basic plan, the techniques for corralling the defender's king, and he even worked out precisely where the defender's pawn needs to be, on each file, in order for the position to be a win.

The basic technique for winning the endgame is always the same, and consists of three stages: 1. The stronger side blockades the enemy pawn with one of his knights. 2. He then drives the defender's king into a corner, using his own king and the other knight. 3. Having cornered the king in the corner, he brings over the blockading knight to effect mate.
Obviously, when he commences stage 3, he has to release the blockade on the pawn, which will then advance. It is important that the pawn cannot promote before the knights are ready to give mate, and this in turn means that the pawn needs to be blockaded far enough back to ensure that this is the case. For various reasons, the line behind which the pawn must stand is not uniform, and it varies depending on which file the pawn stands. Troitzky identified the full line, which is as follows (the diagram assumes that White is the stronger side and that we therefore have a black pawn):

Almost all of the research on this endgame was carried out by the legendary Russian analyst and study composer, Alexey Troitzky, in the early years of the 20th century. Troitzky's achievement is remarkable, as he analysed the endgame single-handedly, with no prior published theory or practice on which to build, and, of course, no computer help. He identified the basic plan, the techniques for corralling the defender's king, and he even worked out precisely where the defender's pawn needs to be, on each file, in order for the position to be a win.

The basic technique for winning the endgame is always the same, and consists of three stages: 1. The stronger side blockades the enemy pawn with one of his knights. 2. He then drives the defender's king into a corner, using his own king and the other knight. 3. Having cornered the king in the corner, he brings over the blockading knight to effect mate.
Obviously, when he commences stage 3, he has to release the blockade on the pawn, which will then advance. It is important that the pawn cannot promote before the knights are ready to give mate, and this in turn means that the pawn needs to be blockaded far enough back to ensure that this is the case. For various reasons, the line behind which the pawn must stand is not uniform, and it varies depending on which file the pawn stands. Troitzky identified the full line, which is as follows (the diagram assumes that White is the stronger side and that we therefore have a black pawn):
