10,Be6,c8e6,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n1b3/4P3/2Pp4/5NP1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,I think maybe I should have played b3 instead. This move blocks in my bishop.

15,O-O,e1g1,2kr1bnr/pppq1ppp/2n1b3/4P3/2Pp4/5NP1/PP1NPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 6 8,Maybe he was thinking about a pawn storm attacking my king?

21,b5,b4b5,2kr1b1r/pppq1pp1/2n1b2p/1P2Pn2/2Pp4/P4NP1/3NPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 11,I advance.
22,Na5,c6a5,2kr1b1r/pppq1pp1/4b2p/nP2Pn2/2Pp4/P4NP1/3NPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 12,"I planned on removing his knight and resuming my attack, but the GK computer tells me that this is an inaccuracy. After black plays Bxc4, my attack is diffused."
23,Qa4,d1a4,2kr1b1r/pppq1pp1/4b2p/nP2Pn2/Q1Pp4/P4NP1/3NPPBP/R1B2RK1 b - - 2 12,"I planned on removing his knight and resuming my attack, but the GK computer tells me that this is an inaccuracy. After black plays Bxc4, my attack is diffused."

Interestingly, the computer calls this a mistake, that black should play c6. What the computer doesn't know is I would be perfectly happy with a draw by perpetual check against an opponent this strong."
