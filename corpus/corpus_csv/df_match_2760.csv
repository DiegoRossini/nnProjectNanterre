8,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/3p4/2p5/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"This move actually surprise me, black didn't play a normal looking move such as Nf6 or g6, but c5 was played, attacking the knight."
9,Nf3,d4f3,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"Nf3 was played, this wasn't an accurate move, may be Bb5+ is stronger, because Nf3 allows black to play Bg4."

If I were black I would keep the lsb, instead of playing bxf3 I would play g6 and prepare for Bg7, because pawns on c5 and d6 is blocking the dsb. Bg7 allows the dsb to work on a better diagonal."
