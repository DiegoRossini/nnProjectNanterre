1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,Just a normal opening.
2,b6,b7b6,rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/1p6/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,"Odd, but playable."
3,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/1p6/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,A good way to keep him from doing what he wanted to.(Ba6)
4,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/p1pp1ppp/1p6/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,Still nothing drastic.
5,Nxe5,f3e5,rnbqkbnr/p1pp1ppp/1p6/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"It might be threatened next turn, but still worth it."
6,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/p1p2ppp/1p1p4/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,See what I meant?
7,Nf3,e5f3,rnbqkbnr/p1p2ppp/1p1p4/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,I could also play Nd3 if I chose.
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/p1p2ppp/1pnp4/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,Black chooses to develop his QK.
9,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/p1p2ppp/1pnp4/1B6/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 5,"It'll be protected soon, but it develops my bishop and forces him to waste a move."
10,Bb7,c8b7,r2qkbnr/pbp2ppp/1pnp4/1B6/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 6,"A good move, although Bd7 would have been better."
11,O-O,e1g1,r2qkbnr/pbp2ppp/1pnp4/1B6/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 5 6,I had to fit this in somewhere.
12,Qf6,d8f6,r3kbnr/pbp2ppp/1pnp1q2/1B6/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 6 7,It's ok.
13,Nc3,b1c3,r3kbnr/pbp2ppp/1pnp1q2/1B6/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 7 7,I probably should have played e5.
14,a6,a7a6,r3kbnr/1bp2ppp/ppnp1q2/1B6/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,Aahh!
15,Bd3,b5d3,r3kbnr/1bp2ppp/ppnp1q2/8/4P3/2NB1N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 8,So annoying.
16,b5,b6b5,r3kbnr/1bp2ppp/p1np1q2/1p6/4P3/2NB1N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 9,"Eccentric, but not bad."
17,Nd5,c3d5,r3kbnr/1bp2ppp/p1np1q2/1p1N4/4P3/3B1N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 9,"He will move his queen, of course."
18,Qh6,f6h6,r3kbnr/1bp2ppp/p1np3q/1p1N4/4P3/3B1N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 10,Said so.
19,Nxc7+,d5c7,r3kbnr/1bN2ppp/p1np3q/1p6/4P3/3B1N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 10,Now he's forced to move his king instead of protecting his rook.
20,Kd8,e8d8,r2k1bnr/1bN2ppp/p1np3q/1p6/4P3/3B1N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 11,"This forces me to make that move right away, but its ok."
