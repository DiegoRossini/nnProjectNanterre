2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Sticking to Classical lines.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Traditional.

5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2pP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,Developing.
6,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2p5/2pP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Trying to KO the White center, since my QP has been diverted."

8,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/8/2pp4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,I proceed as planned.
9,Bxc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/8/2Bp4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,Clears the way to castle. Right at this moment the Tigers hit a home run and I made my next move without looking carefully at the board.
10,dxe3,d4e3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/8/2B5/4pN2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,I figured on being a Pawn up after 6 QxQ ch KxQ in return for losing the right to castle. But...
