1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"In the second Annotation Project Steve took maximum points from me. Up to this point in this tournament most of my games had been with the black pieces and I was struggling for points. To me, it started to feel black was as good as lost before a move was made. Now was a chance to try and prove it!"

20,Kb6,c7b6,rn2qb1r/pp2p1pp/1kp1N3/8/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 3 11,"A favoured move of mine in the last tournament which seemed to serve me well so with the black king even more restricted this time by the c6 pawn, surely this can only make the position even better for me. This opens a line for the black bishop to deliver a check. It is important for white to develop quickly, whilst keeping pressure on the king at the same time."

Almost certain I would need both rooks if I was to convert this position into a full point, it made sense to get my own king to safety. It was nice to have the luxury of a bit of time, and I wanted to see how black would proceed."
