1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi Everyone!

I have some really mixed emotions here!  On the one hand, I am chuffed to gain parity with my on the board nemesis in chief, Freddy the Master Mater, on the other, I somehow feel I could have got even more out of the game if I had had Henry on b1 instead of a1 to allow my knight to interpose a back row check so that my heavies and my g pawn passer could really get to work.  Alas, this did not happen, and my advantage dissipated and at one time Freddy had a big advantage in the endgame.  Thankfully he slipped up and allowed me back into the game, and not only that, he found himself playing reluctant host to Glenda and her white steed late on in the game.  Freddy eventually allowed a draw by repetition.  So, how did all this come about?  Well, read on......."
