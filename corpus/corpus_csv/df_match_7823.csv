Just simple count how many pieces your opponent has guarding the capture piece and then count how many pieces you have attacking the piece.  If the number you have attacking the piece is greater than the number defending the piece then it is safe to take it. 

In this position by using the above formula you can see that it is not safe to take the pawn. White has 2 defenders vs your 2 attackers. So if you want to take the pawn you have to add another piece to attack it. For example, ...Re3 would a good idea."
