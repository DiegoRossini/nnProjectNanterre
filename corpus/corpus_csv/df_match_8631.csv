	This game is a demonstration of the difference in efficiency between active and passive pieces. If the objective is mate then one needs to retain only the bare minimum to fulfill the goal of checkmate. But only limited favorable situations can lead to the tightened noose around hostile king's neck. We frequently encounter a dilemma where inferior material side furiously prevails over superior forces due to more effective performance of their pieces, creating tricks available to them. Here I was ready to give away one of my pawns for superior position increasing the scope of fire power of my pieces which give opportunity of obtaining not decisive, but a noticeable advantage in the placement of my pieces.]"

[Filipp Frenkel:
	I played this game more than 40 years ago, when theory of chess openings was measured in reams of paper, not gigabytes. No matter how it is measured, opening theory is nothing more than a compilation of some, but never all, the idiotic garbage spiced with some nice gems there and here in rare corners of the ocean of mixture of slime, that was played by players who thought much more about what they were doing than whoever compiled the theory. There is so much richness in the uncounted trillions of possibilities that no chess player can hope to memorize enough to cover even a limited area. And by trying to specialize in memorized openings, woodpushers (even titled and high-rated woodpushers) blind themselves to new and creative ideas.
	7...Nf6 is an important innovation which even now is rarely if ever played. One point, aside from offering the b7-pawn, is that white now has no time for Bg5, which is otherwise a main response to 7...Nc6. 
(7 ... Nc6 8. Bg5 Nf6 is one common move order today, rendered obsolete 43 years ago by 7...Nf6.) ]"

The value of pieces is relative to the position. White's knight and light squared bishop are worth more than black's queen.

[Filipp Frenkel comments: 	People are thrilled by exceptions rather than by rules. Imagine: a pawn is worth one dollar, a knight $3.25, a bishop $3.50, a rook $5.30, a queen $10.30, and the king is priceless. Chess is a mirror of life, and the prices of goods change. Now, the price of white's knight and bishop is higher than black's queen.

	It's known that three pieces can often overplay a queen positionally, even in the absence of some combination which regains the queen. Sacrifice of queen for only two pieces is much rarer and more spectacular- looking. I had seen this idea before, in some few other games, and the pattern had suggested itself to me once 12. a3 revealed white's intentions. Queen for two pieces is really only the equivalent of sacrificing a piece, and we do know often enough the value of sacrificing a piece. ]"
