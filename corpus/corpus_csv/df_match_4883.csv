However, I recently lost a few games with Evans Gambit and Guioco Piano openings so I decided to change this game. I didn't realise until after I played my move that it was the same opening that we played in our previous game or I may well have avoided it."

6,d6,d7d6,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,"An unusual response to the Ruy Lopez. It opens the knight to be pinned, but provides some support to e5. My personal opinion is that it is weak for Black."
7,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/1B2p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,I grab at the centre with d4 and he exchanges pawns. I really wasn't sure which piece to take with here - I chose to leave my knight where it is and develop my queen.
8,exd4,e5d4,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/1B6/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,I grab at the centre with d4 and he exchanges pawns. I really wasn't sure which piece to take with here - I chose to leave my knight where it is and develop my queen.

10,Bd7,c8d7,r2qkbnr/pppb1ppp/2np4/1B6/3QP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 1 6,Rather expected - protects his knight but also releases the pin to attack my queen in the centre of the board.
11,Bxc6,b5c6,r2qkbnr/pppb1ppp/2Bp4/8/3QP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 6,"I thought he might take with the bishop after developing it to d7. I really didn't expect my opponent to double his pawns after our previous game, which involved a lot of exchanges and was quickly at a knight and pawn ending. GK analysis pits this as 'Inaccuracy'."

13,Nc3,b1c3,r2qkbnr/p1pb1ppp/2pp4/8/3QP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 1 7,Standard development of the knights followed by a castle - I do think I probably should have played 10. Bg5 here though. I think the reason I didn't was not to give him a reason to play Be7 yet.

26,Ra8,d8a8,r3k2r/p1p1bppp/2N1bn2/2p5/8/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 w k - 2 14,I've forced the Black rook back into the corner in it's attempt to save a pawn (and the knight-rook exchange).
27,Nxe7,c6e7,r3k2r/p1p1Nppp/4bn2/2p5/8/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b k - 0 14,"I saw Nb5 and it looked good until I saw the line 14. Nb5 Bc4 15. Nxc7+ Kd7 16. Nxa8 Bxf1 17. Kxf1 Kxc6... with me losing my other knight shortly after. If there is a better alternative, I'd like to hear it. So instead I decide to rid my opponent of his bishop pair, as I'm sure he was trying to keep them and they can be very dangerous!"
