1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Here shows the danger of the Lolli attack. My opponent blundered but my attack was still going to be quite strong and he discovered that this Lolli wasn't very sweet.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I decided to play the Italian game. While considered toothless it still has some dangerous lines if black isn't prepared for them. It however has been overshadowed by it's big brother the Ruy Lopez.

8,d5,d7d5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3pp1N1/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,Not Bc5 the Traxler gambit which is a pretty wild game
9,exd5,e4d5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3Pp1N1/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,?! Preferred is Na5 this is because of Nxf7 (The fried liver attack) and d4 the Lolli.

Fischer-Snuske continued:
...Kxf7 8. Qf3+ Ke6 9. Nc3 9... Bb4 10. Bxd5+ Kd6
11. Bxc6 Bxc3+ 12. bxc3 bxc6 13. O-O Be6 14. dxe5+ Kd7

14,Nxd4,c6d4,r1bqk2r/ppp1bNpp/8/3np3/2Bn4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,??? Oh no
15,Nxd8,f7d8,r1bNk2r/ppp1b1pp/8/3np3/2Bn4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,Black resigns however I planned on Kxf7 Qf3+ and then I had a variety of lines which I will post once I find them.
