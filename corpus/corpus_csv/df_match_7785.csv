2,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Robatsch Defence. A more restrained line in which White is allowed to form the classical centre, while Black starts building a citadel for his monarch, aiming to put pressure on White's centre later."

The move played prevents Nb5 and Bb5 (irrelevant, since I was not planning on making either move) and also prepares for the advance of the queenside phalanx."

Still, out of eight games reaching this position 7... b4 was never played, so perhaps it isn't so good if played immediately. Can anyone help me out here?"
