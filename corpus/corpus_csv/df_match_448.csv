1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This game is a training match with one of my teammates in the Kingslayers.  We appreciate your contributions to this annotation so we can all learn together.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"Alekhine's defense.  Not a personal favorite (I really like Petrov), but very playable.  I like it when I get to practice in training games too."
3,e5,e4e5,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/4P3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Although a common play is 4. c4 instead, I prefer to get my knight into the mix first, even though it prompts the inevitable Bg4 response from Black."
4,Nd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/3nP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"Although a common play is 4. c4 instead, I prefer to get my knight into the mix first, even though it prompts the inevitable Bg4 response from Black."
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/3nP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"Although a common play is 4. c4 instead, I prefer to get my knight into the mix first, even though it prompts the inevitable Bg4 response from Black."
6,d6,d7d6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p4/3nP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Although a common play is 4. c4 instead, I prefer to get my knight into the mix first, even though it prompts the inevitable Bg4 response from Black."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p4/3nP3/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"Although a common play is 4. c4 instead, I prefer to get my knight into the mix first, even though it prompts the inevitable Bg4 response from Black."
8,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p4/3nP3/3P2b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,We are all book play so far with no surprises on either side.
9,Be2,f1e2,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p4/3nP3/3P2b1/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 5,We are all book play so far with no surprises on either side.
10,Bxf3,g4f3,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p4/3nP3/3P4/5b2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"A surprise!  I was expecting Black to play e6 instead.  This move is a mistake for Black.  Although it is uncommon to see a mistake this early, it is worth exploring why.  The threat of violence is often more potent than the actual violence itself."
11,Bxf3,e2f3,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p4/3nP3/3P4/5B2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"I have no other choice worth considering, but now Black is in a bit of a hole because his knight is being threatened and I essentially got a free strong position for my LSB.  Knights vs bishops is a debate that many have, but a long diagonal for a bishop is never a good thing to let your opponent have."
12,dxe5,d6e5,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3np3/3P4/5B2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"An interesting choice.  I was expecting c6, which is a much stronger move.  c6 protects the knight and gives an egress for the queen to threaten Qa5+.  This move, while giving the appearance of being strong, actually exposes Black to some serious jeopardy early on."
13,c4,c2c4,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3np3/2PP4/5B2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,"And here we are.  Notice that Black's rook is in danger and will almost certainly be traded for a bishop.  With proper play Black will only go down a pawn, but positionally, White is in great shape."
14,Nf4,d5f4,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/4p3/2PP1n2/5B2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 8,Looking to cash in on Nxg2+ perhaps?  Black's knight's defense fe5 is tenuous.  I think Nb6 is a better play - stronger defense on the knight and allows capture of c4.
15,Bxb7,f3b7,rn1qkb1r/pBp1pppp/8/4p3/2PP1n2/8/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,No other course worth discussing for White
16,c6,c7c6,rn1qkb1r/pB2pppp/2p5/4p3/2PP1n2/8/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,A blunder... better to play Nd7 by far.  Perhaps hoping to equalize with Nxg2+?
17,Bxf4,c1f4,rn1qkb1r/pB2pppp/2p5/4p3/2PP1B2/8/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 0 9,Removing the threat of the knight check and that rook isn't going anywhere...
18,exf4,e5f4,rn1qkb1r/pB2pppp/2p5/8/2PP1p2/8/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 10,"Hoping to salvage a castle and soldier on.  Although being down a rook sucks, everyone makes mistakes and you can still get back in a game."

30,f3,f4f3,5rk1/p3bppp/2Q1p3/8/2Pq4/2N2p2/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 16,Seems premature as e5 would have protected it allowing for some pawn march madness.
31,Rad1,a1d1,5rk1/p3bppp/2Q1p3/8/2Pq4/2N2p2/PP3PPP/3R1RK1 b - - 1 16,tactical tempo gain.
32,Qe5,d4e5,5rk1/p3bppp/2Q1p3/4q3/2P5/2N2p2/PP3PPP/3R1RK1 w - - 2 17,I was expecting the queen to protect the pawn instead... This move also potentially allows for a second tempo move later with Rf1e1 as a queen check.
