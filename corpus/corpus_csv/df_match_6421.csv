1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is my latest battle against kaboes, who, as I write, is currently 2nd in the Fast Ladder.  I'm 71st.  My record hitherto against him doesn't look bad but I think all my wins came relatively early in our history.  Anyway, looking for a hoick up the ladder, I decide to play a solid opening...

This commentary was written before reading the computer analysis.  I've then added computer commentary.  I think this demonstrates that I didn't have a clue what was going on most of the time!"
2,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The dreaded Dutch, his favourite response, against which I have not done well."

7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppp2pp/4pn2/5pB1/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,Both sides have played natural developing moves so far.  This pawn prevents my N from going to e5.

16,Bxf6,e7f6,r1bqk2r/ppp3p1/2nppb1p/5p2/2PP4/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 9,Now Black has the advantage of the bishop pair
17,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk2r/ppp3p1/2nppb1p/5p2/2PP4/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 1 9,"Here come the pawns anyway.  This seems to be easier for Black to achieve with the Dutch than with, say, the King's Indian, since Black doesn't have to muck about with his KN to enable his f-pawn to advance.  The computer prefers 9...0-0"

20,Ne5,c6e5,r1bqk2r/ppp5/3ppb1p/3Pnpp1/2P5/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 1 11,...but every pawn move leaves two squares that were previously defended undefended.  So Black hops his N onto one of them.

22,Nxd3,e5d3,r1bqk2r/ppp5/3ppb1p/3P1pp1/2PN4/2NnP3/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 12,Now Black takes the opportunity to make it 2 Bishops against 2 Knights.  Which is better in this position?
23,Qxd3,d1d3,r1bqk2r/ppp5/3ppb1p/3P1pp1/2PN4/2NQP3/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b kq - 0 12,Clearly Black doesn't like that balance...
