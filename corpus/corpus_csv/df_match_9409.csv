1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!  This game was played against a nine-year old boy called Adam.  Incredibly I was 20 years older than him when this was played.  This was to be my only game out of quite a few games against him that I would get anything other than The Blob, so I was really chuffed by this one victory."
