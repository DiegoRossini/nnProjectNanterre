1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"A lost game simply because key pieces were taken out of the game by whites clever positioning. My queen was on the run, so to speak, and I never really recovered. I would appreciate your comments on anything you would have done differently.


White starts with (A04) the Reti opening."
2,Na6,b8a6,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/n7/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 2,I respond accordingly
3,e4,e2e4,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/n7/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,White takes control of the centre
4,d5,d7d5,r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/n7/3p4/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,I put pressure on the centre pawn - no issues here. Another possibiltiy for black is ...d6. 3. Nc3 e5 and allowing ny bishop to progress...we then move into the Vienna (C25).
5,exd5,e4d5,r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/n7/3P4/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,he removes my pawn
6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/n4n2/3P4/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,"Qxd5 is a good option here, but I choose to develop the kings knight. On reflection Qxd4 would have been better although white is still ahead...bf4 and white following with his move, exchanging pieces on a6 might have let me catch up."
7,Bb5+,f1b5,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/n4n2/1B1P4/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 4,"...in check. I thought d4 would have been a stronger move for white here considering he is ahead and to maintain momentum. But who am I to say, I lost!!"
8,Bd7,c8d7,r2qkb1r/pppbpppp/n4n2/1B1P4/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 3 5,I respond accordingly
9,Bc4,b5c4,r2qkb1r/pppbpppp/n4n2/3P4/2B5/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 4 5,"white could exchange bishops, but chooses to retreat. I thought also that white would have weakened me by removing my a6 knight followed by d4 to strengthen the centre."
10,Nb4,a6b4,r2qkb1r/pppbpppp/5n2/3P4/1nB5/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 5 6,and I decide to put pressure on the d file pawn

16,Bc8,g4c8,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/1nBN4/2N2P2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 9,and I get the hell out also thinking about e6.
17,d3,d2d3,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/1nBN4/2NP1P2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 9,white develops
