1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,A seemingly logical pawn push by my opponent gave me a decisive advantage.  I have the black pieces.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"With this unusual move, I had to wonder what I was up against."
3,a3,a2a3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/P7/1PPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"With this unusual move, I had to wonder what I was up against."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/P7/1PPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,The pawn pushes on both edges look like blitz moves; black is allowed a major lead in development.
5,d3,d2d3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/P2P4/1PP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,The pawn pushes on both edges look like blitz moves; black is allowed a major lead in development.

7,h3,h2h3,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/2b1p3/4P3/P2P3P/1PP2PP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,The pawn pushes on both edges look like blitz moves; black is allowed a major lead in development.
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/4P3/P2P3P/1PP2PP1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"Prepares an escape square for the DSB, when the d4 thrust comes."
9,c3,c2c3,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/4P3/P1PP3P/1P3PP1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"Prepares an escape square for the DSB, when the d4 thrust comes."
10,a6,a7a6,r1bqk2r/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/2b1p3/4P3/P1PP3P/1P3PP1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"Prepares an escape square for the DSB, when the d4 thrust comes."

12,d6,d7d6,r1bqk2r/1pp2ppp/p1np1n2/2b1p3/4P3/P1PP1N1P/1P3PP1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"DSB is established and safe outside the pawn chain.  White can, and does, push the d pawn and constrict black's position, but I think I will still be OK after this."

14,Ba7,c5a7,r1bqk2r/bpp2ppp/p1np1n2/4p3/3PP3/P1P2N1P/1P3PP1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,"The resultant constricted position.  However, I think I can transfer the N to g6 and have a setup I've sometimes seen my favorite speed player in Harvard Square, Raoul, play countless times, with two adjacent knights."
15,d5,d4d5,r1bqk2r/bpp2ppp/p1np1n2/3Pp3/4P3/P1P2N1P/1P3PP1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,"The resultant constricted position.

Were Bd4 or a queen move better?  White, however, seems to be moving toward a swift Kingside attack, and this N move fits that general idea I guess."
18,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/bpp1nppp/p2p1n2/3Pp3/4P3/P1P2N1P/1P1N1PP1/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 3 10,"Unsure whether it was safe, I decide to castle into what might become a storm.  I believe White has good attacking possibilities, but..."
19,g4,g2g4,r1bq1rk1/bpp1nppp/p2p1n2/3Pp3/4P1P1/P1P2N1P/1P1N1P2/R1BQKB1R b KQ - 0 10,"...this isn't one of them.  I can get three pawns for my undeveloped LSB, and disrupt the White King's safety as part of the bargain.  I think this may be considered the losing move."
20,Bxg4,c8g4,r2q1rk1/bpp1nppp/p2p1n2/3Pp3/4P1b1/P1P2N1P/1P1N1P2/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 0 11,The fortuitous exchange sequence begins

At this point, perhaps Rh2, accepting the trade of R for N, was white's best option.  Alternatively, he can move the queen to avoid the threatened Q-R fork."
23,Qe2,d1e2,r2q1rk1/bpp1nppp/p2p4/3Pp3/4P1n1/P1P2N2/1P1NQP2/R1B1KB1R b KQ - 1 12,"But this isn't the right square.  If 10. g4 isn't immediately losing, this is.  The queen now must be given up to avoid mate."
24,Bxf2+,a7f2,r2q1rk1/1pp1nppp/p2p4/3Pp3/4P1n1/P1P2N2/1P1NQb2/R1B1KB1R w KQ - 0 13,Forcing a nasty choice.

27,Qxe3,e2e3,r2q1rk1/1pp1nppp/p2p4/3Pp3/4P3/P1P1QN2/1P1N1b2/R1BK1B1R b - - 0 14,"Ahead 6 points, I trade whenever possible."
