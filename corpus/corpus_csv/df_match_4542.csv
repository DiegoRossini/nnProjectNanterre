3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Black is planning to fianchetto the bishop and then attack the white centre from the flanks.

7,f4,f2f4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/3PPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"Meanwhile, White has a number of set-ups available, the most common are the classical variation (4.Nf3) and the sharp Austrian Attack (4.f4), which I play in this game."
8,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"The other main move is 5...c5, after which I would surely have gone for the famous drawing line 6.Bb5+ Bd7 7.e5 Ng4 8.e6 fxe6 9.Ng5 Bxb5 10.Nxe6 Bxd4 11.Nxd8 Bf2+ 12.Kd2 Be3+ 13.Ke1 Bf2+ with perpetual check (there are ways to deviate for Black, but then White has a better position). I would've been very content with a draw against such a strong player, but now I'm glad it didn't end this way. After the text move I had to think on my own."
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PPP2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,"The other main move is 5...c5, after which I would surely have gone for the famous drawing line 6.Bb5+ Bd7 7.e5 Ng4 8.e6 fxe6 9.Ng5 Bxb5 10.Nxe6 Bxd4 11.Nxd8 Bf2+ 12.Kd2 Be3+ 13.Ke1 Bf2+ with perpetual check (there are ways to deviate for Black, but then White has a better position).

11,Be3,c1e3,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/3PPP2/2N1BN2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 4 6,"!? The main move is 6.Bd3. However, this move is the second most played move on the DB and it does prevent the normal ...c5 break. I was unaware of the theory at the time, so just tried to develop."
12,Ng4,f6g4,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p2p1/8/3PPPn1/2N1BN2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 5 7,"?! Played almost instantly, as if he knew that this was the refutation of my previous move. Not knowing the theory, I thought he knew what he was doing and came to the conclusion that 6.Be3!? was not so strong a move. But when I showed the game to someone at my club who plays the Pirc himself, he said that this was too early. The normal moves here are 6...b6 and 6...Nc6."
13,Bc1,e3c1,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p2p1/8/3PPPn1/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQ - 6 7,"!? Not quite what I wanted to play, but I thought it  was not a big problem because I can chase back the Knight with h3 and then put my bishop back on e3. I have then lost a tempo by playing h3, but maybe that's not a lost tempo after all as it does prepare a pawn storm on the kingside. Normal here is 7.Bg1."
14,c5,c7c5,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p2p1/2p5/3PPPn1/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 0 8,"And there we have it, the usual Pirc break."

Maybe he thought my opening play was bad and tried to refute it, but didn't think he'd refute it by just playing normal Pirc moves such as 9...Nf6. Or maybe he wanted to keep ...f5 as an option."
16,cxd4,c5d4,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p2p1/8/3pPPn1/2N2N1P/PPP3P1/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 0 9,"?! A strange decision. This knight is very badly placed at h6, as we'll see later in the game.

The immediate 12.f5!? is then answered by 12...Nxd4! 13.Bxd4 Bxd4 14.Qxd4 gxf5 but White still keeps a good position. The try to prepare it with 12.Nxc6?! bxc6 and then 13.f5 can now be answered by 13...Qb4! when 14.Bxh6? fails to 14...Qxb2!."
