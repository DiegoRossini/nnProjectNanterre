With Black's 3rd move, she adds to her control of e4 by pinning the white knight. It also indicates a willingness to trade the bishop for the knight once White plays a3. This queen move allows White to recapture without doubling his pawns, although in that case Black can often then gain time with ...Ne4, forcing the queen to move a third time in the opening. Time, pawn structure, development, and bishop vs. knight are always important to keep in mind, but are especially common themes in the Nimzo-Indian."

With e3, White plays a useful move that begins his king-side development while guarding the d-pawn, although for the time being it concedes the e4 square to Black. As it turns out, the book reply is 5. dxc5. I'm not overly familiar with the books, and just try to play what makes sense in the opening, but I realized later that I had entered a position where BLACK has a whopping 54% to 35% advantage in the GK database."

The first plan seemed rather limited, so I looked at the second. I thought Black might reply in one of three ways: Rfe8, Ne4, and e5. I decided I could handle e5, although worried about one variation that ended with f3 being forced on White, creating ugliness around the king. Rfe8 also ultimately did not discourage me either. Ne4 looked tough. It would force Bb2 or Bxe4 and I liked neither. So I started looking at a4 again and realized Black's best move was 13... Ne4, and I couldn't effectively stop it! I began looking at Nd2. It also eyes e4, and if 13... Ne4, then 14. Nxd2 Bxe4 looked okay.
