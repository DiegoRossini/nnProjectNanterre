1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

On Sunday at my father's house, my 5 year old daughter Charlotte spotted a chess set and some old wooden pieces.  She wanted me to give her a game.  Charlotte took the black side and I decided to go through how the pieces moved in a real game of chess.  Charlotte had been watching a battle chess tutorial so she had some idea of how the moves went and how the pieces captured.  I explained to her that white moved first and I started off with my trusty 1. e4."
2,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,1. ...... f5? - Charlotte decided to put her pawn on f5.  I told her it was a bit of a mistake as now my pawn can capture hers by moving diagonally.  So I then played 2. exf5.
3,exf5,e4f5,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5P2/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,3. Nc3 - good old fashioned sensible development here.
4,a6,a7a6,rnbqkbnr/1pppp1pp/p7/5P2/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,3. Nc3 - good old fashioned sensible development here.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/1pppp1pp/p7/5P2/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,3. Nc3 - good old fashioned sensible development here.
6,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/1pp1p1pp/p2p4/5P2/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,4. Bd3 - noticing my f pawn was en prise I decided to back it up with Fou Leblanc.
7,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqkbnr/1pp1p1pp/p2p4/5P2/8/2NB4/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 4,4. Bd3 - noticing my f pawn was en prise I decided to back it up with Fou Leblanc.
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/1pp1p1pp/p2p1n2/5P2/8/2NB4/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 2 5,4. ...... Nf6 - after a few pawn moves I had to correct Charlotte as she moved her knight to g6.  I told her she had a choice of Nf6 or Nh6.  She decided to put her knight on f6.
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/1pp1p1pp/p2p1n2/5P2/8/2NB1N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 5,6. 0-0 - I decided to keep in the habit of getting Henry to safety even though my opponent is not the Master Mater!
10,b5,b7b5,rnbqkb1r/2p1p1pp/p2p1n2/1p3P2/8/2NB1N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,6. 0-0 - I decided to keep in the habit of getting Henry to safety even though my opponent is not the Master Mater!
11,O-O,e1g1,rnbqkb1r/2p1p1pp/p2p1n2/1p3P2/8/2NB1N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 6,6. 0-0 - I decided to keep in the habit of getting Henry to safety even though my opponent is not the Master Mater!
12,Bd7,c8d7,rn1qkb1r/2pbp1pp/p2p1n2/1p3P2/8/2NB1N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 7,6. ...... Bd7 - Charlotte put her bishop on c6.  I had to correct her there and remind her that bishops move diagonally.  She then decided to place her light squared bishop on d7.
13,b3,b2b3,rn1qkb1r/2pbp1pp/p2p1n2/1p3P2/8/1PNB1N2/P1PP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,8. ..... Nc6 - Charlotte is beginning to get the hang of how the knights move.
14,c5,c7c5,rn1qkb1r/3bp1pp/p2p1n2/1pp2P2/8/1PNB1N2/P1PP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,8. ..... Nc6 - Charlotte is beginning to get the hang of how the knights move.
15,Bb2,c1b2,rn1qkb1r/3bp1pp/p2p1n2/1pp2P2/8/1PNB1N2/PBPP1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 1 8,8. ..... Nc6 - Charlotte is beginning to get the hang of how the knights move.

17,Ne4,c3e4,r2qkb1r/3bp1pp/p1np1n2/1pp2P2/4N3/1P1B1N2/PBPP1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 3 9,9. Ne4 - this looks as though I am about to give her my pawn back but if Bxf5 then she will lose a piece through Nxf6+.
18,d5,d6d5,r2qkb1r/3bp1pp/p1n2n2/1ppp1P2/4N3/1P1B1N2/PBPP1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 10,10. Nxf6+ - I decided to increase my positional advantage by exchanging pieces as I am a pawn up.
19,Nxf6+,e4f6,r2qkb1r/3bp1pp/p1n2N2/1ppp1P2/8/1P1B1N2/PBPP1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 10,10. Nxf6+ - I decided to increase my positional advantage by exchanging pieces as I am a pawn up.

I explained that she could play exf6 or gxf6 or Kf7.  She moved her king.  It looks as though she has merely lost a piece, but wait, what I now see is a ........."
21,Ng5#,f3g5,r2q1b1r/3bpkpp/p1n2N2/1ppp1PN1/8/1P1B4/PBPP1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 2 11,"11. Ng5# ...... MATE!!  When I explained to Charlotte what checkmate was and that there was no way she could get out of check and she had lost the game she was inconsolable.  She eventually turned off the waterworks about 5 minutes later.  In some ways I can understand, after all, in the pre-Freddy era I used to resign if I saw mate coming.  Now when I know I am about to be Freddied I either put the kettle on for a cup of Rosie Lee or if it is in the evening, a nice glass of vino to drown my sorrows!  I told Charlotte that chess is a long hard road but one day she will know what it is like to win a game."
