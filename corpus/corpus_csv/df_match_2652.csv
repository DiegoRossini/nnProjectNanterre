However I had to tap into all my resources but eventually I managed to grind out an edge which eventually turned decisive"

But don't get me wrong, the position isn't anymore than marginally more comfortable for white, realizing an advantage is still a long way off, the position is that after this its white who now gets to probe for an edge well black will have to react"
