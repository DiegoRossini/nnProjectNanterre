I believe the Deep Blue Computer famously beat Kasparov with it in 1996 - the first game to be won by a chess-playing computer against a reigning world champion under normal chess tournament conditions, and in particular, normal time controls.

5,d3,d2d3,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/4P3/2PP4/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"3. d3 is not as aggressive - and not as good for that matter - as the standard 3. e5. I was tempted to play d5 and expected in reply either 4. Nd2 or 4. e5 Nf6-d7 and, after a later d4 by white we will go into a position similar to a variation of the Tarrasch Variation of the French Defence(1. e4 e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nd2 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7) where Black has an extra tempo because White has wasted a move by playing d3 and then d4. I thought at the time that Black would struggle to make the extra tempo count in a blocked position. I went for something more ambition. But wrongly! After the game a glance at the Gameknot World Database shows d5 was the better move."

9,Bxf6,g5f6,rnbqk2r/pp1pbppp/5B2/2p1p3/4P3/2PP4/PP3PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,I really don't understand this unforced exchange of minor pieces by White. On the databases I can only find games with 5. Nf6. However Black seems to have the better of those games.

I was a bit afraid of him closing up the centre with 7. c4, ruling out ....d5 for ever. I thought that in that position his knights may be at least equal to my bishops. Computer seems to prefer Nc6 or 0-0 and black stands slightly better. What do you think dear reader?"

In the meantime he has a backward d pawn on a semi-open file, I have the 2 bishops and more space. What more could one want after just 7 moves? Compute prefers 7.

I thouhght that if he castles, h4 and his knight is forced back to h1 where is has no influence. I can follow with moves like Be6, 0-0-0 and g5 and a ready-made attack on his castled King.
