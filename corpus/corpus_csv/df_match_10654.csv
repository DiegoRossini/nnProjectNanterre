1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I'm a 1. d4 player. Always have been. Lately, I've been studying the Queen's and Nimzo Indian systems - and I ran across this game. I've never heard of this Sashin fellow, but the name Korchnoi cetainly caught my eye. I have come of the opinion that the strong GM types consider the Queen's and Nimzo Indian systems a little slow and boring (and most often drawish), but if it's good enough for Korchnoi it's good enough for me. Or so I thought......This is a wild game. Sashin plays solidly, and delivers an extremely subtle, but beautiful 23rd move which starts the fireworks. Korchnoi gets through the opening in solid position, and then goes totally nuts with a brutal attack during the middlegame (at one point delivering 11 consecutive checks!) which marches the white king all the way across the board. Then, just like THAT! - all of his initiative is gone, and Sashin's awesome 23rd move gem tells the tale of victory. Was it brilliant insight into the position? or was it just dumb luck? I don't know....but this IS a pretty game! As always, my meager analysis will be limited. I hope you enjoy:)"

The reason I give 8. a3 a ""?!"" is that although black's dark squared bishop is strong, it currently is only exerting influence on c3. Perhaps 8. Bd2 was better?
