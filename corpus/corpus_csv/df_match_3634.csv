1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,E4 my favorite opening move. c5 attacks d4 & Nf3 protects
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,E4 my favorite opening move. c5 attacks d4 & Nf3 protects
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Nc6 adding more pressure to d4. Not too worried about that at this time so I will develop Bc4 aiming at f7
