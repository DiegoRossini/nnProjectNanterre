24,Re8,f8e8,r1bqr1k1/4bppp/p3pn2/3p4/3B4/2NQ1P2/PPP1B1PP/R3K2R w KQ - 4 13,King in the center so launching the attack immediately on the opposing king..!
25,O-O-O,e1c1,r1bqr1k1/4bppp/p3pn2/3p4/3B4/2NQ1P2/PPP1B1PP/2KR3R b - - 5 13,Its High time so castled Queen side bcoz there are less pawns on the queen side to launch an immediate attack on the white king also queen rook comes into play and attacks center.
26,Bd7,c8d7,r2qr1k1/3bbppp/p3pn2/3p4/3B4/2NQ1P2/PPP1B1PP/2KR3R w - - 6 14,Preparing a violent attack from queen side against white..!

30,Nh5,f6h5,r2qr1k1/3b1ppp/p2bp3/3p2Pn/3B4/2NQ1P2/PPP1B2P/2KR3R w - - 1 16,Defending the Knight at the same time attacking the pawn with an opportunity to fork queen and bishop if white saves the pawn. Clearly Black has the upper hand over here I admit that black could have easily won by taking my light colored Bishop on e2. Again with two Bishops advantage over Knight and a Bishop along with good center control...!!
31,Rdg1,d1g1,r2qr1k1/3b1ppp/p2bp3/3p2Pn/3B4/2NQ1P2/PPP1B2P/2K3RR b - - 2 16,No other option but to guard the falling g-pawn. Rdg1 and not h4 since g3 then becomes vulnerable point for white where black's Knight can easily exploit.

35,Bf2,d4f2,r2qr1k1/3b1ppp/p2b4/3pp1P1/5n2/2N2P2/PPPQBB1P/2K3RR b - - 1 18,Slight alteration to black's move He played d4 which is not a good move since it gives White Knight an Outpost on e4! and did not take my Bishop on e2 which was again wrong option.
36,Bb4,d6b4,r2qr1k1/3b1ppp/p7/3pp1P1/1b3n2/2N2P2/PPPQBB1P/2K3RR w - - 2 19,Slight alteration to black's move He played d4 which is not a good move since it gives White Knight an Outpost on e4! and did not take my Bishop on e2 which was again wrong option.
