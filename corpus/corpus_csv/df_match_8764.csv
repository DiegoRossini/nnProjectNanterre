The only way I move on is to win both of my games against my opponent in this game, in which case I am in a 2-way tie for first place in our group at 5-1."

A rook on d8 supported by the bishop on g5 would be checkmate. There is the small matter of black's queen and knight - time to drive them off. It's worth noting that there are lots of things black can do to prevent this checkmate. It's risky to make bad moves that might end in a checkmate, especially if your opponent has simple ways to escape the mate. So, if the checkmate you want to play for is not a forced checkmate, then make sure the moves you make along the way are sound moves so that you don't leave yourself worse off for trying for the failed checkmate. First step, chase away black's queen. This move also places a white rook powerfully on the open d-file - always an excellent place for a rook. And it does so with a threat against black's queen, buying white a tempo."

36,Qa5+,d8a5,r1b1k2r/5ppp/4pn2/q3Q1B1/p3P3/7P/BPP2PP1/3RK2R w Kkq - 2 19,"Even better, black wants to trade queens. White is a pawn ahead and welcomes this trade. Another consideration is worth noting. Even though I drove the queen off of d8, she still protects d8. Here is a secret: When any piece moves, it automatically defends the space from which it moved. I know that sounds obvious, but consider the implications. Driving a piece from a square does not automatically mean you control the square. More often, that square is still in contention, as is the case with d8 after black's 18th move. The queen exchange will solve that."

Nd7 also would have worked with no worries about the pawns. 20. ... h6!? would have been interesting, driving the white bishop off of the h4-d8 diagonal, but at the cost of further exchanges that favor white. Still, while the mate was not expected, the moves leading up to it were all valuable moves that advanced white's game, so had black averted disaster at the end, white would have been in a solid position to go on and win the game. The final position is worthy of study. It arises in many games. The triangle formed by white's bishop and rook and the edge of the board is a common mating theme. All it takes is for a piece to exist where the black pawn at f7 is in this example. The rook and bishop cover all the squares to which the king might flee except the one diagonally away from the rook. Here black's f7 pawn contributes to the mate. This triangular checkmate formation (the diagonal between the bishop and rook form the hypotenuse) comes up surprisingly often. I call it the Bermuda Triangle. I don't know if the chess world has a different name for it. Recognizing the formation is a good way to find the checkmates and use them against your opponents, or avoid them when your opponent wants to use them against you."
