17,Be3,c1e3,r1bq1rk1/2pp1pp1/p1n2n1p/1pb1p3/4P3/1BPPBN2/PP2QPPP/RN2K2R b KQ - 1 9,"but first he must do something about his bishop. Simply defending it (e.g. 9...Qe7) isn't the best idea, since White doesn't need to exchange. Instead, he might play a move like 10.d5!, and White seems to have the better position then. Also, the other squares for the bishop didn't look like they suited it, so..."

It can't be stopped if White is determined to get there (14...Qe7 15.d4!), so Black might be better off letting it get there. So with the move he has before that, what can he do?"

This does, however, take the king off the diagonal of White's remaining bishop. The Gameknot analysis didn't mark this move as an inaccuracy, but the advantage (which had been pretty close up until now) jumped from -.36 to -.76, which means that White has the advantage."

After all, c5 was a good outpost for the knight, and with this exchange Black has the knight pair, whereas White has a bishop and knight, and the knight pair is better than that, I believe."
