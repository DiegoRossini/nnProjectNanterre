1,b4,b2b4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/1P6/8/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Another ladder challenge. My opponent opens with the colorfully named Orang-utan Opening. Also known as the Polish Opening and as the Sokolsky Opening. Evidently Tartakover dubbed it the Orang-utan opening after an ape he claims to have conversed with. You be the judge. White begins on the flank intending to control the center from the outside looking in. Black responds by charging right into the center with a move that earn's black's choice the clever title of King's Pawn Variation.

3,b5,b4b5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/1P2p3/8/8/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Well, I'm already out of what little opening book to which I might dare lay claim (98% of which I've forgotten in nearly 25 years away from competitive play). I see little purpose to white's move other than hindering my queen's knight's development, so I make a grab for the classical strong center, and the few games in the World DB agree with my choice."

5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/1P1pp3/3P4/8/P1P1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"3. d4 takes me completely out of the world DB and into ""winging-it"" territory. Thanks to white's advanced pawn on b5, defending my e5 pawn with the knight is undesirable. I also don't favor recapturing or pushing forward yet with 3. ... e4. So I settle on 3. ... Bd6 which seems a weak move for the bishop, but better than my alternatives. Now 2. b5 makes a little more sense."
