1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The Sicilian, a personal favorite of mine."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The Sicilian, a personal favorite of mine."
3,d3,d2d3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Not an idea I'm familiar with. More practiced with d4 or Nf3 lines. I decide to continue with natural development.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,?! An interesting move from my opponent. I was expecting an eventual d4 after the development of whites bishops to the center; this contests c4 and frees the long diagonal for his bishop.
5,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 3,?! An interesting move from my opponent. I was expecting an eventual d4 after the development of whites bishops to the center; this contests c4 and frees the long diagonal for his bishop.

7,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/2p5/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,?! An interesting move from my opponent. I was expecting an eventual d4 after the development of whites bishops to the center; this contests c4 and frees the long diagonal for his bishop.
8,Bd7,c8d7,r2qkbnr/pp1bpppp/2np4/2p5/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,?! An interesting move from my opponent. I was expecting an eventual d4 after the development of whites bishops to the center; this contests c4 and frees the long diagonal for his bishop.
9,a3,a2a3,r2qkbnr/pp1bpppp/2np4/2p5/4P3/P1NP1N2/1PP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,?! An interesting move from my opponent. I was expecting an eventual d4 after the development of whites bishops to the center; this contests c4 and frees the long diagonal for his bishop.

11,b4,b2b4,r2qkb1r/pp1bpppp/2np1n2/2p5/1P2P3/P1NP1N2/2P2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,?! An interesting move from my opponent. I was expecting an eventual d4 after the development of whites bishops to the center; this contests c4 and frees the long diagonal for his bishop.
12,g6,g7g6,r2qkb1r/pp1bpp1p/2np1np1/2p5/1P2P3/P1NP1N2/2P2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"I decide to do nothing about the pawn and focus on the diagonal, as well as getting my king out of trouble."
13,bxc5,b4c5,r2qkb1r/pp1bpp1p/2np1np1/2P5/4P3/P1NP1N2/2P2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"Another good natural move from my opponent, though from my earlier comment, unexpected."
14,dxc5,d6c5,r2qkb1r/pp1bpp1p/2n2np1/2p5/4P3/P1NP1N2/2P2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,"Another good natural move from my opponent, though from my earlier comment, unexpected."

17,Nb5,c3b5,r2qk2r/pp1bppbp/2n2np1/1Np5/4PB2/P2P1N2/2P2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 3 9,?? Bad idea.
18,Qa5+,d8a5,r3k2r/pp1bppbp/2n2np1/qNp5/4PB2/P2P1N2/2P2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 4 10,Bd2 and Qd2 all amount to the same thing. The knight is lost.
19,c3,c2c3,r3k2r/pp1bppbp/2n2np1/qNp5/4PB2/P1PP1N2/5PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 10,Bd2 and Qd2 all amount to the same thing. The knight is lost.
20,Qxb5,a5b5,r3k2r/pp1bppbp/2n2np1/1qp5/4PB2/P1PP1N2/5PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 11,"? In hindsight, I think Qa5 may have been slightly better. There are a lot of variations that give white decent attacking chances here, I opted to be cautious. Thoughts?"
21,Rb1,a1b1,r3k2r/pp1bppbp/2n2np1/1qp5/4PB2/P1PP1N2/5PPP/1R1QKB1R b Kkq - 1 11,"? In hindsight, I think Qa5 may have been slightly better. There are a lot of variations that give white decent attacking chances here, I opted to be cautious. Thoughts?"

24,O-O,e8g8,r4rk1/ppBbppbp/q1n2np1/2p5/4P3/P1PP1N2/5PPP/1R1QKB1R w K - 4 13,Getting my King to safety goes without saying.
25,e5,e4e5,r4rk1/ppBbppbp/q1n2np1/2p1P3/8/P1PP1N2/5PPP/1R1QKB1R b K - 0 13,"? Another questionable move. I was expecting (again) d4, which would a) develop the light squared bishop, b) attack my queen and further tighten the noose on it, c) attack my weak c4 pawn, and d) prepare for this on whites next move. Instead..."
26,Nd5,f6d5,r4rk1/ppBbppbp/q1n3p1/2pnP3/8/P1PP1N2/5PPP/1R1QKB1R w K - 1 14,I now have a counter-attack. White can choose between a fork or his bishop next move.
27,d4,d3d4,r4rk1/ppBbppbp/q1n3p1/2pnP3/3P4/P1P2N2/5PPP/1R1QKB1R b K - 0 14,"Temporary relief, if it can be called that."
28,Qxa3,a6a3,r4rk1/ppBbppbp/2n3p1/2pnP3/3P4/q1P2N2/5PPP/1R1QKB1R w K - 0 15,"Not sure what the purpose of this was. I decide to ignore it for now, and go for the jugular."

30,Qxc3+,a3c3,r4rk1/ppBbppbp/2n1P1p1/2pn4/3P4/2q2N2/5PPP/1R1QKB1R w K - 0 16,Forcing white to deal with my threats before I come back to his. Tactical complications abound.
31,Nd2,f3d2,r4rk1/ppBbppbp/2n1P1p1/2pn4/3P4/2q5/3N1PPP/1R1QKB1R b K - 1 16,"? A bad idea from me, I missed..."
32,Bxe6,d7e6,r4rk1/ppB1ppbp/2n1b1p1/2pn4/3P4/2q5/3N1PPP/1R1QKB1R w K - 0 17,"? A bad idea from me, I missed..."
33,Rb3,b1b3,r4rk1/ppB1ppbp/2n1b1p1/2pn4/3P4/1Rq5/3N1PPP/3QKB1R b K - 1 17,"! A trap of my Queen, threatening not just a capture but an even game (material wise, at least. I'm sure better players than myself will make points about minor pieces being better than a Queen or Rook by itself. This is a nuance of the game I didn't know at the time and I admit I still don't fully comprehend or appreciate). I spent a lot of time here (yes, I see that I can capture the pawn but I don't want to give up tempo)."
34,Qxb3,c3b3,r4rk1/ppB1ppbp/2n1b1p1/2pn4/3P4/1q6/3N1PPP/3QKB1R w K - 0 18,"Abandoning the attach and snatching material. I still have the bishop on c7 and pawn on d4 for compensation. Not the best move in hindsight, but we wouldn't have the strange game that follows either."
35,Nxb3,d2b3,r4rk1/ppB1ppbp/2n1b1p1/2pn4/3P4/1N6/5PPP/3QKB1R b K - 0 18,Expected exchanges.
36,Nxc7,d5c7,r4rk1/ppn1ppbp/2n1b1p1/2p5/3P4/1N6/5PPP/3QKB1R w K - 0 19,Expected exchanges.
