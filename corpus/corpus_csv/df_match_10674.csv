1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"ok, ok........just to prove that I don't just annotate my wins, here is an example of how I get absolutely crushed by my good friend mbingham. Feeling a little too confident with my own very meager skills at the chessboard, I challenge my friend to a *ahem* ""friendly"" game. I learn that mbingham is NOT just the goofy guy I hang around with at OTB tourneys - he is in reality an attacking hit man! In this game, I have the black pieces. After the opening, I feel a little under-developed but otherwise ok. It looks like I will have a little counterplay. Then my opponent launches into an attack that leaves my king feeling like Big Puss in that scene where he gets whacked on the boat. Three gunmen with weapons drawn and nowhere to run! This one is very pretty - I hope you enjoy:)"
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,I go ahead and get into Nimzo-Indian territory. I'm looking to castle quick and then fight it out on the queenside.

One of the main reasons I played 4...d5 here was to show my opponent that his 400 point rating advantage over me was not intimidating to me at all, and I was prepared to meet him head on! (lol - it's ok to laugh at me.... these are the type of little comments that run through my brain when playing chess against stronger players:)"

19,Bd3,f1d3,rnbq1rk1/p4ppp/1p2p3/2pn4/3P4/P1PBPN2/2Q2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 1 10,"! Putting a double tap on h7, developing, and preparing to castle. A very multi-purpose move. At this point I realized that my last move was weak."

The only real problem with that idea is that I have now opened up the dark squares for my opponent to attack, and he still has his dark squared bishop and I don't have mine. I started to get that sinking feeling that some misery was coming my way, and put myself into a defensive mindset. In retrospect, I realize that this kind of thinking is dangerous so early. I've been psyched out! Call Dr. Melfi !!!"

22,Nc7,d5c7,rnbq1rk1/p1n2p1p/1p2p1p1/2p5/3PP3/P1PB1N2/2Q2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 1 12,"I picked Nh7 over Nf6 thinking f5 may just be the site of our next shootout, and I didn't want to restrict my f pawn.  Keep in mind I'm still thinking defense, and want to go ahead and push my kingside pawns and rush pieces behind them. I realize now that this theory is flawed, and that I need to up my Prozac."

24,Bb7,c8b7,rn1q1rk1/pbn2p1p/1p2p1p1/2p1P3/3P4/P1PB1N2/2Q2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 1 13,"Rushing to catch up in development, and trying to come up with a plan to start something on the queenside that will distract my good friend from my weakened castled position."

30,Nc6,b8c6,r1q1r1k1/pbn2p1p/1pn1p1p1/2p1P1B1/3P3N/P1PB4/2Q2PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 7 16,"? I had to do something to get developed, but this was a poor choice. I think 15...Nd7 would have been better, with the idea of action on f6."
31,Nxg6,h4g6,r1q1r1k1/pbn2p1p/1pn1p1N1/2p1P1B1/3P4/P1PB4/2Q2PPP/R3K2R b KQ - 0 16,"! BAM! At this point I see the fallacy of taking the knight, and start to get the inkling of an idea. I end up picking up material, but didn't plan far enough ahead. It's the whole hind sight is 20/20 thing I know, but I was kind of proud of the way the following combination worked out."

While I achieve my goal of eliminating one of those pesky central pawns, and accomplish that little picture in my head, it is simply too little too late. About 5 moves ahead is my limit in tactical considerations, and my friend mbingham proves that he can see just a little bit further:)"
