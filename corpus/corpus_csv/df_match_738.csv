7,g4,g2g4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1nppp/4p3/3p4/3P1BP1/5N2/PPP1PP1P/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"...so why lose time? :-) I know ""principles"", but I try to be quicker than my opponent, and don't allow for a relaxed developement."
8,Ng6,e7g6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4p1n1/3p4/3P1BP1/5N2/PPP1PP1P/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"I can now play h4, and threat h5, making this N a sad retreater."
9,Bg3,f4g3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4p1n1/3p4/3P2P1/5NB1/PPP1PP1P/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,"I can now play h4, and threat h5, making this N a sad retreater."

When facing a rated player, one tends to be ""prudent"" and wise. In this case, this is fatally wrong, because it deprives the N from his escape square. The B in b4+ would have had a scope, and Ne7 was good for B."
11,h4,h2h4,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4p1n1/3p4/3P2PP/5NB1/PPP1PP2/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"An unsound sac. In a timed game, it would have been nice to explore things like Bxc7, at some point of the exchange, but I didn't see much of a future in this."

14,Nxh4,g6h4,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3P2Pn/6B1/PPP1PP2/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,Naive? Rxh4 didn't appeal to me on account of Qg5 afterwards. Not sure.

16,Qd7,d8d7,rnb1k2r/pppq1ppp/4p3/3p4/3P2PB/8/PPP1PP2/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 1 9,"Better would have been Qd6! Look the difference between Qb4+ and Qb5... and it blocks his own pieces, of course."
17,Qd3,d1d3,rnb1k2r/pppq1ppp/4p3/3p4/3P2PB/3Q4/PPP1PP2/RN2KB1R b KQkq - 2 9,"indirecdtly threatening h7, and blocking Qb5. More aggressive than e3. Probably stronger was Qd2, threatening Qg5. But this means allowing black Q a counterattack on the queenside."
18,e5,e6e5,rnb1k2r/pppq1ppp/8/3pp3/3P2PB/3Q4/PPP1PP2/RN2KB1R w KQkq - 0 10,"Black threatens g4. I don't want to lose it, because it means opening black lines for developement."
19,Bh3,f1h3,rnb1k2r/pppq1ppp/8/3pp3/3P2PB/3Q3B/PPP1PP2/RN2K2R b KQkq - 1 10,"Developing and threatening, but at the cost of leaving black the center."
20,e4,e5e4,rnb1k2r/pppq1ppp/8/3p4/3Pp1PB/3Q3B/PPP1PP2/RN2K2R w KQkq - 0 11,"Much better than exd, of course."
21,Qe3,d3e3,rnb1k2r/pppq1ppp/8/3p4/3Pp1PB/4Q2B/PPP1PP2/RN2K2R b KQkq - 1 11,"Now I threat Qg5, but it is not all that dangerous now. I am accepting..."
22,Qb5,d7b5,rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/8/1q1p4/3Pp1PB/4Q2B/PPP1PP2/RN2K2R w KQkq - 2 12,"I became a little scared about b3 - Qb4+, but I was wrong. after c3 the BQ's incursion would have lost power."
23,Qc3,e3c3,rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/8/1q1p4/3Pp1PB/2Q4B/PPP1PP2/RN2K2R b KQkq - 3 12,"? Qa3 prevented black to castle, and allowed for Nc3, kicking the Q."
24,c6,c7c6,rnb1k2r/pp3ppp/2p5/1q1p4/3Pp1PB/2Q4B/PPP1PP2/RN2K2R w KQkq - 0 13,"This move I wouldn't recommend. Nc6 was plain developement, but good. Note that black has an undefended B on c8, which means that I can play g5 ""for free"". But I couldn't find a good plan after g5. I am not sure now if I could have got more from it, but I am still unable to get my Q into the attack."
25,Na3,b1a3,rnb1k2r/pp3ppp/2p5/1q1p4/3Pp1PB/N1Q4B/PPP1PP2/R3K2R b KQkq - 1 13,"I only wanted to castle, defend b3 and get the Q to g3."
26,Qb6,b5b6,rnb1k2r/pp3ppp/1qp5/3p4/3Pp1PB/N1Q4B/PPP1PP2/R3K2R w KQkq - 2 14,"Back on the black squares, it has now more defensive chances."
27,Bg3,h4g3,rnb1k2r/pp3ppp/1qp5/3p4/3Pp1P1/N1Q3BB/PPP1PP2/R3K2R b KQkq - 3 14,"? Not necessary, but I wanted to prevent Qc7."
28,O-O,e8g8,rnb2rk1/pp3ppp/1qp5/3p4/3Pp1P1/N1Q3BB/PPP1PP2/R3K2R w KQ - 4 15,"? It defends Bc8, right, but... just into the fire!"
29,Bd6,g3d6,rnb2rk1/pp3ppp/1qpB4/3p4/3Pp1P1/N1Q4B/PPP1PP2/R3K2R b KQ - 5 15,"Not really strong, but I had to make room for the Q on g3 after o-o-o."
