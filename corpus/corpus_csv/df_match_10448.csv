1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The Vienna Game -- a quiet opening, whose strength often lies in the very fact that it attacks nothing -- quite often black will go for too much in an opening like this."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The Vienna Game -- a quiet opening, whose strength often lies in the very fact that it attacks nothing -- quite often black will go for too much in an opening like this."

4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,"2. ...Nf6 is more common, but this is good as well, and has the bonus that if white plays 3. f4, there is no cumbersome knight on f6 to prevent black from playing exf4 followed by Qh4 ."
5,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 3 3,"?!  This is an unusual move here.  While it's good to win the bishop pair, this is a slow move for black.  White will continue to develop while it costs black three knight moves to exchange white's ""bad"" bishop.  In return, black gets the bishop pair and doubles white's pawns."
6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 4 4,"?!  This is an unusual move here.  While it's good to win the bishop pair, this is a slow move for black.

9,Nge2,g1e2,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/n3p3/2B1P3/2NP4/PPP1NPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 5,"Continuing to develop, aiming for an f4 push."
10,g6,g7g6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1p1p/5np1/n3p3/2B1P3/2NP4/PPP1NPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"An interesting move here.  I don't think it's very good, as the pawn on e5 will certainly hamper the Bg7.  Perhaps d6 was the move to be made here, giving the Bc8 some scope, or possibly h6, preventing Bg5."
11,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqkb1r/pppp1p1p/5np1/n3p1B1/2B1P3/2NP4/PPP1NPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"!  This is an excellent response to g6, as this pin is even stronger than it would've been with a pawn on g7."
12,Bg7,f8g7,r1bqk2r/pppp1pbp/5np1/n3p1B1/2B1P3/2NP4/PPP1NPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 7,"Consistent, and it allows the queen to move away from the knight's protection."
13,f4,f2f4,r1bqk2r/pppp1pbp/5np1/n3p1B1/2B1PP2/2NP4/PPP1N1PP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 7,"If white can play fxe5 unhindered, he'll win a piece with Bxf6."
14,Nxc4,a5c4,r1bqk2r/pppp1pbp/5np1/4p1B1/2n1PP2/2NP4/PPP1N1PP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 8,Of course.
15,dxc4,d3c4,r1bqk2r/pppp1pbp/5np1/4p1B1/2P1PP2/2N5/PPP1N1PP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 8,"An important recapture -- not only is white still threatening fxe5, but he now has commanding control of d5 as well as a half-open d-file to wreak havoc upon.  fxe5 here would have been premature."
16,d6,d7d6,r1bqk2r/ppp2pbp/3p1np1/4p1B1/2P1PP2/2N5/PPP1N1PP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 9,"Necessary in order to recapture after fxe5.  Qe7 fails to Nd5!, where black loses a piece."

19,fxe5,f4e5,r1bq1rk1/ppp2pbp/3p1np1/4P1B1/2P1P3/2N5/PPP1N1PP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 10,"!  The key move of the combination, as now the Nf6 is attacked three times and cannot be defended a third.  Capturing on d5 or e4 is impossible due to Bxd8, and so black has no choice but to play a piece down."
20,dxe5,d6e5,r1bq1rk1/ppp2pbp/5np1/4p1B1/2P1P3/2N5/PPP1N1PP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 11,"!  The key move of the combination, as now the Nf6 is attacked three times and cannot be defended a third.  Capturing on d5 or e4 is impossible due to Bxd8, and so black has no choice but to play a piece down."

23,Bxf6,g5f6,r1bq1rk1/ppp2pb1/5Bpp/3Np3/2P1P3/8/PPP1N1PP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 12,The simplest way to win a piece.
24,Bxf6,g7f6,r1bq1rk1/ppp2p2/5bpp/3Np3/2P1P3/8/PPP1N1PP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 13,"I prefer Kh8 here, for reasons that will become apparent later.

Black is lost here, but the way white wins the game is a lot of fun."

28,Qe7,d8e7,r1b2r2/ppp1qpk1/5Npp/4p3/2P1P3/2N5/PPP3PP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 3 15,"Aiming for Rd8, but again, this is simply too slow."
29,Ncd5,c3d5,r1b2r2/ppp1qpk1/5Npp/3Np3/2P1P3/8/PPP3PP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 4 15,"Hitting the queen; perhaps c6 or Be6 would have been better for black last move, keeping the knight out of d5 for a little while."
