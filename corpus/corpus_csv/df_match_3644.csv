1. d4    I grew up/learned playing e4. Since joining GameKnot have been playing d4. The following moves are in the database. I do not have the knowledge to talk about the good and bad points of openings. Suffice it to say, if the database likes it, I love it."

7,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3p4/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"4. e4     This move is a first for white. Usually play e3 (twice) and the results were 1 win and 1 loss. This time round white played e4 because the database showed a higher winning percentage for white and this seems to be an aggressive move, I think another way of saying that is that this is a move with tempo. Moves with tempo are something I have learned about recently, I look for them now. It seems to help"
8,Bd6,f8d6,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/2pbp3/3p4/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"Black plays 4. ...  Bd6    Looking at the databases, this move is not in the ""World"" database but is in the ""GameKnot"" database and has been played 6 times. Going by the database black has made the best statistical move for a black victory."

16,h6,h7h6,rnbq1rk1/ppb1npp1/2p1p2p/3pP1B1/2PP4/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 9,"The database has black moving Qe8 or dxc4 next. Black decides to travel down a different path. Neither good nor bad, just different.

Blacks Knight is pinned and black is cramped for space. White thinks the h6 move is to unpin the Knight. Maybe h6 is a good move, maybe not so good a move. A chess player better than white might have an opinion one way or the other. White now have a choice to make.

Whites thought process here is between two choices. Take the Knight or retreat.

If white takes the Knight tempo is lost, whites ""projected power"" decreases and creates a crack in whites King side.

If white retreats tempo is still lost but the Knight is stilled pinned. After looking what the board would look like after retreating to h4 white moves there. White can not see a move black could make next to stop white from castling next time around.

Bottom line is white retreats and retreats to a square that keeps the Knight pinned."
17,Bh4,g5h4,rnbq1rk1/ppb1npp1/2p1p2p/3pP3/2PP3B/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 1 9,"After retreating white is expecting black to develop another piece, maybe the Knight or Bishop to d7 and if not develop then try to create some room to maneuver, like dxc4. Blacks position is cramped. White thinks black does have a few good moves to make, the defense looks solid and white just gave away tempo. All in all it seems to be an even game right now. Looks like the middle game is going to be slow and long."
18,g5,g7g5,rnbq1rk1/ppb1np2/2p1p2p/3pP1p1/2PP3B/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 10,"¿What? Chasing away the Bishop does nothing but weaken the blacks king side defense. White clicked on analyze to see what the game would looked like if it went 10. Nxg5 hxg5 11.Bxg5. White liked what was seen and so sacrificed the Knight for position. It took about 30 seconds to analyze, move and hit the submit button.

White is close to castling and complete developing. Black has castled, is behind in development, is cramped and needs to move precisely to stay in the game.

¿Could chasing the Bishop away be a fatal mistake?"
19,Nxg5,f3g5,rnbq1rk1/ppb1np2/2p1p2p/3pP1N1/2PP3B/2NB4/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 10,"Wow, white likes it. Whites projected power on the king side is impressive. Whites Bishops and Queen have a clear look at blacks King. Black needs to open the position up to move in re-enforcements. White sees the beginning of the end for black. If the Queen could hurry up and get to the h file this game is history.

White is down a point but has excellent position."

22,Qd7,d8d7,rnb2rk1/ppbqnp2/2p1p3/3pP1B1/2PP4/2NB4/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 1 12,"Alrighty then. Black does not complicate the position, does not apply any pressure, does not open up and gives the tempo back to white. Black has moved the Queen with thoughts of moving the Knight to g6. This does put a piece in front of blacks King but black is still cramped for space and more than a Knight is needed. It will soon be Blacks King, Knight and Pawn against whites two Bishops and Queen.

White clicks on the analyze button once again, this time spends 30 minutes going through the different combinations thinking surely there is a forced checkmate somewhere in here. There is. Unfortunately white did not see it and let black off the hook.

White played 12. Qh5 then 13. Bf6. Should have moved the Bishop first then the Queen, white did not see this until after moving the Queen."
