1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,54th GK Tournament. I'm playing white. I begin with the Open Game.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"2. ... f5 is The Latvian Counter-Gambit, aka the Greco Counter-Gambit. Black offers white the choice of two simultaneous gambit pawns. I choose the main line with 3. Nxe5 which threatens 4. Bc4 and 4 Qa5. I am not sure how viable this opening is for black. I suspect, in OTB club play it may take some players by surprise, getting them out of lines they are more familiar with - it certainly would have done so to me. But here, with the ChessKnot and World DB to guide any player through the rough spots, there is no surprise, only a speculative opening that seems to get black into dangerous waters very quickly in this game."

6,Qf6,d8f6,rnb1kbnr/pppp2pp/5q2/4Np2/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,Main Line. Black brings out the queen to defend against both of white's threats and to attack the white knight. 4. d4 defends the knight and opens lines for white's DSB.
7,d4,d2d4,rnb1kbnr/pppp2pp/5q2/4Np2/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,Main Line. Black brings out the queen to defend against both of white's threats and to attack the white knight. 4. d4 defends the knight and opens lines for white's DSB.

White's programmed response is 6. Be2 to enable early castling. This alternate line deviates a bit from the main line by developing white's other knight with a direct threat against the black pawn on e4 and also a two-move threat of 7. Nd5, threatening the black queen, followed by 8. Nxc7+, forking the king and rook."

Nxe4 - it may take a lot more analysis than I put into it to figure it white can hold onto that pawn. Likewise, 8. ... Ng4 is not really threatened because of 9. Nxg4 Bxg4 10. Qxg4. I would find this threat more credible if black had first played 8. h5. So white proceeds with the plan, forking the queen and the undefended pawn on c7. Black has only one good response, which finally sheds light on 7. ... Ng6 because black's bishop will need a defender after the queen retreats. Still, black is in defensive mode, planning ahead for defenses rather than making plans for attacks. This gives white a good deal of attacking confidence."

I am not familiar enough with the Latvian Counter-Gambit to know where black has gone wrong, but I don't think this was how the first 11 moves are supposed to go for black."
