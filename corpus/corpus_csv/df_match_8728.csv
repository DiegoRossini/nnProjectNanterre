9,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,"All book moves. I though about doing soemthing like the Mieses variation with Nxc6 then Bd3 or something, but figured this would be better."

Better would have been Bxc3  and then bxc6. Or something like that. I'm probably wrong, seeing as my opponent was a full 200 points higher than me."
