1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Although I like strategical interesting games, this game does not have that. Instead it contains an interaction between the white queen and the black king which lasts nine moves and leads to the demise of the black queen. It is not unlike a dance - hence the title - and not devoid of some beauty."

That is often a good idea in the defense against this opening: White is in danger of running out of attacking pieces. For instance it takes quite a while before the white knight can join the raiding party (a disadvantage of 6. c3).
