*A pin is a situation in which a piece is forced to stay put because moving it would expose a more valuable piece behind it to capture."

My initial instinct told me to take it back with my knight to develop my pieces, but then my pawn at e5 would fall... so I must do gxe5 instead.
...
But then I noticed his pawn at e4 is actually not protected since I got its defender pinned to his queen with my rook!"

so now I have to decide if I take his pawn at e4 with my rook or with my bishop?

Use Bishop: If I use bishop, I can then pin his knight at f3... 

Use Knight: I can start an attack on f2, the king's weak spot, since my black bishop is also aiming over there... The problem is that he can then take my white bishop with his knight, but after a few calculations I noticed I had nothing to fear: I can just take it back and still have a very powerful discovered check

(Discovered checks are a lot more devastating if done with a knight IMO)"

I guess the shock of the pin and seeing my queen and rook all aligned there made him rush to make this move.."

now my bishop is pinned... I cant take his rook with it since he would take my queen afterwards...

He has 3 options:
- kf1, which would be followed by Qxb2...and I end up taking one of his rooks..
- Kd1, which results in his pawn at d3 being pinned again, so I can just move my queen and keep the 2 piece advantage...

SEKRUT STRATEGIEZ: a cool psyche trick you can do in gameknot when you've studied the position, is to do conditional moves... (the link is on the bottom when you're playing a game).  Not a lot of players use these, and it can throw your enemies off balance... and it will speed things up too!"
