1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Going for slav or queen pawn. I don't have much experience with it, so I would like to try it."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Black chooses a Slav
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Black chooses a Slav
4,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Black chooses a Slav
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"Now, for some theory....."
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,I slightly more aggressive variant. Could have played e3 right away.
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 4,I slightly more aggressive variant. Could have played e3 right away.
8,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,I slightly more aggressive variant. Could have played e3 right away.
9,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,I slightly more aggressive variant. Could have played e3 right away.
10,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,"Other possibilities: h6, Be7, Bb4 or dxc4."
11,e3,e2e3,r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,Was a bit surprised. This probably is also theory. Certainly this is played a lot. It's one of the benefits of Nd7 (or Be7) that the queen is not tied to defending f6 in order to prevent a doubled pawn on the f-file
12,Qa5,d8a5,r1b1kb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/q2p2B1/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,Was a bit surprised. This probably is also theory. Certainly this is played a lot. It's one of the benefits of Nd7 (or Be7) that the queen is not tied to defending f6 in order to prevent a doubled pawn on the f-file
13,Nd2,f3d2,r1b1kb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/q2p2B1/2PP4/2N1P3/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 2 7,More attention needed on the queen side. Extra defending c4 and thus enabling a counter-thread (because Bb4 and dxc4 probably will be played).
14,Bb4,f8b4,r1b1k2r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/q2p2B1/1bPP4/2N1P3/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 3 8,Now b-pawn is about to get lost. Extra defense for c3 needed.
15,Qc2,d1c2,r1b1k2r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/q2p2B1/1bPP4/2N1P3/PPQN1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 4 8,Queen defending c3
16,dxc4,d5c4,r1b1k2r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/q5B1/1bpP4/2N1P3/PPQN1PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 9,As expected. Now it looks like it's best to trade in order to prevent too much of blacks pieces to come into play.
17,Bxf6,g5f6,r1b1k2r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pB2/q7/1bpP4/2N1P3/PPQN1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 9,Now the extra knight comes in to stop the queen.
18,Nxf6,d7f6,r1b1k2r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/q7/1bpP4/2N1P3/PPQN1PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 10,Now the extra knight comes in to stop the queen.
19,Nxc4,d2c4,r1b1k2r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/q7/1bNP4/2N1P3/PPQ2PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 10,Now the extra knight comes in to stop the queen.
20,Qd5,a5d5,r1b1k2r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3q4/1bNP4/2N1P3/PPQ2PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 1 11,Queen is bugging. I want to get some pressure of my queen-side
21,a3,a2a3,r1b1k2r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3q4/1bNP4/P1N1P3/1PQ2PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 11,Ok. I expected that. But how to recapture ? Queen or pawn?
22,Bxc3+,b4c3,r1b1k2r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3q4/2NP4/P1b1P3/1PQ2PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 12,Ok. I expected that. But how to recapture ? Queen or pawn?
23,bxc3,b2c3,r1b1k2r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3q4/2NP4/P1P1P3/2Q2PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 12,In order to keep the pawn-structure as strong as possible and at the same time creating a nice half-open file I choose to recapture with the pawn.
24,O-O,e8g8,r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3q4/2NP4/P1P1P3/2Q2PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 1 13,Smart.
25,Ne5,c4e5,r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3qN3/3P4/P1P1P3/2Q2PPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 2 13,"Without the Bishop, the knight would be lost. e5 is a nice post: it also allows for a defensive move (possibly after f6). Offensively this is a great spot."
26,b6,b7b6,r1b2rk1/p4ppp/1pp1pn2/3qN3/3P4/P1P1P3/2Q2PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 0 14,I expect development of the Bishop along the H1-A8 diagonal and the attack of my centre by means of pawns.
27,f3,f2f3,r1b2rk1/p4ppp/1pp1pn2/3qN3/3P4/P1P1PP2/2Q3PP/R3KB1R b KQ - 0 14,There is still some time. First I want to prevent the Knight from getting to e4.
28,c5,c6c5,r1b2rk1/p4ppp/1p2pn2/2pqN3/3P4/P1P1PP2/2Q3PP/R3KB1R w KQ - 0 15,Black attacks my knight-supporting pawn. Probably doesn't want it there.
29,Rd1,a1d1,r1b2rk1/p4ppp/1p2pn2/2pqN3/3P4/P1P1PP2/2Q3PP/3RKB1R b K - 1 15,Would allow for some extra backup on this file.
