1,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/2N5/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 1,"Hey hey all, I hosted a game as black and got a player who started with nc3. i dont even remember the last time i faced someone who started with this. shows how often i face this."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/2N5/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"and so i told myself ill try a new opening i discovered this week in an Annotation by CheapShotFail rated 1900+ that he called a dutch stonewall,  i did 0 research to this opening and have only seen his annotation with it but i did remember what the basic start up looked like and decided to go for it,"
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,already there are 2 differences from the game CSF annotated. first white placed his knight in front of c2 before playing c4 and i decided to play c6 instead of e6.
4,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,already there are 2 differences from the game CSF annotated. first white placed his knight in front of c2 before playing c4 and i decided to play c6 instead of e6.
5,Bf4,c1f4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3P1B2/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,hmm another big difference in the game i saw the white player chose to seal his DSB in by playing e3.
6,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/pp2p1pp/2p5/3p1p2/3P1B2/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,i still decide to move forward with the formation and choose to play f5 before e6 since my opponent didnt play his e pawn.
7,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/pp2p1pp/2p5/3p1p2/3P1B2/2N1P3/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,opens the way for his queen and lsb
8,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pp4pp/2p1p3/3p1p2/3P1B2/2N1P3/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,and so the stonewall formation is almost complete
9,Qd3,d1d3,rnbqkbnr/pp4pp/2p1p3/3p1p2/3P1B2/2NQP3/PPP2PPP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 1 5,"hmm curious reply promotes queen right away. i guess he will long castle. this delights me this opening seems to make for a strong queen side attack,"
10,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp4pp/2p1pn2/3p1p2/3P1B2/2NQP3/PPP2PPP/R3KBNR w KQkq - 2 6,develop knight
11,O-O-O,e1c1,rnbqkb1r/pp4pp/2p1pn2/3p1p2/3P1B2/2NQP3/PPP2PPP/2KR1BNR b kq - 3 6,anticipated long castle
12,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/pp2b1pp/2p1pn2/3p1p2/3P1B2/2NQP3/PPP2PPP/2KR1BNR w kq - 4 7,heading towards my castle.  another minor difference from CSF's annotation. he was able to put his DSB on d6 and also the fact white never took the time to castle in his annotation.   i prefer Be7 to a early Bb4 i can hold out my attack til i develop a bit more was my thought
13,Be5,f4e5,rnbqk2r/pp2b1pp/2p1pn2/3pBp2/3P4/2NQP3/PPP2PPP/2KR1BNR b kq - 5 7,what i noticed this game is that whites DSB being out there is stuck to the e5 and f4 squares renduring him Very weak compared to blacks DSB having a long diagonal towards whites king.
14,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp2b1pp/2p1pn2/3pBp2/3P4/2NQP3/PPP2PPP/2KR1BNR w - - 6 8,and so castle!
15,Nf3,g1f3,rnbq1rk1/pp2b1pp/2p1pn2/3pBp2/3P4/2NQPN2/PPP2PPP/2KR1B1R b - - 7 8,opponent also further develops
16,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bq1rk1/pp1nb1pp/2p1pn2/3pBp2/3P4/2NQPN2/PPP2PPP/2KR1B1R w - - 8 9,"i decide to reinforce my knight and now to quote CSF ""obvious development is complete"" here i also saw i could play ne4 to double pawn his C file or gain a rook and the f pawn if he doesnt defend appropriately. or even better a knight for a pawn if he would be foolish enough to exchange his knight on e4.  double pawning him on the c file greatly compliments my DSB and queen. man this opening has Very nice attacking potential im loving this already."
17,g3,g2g3,r1bq1rk1/pp1nb1pp/2p1pn2/3pBp2/3P4/2NQPNP1/PPP2P1P/2KR1B1R b - - 0 9,maybe looking to develop his LSB is what i thought
18,Ne4,f6e4,r1bq1rk1/pp1nb1pp/2p1p3/3pBp2/3Pn3/2NQPNP1/PPP2P1P/2KR1B1R w - - 1 10,onwards with plan
19,Qe2,d3e2,r1bq1rk1/pp1nb1pp/2p1p3/3pBp2/3Pn3/2N1PNP1/PPP1QP1P/2KR1B1R b - - 2 10,decides for the double pawn
20,Nxc3,e4c3,r1bq1rk1/pp1nb1pp/2p1p3/3pBp2/3P4/2n1PNP1/PPP1QP1P/2KR1B1R w - - 0 11,and so i decide to strike right away. maybe this is too early i dont know its my first time trying this opening. it felt right.  i believe CSF tried moving his pawns first. i told myself i could race the B and A pawns up there if he doesnt let me checkmate him.
21,bxc3,b2c3,r1bq1rk1/pp1nb1pp/2p1p3/3pBp2/3P4/2P1PNP1/P1P1QP1P/2KR1B1R b - - 0 11,and so i decide to strike right away. maybe this is too early i dont know its my first time trying this opening. it felt right.  i believe CSF tried moving his pawns first. i told myself i could race the B and A pawns up there if he doesnt let me checkmate him.

23,Kd2,c1d2,r1bq1rk1/pp1n2pp/2p1p3/3pBp2/3P4/b1P1PNP1/P1PKQP1P/3R1B1R b - - 2 12,forced. kb1 leads to mate with Qb6check
