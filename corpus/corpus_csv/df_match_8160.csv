1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is my first annotation of a chess match. This match shows that even if you are winning and about to checkmate, everything can turn around last minute. The final checkmate was pretty obvious, but I was quite oblivious. I always like to open with the king's pawn advancing two spaces"
2,b6,b7b6,rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/1p6/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"This move appears commonly, but I don't really understand the purpose of it."
3,Qf3,d1f3,rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/1p6/8/4P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"Opening with a queen is not always a smart idea, but if the opponent is not careful, checkmate can be easy."
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/p1pppp1p/1p4p1/8/4P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Another strange move I wasn't really sure about. The opponent must have been planning something.
5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/p1pppp1p/1p4p1/8/2B1P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 1 3,"Now if the opponent makes a silly move, the game is over."
6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/p1pp1p1p/1p2p1p1/8/2B1P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 0 4,"However, this is not the case. The pawn blocks the bishop's attack, so I have to come up with another plan."
7,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/p1pp1p1p/1p2p1p1/8/2BPP3/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 0 4,Releasing that pawn opens up my black square bishop.
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/p1pp1p1p/1p2pnp1/8/2BPP3/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 1 5,"That knight gets in my way, so I really need to change tactics."
9,e5,e4e5,rnbqkb1r/p1pp1p1p/1p2pnp1/4P3/2BP4/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 0 5,"I attack the knight with my pawn, hoping for it to go away."
10,Nh5,f6h5,rnbqkb1r/p1pp1p1p/1p2p1p1/4P2n/2BP4/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 1 6,It does. But what is he planning now?
11,d5,d4d5,rnbqkb1r/p1pp1p1p/1p2p1p1/3PP2n/2B5/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 0 6,Didn't really pay attention to it. My other pawn attack's my opponent's king pawn.
12,Bb7,c8b7,rn1qkb1r/pbpp1p1p/1p2p1p1/3PP2n/2B5/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 1 7,The bishop lines up an attack. I guess I can't take that pawn after all.
13,g4,g2g4,rn1qkb1r/pbpp1p1p/1p2p1p1/3PP2n/2B3P1/5Q2/PPP2P1P/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 0 7,So I decide to attack the knight. He is getting pretty close and I'm beginning to get cautious.

15,h4,h2h4,rn1qkb1r/pbpp1pnp/1p2p1p1/3PP3/2B3PP/5Q2/PPP2P2/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 0 8,"So I move my pawn up so it reduces the chance of my opponent wanting to move his knight back, not that he would want to anyway."
16,Bxd5,b7d5,rn1qkb1r/p1pp1pnp/1p2p1p1/3bP3/2B3PP/5Q2/PPP2P2/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 0 9,The first piece of the game is taken. It was my queen pawn.

19,Qxd5,f3d5,rn1qkb1r/p1pp1pnp/1p4p1/3QP3/6PP/8/PPP2P2/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 0 10,"So I take him, opening the attack on his rook."
20,c6,c7c6,rn1qkb1r/p2p1pnp/1pp3p1/3QP3/6PP/8/PPP2P2/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 0 11,He blocks me with a pawn forcing me to retreat.
