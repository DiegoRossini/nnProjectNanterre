Have vague idea about pushing my queenside passers up the board but I must make sure that my king is safe from checks.  Some queen checks in an endgame can be perpetually annoying!!  This move lays 2 traps.  If 39. ......... Qe7 then 40. Qc3 Qe3?? then the stinger discovery 41. Bxg6  comes and it is Ding Dong the Wicked Witch is dead!  Now the second trap, well ............"

He fatally abandons his f pawn and now if he moves his king to h6 then Old Matey strikes on g6.  If he plays his king to h8 then the bishop will take on g6 threatening mate on h7.  Black does have one spite check on g2 or h2 but the white king can go to a3 avoiding further checks.  Black can only delay mate on h7 by sacrificing his queen.  Black realised this and I was greeted with the white flag and found myself 3.1 rating points better off when I arrived home from work today!!"
