1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I'd played jevgeni four times before on gameknot.   Looking back over those games at the start of this one told me two things - 1) he went for unusual openings, hypermodern in the extreme with no real central presence and 2) I didn't have a great record against him (2-0-2, with white winning every time).   It's no use thinking your opponent's opening isn't great if he still beats you with it!   This time around, though, I scored a nice win."

11,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qk1nr/pbppppb1/1p4pp/8/2PPP3/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"Even with his last two moves, black is still playing very passively.   There aren't really any weaknesses in his position though, with the probable exception of the h-pawn.   He's a good three or four moves away from castling queenside, so I decide to pre-empt kingside castling with my next move (similar to my last annotated game actually)"

With kingside castling still looking odds-on, I'm not about to give up the LSB, which can drop back to b1 while still keeping the same range.   Meanwhile, black's knight can get kicked back to where it came from after an a3 push; it would retreat having gained nothing from its excursion."

This creates a fair few dark-squared weaknesses around black's king-side, and all in exchange for a knight that wasn't really going anywhere.   This will prove costly later.

It's always a danger when you're working on an attack that you completely overlook any counter-attack for your opponent.   Similarly, black deserves credit for not overlooking the counter-attack while on the defence; many a game has been needlessly lost as a result.   However, the more I looked at this move, the less concerned I was.   The a1 rook isn't in the game and is as far away as possible from the action (which is starting to swirl around the opposite corner of the board).   With the two bishops aimed at the king, there should still be enough for a winning attack.   But moves like 19. Qb2 NxR 20. QxN aren't good enough at all; the queen's mis-placed badly and maybe black can shore up his kingside a little with g5."
