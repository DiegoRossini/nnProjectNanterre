7,a3,a2a3,rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/1qp5/3p4/3PP3/P4P2/1PP3PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"!? A novelty. Ivanchuk probably wanted to prevent a future Qb4+, threatening his d4 pawn, though this is quite modest. So much for theory!"
8,e5,e7e5,rnb1kbnr/pp3ppp/1qp5/3pp3/3PP3/P4P2/1PP3PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"!?!? This move releases the tension in the centre a little too early. However, Black does want to play aggressively and develop his pieces quickly too. The normal verdict of this move would probably be unclear."
9,exd5,e4d5,rnb1kbnr/pp3ppp/1qp5/3Pp3/3P4/P4P2/1PP3PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,?! Now this is really unjustified. The normal 5...cxd5 6. c3 Nc6 gives Black a tenable game. But now the action starts...
10,Nf6,g8f6,rnb1kb1r/pp3ppp/1qp2n2/3Pp3/3P4/P4P2/1PP3PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,?! Now this is really unjustified. The normal 5...cxd5 6. c3 Nc6 gives Black a tenable game. But now the action starts...

12,Bc5,f8c5,rnb1k2r/pp3ppp/1qp2n2/2bPP3/8/P4P2/1PP3PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 7,"?! It seems logical to stake out this plan if Black played 5...Nf6, but the calm and normal-looking 6...Nxd5! is the best move, after which the chances are equal."
13,exf6,e5f6,rnb1k2r/pp3ppp/1qp2P2/2bP4/8/P4P2/1PP3PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 7,"!!! A REALLY GREAT move! Ivanchuk's play MUST be unsound, since he is neglecting development and ALLOWING Black to attack him?? He must have been awfully sure..."
