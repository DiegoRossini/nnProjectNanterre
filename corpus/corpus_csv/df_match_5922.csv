Although the d pawn is isolated as well as backward, black has adequate compensation as his minor pieces has good play on the central squares. e5 is a lovely square to put a black knight, and maybe, in some variations, black can play N(f6)-d7 and Bf6"

Nxe4 Bf3 what was I going to do? Retreating my Ne4 would lose the d pawn, if I protect it with f5 or Bf5 he can exchange on e4 and then take on d6 and if d5 then he has Nc7, then he can exchange on e6 and e4 and leave me with weak doubled e pawns. So I decided just to carry on with my plan."
