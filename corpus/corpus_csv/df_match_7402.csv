1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Two games finished recently, one which involved me being on the receiving end of a successful mating attack and in the other game I was the one to dish it out.  Let's get the bad stuff out of the way first Ladies and Gentlemen.  This game is my 36th against Master Freddy and the outcome is becoming far too much of a ritual for my liking.  We pick up the action on move 5 where Freddy puts his king on e7."
