1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Typical move for a reason. This move controls the centre and gets the queen and bishop ready for action.
2,a5,a7a5,rnbqkbnr/1ppppppp/8/p7/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I don't see how this helps with development. Does anyone know?
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/1ppppppp/8/p7/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Again, not a developing move."
4,h5,h7h5,rnbqkbnr/1pppppp1/8/p6p/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Again, not a developing move."
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/1pppppp1/8/p6p/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,I have heard that it is a bad idea to do Nc3 after d4. Why?
6,Na6,b8a6,r1bqkbnr/1pppppp1/n7/p6p/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,Knights are almost always best when pointing towards the centre.
7,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/1pppppp1/n7/p6p/2BPP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 4,I decide to target the f-pawn.
8,Nh6,g8h6,r1bqkb1r/1pppppp1/n6n/p6p/2BPP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 5,"At this point, one would say that white is much more able to launch an attack, though white would be unwise to attack without much support."
9,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkb1r/1pppppp1/n6n/p6p/2BPP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 5 5,"I castle, putting my king into a safer position (which is generally the aim of castling)."
10,g6,g7g6,r1bqkb1r/1ppppp2/n5pn/p6p/2BPP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 6,"Is this OK, or is Bf4 better?"
11,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqkb1r/1ppppp2/n5pn/p5Bp/2BPP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 1 6,"Is this OK, or is Bf4 better?"
12,b5,b7b5,r1bqkb1r/2pppp2/n5pn/pp4Bp/2BPP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 0 7,? Free pawn.
13,Bxb5,c4b5,r1bqkb1r/2pppp2/n5pn/pB4Bp/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 0 7,Skewering my bishop to b2.
14,Rb8,a8b8,1rbqkb1r/2pppp2/n5pn/pB4Bp/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w k - 1 8,Skewering my bishop to b2.
15,Nc3,b1c3,1rbqkb1r/2pppp2/n5pn/pB4Bp/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b k - 2 8,Is this the best move?
16,f6,f7f6,1rbqkb1r/2ppp3/n4ppn/pB4Bp/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w k - 0 9,As I feared after pressing 'Submit' on move 6.
17,Bxh6,g5h6,1rbqkb1r/2ppp3/n4ppB/pB5p/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b k - 0 9,"Aiming for liquidation, but is this a bad move, because it trades a bishop for a badly placed knight and allows the DSB a more active role in the game?"
18,Rxh6,h8h6,1rbqkb2/2ppp3/n4ppr/pB5p/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 10,Better would be Bxh6.
19,e5,e4e5,1rbqkb2/2ppp3/n4ppr/pB2P2p/3P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 10,Trying to give my knight on f3 attacking space.
20,Bg7,f8g7,1rbqk3/2ppp1b1/n4ppr/pB2P2p/3P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 1 11,"Is this OK? dxe6 is illegal, as d7 is pinned."
21,e6,e5e6,1rbqk3/2ppp1b1/n3Pppr/pB5p/3P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 11,"Is this OK? dxe6 is illegal, as d7 is pinned."
22,c6,c7c6,1rbqk3/3pp1b1/n1p1Pppr/pB5p/3P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 12,Check. My bishop still has time to move.

24,Qxd7,d8d7,1rb1k3/3qp1b1/n1p2ppr/pB5p/3P4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 13,"Bxa6 is probably better, due to Rxb2."
