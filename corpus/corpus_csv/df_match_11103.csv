1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I love the Vienna game, specifically the vienna gambit when black responds Nf6, as it's like the King's gambit, but without the possibility of Qh4  for black..."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I love the Vienna game, specifically the vienna gambit when black responds Nf6, as it's like the King's gambit, but without the possibility of Qh4  for black..."
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"I love the Vienna game, specifically the vienna gambit when black responds Nf6, as it's like the King's gambit, but without the possibility of Qh4  for black..."
4,Bc5,f8c5,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,"Oh well.  Looks like a vanilla vienna game, then."
5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 3 3,"I'm still hoping to play f4 in this position, as the extra pressure on black's kingside is something I'm hopeful for."
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 4 4,"?!  Here it is.  Nf3 would have been solid, albeit boring, but f4 is not optimal here.  rt4sm demonstrates why with a quite lively move:"
7,d3,d2d3,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2B1P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 4,"?!  Here it is.  Nf3 would have been solid, albeit boring, but f4 is not optimal here.  rt4sm demonstrates why with a quite lively move:"
8,d6,d7d6,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/2b1p3/2B1P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,"?!  Here it is.  Nf3 would have been solid, albeit boring, but f4 is not optimal here.  rt4sm demonstrates why with a quite lively move:"
9,f4,f2f4,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/2b1p3/2B1PP2/2NP4/PPP3PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,"?!  Here it is.  Nf3 would have been solid, albeit boring, but f4 is not optimal here.  rt4sm demonstrates why with a quite lively move:"
10,Bxg1,c5g1,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/2B1PP2/2NP4/PPP3PP/R1BQK1bR w KQkq - 0 6,"!  This wins a pawn.  While it looks like it may be rough, exchanging an active bishop for a knight at home, this is, I believe the best move in the position.  Observe why."
11,Rxg1,h1g1,r1bqk1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/2B1PP2/2NP4/PPP3PP/R1BQK1R1 b Qkq - 0 6,"This is forced -- I considered Qh5 here, but black can defend against any of white's threats, and can save the bishop to boot.  White must take."
12,Qh4+,d8h4,r1b1k1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/2B1PP1q/2NP4/PPP3PP/R1BQK1R1 w Qkq - 1 7,"And so, black wins a pawn.  White would love to just play g3, but with the rook no longer protecting the pawn on h2, black is going to win it."
13,Kf1,e1f1,r1b1k1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/2B1PP1q/2NP4/PPP3PP/R1BQ1KR1 b kq - 2 7,"Of course, Ke2 would have been a disaster, and Kd2 blocks the bishop in."
14,Bg4,c8g4,r3k1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/2B1PPbq/2NP4/PPP3PP/R1BQ1KR1 w kq - 3 8,A nice in-between move that forces the queen to move.
15,Qe1,d1e1,r3k1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/2B1PPbq/2NP4/PPP3PP/R1B1QKR1 b kq - 4 8,"The best square for the queen, offering a trade."
16,Qxh2,h4h2,r3k1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/2B1PPb1/2NP4/PPP3Pq/R1B1QKR1 w kq - 0 9,"!?  Trading would give black a solid game.  Instead, the pawn grabbing allows white a large amount of counterplay, but black has a strong attack as well!"
17,Nd5,c3d5,r3k1nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/3Np3/2B1PPb1/3P4/PPP3Pq/R1B1QKR1 b kq - 1 9,Here it comes!  The first threat: Nxc7
18,O-O-O,e8c8,2kr2nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/3Np3/2B1PPb1/3P4/PPP3Pq/R1B1QKR1 w - - 2 10,"!  The best move, as this gets the king out of the center.  Castling on opposite sides often foreshadows attacks on opposite sides of the board."
19,Be3,c1e3,2kr2nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/3Np3/2B1PPb1/3PB3/PPP3Pq/R3QKR1 b - - 3 10,"Pointing the bishop at the enemy's king.  Maybe Qc3 is worth considering here, but it runs into the tactical problem of Be2 , which looks pretty strong for black."
20,exf4,e5f4,2kr2nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/3N4/2B1Ppb1/3PB3/PPP3Pq/R3QKR1 w - - 0 11,"One of those moves that players around my level LOVE to make -- wait until an opponent moves a piece, then immediately force it to move again.  But this doesn't get an exclam, because after the recapture..."
21,Bxf4,e3f4,2kr2nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/3N4/2B1PBb1/3P4/PPP3Pq/R3QKR1 b - - 0 11,White tempos the queen.
22,Qh5,h2h5,2kr2nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/3N3q/2B1PBb1/3P4/PPP3P1/R3QKR1 w - - 1 12,"The best square, allowing the queen scope along the 5th rank."
23,Qc3,e1c3,2kr2nr/ppp2ppp/2np4/3N3q/2B1PBb1/2QP4/PPP3P1/R4KR1 b - - 2 12,! Aggressive!  Threatening Qxg7 and also pressuring the black king.
24,f6,f7f6,2kr2nr/ppp3pp/2np1p2/3N3q/2B1PBb1/2QP4/PPP3P1/R4KR1 w - - 0 13,"Mandatory, as Nf6 allows white to win his pawn back."
25,b4,b2b4,2kr2nr/ppp3pp/2np1p2/3N3q/1PB1PBb1/2QP4/P1P3P1/R4KR1 b - - 0 13,"Again, very aggressive.  This is maybe the critical point in the game, where white is trying to make something happen.  My idea is to kick out the knight on c6 and try to mate black down the c-file."
