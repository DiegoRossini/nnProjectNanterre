11,Be3,c1e3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p1np1/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"6. f4 is the Levenfish which immediately threatens 7.e5.  Black will have to play 6.Nc6, if 6. Bg7?  7.e5!"
12,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 7,6. Ng4??  is a horrible mistake because of 7.Bb5 !  which shall win the Knight after 7. Bd7 then 8. Qxg4 wins it. Note that Black can't capture the Queen with the Bishop because it is pinned to the Black King by the Bishop on b5.
13,f3,f2f3,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,To stop 8.Ng4 after Black plays 7. 0-0
14,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 1 8,Black brings his King to safety.
15,Qd2,d1d2,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3KB1R b KQ - 2 8,This is known as the Yugoslav attack which is most popular way to meet the Dragon. The Bishop plans to come to c4 and castle Q-side and later drop the Bishop to b3 and then a pawn storm on the King side that is the general strategy for White.
16,Nc6,b8c6,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3KB1R w KQ - 3 9,However Black's strategy is to bring the Bishop to d7. ( If the White Bishop comes to e2 known as the classical system then Black should exchange Knights and then play Be6!  yes to e6.)  Then play Rc8 and then bring the Queen out to a5 and then go for Ne5-c4 then later on a possible exchange sacrifice with Rxc3. and h5 to stop White from playing h2-h4-h5 and g4.
17,Bc4,f1c4,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/2BNP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3K2R b KQ - 4 9,Development.....
18,Bd7,c8d7,r2q1rk1/pp1bppbp/2np1np1/8/2BNP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3K2R w KQ - 5 10,Now the Bishop is not on c8 the parking space is now reserved for the Rook ( the a8 rook).
19,O-O-O,e1c1,r2q1rk1/pp1bppbp/2np1np1/8/2BNP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR3R b - - 6 10,10.0-0 is an alternative.
20,Ne5,c6e5,r2q1rk1/pp1bppbp/3p1np1/4n3/2BNP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR3R w - - 7 11,This  threatens the b3 Bishop.
21,Bb3,c4b3,r2q1rk1/pp1bppbp/3p1np1/4n3/3NP3/1BN1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR3R b - - 8 11,This is where the Bishop should retreat because itis on the right diagonal giving cover to the King and  also has in eye Black's King!
22,Rc8,a8c8,2rq1rk1/pp1bppbp/3p1np1/4n3/3NP3/1BN1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR3R w - - 9 12,The cannon is ready!  Ready to support the Knight when it goes to c4!
23,h4,h2h4,2rq1rk1/pp1bppbp/3p1np1/4n3/3NP2P/1BN1BP2/PPPQ2P1/2KR3R b - - 0 12,White is now launcing  a King-side attack that MUST be stopped. If Black does not prevent it he will most probably get burnt to the ground.
24,h5,h7h5,2rq1rk1/pp1bppb1/3p1np1/4n2p/3NP2P/1BN1BP2/PPPQ2P1/2KR3R w - - 0 13,Preventing White from playing 13. h5. failure to play 12.h5 for Black  could lead to a getting hammered down the h-file.
25,Kb1,c1b1,2rq1rk1/pp1bppb1/3p1np1/4n2p/3NP2P/1BN1BP2/PPPQ2P1/1K1R3R b - - 1 13,Anand decides to play it safe. The sharp way to play is 13. Bg5 then 13.Rc5  14. g4!? hxg4 15. f4 Nc4 which is very bizzar.
26,Nc4,e5c4,2rq1rk1/pp1bppb1/3p1np1/7p/2nNP2P/1BN1BP2/PPPQ2P1/1K1R3R w - - 2 14,This move threatens the Queen and blocks the b3 bishop.
27,Bxc4,b3c4,2rq1rk1/pp1bppb1/3p1np1/7p/2BNP2P/2N1BP2/PPPQ2P1/1K1R3R b - - 0 14,Forced. If Queen retreats then Black will exchange the Knight for the powerful Bishop on e3.
28,Rxc4,c8c4,3q1rk1/pp1bppb1/3p1np1/7p/2rNP2P/2N1BP2/PPPQ2P1/1K1R3R w - - 0 15,Recapture.....
29,Nde2,d4e2,3q1rk1/pp1bppb1/3p1np1/7p/2r1P2P/2N1BP2/PPPQN1P1/1K1R3R b - - 1 15,If White played 15. Bh6 then Black can win a Knight and a B. ishop for a Rook after 15.Rxd4! 16.Qxd4 and then 16.Bxh6 which will favor Black.
