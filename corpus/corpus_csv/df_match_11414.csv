3,Qh5,d1h5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p4Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 1 2,This move looks bad but it has actually been used to some effect by an American GM.
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p4Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"The obvious looking Nf6 walks right into Qxc5, which is just giving up a pawn. Black can claim its a sacrifice after e6 maybe, but it is not worth it."
5,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p1P2Q/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 0 3,Preventing Nf6 which would drive the queen away.
