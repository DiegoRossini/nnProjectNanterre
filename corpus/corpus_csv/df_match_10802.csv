1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Playing Black is my friend Baker who's been teaching me for over a year. I've beaten him lots of times in practice games, but this was the only time I ever beat him in a tournament, and FINALLY I found this game after scavenging through my papers. I play 1.Nf3 now, but a few months ago I was only copying Baker's openings, now I have my own style."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The Sicilian Defense is probably the strongest response to e4, since it stops White from creating a strong centre with d4. The move 1...e5 also does this, but it simply matches me in the centre, while c5 creates more imbalances."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Against Sicilian, Baker usually plays c3, or the Morra Gambit (d4 cxd4 c3), but I didn't want to play one of his openings since he would probably crush me due to having more knowledge."
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"This move has a lot of purposes. It defends the c5-pawn, it opens lines for the bishop to develop, it prepares a d5 pawn advance in the future, and it also controls the important d5 square."
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,This is Open Sicilian since I am opening up the centre. Most variations are good for Black if White does not reclaim the d4 square.
6,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Another playable move is d5, but it is frowned upon by most players since it offers to open up the centre even more while White is ahead in development."
7,Nxd4,f3d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"c3 would've transposed into the Morra Gambit, and Qxd4 is just dubious since Black gets a free developing move Nc6."
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"The most common continuation for Black is Nf6, and I cannot attack his knight with e5 because of Qa5"
9,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,Nxc6 just strengthens Black's pawn structure by allowing him to bring a pawn closer to the centre. It's better for me just to develop a piece.
10,Qc7,d8c7,r1b1kbnr/ppqp1ppp/2n1p3/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 3 6,"I thought Baker would play Bb4, but I guess he had a more strategic move in mind. Qc7 sets up queenside counterplay later."
11,Ndb5,d4b5,r1b1kbnr/ppqp1ppp/2n1p3/1N6/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 4 6,Forcing the queen to move again
12,Qb8,c7b8,rqb1kbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/1N6/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 5 7,The purpose of Nc6 was to get the queen to b8 where it will control the b-file after ideas like a6 b5 giving Black good queenside play.
13,Be3,c1e3,rqb1kbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/1N6/4P3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 6 7,"This is usually the best square for the bishop in all Open Sicilians. Although in some variations, the bishop goes to g5 depending on how Black plays."
14,a6,a7a6,rqb1kbnr/1p1p1ppp/p1n1p3/1N6/4P3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,"Baker is initiating his plan to play b5 and gain space on the queenside, so I had to think hard about my next move."
15,Bb6,e3b6,rqb1kbnr/1p1p1ppp/pBn1p3/1N6/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 8,"In order to beat Baker, you have to think like him. Baker's specialty is sacrificing pawns and/or pieces to gain lots of attacking potential, so here I sacrifice a piece to get an attacking initiative."
16,axb5,a6b5,rqb1kbnr/1p1p1ppp/1Bn1p3/1p6/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 9,I was threatening Nc7
17,Nxb5,c3b5,rqb1kbnr/1p1p1ppp/1Bn1p3/1N6/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 9,I'm threatening Nc7  once more.
18,Bb4+,f8b4,rqb1k1nr/1p1p1ppp/1Bn1p3/1N6/1b2P3/8/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 10,"This move was good since it gives Black an extra move to play Ba5. I was a little disappointed since I was expecting Ra4, where Nc7  Ke7 c4!! intends c5 threatening Qd6  where I have a very strong attack on the weak dark squares for compensation for the piece."
19,c3,c2c3,rqb1k1nr/1p1p1ppp/1Bn1p3/1N6/1b2P3/2P5/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 10,I played this instantly since it was clearly the best move.
20,Ba5,b4a5,rqb1k1nr/1p1p1ppp/1Bn1p3/bN6/4P3/2P5/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 11,"I'm still down a piece, so trading bishops would be winning for him since I'd no longer have the pressure on c7."
