2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I like the Sicilian myself, and find that its only downfall is that a lot of people are very good at combating it.  Sometimes when I play it I feel like I'm giving my opponent an edge because he may have a strong counter.  This is personal and in no way documented, as I have not spend much time studying openings (feedback?)"
