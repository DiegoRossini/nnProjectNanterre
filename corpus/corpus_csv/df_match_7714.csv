1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I am in the mood for any kind of Queens pawn game.
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Black plays a Classical response.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Playing for some kind of Queens Gambit.
4,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Interesting, black plays towards what I expect will be a Semi-Slav, which provides a solid pawn formation for black and is usually a tough position to crack by white. The position now is a Slav because ...e6 has not been played yet."
5,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2PP4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"I play an out of sequence move from the mainline of the Semi-Slav, although I did not know this until after the game because I played it instictively. The mainline move, in sequence is 3.Nf3, which plays against e5 weak until ...Nbd7 is played, and is played to prepare for short castling, in a gambit manner because e3 is not played yet usually, so the c4 pawn would hang without bishop assistance."
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/2PP4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"Black plays the Semi-Slav moves in sequence, and this is a book move."
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/2PP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 4,Another out of sequence move from the mainline. Usually Nf3 is played before Nc3. In my view of the position I am playing Nc3 to prevent Qa5+ while developing the kingside.
8,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"This completes the pawn structure for the Semi-Slav, a formidable obstacle for white."
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"Its move 5 and I have obtained all the mainline moves of the Semi-Slav which are normally played as (1.d4 d5  2.c4 c6  3.Nf3 Nf6 4.Nc3 e6  5.e3), to obtain the standard position expected at this move."
10,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,"Its book, but the knight appears to be in the way here to me because it is another obstacle for the c8  bishop, a thought I keep in mind as I create a strategy, which for me usually involves some kind of kingside attack."
11,Bd3,f1d3,r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/2PP4/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 6,"Still book, though I did not really know this at the time. I saw the bishop move as necessary to enable castling, even though there is the unwelcome ...dxc4 Bxc4 to contend with - I still find this move agreeable. The option to play cxd4 first, then develop the bishop is an option that can open a rook line on the c file, which I did not want because I like the constriction that black currently enjoys."
12,dxc4,d5c4,r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/8/2pP4/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,This is the last book move for the opening.
13,Bxc4,d3c4,r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/8/2BP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,This is the last book move for the opening.
14,b5,b7b5,r1bqkb1r/p2n1ppp/2p1pn2/1p6/2BP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,This is the last book move for the opening.
15,Bb3,c4b3,r1bqkb1r/p2n1ppp/2p1pn2/1p6/3P4/1BN1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 8,"The book move is 8.Bd3, which is a good line for the bishop, but I wanted it pulled in tight, so the destination will be c2 where the bishop can target h7 to good effect, and will keep the bishop off the queens d file, which I find preferable. A minimal factor is the bishop targets f7 in the event of e6 being pushed, but this is only a temporary consideration."
16,Bd6,f8d6,r1bqk2r/p2n1ppp/2pbpn2/1p6/3P4/1BN1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 9,"An akward appearing move because the bishop hangs openly, but it is safe due to the lack of an open d file and able knight attacks. This is a good position for the bishop where it targets h2 with aggresive intent."
17,Bc2,b3c2,r1bqk2r/p2n1ppp/2pbpn2/1p6/3P4/2N1PN2/PPB2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 9,Black creates a safe position from which to engage strategic plans.
18,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/p2n1ppp/2pbpn2/1p6/3P4/2N1PN2/PPB2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 4 10,Black creates a safe position from which to engage strategic plans.
19,Ng5,f3g5,r1bq1rk1/p2n1ppp/2pbpn2/1p4N1/3P4/2N1P3/PPB2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 5 10,"!? White decides that there is some room for aggresion before castling due to the lack of mobility and coordination of the black pieces. Some activity begins to focus on h7, which should send a flag to black. I was really expecting perhaps a weakening move of ...g6 in response to this move, but black prefers a lesser strategy."
20,Qc7,d8c7,r1b2rk1/p1qn1ppp/2pbpn2/1p4N1/3P4/2N1P3/PPB2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 6 11,"I see the intent, but the idea is not recommended due to opening the h file which can fast become a liability to black due to the activity that white can generate."
21,a3,a2a3,r1b2rk1/p1qn1ppp/2pbpn2/1p4N1/3P4/P1N1P3/1PB2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 11,"I make a waiting move, which also prevents ...Bb4 or ...b5-b4, in anticipation of ...Bxh2 ?"
22,Bxh2,d6h2,r1b2rk1/p1qn1ppp/2p1pn2/1p4N1/3P4/P1N1P3/1PB2PPb/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 12,"? Not outright losing, but it enables white to have a tactical field day on the black castle."
23,Bxh7+,c2h7,r1b2rk1/p1qn1ppB/2p1pn2/1p4N1/3P4/P1N1P3/1P3PPb/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 12,"! Expecting NxB, the bishop leads the attack."
