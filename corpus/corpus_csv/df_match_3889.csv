1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is part of my clubchampionship and as usual I am the bottom seed though I actually score better than a few of the players and I'm sure my rating will eventually cacth up to my level. I had played the first two rounds very badly because I was playing two of the top three seeds and theoretically my best chances would lie with complicated tactical attacking positions so I played them and it ended badly, this game I decided to stick with how I play best which is a more positional style of play. actually most of the games I lose are games where I try and be too attacking."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"I chose the Alekhine defence, I have begun playing it a few times as a slightly less common opening that is not unsound and can generate good play."
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 2,"My opponent decides to decline the traditional chasing of the knight and infact refuses to push it for quite a while, even when it seems it would be good for white."
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"!? I like this move, I think it has been played in a few high level games before and is likely to get us out of book quite quickly. I have played this position about 5-6 times and in each case the position has turned into some sort of mutation of well known openings like the french, sicilian and even a bennoni!"
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"And already on move three we are out of the databases, I checked after the game. maybe this is bad since white can push his e pawn here but I was willing to try the resulting position. The point behind c5 is to 1. deny white d4 and 2. to play on the queenside. if white were to play e5 here I would maybe play Nd5!? and if the knight exchanges then good centre pawns."
6,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"And already on move three we are out of the databases, I checked after the game. maybe this is bad since white can push his e pawn here but I was willing to try the resulting position.

7,d3,d2d3,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,d4 would transpose into some form of a sicilian.
8,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,I wanted to play Nc6 here but I figured it was pushing the whole non-normal play strategy I like to play at times. This gives a square at d7 for the f knight and strikes at the center to force a descision from white. Now the position looks like something that could be in the databases. possibly some sort of french like position.
9,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp2B1/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,It's important to break the pin before white plays e5.
10,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/4pn2/2pp2B1/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,It's important to break the pin before white plays e5.
11,Be2,f1e2,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/4pn2/2pp2B1/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 3 6,Now I spent about 10 minutes calculating 6...b5!? 10 minutes I could have done with later in the game if only for ease of mind. The pawn would be immune from capture since ...b5 7.Nxb5 Qa5+ 8.Nc3 d4 wins the knight. however I wasn't so sure about other lines like 7.e5 Ng8!? 8.Bxe7 Nxe7 or 7.exd
12,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/2pp2B1/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 4 7,In the end I firgured it's best not to go down any unusual roads just yet.
13,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/2pp2B1/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 5 7,Now that white is castled b5 is impossible.
14,h6,h7h6,r1bqk2r/pp2bpp1/2n1pn1p/2pp2B1/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 8,"At this point I thought descisions had to be made about how the game would proceed, white has neglected to play e5 or to clarrify the situation in the centre, since white is not going to do so then I will. But first I thought I would put the question to the bishop before closing up the position with d4 and e5."
15,Bd2,g5d2,r1bqk2r/pp2bpp1/2n1pn1p/2pp4/4P3/2NP1N2/PPPBBPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 1 8,And now to gain central space and close the position ready for my queenside attack
16,d4,d5d4,r1bqk2r/pp2bpp1/2n1pn1p/2p5/3pP3/2NP1N2/PPPBBPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 9,"Probably best, white aims to redirect the knight to c4 via Na3"
17,Nb1,c3b1,r1bqk2r/pp2bpp1/2n1pn1p/2p5/3pP3/3P1N2/PPPBBPPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 1 9,"Probably best, white aims to redirect the knight to c4 via Na3"
18,e5,e6e5,r1bqk2r/pp2bpp1/2n2n1p/2p1p3/3pP3/3P1N2/PPPBBPPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 0 10,"consistent with blacks plans plus now I have also opened up the way for my LSB Because of the closed nature of the position I wanted to play Bg4 and trade it for the f3 knight, otherwise I would keep it for keeping an eye on the a2-g8 diagonal with ...Be6"
19,Na3,b1a3,r1bqk2r/pp2bpp1/2n2n1p/2p1p3/3pP3/N2P1N2/PPPBBPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 1 10,"an interesting decision, there are some clear imbalances in the position with opportunities for both sides, white could have played h3 but chose not to. black has more central and queenside space and will probably look for a c4 break, white will need to eventually seek counterplay on the opposite wing (the king side) however there is also an option when fighting against space to prove that the advances leaves weaknesses in the space gainers position. by playing this white shows he is not concerned about a bishop for knight trade since it will leave black with some serious light square problems."
20,Bg4,c8g4,r2qk2r/pp2bpp1/2n2n1p/2p1p3/3pP1b1/N2P1N2/PPPBBPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 2 11,"At the time I played this nearly instantly, however Be6 may have been better. I thought though that this was the only way to protect my e pawn after Nc4 but this is not true at all, this move is probably bad as this is my good bishop however trading it for a knight is maybe alright."
21,Nc4,a3c4,r2qk2r/pp2bpp1/2n2n1p/2p1p3/2NpP1b1/3P1N2/PPPBBPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 3 11,"Thematic however White had a good option that I missed during the game. 11.Ne1! since white will eventually want to move the knight anyway to make way for the f pawn it makes perfect sense to do it now. On top of that it proposes a trade of light square bishops which is in whites favour and white black would probably need to move play Be6 anyway which means white would have won about 2 tempo which is very important in an opposite wing attack situation. if I had played 10...Be6 last move I could have met this Nc4 with 11...Bd6 which for some reason never crossed my mind during the game, black will be very happy to trade DSB for whites knight so it would have made good sense."
22,Bxf3,g4f3,r2qk2r/pp2bpp1/2n2n1p/2p1p3/2NpP3/3P1b2/PPPBBPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 12,This is practically forced now.
23,Bxf3,e2f3,r2qk2r/pp2bpp1/2n2n1p/2p1p3/2NpP3/3P1B2/PPPB1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 12,gxf3?! trying to open a kingside file and adding some fuel to the eventual f4 advance would be bad since since black can take advantage of the weak f4 square with Nh5!
