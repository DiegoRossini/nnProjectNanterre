Ng5 is unsound for white when black has played 11.... Rc8 instead of playing  11.... a6 first. However, Anand still had to see the game till the very end from here. He thought for a full one and a half hours before he made his next move.

Usually in this situation, after black's usual move of 11. ... a3, white’s knight move makes a lot of sense. Of course, black can play the tactical shot 11. … Bxh2+ 12. Kxh2 Ng4+, and after white gets out of check black will win back the piece with 13. … Qxg5. The general feeling, though, is that white’s two bishops and better coordination give him a strong position.

The significance of this game is that Anand showed why white’s Ng5 idea is a bit dubious after Rc8. Black did not go for the tactical shot, nor did he worry about the weak h-pawn, nor did he worry about a weakness on b5. He simply played 12. … c5 right away. The line-up of the black rook on c8 with the white queen on c2 gives black a lot of tactical possibilities. White replied with 13. Nxh7, grabbing a pawn and threatening the rook on f8. Anand then played 13. … Ng4, leading to this position:"

It is for this move that the game has been dubbed ""Anand's Immortal"" by chess commentators. I wonder How many players, even grandmasters, would have found this move over the board?!

Notice how Anand's bishop now occupies the same diagonal that Aronian had vacated when he had moved 14.f4 a move ago."
31,Be2,d3e2,2rq1rk1/pb1n1ppN/4p3/1pb5/3P1Pn1/P1N5/1PQ1B1PP/R1B2RK1 b - - 2 16,"Can’t white just take black’s bishop with his pawn? Well, yes. But it won’t go well for him. Black will reply with Nxc5, and suddenly white has all sorts of problems. Black is threatening both to win back the piece by taking the white bishop on d3, and also to play Qd4+. taking advantage of the diagonal opened by white when he moved his pawn to f4. The tactics get very messy to calculate, but suffice it to say that black is doing very well indeed.

So white tried 16. Be2 here, with the idea of chasing back the black knight on g4. If black were actually forced to retreat now, this would be a good move. Sadly for white, Anand has another trick up his sleeve. 


OK, again, you're playing black. What would be your next move?"

Anand played 16. … Nde5!! (That’s right! Two double exclam moves in a row!!)

Let’s take stock. Black’s bishop on c5, his knight on e5, and his rook on f8 are all under attack. If the knight on e5 moves, then the knight on g4 will be hanging. But white is the one in big trouble!

Calculating all the variations would lengthen this post beyond decency, so let’s just look at how things went."

The third double exclam move in the same game ! Anand played 19. … f5!!. A quiet move this time. He simply shuts down the diagonal leading from c4 to h7. Now he really is threatening to play Qh4, after which white will run out of time before finding a reasonable defense.

These quiet moves are always the hardest to find. After the game Anand remarked that he felt proud of himself for having found 19. ... f5 over the board."

The fourth double exclam move in the same game. This move cuts off the Aronian's Queen from defending his pawn on h3. And Aronian resigned here.....What a finish by Anand ! 

A masterful game by Anand, one of the most underrated world champions ever. Actually he is probably among the top 8 chess players of all time. See this link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_top_chess_players_throughout_history
