1,Na3,b1a3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/N7/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 1,"Hi everyone!

I have been given a Master Lesson here in how to mount a successful mating attack on a kingside castled position.  Now Master Freddy seems to have a standard Modus Operandii here.  In the opening he tends to give minions like me a head start with some obscure and beginner type anti-developing moves allowing me a free hand.  He then proceeds to undermine it.  In some of my past annotations against him he has hit me with a pawn push down the h or a column.  Here he strikes by forcing an exchange of knights which busts up my queenside pawn structure laying the foundations for trouble for me later on.  In order to avoid going a pawn down I end up having to let Henry be taken to Freddy's castle yet again.  How does this happen?  Well read on.  Freddy kicks off with 1. Na3, an opening called the Sodium Attack because of the Chemistry Symbol Na (meaning sodium).  Tactical Abyss, another strong Master tried it on me and he won."

Should I allow NxN busting my pawn structure or should I trade knights and allow the Wicked Witch of the West to sit pretty on d4.  I decided on the standard line opener d5.
