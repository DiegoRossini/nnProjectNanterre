1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,The Caro-Kann is my favourite defense.
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,The Caro-Kann is my favourite defense.
3,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/4P3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,I believe this is the best response to White's slightly uncommon 2nd move.
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2pp4/4P3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,I believe this is the best response to White's slightly uncommon 2nd move.
5,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2pp4/4P3/5P2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"Dubious move, probably armed against the King Knight's development. 2.ed is the standard move."
6,Nh6,g8h6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2pp3n/4P3/5P2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,Continuing development.
7,h3,h2h3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2pp3n/4P3/5P2/7P/PPPP2P1/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"Another dubious move, weakening the Kingside."
8,Nf5,h6f5,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2pp4/4Pn2/5P2/7P/PPPP2P1/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"Instead of continuing the development with 4-g6, it is more important to immediately take advantage of White's weak 4th move."
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2pp4/4Pn2/5P2/2N4P/PPPP2P1/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 5,"A pawn sac, but for what? 9.fe was much better, when I would have replied 9-c5, retaining a slight edge."
10,Ng3,f5g3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2pp4/4P3/5P2/2N3nP/PPPP2P1/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 3 6,"A pawn sac, but for what? 9.fe was much better, when I would have replied 9-c5, retaining a slight edge."
