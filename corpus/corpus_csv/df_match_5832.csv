1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I have always been interested in my rating, never having had one, but as near as I can say I play at the level of 1600-1800 in gameknot points.  So I opened with D4, thinking to play solidly against my opponent."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I have been playing the Queen's gambit more often in blitz.  Player's do not appear to be accepting the gambit, though."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"I have been playing the Queen's gambit more often in blitz.  Player's do not appear to be accepting the gambit, though."
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,I think this is the Slav variation of the QGD.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"And I don't know what this position is called, although I would be curious."
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"And I don't know what this position is called, although I would be curious."
7,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 3 4,"Everything appears to be proceeding normally so far.  This a3 break is a little out of the ordinary, but I did want motility of the c3 knight."
8,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bqkb1r/pppn1ppp/4pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 4 5,"Everything appears to be proceeding normally so far.  This a3 break is a little out of the ordinary, but I did want motility of the c3 knight."

16,Nxf6,d7f6,r1bqk2r/pp2bpp1/4pn1p/2pp4/2PP4/P1N1P3/1P3PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 9,"I wanted to clarify the position so I could get a better look at it.  One possibility here is that black will be saddled with floating pawns on c5 and d5.  Cxd also opened up the possibility of bishop b5+, although in this position it does not appear advantageous."
17,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqk2r/pp2bpp1/4pn1p/2pp4/2PP4/P1N1PN2/1P3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 9,"I wanted to clarify the position so I could get a better look at it.

26,Rc8,a8c8,2rq1k1r/pb2bpp1/1p3n1p/1BppN3/3P4/P1N1P3/1PQ2PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 6 14,"With obvious threats of cd.  Again I contemplate the board, looking for a strong, attacking move."

I also had the idea of sacking a knight with ng6+ followed by h5+ and qg6+.  But this seemed arrogant and uncertain.  H4 was a safer bet and probably a better try."
