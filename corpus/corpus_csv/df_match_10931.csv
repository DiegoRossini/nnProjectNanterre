1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I chose to anotate this game for instructive purposes.
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Much like the French defence, the Caro-kann defence is aimed at 
playing the move d7-d5. This will force white to make a decision sooner or later, wether to move his e-pawn forward, defend it or exchange."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"This is the exchange variation of the Caro-kann. 
As pointed out at the previous note, white could've also played 3.Nc3 or 3.e5. 
But unlike other exchange variations ( like in the French Defence ), the Caro-kann exchange variation doesn't lead to a rather lifeless simplified position. Instead, the more modern approach to this exchange variation can lead to more complicated play then other variations of the Caro-kann."
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"This is the exchange variation of the Caro-kann.

6,cxd5,c6d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"! The Panov-Botwinnik attack. 4.Bd3 or 4.Nf3 does lead to simpel play with more drawing chances, and so the textmove is an energetic attempt to keep the advantage. This position can also be reached in other openings. 
With the textmove white risks an isolated pawn ( 4...dxc4 ), but white then gets obvious space advantage and lead in development as compensation."
7,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"! The Panov-Botwinnik attack. 4.Bd3 or 4.Nf3 does lead to simpel play with more drawing chances, and so the textmove is an energetic attempt to keep the advantage. This position can also be reached in other openings.

8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"The strongest continuation. 
Another possibility 4. ... Nc6 5.cxd5 Qxd5 6.Nf3 leads to a position wich can also be reached with the Sicilian defence: 1.e4 c5 2.c3 d5 3.exd5 Qxd5 4.d4 Nc6 5.Nf3 cxd4 6.cxd4. White is slightly better, as shown by 6. ... Bg4 7.Nc3! Bxf3 8.gxf3 Qxd4 9.Qxd4 Nxd4 10.Nb5! ( I suggest you check out the Game DB for this position! )"
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 5,"A solid move, but still white has slight advantage."
10,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"A solid move, but still white has slight advantage."
11,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,Both players developing their pieces.
12,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/4pn2/3p4/1bPP4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 7,Both players developing their pieces.
13,Qb3,d1b3,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/4pn2/3p4/1bPP4/1QN2N2/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 3 7,? Best is to play 7.cxd5 here. The continuation 7... Nxd5 8.Bd2 Nc6 9.Bd3 O-O 10.O-O is favourable for white. Instead Ninjabrown decides to charge out early in the game with his queen.
14,Qb6,d8b6,rnb1k2r/pp3ppp/1q2pn2/3p4/1bPP4/1QN2N2/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 4 8,"? 7. ... Nc6 would have been a natural move now, developing the knight and defending the bishop on b4. The Game DB actually gives the move 8.Bg5 with equal play."
15,c5,c4c5,rnb1k2r/pp3ppp/1q2pn2/2Pp4/1b1P4/1QN2N2/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 8,"The result of black's last move, the black queen is an easy target for harassment."
