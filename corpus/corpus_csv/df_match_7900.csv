I freely admit I don't see the benefit of e2 vs. f3 (sure, I see differences, but not such that I can say one is better than the other), but this move in the World DB is selected by the highest rated white players out of all possible moves. I guess I had better go look this one up. The evident goal is to fianchetto the king's bishop on g2, and the knight on f3 would be in the way."
