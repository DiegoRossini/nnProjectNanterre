I've got a powerful center however I'd consider my pieces less active than the white ones.  The problem I have here is how to get my pieces into the action.  I decide it would be best for me to relieve myself of these doubled pawns and open up my bishops' diagonals.

27,Nd4,f3d4,1r1q1rk1/p2nbppp/2p1p3/3pP3/2bN1P2/1PN5/PBP3PP/R2QR1K1 b - - 1 14,This move centralizes the white knight and shows whites activity.  Black must look at how to avoid Nxc6.  I've got two options I can pin the knight or defend the pawn.  I think Bc5 is playable but I went with the other playable option Qc7 because of the pressure to e5.
28,Qc7,d8c7,1r3rk1/p1qnbppp/2p1p3/3pP3/2bN1P2/1PN5/PBP3PP/R2QR1K1 w - - 2 15,I have the option of play Nxe5 here.  I didn't really notice this move at the time but I feel that lining up my knight with the b2 bishop might be a bad thing.

30,exf5,e6f5,1r3rk1/p1qnbppp/2p5/3pPp2/2bN4/1PN5/PBP3PP/R2QR1K1 w - - 0 16,?! this probably not as good as Nxe5 because white can play Nxf5 and the knight now has a great position as everything is aimed at g7.
31,e6,e5e6,1r3rk1/p1qnbppp/2p1P3/3p1p2/2bN4/1PN5/PBP3PP/R2QR1K1 b - - 0 16,?! better is Nxf5.

Be nice if I can force a trade.  Abstractly if I could take my a6 bishop off the board for his d4 knight my game looks winning.
