My move threats two pawns (Nc6 won't be defended after Qxb7, so the pawn is not poisoned). (quick quiz) Can you see how to defend both pawns?"

Due to the sac and the Qe7 (bad) idea, Bdsb is trapped, and so is Rh8, while white has it very easy to penetrate on black's white squares, due to the poor position of Bg6. Note that, normally, this B is very powerful, but here he is just targeting nothing (I can't play Rb1, ok, that's all!). Nec5 instead, Qa3, Na6, and after Q's exchange, black can take a breath. Or NxN, KxN, d4, threatening dxc3+ or dxe3+..."
