If Black acts quickly in the center, then the position is dead even, however, in this game, White doesnt respond accurately and Black gets a winning attack."

5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,The willingness of the White player to to exchange the d-pawn for the c-pawn means that we are heading for the open lines of the Accelerated Dragon.

White can head into the dangerous Yugoslav attack with Bc4, which prevents d5, but allows Black to play 7...Qa5, a potent anti-Yugoslav system."

The main continuation is 10. e5 Nd7 11. f4 e6 when Black is going to play c5 in the near future with a spatial advantage on the Queenside and a quicker attack.  Note that 12. Na4?? is met with 12...Nxe5 as 13. fxe5 Qh4  and the N on a4 hangs.

The dark-square bishop is too important to leave out and this move will give Black another strategic asset, control of the center and a sweeping pawn roller."

Nxd5 Qxa2 18. Nxf6  Rxf6, and while Black still has a slight advantage, I came to the conclusion that the Bishop was going to be more of an asset than the f8 rook."
