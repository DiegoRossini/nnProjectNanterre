There are three lines I found in the opening data base and I have looked at:  Rb8, breaking the pin,  Qc7 overprotecting c6 and perhaps gaining a good diagonal for the queen, and cxb5 which after 9. Qxa8 will be quite interesting."

If Ba4 eventually black will castle and the bishop won't serve much purpose at a4."

Qg3 would hit the e5 pawn and allow me to play 11. d3 with an extra pawn and a position I thought I could defend. However 10. ..., Bd6 looks very threatening.  I may have been fortunate this was a blitz game."
