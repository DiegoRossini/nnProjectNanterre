2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I have been asked to annotate this for a friend, so here goes."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"I have been asked to annotate this for a friend, so here goes."
4,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"I have been asked to annotate this for a friend, so here goes."
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"I have been asked to annotate this for a friend, so here goes."
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,"I have been asked to annotate this for a friend, so here goes."
7,Bf4,c1f4,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3p4/2PP1B2/5N2/PP2PPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 3 4,"It starts as a fairly conventional Slav Defence. 4. Nc3 is more common that 4. Bf4, but Bf4 can hardly be bad."
8,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/2PP1B2/5N2/PP2PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"This can hardly be wrong, but 4....Bf5 is more active. As played the Bc8 becomes a very bad bishop, hemmed in by its own pawns."
9,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/2PP1B2/4PN2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"This seems good, allowing the Bf1 to recapture on c4 if necessary."
10,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/2PP1B2/4PN2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,Solid development again.
11,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/2PP1B2/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 2 6,The knight finally goes to its natural square.
12,Qb6,d8b6,r1b1kb1r/pp1n1ppp/1qp1pn2/3p4/2PP1B2/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 3 7,And the black queen comes out to menace b2.
13,Qb3,d1b3,r1b1kb1r/pp1n1ppp/1qp1pn2/3p4/2PP1B2/1QN1PN2/PP3PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 4 7,"Post Match Computer Analysis(PMCA) gives this as a mistake, and says the position is now level. It prefers 7. Qc2 with an advantage of 0.57 to white. I am not sure. Although white now ends up with doubled b pawns he has compensation with pressure down the a file. Incidentally I have found this position on the opening databases, and both the games continued with  7. b3?? Bb4 and black soon won a knight and later the game."
14,Qxb3,b6b3,r1b1kb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/2PP1B2/1qN1PN2/PP3PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 8,"So the queens come off, but the only pieces to have been exchanged."
15,axb3,a2b3,r1b1kb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/2PP1B2/1PN1PN2/1P3PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 8,"So the queens come off, but the only pieces to have been exchanged."
16,Bb4,f8b4,r1b1k2r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/1bPP1B2/1PN1PN2/1P3PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 1 9,"This pins comes in again, white has to be careful."
17,Bd3,f1d3,r1b1k2r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/1bPP1B2/1PNBPN2/1P3PPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 2 9,Wisely stopping the knight from coming in to e4.
18,h6,h7h6,r1b1k2r/pp1n1pp1/2p1pn1p/3p4/1bPP1B2/1PNBPN2/1P3PPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 10,"Not sure that this helps black that much. c5 looks a rather thematic move to me, or trying to get in e6-e5."
19,Ke2,e1e2,r1b1k2r/pp1n1pp1/2p1pn1p/3p4/1bPP1B2/1PNBPN2/1P2KPPP/R6R b kq - 1 10,White wisely connects rooks.
20,O-O,e8g8,r1b2rk1/pp1n1pp1/2p1pn1p/3p4/1bPP1B2/1PNBPN2/1P2KPPP/R6R w - - 2 11,And black puts his king to a safer place.
21,Ra4,a1a4,r1b2rk1/pp1n1pp1/2p1pn1p/3p4/RbPP1B2/1PNBPN2/1P2KPPP/7R b - - 3 11,Hitting the bishop.
22,Be7,b4e7,r1b2rk1/pp1nbpp1/2p1pn1p/3p4/R1PP1B2/1PNBPN2/1P2KPPP/7R w - - 4 12,"Not given as a mistake by PMCA, but I prefer c5 or even a5, keeping the bishop active. Black is now a bit passive."
23,Rha1,h1a1,r1b2rk1/pp1nbpp1/2p1pn1p/3p4/R1PP1B2/1PNBPN2/1P2KPPP/R7 b - - 5 12,and white has pressure on a7.
24,a6,a7a6,r1b2rk1/1p1nbpp1/p1p1pn1p/3p4/R1PP1B2/1PNBPN2/1P2KPPP/R7 w - - 0 13,And this is virtually the only way to save the a pawn.
25,c5,c4c5,r1b2rk1/1p1nbpp1/p1p1pn1p/2Pp4/R2P1B2/1PNBPN2/1P2KPPP/R7 b - - 0 13,Further cramping down on black's queen side.
26,Re8,f8e8,r1b1r1k1/1p1nbpp1/p1p1pn1p/2Pp4/R2P1B2/1PNBPN2/1P2KPPP/R7 w - - 1 14,Presumably with the long-term plan of eventually freeing his position a little with e6-e5
