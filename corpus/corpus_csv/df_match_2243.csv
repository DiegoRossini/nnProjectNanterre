1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Scandinavian, my all-time favourite."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Scandinavian, my all-time favourite."
3,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Accepted. Another option in e5, that leads to a well-known kind of game."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,The base for the Icelandic gambit.
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"The best response, according to theory. c4 gets white into troubles - you must know it to realize."
6,Nxd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3n4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Recommended, even if I don't like it after c4. But it is playable."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3n4/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"I can't stop c4, so I develop. This bishop is going to be exchanged for the f3 knight, sooner or later. A key point of the game is to choose where and when."
8,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3n1b2/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,"I can't stop c4, so I develop. This bishop is going to be exchanged for the f3 knight, sooner or later. A key point of the game is to choose where and when."
9,Be2,f1e2,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3n1b2/3P4/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 5,"I don't prefer this kind of dev, but it is definitely glod and sound."
10,Nb4,d5b4,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/5b2/1n1P4/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 6,...but it allows an experiment.
11,Na3,b1a3,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/5b2/1n1P4/N4N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 5 6,"The only good answer. The knight is a little misplaced, but also will be mine after c3."
12,e6,e7e6,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4p3/5b2/1n1P4/N4N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,The bishop's way out.
13,c3,c2c3,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4p3/5b2/1n1P4/N1P2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,At least I avoided c4.
14,Nd5,b4d5,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4p3/3n1b2/3P4/N1P2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 8,"I wanted to keep my c pawn mobile. If now c4, white has kinda returned me the tempo lost with the knight's moves. I forced white into a set, but it is not proven that it will be good for me (black)."
15,Nc2,a3c2,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4p3/3n1b2/3P4/2P2N2/PPN1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 8,White again goes passively but not bad at all.
16,Bd6,f8d6,rn1qk2r/ppp2ppp/3bp3/3n1b2/3P4/2P2N2/PPN1BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 3 9,"It is very important to avoid Bf4, a good white's move."
17,O-O,e1g1,rn1qk2r/ppp2ppp/3bp3/3n1b2/3P4/2P2N2/PPN1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 4 9,"Help yourself... just where I wanted you. The only chance to ""prove"" this opening is for black to manage an attack on the kingside, and castle queenside. White's pawn storm on the queenside must be feared, but it has to be seen if white goes for it quickly enough."
18,Nd7,b8d7,r2qk2r/pppn1ppp/3bp3/3n1b2/3P4/2P2N2/PPN1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 5 10,"Simple developement, but best would have been c6, wasting a tempo but providing c7 to the queen."
19,Bg5,c1g5,r2qk2r/pppn1ppp/3bp3/3n1bB1/3P4/2P2N2/PPN1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 6 10,"I considered f6, but I decided that I had to be careful about the weakness in e6. So..."
20,Nd5f6,d5f6,r2qk2r/pppn1ppp/3bpn2/5bB1/3P4/2P2N2/PPN1BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 7 11,...anticipating the retreat if c4 is payed.
21,Ne3,c2e3,r2qk2r/pppn1ppp/3bpn2/5bB1/3P4/2P1NN2/PP2BPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 8 11,"Wanting to open the column. Bg6 is the natural move, but remember I said my chance was to attack on the kingside? So..."
22,h6,h7h6,r2qk2r/pppn1pp1/3bpn1p/5bB1/3P4/2P1NN2/PP2BPPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 12,"I take my chances to begin a pawn storm. If NxB, hxB."
