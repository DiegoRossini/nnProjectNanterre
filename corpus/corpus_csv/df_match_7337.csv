1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I always think Gruenfeld
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"still using the same idea.  the one recent time kentwood played the main line, I missed the hanging pawn after d5.  Here, white blocks the c-pawn.  I'm still aiming at d4."
3,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"still using the same idea.  the one recent time kentwood played the main line, I missed the hanging pawn after d5.  Here, white blocks the c-pawn.  I'm still aiming at d4."

8,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3p4/3P4/P1N1P3/1PP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 5,this avoids the annoying bishop check.  h4 is a little mysterious.
9,h4,h2h4,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3p4/3P3P/P1N1P3/1PP2PP1/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,this avoids the annoying bishop check.  h4 is a little mysterious.

13,g4,g2g4,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2p2np1/3p4/3P2PP/P1N1PP2/1PP5/R1BQKBNR b KQ - 0 7,guess he's not castling k-side
14,Na6,b8a6,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/n1p2np1/3p4/3P2PP/P1N1PP2/1PP5/R1BQKBNR w KQ - 1 8,"usually, sticking to my opening plan, I want Nc6, but off the line now and I've seen some big guns put the knights ""on the rim."""
15,g5,g4g5,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/n1p2np1/3p2P1/3P3P/P1N1PP2/1PP5/R1BQKBNR b KQ - 0 8,"guess I'll just move that piece.  Black is way behind in development and this will cost him.  he certainly has more space, though and a lot of players who don't play by the principles are downright lethal as far as tactics.  This fellow gave me a run for my money before"
16,Nh5,f6h5,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/n1p3p1/3p2Pn/3P3P/P1N1PP2/1PP5/R1BQKBNR w KQ - 1 9,"guess I'll just move that piece.

20,Nxe2,g3e2,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/n1p3p1/3p2P1/3P3P/P1N1PP2/1PP1n2R/R1BQK1N1 w Q - 0 11,"I wasn't sure about trading a very active N for a somewhat lazy, no matter how good.  There's also the psychological element; letting white know I'm not afraid of confrontation"

With the exception of the a-rook, black is developed and the king is fairly secure.  White's king practically wears a bull's eye and has three pieces looking quaint.  white still has space and arguably a better pawn structure.  even though this grabs a pawn, 17. Bd2, 18. 0-0-0 might have proved better for white."
