1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Every time I play this move against 1. e4 I imagine a boxer dodging a direct jab and countering with a right hook, staggering his opponent. On a more serious note, this move is probably responsible for the lower statistical rating of 1. e4 as opposed to 1. d4."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Every time I play this move against 1. e4 I imagine a boxer dodging a direct jab and countering with a right hook, staggering his opponent.

3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"So far I have a very good rating with this line, the positions are much more dynamic than after 2...d6 and the initiative can shift much quicker to Black."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"So far I have a very good rating with this line, the positions are much more dynamic than after 2...d6 and the initiative can shift much quicker to Black."
5,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,The Rossolimo line with 3. Bb5 scores better in databases and probably with good reason. White can keep a pleasant initiative and can construct a stable pawn centre.
6,cxd4,c5d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,The only serious alternative to 7. Bg5
7,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,The only serious alternative to 7. Bg5
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,The only serious alternative to 7. Bg5
9,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,The only serious alternative to 7. Bg5
10,e5,e7e5,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,The only serious alternative to 7. Bg5
11,Ndb5,d4b5,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/1N2p3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,The only serious alternative to 7. Bg5
12,d6,d7d6,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2np1n2/1N2p3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,The only serious alternative to 7. Bg5
13,Nd5,c3d5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2np1n2/1N1Np3/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 7,The only serious alternative to 7. Bg5
14,Nxd5,f6d5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2np4/1N1np3/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,"Forced, there was no way to defend c7"
15,exd5,e4d5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2np4/1N1Pp3/8/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,Taking with the Queen is pointless as that would only ease Black's task in pushing d5 and gaining the initiative.
16,Nb8,c6b8,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3p4/1N1Pp3/8/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 9,"The best retreat. On e7, it would just tangle up pieces and it wouldn't have a good place to go."
17,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3p4/1N1Pp3/2P5/8/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 9,"White has several plans in this position. The one played is the most popular, but the others are just as playable. Other alternatives involve playing with a4, going for piece play rather than pawn attacks, and in case Black plays a6, squeezing the Q-side with a5. Another plan is with f4, stabilizing and blocking Black's central pawns."
18,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/3p4/1N1Pp3/2P5/8/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 10,"The most elastic move. Black's plan is to castle and play f5, usually in that order."
19,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/3p4/1N1Pp3/2P5/3B4/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 10,"This signals that White isn't going for the f4 plan, which would simply lose a tempo since an e4 pawn push would hit the Bd3 and instead wants to keep the lines open for his pieces and try to make use of the absence of a Knight on the K-side and attack there."
20,a6,a7a6,rnbqk2r/1p2bppp/p2p4/1N1Pp3/2P5/3B4/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 11,"Black is well-advised to wait with this move since playing it at a wrong time can just create entry points on the dark squares on the Q-side. Since White has played such a brazen Bishop move, I was more relaxed about his intentions."
21,Nc3,b5c3,rnbqk2r/1p2bppp/p2p4/3Pp3/2P5/2NB4/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 11,"There are some lines in which the Knight goes to a3, but that is connected to an early c5 push, clearing c4 for the Knight, pressurizing the Q-side."
22,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/1p2bppp/p2p4/3Pp3/2P5/2NB4/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 2 12,"The best plan for Black in these structures. White usually tries to go for a c5 push, creating a passed d-pawn."
23,O-O,e1g1,rnbq1rk1/1p2bppp/p2p4/3Pp3/2P5/2NB4/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 3 12,"The best plan for Black in these structures. White usually tries to go for a c5 push, creating a passed d-pawn."
24,f5,f7f5,rnbq1rk1/1p2b1pp/p2p4/3Ppp2/2P5/2NB4/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 13,"The best plan for Black in these structures. White usually tries to go for a c5 push, creating a passed d-pawn."
25,Qh5,d1h5,rnbq1rk1/1p2b1pp/p2p4/3Ppp1Q/2P5/2NB4/PP3PPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 1 13,"A rather adventurous plan. The theoretical move is f3, trying to contain the mobile Black pawn centre."
26,e4,e5e4,rnbq1rk1/1p2b1pp/p2p4/3P1p1Q/2P1p3/2NB4/PP3PPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 0 14,The Bishop gets a blow to the head and is given a standing count by the referee.
27,Be2,d3e2,rnbq1rk1/1p2b1pp/p2p4/3P1p1Q/2P1p3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 1 14,Now it's time to start developing.
28,Nd7,b8d7,r1bq1rk1/1p1nb1pp/p2p4/3P1p1Q/2P1p3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 2 15,Now it's time to start developing.
29,Bf4,c1f4,r1bq1rk1/1p1nb1pp/p2p4/3P1p1Q/2P1pB2/2N5/PP2BPPP/R4RK1 b - - 3 15,White develops his last piece and takes control of e5.
30,Ne5,d7e5,r1bq1rk1/1p2b1pp/p2p4/3Pnp1Q/2P1pB2/2N5/PP2BPPP/R4RK1 w - - 4 16,The tempting 15...Nf6 just gives White time to send the White Queen to greener pastures via h3.
31,Qh3,h5h3,r1bq1rk1/1p2b1pp/p2p4/3Pnp2/2P1pB2/2N4Q/PP2BPPP/R4RK1 b - - 5 16,White probably should have exchanged on e5 here and his position would have been pretty good.
32,Bf6,e7f6,r1bq1rk1/1p4pp/p2p1b2/3Pnp2/2P1pB2/2N4Q/PP2BPPP/R4RK1 w - - 6 17,Now the Knight is stabilized and it's time to start play on the other side of the board.
