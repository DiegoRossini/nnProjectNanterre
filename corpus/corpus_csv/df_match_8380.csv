Qh4+, otherwise, but in the end i think 6. ... d4 was the right move as it gave me more control on the center, either if 7. cxd4 (since my night become very dangerous with 7. ... Nxd4) either if not (since the d pawn itself is in a strong position)"

1) The path 7. ... Bg6 8. f5, which I think was the attack you wanted to do, opens dengerously the king side when you have not moved a piece yet. It will be terribly hard to do qween side castle and you will have to let your king in the front line. 
2) Above all, instead, I can defend my bishop, checking your king with the qween!"

But I don't want to let my qween all alone in the enemy field. Qe7 is not good for me, since it is in e7 where my dark squared bishop and king side night have to pass to complete my opening."

I am attacking with a bishop, two connected nights, the qween and (in a move) a rock. I can easily castle king side to connect the rocks and obtain help from all my pieces. You have your rocks out of the game yet (one almost definitively), and the bishops trapped by your pawns. It's time to attack."
