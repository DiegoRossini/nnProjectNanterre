12,Bg7,f8g7,r1bqk1nr/3pppbp/p1p3p1/2p5/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 7,Bishop takes some control of the a1 h8 diagonal but to what end?  No purpose in this move that I can see and the king tucked away on the king's side.

15,Nbd2,b1d2,r1bqk2r/3pppbp/p1p2np1/2p5/4P3/2PP1N2/PP1N1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 2 8,Development is all important in early part of the game.

23,e5,e4e5,r2q1rk1/4ppbp/b1p2np1/p1ppP3/P1P5/3P1N1P/1P1N1PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 12,Want's to keep knight

37,Rad1,a1d1,1r3rk1/3nq1bp/b1p1p1p1/p1p1p3/P1P1N3/BP2QN1P/5PP1/3R1RK1 b - - 3 19,"Hangs the pawn at e5.

Better is Bc8, leading to 20.Rd3 Qf7 21.Rfd1 Qf4 22.Rxd7 Qxe3 23.fxe3 Bxd7 24.Rxd7 Rxb3 25.Bxc5 Rb1+ 26.Kf2, which wins a queen, a rook, and a pawn for a queen, a bishop, a knight, and a pawn."

39,Nxc5,e4c5,1r3rk1/4q1bp/b1p1pnp1/p1N1p3/P1P5/BP2QN1P/5PP1/3R1RK1 b - - 0 20,Attacks Black's bishop at a6 and blocks Black's pawn at c6.  This shows why black's Nf6 move was bad.  Removed protection from the c5 pawn and puts the knight in a position where it can only move back or to the edge of the board.   Now I can take the bishop on a6 which leads to an attack on both the queen and the b8 rook.  I could get a bishop and rook for a bishop and knight.
40,Qa7,e7a7,1r3rk1/q5bp/b1p1pnp1/p1N1p3/P1P5/BP2QN1P/5PP1/3R1RK1 w - - 1 21,"Again a bit of a blunder leading to a loss of material.  The knight at c5 is protected by the queen and bishop, the pawn at e5 is open to attack by the f3 knight which could lead to a fork at c6 on the queen and rook or a fork on both rooks from d7 leading to an exchange knights with a knight on back on d7 again forking the two rooks and being protected by the rook.  Only thing at this point would be to trade queens and black still loses a rook for a knight."
