1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"White begins with the non-committal King's Knight, controlling e5, but otherwise allowing Black to occupy the center. Most often (in my experience anyway) Black will reply with 1…Nf6 – a solid developing move waiting for White to show his hand first (and typically following a KID setup).  Black however responds in classical fashion with the confident advance of the Queen’s Pawn to occupy the center thereby controlling e4 and freeing the Queen’s Bishop for development."

3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,"With the immediate advance of the c-pawn, White opens with the Reti proper – threatening Black’s d-pawn and offering the gambit to either displace Black’s central pawn or cause him to lose time in defending it."
4,dxc4,d5c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2p5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"The natural choice of the QGA player, Black removes the pawn to resolve the tension simply and immediately, giving up the center to achieve flexible play for his pieces. Black’s main alternatives are 2…d4/e6/c6 which are all equally good."
5,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2p5/4PN2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"White replies by the short advance of the King’s Pawn, freeing the King’s Bishop to attack c4. Black chooses to develop the Queen’s Bishop to e6 to hold onto the pawn. Normally, Black would return the gambit pawn with normal development (e.g 3...Nf6 4.Bxc4 e6 5.d4 or even the questionable 3...b5 4.a4 c6 5.axb5 cxb5 6.b3!?)"
6,Be6,c8e6,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/4b3/8/2p5/4PN2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,"White replies by the short advance of the King’s Pawn, freeing the King’s Bishop to attack c4.

7,Ng5,f3g5,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/4b3/6N1/2p5/4P3/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,"Nc3 seems to be the natural developing move if one were to ignore the pawn advantage and Na3 is also certainly possible in attempt to recapture, but can White take advantage of the bishop which may be misplaced on e6, forcing it to move again while gaining a more threatening square?"
8,Bd5,e6d5,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3b2N1/2p5/4P3/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 3 5,"Black’s Bishop sidesteps the knight while trying to hold the pawn and maintain a presence  through the center – however this allows White’s e-pawn to advance to e4 supported by Ng5, pushing the bishop again, eventually allowing White to regain the pawn."
9,e4,e3e4,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3b2N1/2p1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"The Bishop retreats to the only square available, blocking the c-pawn. Also possible was 5…e6,  attacking the advanced knight, 6.d4 Bc6."
10,Bc6,d5c6,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/2b5/6N1/2p1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,"The Bishop retreats to the only square available, blocking the c-pawn. Also possible was 5…e6,  attacking the advanced knight, 6.d4 Bc6."
11,Bxc4,f1c4,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/2b5/6N1/2B1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"White regains the pawn with an aggressively posted Bishop pressuring the Kingside, without a d-pawn to push it back.  In response, Black looks to open a line for his Bishop, blunt White’s bishop, and threaten the knight."
12,e6,e7e6,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2b1p3/6N1/2B1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"White regains the pawn with an aggressively posted Bishop pressuring the Kingside, without a d-pawn to push it back.  In response, Black looks to open a line for his Bishop, blunt White’s bishop, and threaten the knight."
13,d4,d2d4,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2b1p3/6N1/2BPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,"7.d3 seems to be the solid move to play to reinforce central occupation of e4 while defending Ng5 with the Queen’s Bishop, but it results in a weak d-pawn. At this point I decided to move forward with the more dashing and perhaps questionable d4 for the large center effectively transitioning from what began as a flank opening to a more classic approach. In the event that Black pushes Queenside with b5, White now has extra options for redeploying the bishop."
14,Be7,f8e7,rn1qk1nr/ppp1bppp/2b1p3/6N1/2BPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 8,"Black develops his Queen’s Bishop to a great natural square, threatening Ng5.  At this point I had a few different ideas. Retreat with 8.Nf3 Bxe4 9.Nc3. Defend with the h-pawn? Try to make something of a tactical shot with Nxf7 then a Queen check on h5? However, I decided upon the “throw all you got at the King and hope something sticks” approach with 8.f4 – defending our intrepid Knight while gaining the broad center with nice open lines."
15,f4,f2f4,rn1qk1nr/ppp1bppp/2b1p3/6N1/2BPPP2/8/PP4PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,"Black develops his Queen’s Bishop to a great natural square, threatening Ng5.  At this point I had a few different ideas.

16,Nf6,g8f6,rn1qk2r/ppp1bppp/2b1pn2/6N1/2BPPP2/8/PP4PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 9,"Black develops the King’s Knight to f6 trying to stake his claim into the center with both Knight and Bishop attacking the e-pawn.  Again I debated with which approach I should take – should I play e5 and go with the slow but more solid approach or should I try to develop quickly and hope to overwhelm my opponent?
I decided to move forward with Nc3 – grasping more control over the center with a simple developing move. Although the e-pawn is defended by both knights if one can be immediately displaced then the central pawn could fall. However, as we will see White has an interesting option available to create a strong imbalance while his pieces are mobile and his King relatively safe. Instead of 9…h6 I believe Black would have been safer with 9…O-O to be followed up with 10.e5 Nd5 11.O-O."

19,Nxe6,g5e6,rn1qk2r/ppp1bpp1/2b1Nn1p/8/2BPPP2/2N5/PP4PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 10,"To retreat with 10.Nf3 would be to admit mistake and give up the pawn while losing time. 10.Nxe6 gives up the Knight to tear away at the pawns in front of Black’s King while ramming the Queen’s Bishop deep into his territory – controlling key squares around the King and cutting off castling avenues. At the same time, the e4 pawn is no longer free for the taking…"

(11.Bxe4 12.Nxe4 also looks weak for Black even if not immediately losing the game). Stronger would have been either 11…Bd7 or 11…Nbd7 to develop the Queen’s pieces while still keeping control of h5. Although Black would have been up a Knight for two Pawns, White still would have retained a strong initiative with mobility, space, and control with a complex and interesting game ahead."
