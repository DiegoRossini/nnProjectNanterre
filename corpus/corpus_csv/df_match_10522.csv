Chess is an old game, played long enough that people have been able to note patterns. We're on the six move but it's following a fairly common opening pattern (tho moving my queen was a little unusual.) It's still a kind of Ruy Lopez. Moving the black pawn in the 3rd move to threaten the white bishop made it a Morphy Defense. Moving the white queen in 5 Qe2 branched off the standard Ruy Lopez/Morphy line and made it a ""Wormald Attack."" Sounds like a sci-fi B movie.

Both of us have a lot of pieces able to be put into play and neither has castled."

This move took me by surprise. I had expected Be7 or maybe Qe7 or Bb7.
At first I thought I had fallen into a trap. It was so surprising I must have overlooked something. I might get forked, put in check and lose a rook for example.
But soon, to my albiet inexperienced eyes, it looks like a mistake. Maybe he thought he was setting something up, but most moves by his knight can be easily countered. Of course I could be overlooking something, but I'm gonna take advantage of what appears to be a mistake.
Note also if I Nxe5 and take his center pawn, I can put pressure on f7, check, maybe get the rook or force a move.
One thing I'm not happy about is I'd like to get more pieces into play. But heck, it's still early."

Still, if I 8 Nxf7, my white bishop will protect the knight. There might be some exchanges but I can probably come out ahead. 

I expect him to Qe7 next. He might expect me to jump for the chance to grab his rook, but then he can do the above scenario of taking my queen.

I moved d3 in order to cover the center pawn and in effect protect my home base of queen and king.
I can move e5 later.

If he's not paying attention he might Nxd3 , but he'd immediately lose the N with no gain. His other gut reaction might be to take the knight on f7 (probably a bad idea.)

Black's probably gunning to get his queen on c5, especially after I castle. Maybe that's why he did the little dance with his white bishop; in order to get the awn out of the way, opening up a shot at the castled king and threatening the d3 pawn and therefore queen.

I can block him preemtively with Be3 but then my queen can't protect the center knight.

The game is tight enough that we're both putting pressure on the opponent's home camp, yet open enough that there's plenty of opportunity for grabbing material too. His 2 knights are really doing a good job of limiting my options. Knights are tricky too, it's easy for a beginner for me to overlook their danger. For example Qd7  is easily solved by his Nf6xQ. Same goes for me trying to get his rook with my white bishop.

The options I've considered are: castleing (NG - lose my queen), c3 (cover the queen), Qf4 (protect my queen, pressure him, but leaves him too many options, Be3 (protect queen, get 2nd bishop into play, not bad) or Bf7 .

I'm choosing the last one. He might be able to squirm out of it, but I should end up with a material advantage (namely his queen) and if he makes a mistake, even a checkmate in 2 moves. When he moves his king out of check, his only choice is e7, which blocks his bishop that's covering his queen."

okay, as you can tell by my notes, I wasn't expecting that. Frankly I was too caught up in my attack to notice. So let that be a lesson to fellow beginners: don't forget that the other guy has plans too.

Moving my king to d2 might be a bad idea. If he checks with Bb4 I can just scoot the king over and grab his knight, which would be nice. But he might not do that. He might just grab my a1 rook instead. If his f6 knight were out of the way I could check with my queen easily -- but the knight is there, so I'd like to take it with my black bishop.
