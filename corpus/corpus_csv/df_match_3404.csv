10,Ngf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppn1ppp/4pn2/8/3PN3/3B4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 3 6,Challenging my knight on e4.
11,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkb1r/pppn1ppp/4pn2/8/3PN3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 4 6,Developing his knight to a better square with tempo.

15,Bd3,e4d3,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/8/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 8,A thematic break for Black in the French. He has to put some pressure on the White centre.
16,c5,c7c5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2p5/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,A thematic break for Black in the French. He has to put some pressure on the White centre.
17,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2p3B1/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 9,More common are 9.O-O and 9.dxc5. But both of us were out of our theoretical knowledge from move 4 or so.
18,a6,a7a6,r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p3pn2/2p3B1/3P4/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 10,"!? This is a new move in the 365chess.com database. In 11 of the 15 games where 9.Bg5 was played, the Black player responded with 9...cxd4. The move was played to prevent Bb5+ and to prepare ...b5 for himself."
19,c3,c2c3,r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p3pn2/2p3B1/3P4/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 10,"Strengthening the centre (but not intending to recapture with the c-pawn if White were to play ...cxd4, as that would leave me with an isolated pawn)."

25,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk2r/1p2bpp1/p3pn1p/8/3N3B/2PB4/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 2 13,Now I prevent ...e5.
26,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/1p2bpp1/p3pn1p/8/3N3B/2PB4/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 3 14,Now I prevent ...e5.

28,b5,b7b5,r1bq1rk1/4bpp1/p3pn1p/1p6/3N3B/2PB4/PP3PPP/R2QR1K1 w - - 0 15,"? seeking for counterplay, but this weakens the a8-h1 diagonal and gives White some nice possibilities. Fritz' suggestion is 14...Qd5, probably to prepare ...e5 again and maybe also to strengthen the a8-h1 diagonal (although if he'd follow up immediately with 15...b5?? white would win an exchange with 16.Bxf6 Bxf6 17.Be4)."
29,Qf3,d1f3,r1bq1rk1/4bpp1/p3pn1p/1p6/3N3B/2PB1Q2/PP3PPP/R3R1K1 b - - 1 15,"?! Right idea, but there was a better move. I had considered 15.Be4?, 15.Bxf6? Bxf6 16.Be4, 15.Nc6 and this move. Best was 15.Nc6! Qe8 16.Be4, when 16...Nxe4?? fails to 17.Nxe7+ etc., so Black has to play 16...Bb7 17.Nxe7 Qxe7 18.Bxf6 gxf6 (18...Qxf6?? 19.Bxb7). 15.Bxf6? Bxf6 16.Be4 doesn't win an exchange as we thought in the post-game analysis, because after 16...Ra7 17.Nc6 Black can exchange queens and then save his rook. also 15.Be4? accomplishes nothing due to 15...Nxe4 16.Bxe7 Qxe7 17.Rxe4 Bb7 and Black's position is at least equal, if not better."
30,Qb6,d8b6,r1b2rk1/4bpp1/pq2pn1p/1p6/3N3B/2PB1Q2/PP3PPP/R3R1K1 w - - 2 16,Developing his queen on the a7-g1 diagonal towards the White king.
31,Rad1,a1d1,r1b2rk1/4bpp1/pq2pn1p/1p6/3N3B/2PB1Q2/PP3PPP/3RR1K1 b - - 3 16,"Placing my pieces on optimal squares and not falling for 16.Qxa8?! Bb7 trapping the queen, although it may be OK after 17.Qxf8+ Kxf8 when I have exchanged my queen for 2 rooks, but I think my queen is better than the two rooks in this position). But why would I get into such a complicated line if I'm simply better by playing normal moves?"
32,Bd7,c8d7,r4rk1/3bbpp1/pq2pn1p/1p6/3N3B/2PB1Q2/PP3PPP/3RR1K1 w - - 4 17,"!? Forcing a weakness in the Black pawn structure, and also complicating the position. My computer programme Fritz seems not to like it that much at first and considers 17.Bc2 better, but after analyzing a bit it says White has an advantage in this line as well."
33,Nf5,d4f5,r4rk1/3bbpp1/pq2pn1p/1p3N2/7B/2PB1Q2/PP3PPP/3RR1K1 b - - 5 17,"!? Forcing a weakness in the Black pawn structure, and also complicating the position.

35,Rxe7,e1e7,r4rk1/3bRpp1/pq3n1p/1p3p2/7B/2PB1Q2/PP3PPP/3R2K1 b - - 0 18,"An alternative given by Fritz is 18...g5!? when Fritz comes up with an interesting line: 19.Rxd7! Nxd7 20.Qxf5 Qg6 21.Qxd7 Qh5! 22.Be4 Qxh4. However, this position must be better for White as well. Black wanted to avoid all this so he decided to protect his bishop a second time."
