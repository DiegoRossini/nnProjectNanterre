1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Another game from another one of Trafalgar's members, though this time not a team match. This game is now currently man-on-a-mission's highest rated win (against an expert player, no less). The game kicks off with a Queen's Pawn opening.... [looking at a game between higher rated players should also give me a few pointers on how to improve my own game :) It would also be likely that I miss certain strategies by both players, so all comments are appreciated]"

If Black were to exchange one of his pieces with White's knight, he could land a pawn on the e5 square, which would put a slight cramp in Black's position (would it?)
