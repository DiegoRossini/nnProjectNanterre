1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

In this game I seemed to be in the grip of passivitis yet again.  But, suddenly, out of nowhere, comes an attack on Rick's king which first wins a pawn and then the exchange.  A killer pawn fork at the end brings about Rick's resignation.  So, how does this happen?  Well, read on.  Here is the GK analysis to help you follow this game of which starts off as a Ruy Lopez.  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15252003&fb=1&rnd=0.32452067174571786"

Of course, there is always B or N x P on f4 but I did calculate that I would still be considerable material up in the coming endgame and it would give me a chance to simplify further.   Gameknot Analysis thought that Rxd7 was better but Rick did not seem to think so, which was the main thing, because immediately after I executed the pawn fork he waved the white flag!   Amazing, a winning attack comes out of nowhere from the queen of defense and passivitis, jstevens1!  Anyhow, hope you have all had a good read.  There is a third installment of the Pawn fork theme to come - bye for now - Joanne"
