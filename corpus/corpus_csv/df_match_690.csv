BB will have an excellent control of a1-h8 whiles white's may be more limited in his control due to e4 blockade, which will prompt white to induce a future advance, being supported by either d4 or f4."

On the other hand, white has now the chance to expel BN on d4 if c3 is eventually allowed. White needs to exploit the narrow position black has on that area, not forgetting to try something on the BK castling though."

But then, black is moving pieces away from the castling, which makes me think about trying something there. The mate with N on h6 seems impossible, but then maybe something with the rook... Question is... would it be worth trying the advance h4? Or perhaps , since black has not advanced e5, Rf4 is the appropriate move?"

This is a risky commitment, since, once on the ""h"" file, the rook will be of no support to the Queen's flank, and after ...e5, black can cut off any reinforcements white will like to bring onto the castling area."

I guess in case of ...e5, black will have to give up on the center. That (not giving up on the center) may also explain why it was Ra and not Rfa8 played."
