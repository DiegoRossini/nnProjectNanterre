1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I like playing against e4, I switch between the Sicilian and the petrov. I know your supposed to master 1 opening and keep with that, but i like both. I have also recently found the philidor which i really like and will be playing more often. I should also say that i have only been back playing chess proper this year (april), so i am still looking for the openings that suit me best. I have found the website highlighted on marinvukusic profile www.chessgames.com very helpful."

Nf3, Nxe4, 5. d5, d4. 6.Bd3....is more common, so this was quite exciting! As a kid i always played this opening as white to try and fork the queen and rook (Ng5, Nxf7), :) you could only ever do it straight off against beginners though. Nostalgic moment there!"

6,Nxe4,f6e4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B1n3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,"This threatens whites bishop whilst creating pressure around the centre of the board. I will now develop, which should be carried out whilst gaining tempo thanks to whites retreat of the bishop (anticipated move)."

10,Be6,c8e6,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4b3/3pN3/2B1n3/8/PPPPQPPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 2 6,"I think this is the best move. It prevents a discovered check if i move my e4 knight, it strengthens the centre of the board and it is constructive development."
11,d3,d2d3,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4b3/3pN3/2B1n3/3P4/PPP1QPPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 6,"Having to move the threatened knight or go for exchange. i don't like the exchange as afterwards white has control of the centre and would dictate the way i will play (dxc4, Qxe4, c6, white superior). moving knight gives me better defensive security and allows my development to continue at my pace and my say so."
12,Nf6,e4f6,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4bn2/3pN3/2B5/3P4/PPP1QPPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 1 7,"knight retreats into position which i feel comfortable with, while at same time leaves white to ponder the threat on the bishop. From here i should be able to develop with ease."
13,Bb3,c4b3,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4bn2/3pN3/8/1B1P4/PPP1QPPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 2 7,"Continuing development, and putting pressure on e5 knight as it is cause for concern."

Now a intricate little battle is going on around my king side. white is perhaps hoping i play Nbd7 or Bxe5 which would lead to white probably winning the game. I have numerous moves which can prevent white gaining an advantage.
20,Qb6+,d8b6,rn3rk1/pp3ppp/1qpbbn2/3pN1B1/5P2/1B1P4/PPP1Q1PP/RN3RK1 w - - 1 11,However Qb6  is best. Knight is no longer pinned and now the e5 knight (which I think is key in whites attack) can be removed.
21,Kh1,g1h1,rn3rk1/pp3ppp/1qpbbn2/3pN1B1/5P2/1B1P4/PPP1Q1PP/RN3R1K b - - 2 11,Qb6  allows black the option of how future play will work out around my king side and as previously stated i believe the removal of the e5 knight is now essential.
22,Bxe5,d6e5,rn3rk1/pp3ppp/1qp1bn2/3pb1B1/5P2/1B1P4/PPP1Q1PP/RN3R1K w - - 0 12,gets rid of pesky knight and relieves pressure on the king side.
23,fxe5,f4e5,rn3rk1/pp3ppp/1qp1bn2/3pP1B1/8/1B1P4/PPP1Q1PP/RN3R1K b - - 0 12,best place for knight as threatening light squared bishop will be next move which starts a interesting battle.
24,Nfd7,f6d7,rn3rk1/pp1n1ppp/1qp1b3/3pP1B1/8/1B1P4/PPP1Q1PP/RN3R1K w - - 1 13,best place for knight as threatening light squared bishop will be next move which starts a interesting battle.
25,c3,c2c3,rn3rk1/pp1n1ppp/1qp1b3/3pP1B1/8/1BPP4/PP2Q1PP/RN3R1K b - - 0 13,white seeing the threat to his bishop makes an escape route for him.
26,Nc5,d7c5,rn3rk1/pp3ppp/1qp1b3/2npP1B1/8/1BPP4/PP2Q1PP/RN3R1K w - - 1 14,This now kick starts the battle to which i refer in the first page of this annotation was the main thing to look out for.
27,Bc2,b3c2,rn3rk1/pp3ppp/1qp1b3/2npP1B1/8/2PP4/PPB1Q1PP/RN3R1K b - - 2 14,"a clever well thought out move, had i falling for the trap or mistake?. it looks like a mistake and that is what i take it for as black still needs to make 1 more mistake before the queen is trapped. A mistake that can quite easily be played."
28,Qxb2,b6b2,rn3rk1/pp3ppp/2p1b3/2npP1B1/8/2PP4/PqB1Q1PP/RN3R1K w - - 0 15,"(At time my thinking: if white moves knight i win a piece, if not i win rook. can i escape with queen....should do. Good I have advantage.)"
29,Be7,g5e7,rn3rk1/pp2Bppp/2p1b3/2npP3/8/2PP4/PqB1Q1PP/RN3R1K b - - 1 15,"On move 14 we where even on points. now i am a pawn up. so i am ahead. if we exchange rooks i will be 4 points up when king takes bishop. what if i take rook then white takes knight....can he trap me.....oh! yes he can, if after Qxa1, Bxc5, then i move Re1, white can then Bb3, Na6, Bd4, c5, Na3, Qxf1 , Qxf1, cxd4, cxd4 am a point up but the future does not bode well."
