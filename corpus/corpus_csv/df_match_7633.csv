Now, by this move, I'm setting the ""trick"": Nd2-c4, and he cannot take it because Nxc4, trheatening the queen and the bishop at the same time, recovering my piece and a pawn, along with a good position. 
Bd3 was ok, apparently, and if c4, Bc2. But after Ne4, I'm giving him an ""attacking"" position, I didn't like it. 
Be2 sets the threat Qg3 (for Bh6), but it is easily met, and there are a lot of ways the game can go on. 
I hoped the trick I am building is too deep for him to see. Anyway, not a bad move as it seems to be."
