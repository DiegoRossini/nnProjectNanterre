1,f3,f2f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5P2/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

I think this is my second worst game I have played against Master Freddy.  I played like my OTB rating here.  My OTB rating is still 1200.  If you see what happened from the middlegame onwards you will see why.  Freddy opens with the Gedault Opening, 1. f3."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/5P2/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,1. ...... e5 - the most common response to this pawn move.
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/2N2P2/PPPPP1PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"2.  Nc3 - aha, Freddy does not follow up with the Fried Fox, Pork Chop Opening, which is 2. Kf2.  This knight move of Freddy's to c3 transposes into his favourite opening which is the Dunst!"
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/8/2N2P2/PPPPP1PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,"4. ....... Nc6 - and this becomes like the Centre Game but with the e pawn on e2 and not e4.  I decide to develop a piece.  Freddy chooses to tuck his queen, that Wicked Witch of the West onto f2.  You will see why as the game develops."
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/3P4/2N2P2/PPP1P1PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"4. ....... Nc6 - and this becomes like the Centre Game but with the e pawn on e2 and not e4.  I decide to develop a piece.  Freddy chooses to tuck his queen, that Wicked Witch of the West onto f2.  You will see why as the game develops."
6,exd4,e5d4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/8/3p4/2N2P2/PPP1P1PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"4. ....... Nc6 - and this becomes like the Centre Game but with the e pawn on e2 and not e4.

7,Qxd4,d1d4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/8/3Q4/2N2P2/PPP1P1PP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"4. ....... Nc6 - and this becomes like the Centre Game but with the e pawn on e2 and not e4.  I decide to develop a piece.  Freddy chooses to tuck his queen, that Wicked Witch of the West onto f2.  You will see why as the game develops."
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/3Q4/2N2P2/PPP1P1PP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"4. ....... Nc6 - and this becomes like the Centre Game but with the e pawn on e2 and not e4.

9,Qf2,d4f2,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/8/2N2P2/PPP1PQPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 2 5,"5. ..... Bb4 - pins the knight on c3 and develops a piece.  I am now wondering whether the move Be7, although more passive would have been more circumspect here.  For starters it defends the knight on f6."
10,Bb4,f8b4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/1b6/2N2P2/PPP1PQPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 3 6,"5. ..... Bb4 - pins the knight on c3 and develops a piece.  I am now wondering whether the move Be7, although more passive would have been more circumspect here.  For starters it defends the knight on f6."
11,Bd2,c1d2,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/1b6/2N2P2/PPPBPQPP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 4 6,"7. ........ Qe7.  I start to clear the decks so that I can choose whether to castle kingside or queenside.  I would prefer to castle queenside, same side as Freddy this time, but there is the possibility of Freddy putting a knight on d5.  Freddy prepares for it by playing e4.  This move makes Nd5 a very strong move because if there is an exchange of knights on d5, the e pawn will recapture, threaten the c6 knight and open up the possibility of a rook pin on the e column.  Henry and Glenda are really sitting ducks there!"
12,d6,d7d6,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/8/1b6/2N2P2/PPPBPQPP/R3KBNR w KQkq - 0 7,"7. ........ Qe7.  I start to clear the decks so that I can choose whether to castle kingside or queenside.

Fou Lenoir gives up his life for that knight but now Freddy's dsb goes to c3.  That dsb's control of the a1-h8 diagonal will open up the possibility of a combo against the f6 knight later on.
16,Bxc3,b4c3,r1b1k2r/ppp1qppp/2np1n2/8/4P3/2b2P2/PPPB1QPP/2KR1BNR w kq - 0 9,8. ........ Bxc3 - so I avoid this possibility by making a concession.

Incredibly this is the only time such a thing has happened in my game against Freddy, me being lost in just a dozen moves!!!  Now here comes the combo.  Admittedly it takes four moves before the devastation becomes apparent, but at my level I should have seen it coming."
