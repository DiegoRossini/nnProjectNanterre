1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"B00 King's Pawn Opening. The King's Pawn opening move is both popular and logical. It controls the center, opens lines for both the Queen and the Bishop, and usually leads to an open game in which tactics, rather than slow maneuvering, predominates."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"B02 Alekhine Defense. Alekhine successfully introduced this defense in the 1920's and it is still valid today. It avoids major attacking lines by White, while inviting White to overextend in the center."
3,e5,e4e5,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/4P3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"B02 Alekhine Defense. This natural move declines to advance with 2.Nc3, which would transpose the game into a Vienna game."
4,Nd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/3nP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"B02 Alekhine Defense / Normal Variation 2.e5 Nd5. This is a 'standard' position in the Alekhine Defense. Black's idea is to entice White to advance pawns, making them targets in need of defending later. After ten years or so, the Alekhine is making a new appearance on the tournament scene.  3.d4 d6 4.Nf3 is still considered the most solid for White."
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/3nP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,B02 Alekhine Defense / Normal Variation 2.e5 Nd5.
6,d6,d7d6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p4/3nP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,B03 Alekhine Defense / Normal Variation 2.e5 Nd5 3.d4 d6.
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p4/3nP3/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,B04 Alekhine Defense / Modern Variation. The Modern Variation relies on development rather than a pawn assault.
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2np4/3nP3/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,B04 Alekhine Defense / Modern Variation.

10,Nb6,d5b6,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/1nnp4/4P3/2PP4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,"Finally developing the queenside knight, but with the c-pawn not being blockaded in the process. White has a very strong center."
11,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/1nnp4/4P3/2PP4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 6,"Finally developing the queenside knight, but with the c-pawn not being blockaded in the process. White has a very strong center."
12,g6,g7g6,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/1nnp2p1/4P3/2PP4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,Black's plan is to fianchetto the dark squared bishop to counterattack the central squares after the inevitable exchange at e5 or d6.

Here it is very strong, as the knight outpost at c5 blockades White's potentially powerful c4 pawn, as well as controlling the key squares b3, d3, e4 and e6!"
