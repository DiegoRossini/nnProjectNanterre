1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game was from a thematic mini-tournament. The starting position is after black's fourth move.

The result unfortunately was a timeout. However there were some interesting phases of play, which I have annotated in order to try and draw some lessons."

10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 2 6,Decision time in the centre. I opt to maintain the tension for another move. Alternatives are the Petrosian variation (d5) or the (boring) exchange variation.

The idea is to bring the knight to c4 putting pressure on d6; at the same time, white's control of the d1-h5 diagonal inhibits black from initiating his kingside counterplay by Nh5."

In Ljubojevic-Kasparov (Linares 1993), white played Nb3, supporting the c5 break but leaving the knight misplaced for the sequel. This move is intended to put pressure down the c-file while adding to a possible later defence of g2."
