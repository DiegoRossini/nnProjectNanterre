1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Here is a challenge from my friend hugomason, who in one of his chess books has discovered his new favourite opening: the Budapest Gambit. Hugo decided that trial-and-error was the best way to learn this opening, and so he challenged me to a game entitled ""Budapest Gambit"". I edited the title slightly for this annotation :-)."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"This is only the second time I have been faced with this unnatural-looking defence, the Budapest Gambit. Due to its tricky nature, it is often played at club level, but, since White is able to hold on to the two bishops and the extra pawn, it is rarely played at master level. White should accept the gambit."

5,dxe5,d4e5,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4P3/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,Black's only continuation to put sufficient pressure on White's advanced extra pawn.
6,Ng4,f6g4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/2P3n1/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,Black's only continuation to put sufficient pressure on White's advanced extra pawn.
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/2P3n1/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,4.Nf3 and 4.Bf4 are White's main options here: Black will have the advantage very quickly if White does not fight to hold onto his pawn. NOTE THAT 4.f4? is a bad move as with 4...Bc5! White's position is in trouble. I learned that the hard way in my first game vs the Budapest Gambit :-(...

However, I can combat this very effectively with my own queenside expansion: 9.a3 b5 10.b4! and Black has expanded with tempo, giving his queenside pawns the edge.
