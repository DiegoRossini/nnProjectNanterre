1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Honeybrook: I thought it would be interesting and helpful to post a game by the great Alexander Alekhine, many times world chess champion and in my mind probably the greatest player of all time.  But who can say?

Many notes are Alekhine's and can be found in his book of his best games. Where my notes are added I will specify as 'Honeybrook' or 'H'."

An opening, according to www.chessgames.com's database, white wins 35%, black 22% and draws 42%. It's greatest popularity was enjoyed during the first two decades of the 20th century.  But it is by no means forgotten, Bobby Fischer often employed the opening with great success... but then he was Bobby Fischer."

10,d6,d7d6,r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1np1n2/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 6,"Alekhine begins:
This permits white to start an immediate action in the center without being obliged to protect first the King pawn by Re1 or Qe2 which would have been the case after 5...Be7.

Honeybrook: this to me is a sophisticated note that requires some thought to appreciate. For in truth the King pawn is now unprotected and easy prey for black's knight. But anticipating the freeing of the bishop on c1 to attack black's queen from g5, the black knight is reluctant to abandon its post just to capture the king pawn.  The knight would stand on an unprotected square and have to retreat in the face of Re1 or d3 thus giving up a tempo."

H: Where can the knight go? There are no excellent homes for it to land, retreat is forced.  Meanwhile white's position has room to move while black's suffocatingly cramped.  Plus, the d5 knight controls e6."
