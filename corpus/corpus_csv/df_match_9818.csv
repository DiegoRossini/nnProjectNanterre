Entering the Yugoslav attack with 9.f3 is probably the most critical, but it can be very painful to play white, at least in a game with less time on your clock. I used to think this h3 move was a good practical choice, but after some games, including this one, I've changed my mind. Now I believe the Maroczy bind is a better practical choice against the accelerated dragon if you want to avoid the complications of the Yugoslav attack."
