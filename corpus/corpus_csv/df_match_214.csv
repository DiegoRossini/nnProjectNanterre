White played this move before moving away his bishop on c4. Maybe the idea was to make a forcing move and gain time and at the same time develop the Queen. But now my ambition is to castle and play Re8, putting the Rook in front of White's Queen."

Since exchanges should always have a point, I'm guessing White's point is to create a doubled pawn on the c-file and then attack it.

I now have the bishop pair (and will be keeping it until the end of the game)."

Maybe I could have developed my light squared bishop (on c8), thus connecting my Rook on b8 with the Queen and other Rook.
I know moves like h3/h6 and a3/a6 can make sense, but I often feel like they make me lose time."

Maybe White plans on manoeuvring on the Queen-side. This move does support b4, if White is going to attack my doubled pawn(s). But White's bishop can't join the fight.

I'm a little concerned about the e5-square. It looks like White's knight has access to it, supported by its rook."

Here I don't remember all the variations I looked at, but my plan against Bb2 was to play d4, in order to somewhat limit the reach of White's bishop. However, White can challenge d4 with c3, and his Knight also covers the d4-square.

Therefore my plan is to exchange Knights"
