1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The other day, I couldn't resist having a peak through my buddy, The Dentist's past games profile because his rating had suddenly shot up about 18 points.  I saw this brevity and I couldn't help playing through it to see how The Dentist managed to pulverise his opponent in just TWELVE MOVES!  I saw how, he showed his opponent the utter folly of leaving the Fool's Mate diagonal unprotected.  Yes, white was certainly awakened from a Fool's Paradise."
2,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,2......... e5 - transposes into a sort of King's Gambit declined.
3,f4,f2f4,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,2......... e5 - transposes into a sort of King's Gambit declined.
4,e5,e7e5,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,2......... e5 - transposes into a sort of King's Gambit declined.
5,f5,f4f5,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4pP2/4P3/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,3. f5? - bad move - this leaves the Fool's Mate diagonal unprotected to the BQ.  Better was Nf3 guarding the h4 square and developing a piece at the same time - in this case white will now drop a pawn as 3........ Qh4  forks WK and e4 pawn.
6,Qh4+,d8h4,r1b1kbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4pP2/4P2q/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"4. ........ Qxe4  - after 4. g3?? this allows another queen fork on e4 and the WR on h1 is toast.  The Dentist may have a low rating, but as you saw with my earlier annotated game ""In the Dentist's Chair"" in which I very nearly lost he is not to be underestimated!  Now white really feels the drill as a lot of enammel is about to disappear from his side of the board!!"

10,Qxh1,e4h1,r1b1kbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4pP2/8/6P1/PPPPQ2P/RNB1KBNq w Qkq - 0 6,6. Nf3 - develops a piece but three moves too late.  The Dentist now develops very sensibly bringing out a knight to f6.

12,Nf6,g8f6,r1b1kb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4pP2/8/5NP1/PPPPQ2P/RNB1KB1q w Qkq - 2 7,7. Qc4?? - white tries to counter-attack by zeroing in on f7 with his queen but he leaves the f3 knight en prise.
13,Qc4,e2c4,r1b1kb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4pP2/2Q5/5NP1/PPPP3P/RNB1KB1q b Qkq - 3 7,7. Qc4?? - white tries to counter-attack by zeroing in on f7 with his queen but he leaves the f3 knight en prise.
14,Qxf3,h1f3,r1b1kb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4pP2/2Q5/5qP1/PPPP3P/RNB1KB2 w Qkq - 0 8,8. Be2 - develops a piece but white is way down on material.  Had it been me I would have resigned when I knew I was going to drop a rook even though The Dentist is 300 points south of my rating.  But I don't think I would have left the Fool's Mate diagonal unprotected in the first place.
15,Be2,f1e2,r1b1kb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4pP2/2Q5/5qP1/PPPPB2P/RNB1K3 b Qkq - 1 8,8. Be2 - develops a piece but white is way down on material.
