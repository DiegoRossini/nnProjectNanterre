8,dxc5,d6c5,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/2p1p3/3P4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,after this it looks as if whit has the upper hand because if Nxe5 then dxe5 and material is even.

10,cxd4,c5d4,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/4N3/3p4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,This move lets black win a pawn (and maybe more if white is careless).
11,g3,g2g3,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/4N3/3p4/6P1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"I don't understand this move at all, it leaves his knight undefended, and a fianchettoed bishop doesn't do much when the opposite knight is already developed. Because of this, white loses a piece for a pawn."
