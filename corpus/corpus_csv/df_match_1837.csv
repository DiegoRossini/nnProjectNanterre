1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"A40 Queen's Pawn Opening. The Queen's Pawn opening move is somewhat slower than the popular e4, because White will not be able to castle for three more moves. Its advantage is that it gives White more control over tactical surprises and often provides more lasting initiative and pressure."

In Queenside openings, one rarely is rewarded when blocking the c-pawn because you lose that as a lever against the center. 3.c4 (see!) 3...Bg44.cxd5 Bxf3 5.gxf3 Qxd5 6.e3 e57.Nc3 Bb4 8.Bd2 Bxc3 9.bxc3Qd6 and White is 8% better, possessing the Bishop pair and a strong center."
