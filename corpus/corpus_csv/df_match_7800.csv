There is, in fact, a highly complex variation following 16.Bg2 gxf6 17.exf7+, when my investigation suggests white is winning:
a) 17...Kxf7?? 18.Ng5+ fxg5 19.Bxd5+ wins black's queen.
b) 17...Qxf7?! 18.Ng5 is very complex and at time of writing my mind is too hazy to go into it without a board to move the peices on, but again white looks to at least recover the material.
c) 17...Bxf7 18.Nh4 wins the exchange due to the skewer along the long diagonal."
