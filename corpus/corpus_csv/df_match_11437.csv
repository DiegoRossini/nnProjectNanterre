1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This game is a Bogo-Indian which features some key positional ideas for the Black pieces.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,Here White wishes to avoid the Nimzo-Indian and is probably hoping for 3...b6 when the Queen's Indian Defense will lead him into lines where White has a good chance for a small but persistent advantage.

6,Bb4+,f8b4,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,"I, however, prefer Efim Bogolubov's defense."
7,Bd2,c1d2,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/5N2/PP1BPPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 3 4,"Here White could transpose into the Nimzo-Kasparov Variation with 4. Nc3, however, this move and 6. Nbd2 keep things in Bogo territory."
8,Qe7,d8e7,rnb1k2r/ppppqppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/5N2/PP1BPPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 4 5,"The purpose of this move is two-fold, as it prevents the exchange of Bishops, after which White would lose a pawn, and it prepares an eventual e5, by playing Nc6, exchanging the Bishops and then playing d6 and finally e5, with active play on the kingside."
9,g3,g2g3,rnb1k2r/ppppqppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/5NP1/PP1BPP1P/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"Black has a few options here, however, I like the consistency and straight forwardness of playing for a quick e5."
10,Nc6,b8c6,r1b1k2r/ppppqppp/2n1pn2/8/1bPP4/5NP1/PP1BPP1P/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,"Black has a few options here, however, I like the consistency and straight forwardness of playing for a quick e5."
11,Bg2,f1g2,r1b1k2r/ppppqppp/2n1pn2/8/1bPP4/5NP1/PP1BPPBP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 2 6,"A slight inaccuracy on my part.  6...Bxd2 allows White the opportunity to play 7. Qxd2?! where after 7...Ne4 8.Qc2 Qb4 , White has to make some unpleasant choices;

1) 9. Kf1 d5
2) 9. Nc3 Nxc3 10. Qxc3 Qxc3 11. bxc3 b6 where White's weak pawn structure will be an endgame disadvantage.
3) 9. Nbd2 Nxd2 10. Qxd2 Qxc4 or 10. Nxd2 Nxd4 and White doesnt have sufficient compensation for the pawn."
12,O-O,e8g8,r1b2rk1/ppppqppp/2n1pn2/8/1bPP4/5NP1/PP1BPPBP/RN1QK2R w KQ - 3 7,"A slight inaccuracy on my part.  6...Bxd2 allows White the opportunity to play 7. Qxd2?! where after 7...Ne4 8.Qc2 Qb4 , White has to make some unpleasant choices;

13,O-O,e1g1,r1b2rk1/ppppqppp/2n1pn2/8/1bPP4/5NP1/PP1BPPBP/RN1Q1RK1 b - - 4 7,"Why the exchange?  Black gets the opportunity to exchange of Bishop for Bishop, rather than Bishop for Knight, also the Queen's Knight will be less aggressively placed on d2."

16,d6,d7d6,r1b2rk1/ppp1qppp/2nppn2/8/2PP4/5NP1/PP1NPPBP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 9,Now we have transposed back to the main line.
17,e4,e2e4,r1b2rk1/ppp1qppp/2nppn2/8/2PPP3/5NP1/PP1N1PBP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 9,"The culmination of Black's opening strategy, he stakes a claim in the center and invites a closing of the position where Black's chances are at least equal to White's."

1) White's knight on d2 is misplaced,
2) White's bishop is hemmed in by it's center pawns;
3) Black is behind in development, however, the fact that the center is closed makes this a minor drawback.  Black indeed has a strategically sound position."
