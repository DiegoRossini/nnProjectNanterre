Black just has to exercise reasonable care."

17,g4,g2g4,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pnb1/4N3/2BP2P1/2N5/PPP4P/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 9,"Well, this is the type of caveman response one will have to get used to if one plays 5...c6 on a regular basis. White hasn't got a clue how to attack the Black position and lashes out! On second thought, for caveman, substitute desperate!  

Another plausible alternative for White is 9.Bg5 

PLAUSIBLE, BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH! 

Black deals with this move comfortably with straightforward development: 
9...Nbd7 10.Qe2 Be7 11.Rad1 Nxe5 12.dxe5 Nd5 13.Bxe7 Qxe7 14.Ne4 Bxe4 15.Qxe4 Qc5+ 16.Rd4 0-0-0 when White has already run out of steam, and Black's advantage is unquestionable, P Sadilek - S Bakker, Vienna Open 2003. 

9 Bg5 only seems to help Black in his quest to exchange pieces."
