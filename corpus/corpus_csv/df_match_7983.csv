2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Preparing for the gambit...
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Here comes the gambit...
4,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Black could have played e6 instead.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,White advances his knight.
6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Pawn blocking Bishop at c8
7,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3p4/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,White continues to attack the centre.
8,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3p4/1bPPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"Instead of taking the pawn at c4, Black chooses to advance his Bishop. This is not a bad move but perhaps moving his Knight or even better taking the pawn at e4 would have been a better choice."
9,e5,e4e5,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3pP3/1bPP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,White takes advantage of this and establishes strong presence in the centre
10,dxc4,d5c4,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/4P3/1bpP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,At this stage I would have moved my Knight at g8 to e7 instead of taking the white pawn at c4.
11,Bxc4,f1c4,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/4P3/1bBP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 6,White takes the pawn back with his Bishop
12,b5,b7b5,rnbqk1nr/p4ppp/2p1p3/1p2P3/1bBP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 7,"Good move, threatening White bishop."
13,Be2,c4e2,rnbqk1nr/p4ppp/2p1p3/1p2P3/1b1P4/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 7,"White Bishop retreats but instead of going to b3, white chooses to go to e2 as he plans to launch an attack on the Kingside."
14,Ne7,g8e7,rnbqk2r/p3nppp/2p1p3/1p2P3/1b1P4/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 2 8,Black activates his Knight
15,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk2r/p3nppp/2p1p3/1p2P3/1b1P4/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 8,White moves his Knight to a good square. White is ahead in developing his pieces. He has a good centre. Black's bishop at c8 is blocked by his pawn at e6. He hasn't yet developed his other knight at b8. The good square for his knight (c6) is now occupied by his pawn.
16,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/p3nppp/2p1p3/1p2P3/1b1P4/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 4 9,Black castles. I don't see anything wrong with this move.

18,Nd7,b8d7,r1bq1rk1/p2nnppp/2p1p3/1p2P3/1b1P4/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 6 10,Black ignores the threat to h7 and develops his knight.
19,Bxh7+,d3h7,r1bq1rk1/p2nnppB/2p1p3/1p2P3/1b1P4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 10,"White takes the pawn at h7, sacrificing his Bishop. By this move he hopes to expose the black king."
20,Kxh7,g8h7,r1bq1r2/p2nnppk/2p1p3/1p2P3/1b1P4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 11,Black defeats the white bishop. Now White can check with his Knight
