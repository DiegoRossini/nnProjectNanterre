Nd7 is also possible, and perhaps Qc7 or Qb6; however, I did not like any of the queen moves in this position as I ultimately don't think they will work in this position. Often white can sacrifice on h6, but in this position, it appears to me that white is not really set up to do so; and doesn't in the ensuing moves. I am still not developed all the way, and want to not just castle by rote here; let white guess a bit. But I have to be careful not to wait too long."

Since the light squared bishops are off the board, sometimes an imbalance of two knights verse a knight and a bishop is better, especially if the pawns are mostly still on the board. Yes, the bishop can cover the board more quickly, but two knights can work very well together, and the pawns can hem the bishop in, so it depends on the position. I did not want white to make that particular trade. Besides, this is typically where the queen's knight goes anyways."

However, white's pieces are beginning to become coordinated, and so I decide to lessen some of the tension."

Nxf7 and Ng6, were white prepared to make those moves, could prove unpleasant. For example, were white allowed to, Nxf7 Kxf7 Qf3 and the black king must retreat; but Kg8 is very unpleasant, and Ke8 is just dangerous after Rxe6. I have one move to make before white can consider it, so I do what I think will not allow white enough compensation to make such a move. ::edited:: Yes, black can move the knight to f6 instead of moving the king, but it just seems dangerous to keep having pieces tied up on defense allowing white more initiative, and the white rooks would quickly be able to add pressure down the e file if I chose that. So as I said...::"

If white still had three minor pieces, or  if white's rooks were positioned to support the kingside, black would be in a dangerous position. Now, however, the move h3 made by white some moves ago makes it more difficult to get both rooks involved quickly, and I think black will be able to defend just fine. White however still has the initiative."

Either of the other two would have been interesting; but the bishop recapture seems a little passive to me because it delays other tactics on h6 and doesn't seem to give white any additional pressure.

I am still trying to equalize. Some may say it looks equal, but white up to the last couple moves had maintained an initiative. I am close to changing that. White's attack has really evaporated now."

I am already looking ahead to my counter play on the queenside; after a short think, I decide to move the Rook to where I think it will do the most good. When queenside play begins, notice how the black rook moves and black queen position result in an advantage for black. I could not at this point know what my opponent would do, but after considering the possibilities, thought that the c file would become open before long."
