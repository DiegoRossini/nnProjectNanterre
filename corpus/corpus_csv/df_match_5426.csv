I'm threatening to trade that knight for a bishop, and in a closed game, knights are better than bishops. But I hate to trade off this bishop, because my pawns are on white squares, and this bishop is used to protect the dark squares. So I really would prefer not to make that trade. What I really want to do is play Be4 and trade off my white-squared bishop for his knight. But giving up the bishop pair is like giving up a half a pawn. Hard decisions."
