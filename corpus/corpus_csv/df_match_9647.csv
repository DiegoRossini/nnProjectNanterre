Anyone who plays Ruy Lopez regularly will spot this and have a proper look at the position now. Your e4 is vulnerable and black can consider some other positional options. I expected you to play 0-0 first as that discourages Nxe4 and prepares for Re1."

By that I mean - I think I can defend it (the position, not the extra pawn) and will reach a position of equality at least. I normally would play d6 or other developing move, but you obviously want to divert from normal Ruy Lopez !  Sharp play from here, I hope I don't get cut."
