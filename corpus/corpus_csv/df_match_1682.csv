1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,I've taken a liking to the flexible reti opening lately. It presents many possibilities and allows me to enter some favourable variations on some of my common openings.

But against a stronger opponent such as elyhim I feel my best chances lie playing the white side of this system."

24,Nd7,f6d7,r2q1rk1/pp1nppbp/2bp2p1/8/2PBP3/2N2P2/PP1QB1PP/R4RK1 w - - 1 13,Broadly speaking black has two ways to handle the position. He can either try to strike at whites center by playing for the violent d5 or b5 pawn breaks. Or he can play with a strategy based around making use of the dark square weaknesses in whites position. This move aims for the latter. To be honest I'm not surprised. Elyhim is a very good strategical/positional player and aiming for favourable endgames by making use of blacks stronger colour complex is very much his style. Basically black wants to exchange DSBs then place a knight on c5 support it with a5 possible bring the quuen to b6 and make use of the weakened dark squares.
25,Be3,d4e3,r2q1rk1/pp1nppbp/2bp2p1/8/2P1P3/2N1BP2/PP1QB1PP/R4RK1 b - - 2 13,"I avoid the exchange for a couple of reasons. For one thing I have a space advantage so should look to avoid exchanges. For another an exchange would only be going along with blacks plans. Maybe there is some merit to exchanging DSB if I were going to follow up with an attack against the black king. But to be honest I feel like white should be playing a different strategy which revolves around cintrloibg the center and squeezing black to death/leaving him with no play.
Btw we are still in book here this is still very much theory."

27,Rac1,a1c1,r2q1rk1/pp2ppbp/2bp2p1/2n5/2P1P3/2N1BP2/PP1QB1PP/2R2RK1 b - - 4 14,"I think the more common square for the took would be b1, evidently intending to play for pawn advances on the queen side at some point. I opted for this because I had my own ideas about how I wanted to play the position. Here the took adds protection to the knight and is ready to play on the c file if it ever opens up."
28,a5,a7a5,r2q1rk1/1p2ppbp/2bp2p1/p1n5/2P1P3/2N1BP2/PP1QB1PP/2R2RK1 w - - 0 15,More dark square control and adding support to the knights position.

Its very strong here holding slot of influence over the board and if black wants to get rid of it then he will need to either give up his LSB leaving me with a lot of space plus great pawn chain and the bishop pair or he will need to play e6 which will weaken the d6 pain and make it a possible target.

I was already planning to meet ...e6 with Nxb6 but black hadn't played it yet. So this move prepares to challenge the knight on c5 by preparing a3/b4. Also it means I can still possible take on b6 if black tries 18...Rd7 19.a3 e6 20.Nxb6!?"

Possibly he missed my next move or perhaps he was ready to embrace the complications and felt that the resulting position presented black with good chances. Right now white has two options, to drop my knight back and play against the weakened d6 pawn or..."
37,Nxb6,d5b6,3q1rk1/1r3pbp/1Nbpp1p1/p1n5/2P1P3/1P2BP2/P2QB1PP/1R1R2K1 b - - 0 19,"To dive head first into the complications. Practically speaking I think this offers white the best winning chances, especially given the rating disparity. I want give all my analysis as I think too much variations and reams of analysis to go through can be quite dry. But the line I was expecting/hoping for was 19...Qxb6 20.Qxd6 Nxe4 21.Qxf1+! (An important intermizzo) Bxf1 22.Bxb6 Nc3 24.Bxa5 Nxe2+ 25.Kf1 and I think white has good chances. Instead elyhim came up with a move I overlooked which on a practical aspect is probably more speaking than Qxb6"

During the game I thought this move was forced incidently I didnt even see Na5 until after playing this. Na5 I think offers white a safe albeit very slight edge. The move played is objectivly the strongest but does offer black attacking chances. After some thought I think I had found the way to force at least a draw.

This move forces the draw, a great result against such a strong opponent. However on the other hand I have the advantage here and in settling for a draw I may have thrown away a rare chance at fighting for a win against a ~2500 rated opponent! I can't help but feeling like this is chickening out in a way. The alternative was to play g3 where we either have 21.g3 Bxg3 22.hxg3 Qxg3+ or 21.g3 Bxg3 Bf1 in both cases White might be the better side, but my king would be very exposed with moves like f5 to come I felt taking the easy out as it were would push me over 2000 and that was a good feeling."
