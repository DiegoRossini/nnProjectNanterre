19,f4,f2f4,r3k1nr/pppq1p1p/3p2p1/4b3/4PP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 10,"I know that most inexperienced players think that pawn structure is very critical, which is untrue. The order of advantages from the highest to least in a position evaluation are: material, piece activity, king safety, and finally pawn structure. Also, here, if he takes, I get an open b file and get to exploit the weak dark squares easily. If his king castle on either side, I will have play against it."
20,Bxc3,e5c3,r3k1nr/pppq1p1p/3p2p1/8/4PP2/2b5/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 11,it was probably better to keep the bishop to watch the dark squares.

24,f6,f7f6,2kr2nr/pppq3p/3p1pp1/8/3QPP2/2P5/P1P3PP/R1B2RK1 w - - 0 13,threatening an obvious Qa1mate

26,Qc6,d7c6,2kr2nr/Qpp4p/2qp1pp1/8/4PP2/2P5/P1P3PP/R1B2RK1 w - - 1 14,pointless. better is to get his pieces out safely.

30,Qd7,c6d7,2kr2nr/2pq3p/1p1p1pp1/8/3QPP2/2P5/P1P3PP/R1B2R1K w - - 2 16,the queen is moving back and forth without any clear plan.
31,Be3,c1e3,2kr2nr/2pq3p/1p1p1pp1/8/3QPP2/2P1B3/P1P3PP/R4R1K b - - 3 16,just completing the development.
32,Qe6,d7e6,2kr2nr/2p4p/1p1pqpp1/8/3QPP2/2P1B3/P1P3PP/R4R1K w - - 4 17,too many queen moves!! The knight and rook are not doing anything.
33,f5,f4f5,2kr2nr/2p4p/1p1pqpp1/5P2/3QP3/2P1B3/P1P3PP/R4R1K b - - 0 17,open the position when you have better development.

I am experienced at handling small material advantages (not so great at generating unclear attacks) and a trade is fine, as it will undouble the pawns and leave my pieces relatively better. I will also, of course have 1 extra pawn."
36,Ne7,g8e7,2kr3r/2p1n2p/1p1p1pp1/4qP2/3QP3/2P1B3/P1P3PP/1R3R1K w - - 3 19,"threatening Bxb6, and he will have to really do something about this. This also sets a little trap, which black can blunder into if he over reacts"
37,Qc4,d4c4,2kr3r/2p1n2p/1p1p1pp1/4qP2/2Q1P3/2P1B3/P1P3PP/1R3R1K b - - 4 19,"threatening Bxb6, and he will have to really do something about this. This also sets a little trap, which black can blunder into if he over reacts"
