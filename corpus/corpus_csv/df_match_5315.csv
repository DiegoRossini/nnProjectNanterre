1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Threats of discovered attacks/pins/self pins/royal forks----All these in one game? Pawn promotion, my pawns only in front of the opponents king!! For those who wish to enjoy a lesson of a game and learn while playing this one out, to never get to over confident.... After asking my opponent(during the middle of the game) if I may annotate this,(due to the unusual amount of threats and counter threats!) his defensive play went beyond to a point which I felt I was going to loose! Only thing bad about this game is I failed to end it in a classical type manner and missed many winning opportunities that could have ended it swiftly. Hoping the lessons in it and about it help us all. thekingni............"

5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,This position was the stipulation of the thematic mini-tournament which cavalcanti conceived. The King's gambit accepted or also known as the King's Knight's gambit.
6,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk1nr/ppppbppp/8/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,"This is ""book"" according to the computer analysis. I, do not know much about it....my play is from common sense and out of my admiration of the earliest masters. Capablanca and the like."
7,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqk1nr/ppppbppp/8/8/2B1Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 4,Still book but let me say that my opponent seems to want an accelerated development. So then I consider here and now that my opening shall become closed and attempt to neutralize all range of movement which his pieces may initially acquire.
8,d6,d7d6,rnbqk1nr/ppp1bppp/3p4/8/2B1Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"So now the reasoning begins and the book gets chucked out the window........so says the analytic computer(not me!) The e7 bishop is set to assist only with my king side pawn majority, the move played therefor establishes the queen side bishop to be the most mobile!"
9,d4,d2d4,rnbqk1nr/ppp1bppp/3p4/8/2BPPp2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"My opponent chooses the exact thought which I expressed earlier....development, development, development. He builds a strong central and strategical position which I will attempt to dismiss."
10,g5,g7g5,rnbqk1nr/ppp1bp1p/3p4/6p1/2BPPp2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,His king knight is now limited to 2 out of 8 possible moves and begins the advance of the majority.
11,O-O,e1g1,rnbqk1nr/ppp1bp1p/3p4/6p1/2BPPp2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 6,Staying in theme and protecting the king to the side which I should have difficulties projecting my own pieces.
12,Nd7,b8d7,r1bqk1nr/pppnbp1p/3p4/6p1/2BPPp2/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 7,Attempting three things... 1. developing.  2. central governance. 3. future attempt at restriction of the bishops range.
13,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqk1nr/pppnbp1p/3p4/6p1/2BPPp2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 3 7,"Good developing move, perhaps planning central expansion."
14,Nb6,d7b6,r1bqk1nr/ppp1bp1p/1n1p4/6p1/2BPPp2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 4 8,"Tho most would refrain from moving pieces twice so early in the game due to getting behind in development, I set the standard of my opening to be a restrictive one(to the opponent) and will adhere to that goal. In addition to deeming the opening theme a failure if I deviate from my intentions."
15,Bb3,c4b3,r1bqk1nr/ppp1bp1p/1n1p4/6p1/3PPp2/1BN2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 5 8,Was attacked and now is in a cramped position.
16,Bg4,c8g4,r2qk1nr/ppp1bp1p/1n1p4/6p1/3PPpb1/1BN2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 6 9,"More so a need for developing while toying with 0-0-0 in the future, plus enjoying some spacial benefits."
17,h3,h2h3,r2qk1nr/ppp1bp1p/1n1p4/6p1/3PPpb1/1BN2N1P/PPP3P1/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 9,"Oops, his theme changed first! Now his wishes may be in the restriction of my space!"
18,Bh5,g4h5,r2qk1nr/ppp1bp1p/1n1p4/6pb/3PPp2/1BN2N1P/PPP3P1/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 1 10,I'll keep the pin and reduce his central dominance.
19,Qe1,d1e1,r2qk1nr/ppp1bp1p/1n1p4/6pb/3PPp2/1BN2N1P/PPP3P1/R1B1QRK1 b kq - 2 10,"So much for the pin, but where is his opening theme? Shifted from rapid development to a quick attempt to control e5? Hey, I'm not a master, but please stick to your guns as much as possible, at best to lessen the confusion of the upcoming middle game."
20,c6,c7c6,r2qk1nr/pp2bp1p/1npp4/6pb/3PPp2/1BN2N1P/PPP3P1/R1B1QRK1 w kq - 0 11,This was done at this time to benefit the center and to lessen range that the knight may utilize.
21,e5,e4e5,r2qk1nr/pp2bp1p/1npp4/4P1pb/3P1p2/1BN2N1P/PPP3P1/R1B1QRK1 b kq - 0 11,Here comes the new shift from deployment to central aggression.
22,d5,d6d5,r2qk1nr/pp2bp1p/1np5/3pP1pb/3P1p2/1BN2N1P/PPP3P1/R1B1QRK1 w kq - 0 12,In keeping with my continuous blockade theme and making the queen side like a BP oil slick! Needing removal and repositioning.
23,g3,g2g3,r2qk1nr/pp2bp1p/1np5/3pP1pb/3P1p2/1BN2NPP/PPP5/R1B1QRK1 b kq - 0 12,This is where I saw the chance to rid myself of a doubled pawn and seek compensation for the weaknesses in whites king side.
