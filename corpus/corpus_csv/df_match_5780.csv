1,b4,b2b4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/1P6/8/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The Sokolsky opening.  A wing eccentricity that looks a little ridiculous, though it has more than a bit of poison for the unsuspecting (it's much more sound than say, the Grob).  If black plays passively white can eventually transpose into the family of more conventional d4/c4 openings with more queenside space."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/1P6/8/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"1. b4 e5 2. Bb2 Bxb4 3. Bxe5 is the ""main line,"" such as it is, in this opening, and one any Sokolsky specialist can expect to be very comfortable in."
3,Bb2,c1b2,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/1P6/8/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"My favored recipe against the Sokolsky.  The queen is well posted here, as it both hits b4 and supports a e5 push."

5,a3,a2a3,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/3q4/3p4/1P6/P7/1BPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"3. b5?! runs into Qb4.  One sample line: 4. Be5 Qxb5 5. Bxc7 Qc5 6. Bg3 (or 6. Bxb8, ceding the bishop pair for...not a lot) Nc6, preparing ...e5 and black is already a little better."
6,e5,e7e5,rnb1kbnr/ppp2ppp/3q4/3pp3/1P6/P7/1BPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Full classical center achieved.
7,e3,e2e3,rnb1kbnr/ppp2ppp/3q4/3pp3/1P6/P3P3/1BPP1PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"4. ...Nf6 is slightly more accurate, if only because white can now transpose to a more ""proper"" opening scheme with the Bird via 5. f4, if that's to white's taste."
8,Be7,f8e7,rnb1k1nr/ppp1bppp/3q4/3pp3/1P6/P3P3/1BPP1PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"4. ...Nf6 is slightly more accurate, if only because white can now transpose to a more ""proper"" opening scheme with the Bird via 5. f4, if that's to white's taste."
9,c4,c2c4,rnb1k1nr/ppp1bppp/3q4/3pp3/1PP5/P3P3/1B1P1PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,I prefer maintaining my center vs. advancing with ...d4 and then spending the middlegame defending this advanced target.  5. ...c6 also provides my queen luft on c7 in the event of a white push with c5.

It covers g5 from invasion, however my knight would have been more likely to jump to f5, if anything.  Additionally I think this pawn bunt sets up h3 as a rather obvious target in the future."

I felt very content with my position, and I think black, with a strong center and more space, is easier to play and find harmonious plans."

Depending on black's plan, a ...f4, ...d4, or even ...g5 push could all be justified with some prep, though I am more partial to ...f4."
