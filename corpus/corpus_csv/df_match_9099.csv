I've seen a couple of games  with white winning by using this system and heard it is a universal system for white.  I also seen a couple of games with black winning.  The setup I use, I'm black, is what Gregory Serper used to beat a young kid Michael Lee in Wa state Championship.  However, I did not play Nh5 and Instead playing Nd7 incorrectly playing the system.  Kasparov also played this line as black a couple of times"
