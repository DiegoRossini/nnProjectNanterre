1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I was lucky enough to have white again. This game is an excellent partner to the previous game. In that, I gave up bishop for knight to gain and pawn, and then I prevented him from play the freeing c6-c5 and kept the position closed, so that my knight was far better than his bishop. This game is the reverse. He gives up bishop for knight, and the open position favours my bishop over his knight."
