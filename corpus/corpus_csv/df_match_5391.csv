1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This is probably the most aggressive and risky game I have played for a long time. It happened in my Halibut gambit tournament.
2,b5,b7b5,rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/8/1p6/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Starting position
3,cxb5,c4b5,rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/8/1P6/8/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,This is surely a mistake.
4,a6,a7a6,rnbqkbnr/2pppppp/p7/1P6/8/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,This is surely a mistake.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/2pppppp/p7/1P6/8/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,This is surely a mistake.
6,axb5,a6b5,rnbqkbnr/2pppppp/8/1p6/8/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,This is surely a mistake.
7,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/2pppppp/8/1p6/4P3/2N5/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,This is surely a mistake.
8,b4,b5b4,rnbqkbnr/2pppppp/8/8/1p2P3/2N5/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,I think I would have been tempted by e6.
9,Nd5,c3d5,rnbqkbnr/2pppppp/8/3N4/1p2P3/8/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 5,I think I would have been tempted by e6.

11,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/3ppppp/8/2pN4/1p1PP3/8/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,It was around this point that I decided to go for it. I think having such an advanced position for my knight went to my head and I thought I could see all sorts of possibilities.

13,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkbnr/3p1ppp/4p3/2pN2B1/1p1PP3/8/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 1 7,Obviously if the queen takes the bishop I can fork King and rook with my knight and may get to develop my remaining knight with tempo to f3
14,f6,f7f6,rnbqkbnr/3p2pp/4pp2/2pN2B1/1p1PP3/8/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 8,Against a player ranked so much higher than me this is a high risk gambit.
15,Nxf6+,d5f6,rnbqkbnr/3p2pp/4pN2/2p3B1/1p1PP3/8/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 8,Against a player ranked so much higher than me this is a high risk gambit.
16,Nxf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/3p2pp/4pn2/2p3B1/1p1PP3/8/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 9,I was hoping for (though not expecting) gxf6 as I then have Qh5+

19,exf6,e5f6,rnbqkb1r/3p2p1/4pP1p/2p3B1/1p1P4/8/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 10,I didn't want to retreat the bishop as g5 might follow if I did and that would give black advanced pawns on the kings side where I was looking to castle in future

22,Kxf7,e8f7,rnbq1b1r/3p1kp1/4p3/2p3p1/1p1P4/8/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR w KQ - 0 12,Black can't afford to leave one of my pawns so far advanced so has little choice
23,Qf3+,d1f3,rnbq1b1r/3p1kp1/4p3/2p3p1/1p1P4/5Q2/PP3PPP/R3KBNR b KQ - 1 12,Suddenly I am ahead on material with the chance of more. Black can no longer castle and  and I need to work out how to take advantage of the position
24,Qf6,d8f6,rnb2b1r/3p1kp1/4pq2/2p3p1/1p1P4/5Q2/PP3PPP/R3KBNR w KQ - 2 13,Suddenly I am ahead on material with the chance of more. Black can no longer castle and  and I need to work out how to take advantage of the position

27,Rd1,a1d1,Qnb2b1r/3p1kp1/4p3/2p3p1/1p1q4/8/PP3PPP/3RKBNR b K - 1 14,"I'm still not sure that the simple Qxb8 wouldn't have been better here, in the end I decided to keep trying to pressure black. I figured that he would be tempted with Qxb2 partly to equalise on material but also because it means that his c and b pawns look a lot more threatening then."
28,Qxb2,d4b2,Qnb2b1r/3p1kp1/4p3/2p3p1/1p6/8/Pq3PPP/3RKBNR w K - 0 15,Looking to develop here but again the simple Qxb8 or Nf3 may have been better. I wanted to preserve my a pawn as I may need it to keep the black pawns back a little.
