1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I am playing this game with the delightful Zhanna. I am over 1000 grading points above her. I delibrately let her have my queen early on, to give her a chance. Unfortunately little by little she lets me get back into the game."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,So we start conventionally.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,This is good development.
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,I copy her.
5,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"This is a good developing move too, although c2-c4 is more usual."
6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,I continue to copy.
7,Bb5+,f1b5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/1B1p4/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"This is not a good move. After the correct reply from black, c7-c6 white has to move the bishop again."
8,Qd7,d8d7,rnb1kb1r/pppq1ppp/4pn2/1B1p4/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,So I offer the queen.
9,Bxd7+,b5d7,rnb1kb1r/pppB1ppp/4pn2/3p4/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,She takes it.
10,Bxd7,c8d7,rn2kb1r/pppb1ppp/4pn2/3p4/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,I take back.
11,b3,b2b3,rn2kb1r/pppb1ppp/4pn2/3p4/3P4/1P2PN2/P1P2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,And she develops.
12,Bd6,f8d6,rn2k2r/pppb1ppp/3bpn2/3p4/3P4/1P2PN2/P1P2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 7,So do I.
13,Nbd2,b1d2,rn2k2r/pppb1ppp/3bpn2/3p4/3P4/1P2PN2/P1PN1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 7,This is not a bad square for the knight.
14,O-O,e8g8,rn3rk1/pppb1ppp/3bpn2/3p4/3P4/1P2PN2/P1PN1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 3 8,I castle.
15,c3,c2c3,rn3rk1/pppb1ppp/3bpn2/3p4/3P4/1PP1PN2/P2N1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 8,This move doesn't fit in well with 6. b3. Better was Bb2.
16,Bb5,d7b5,rn3rk1/ppp2ppp/3bpn2/1b1p4/3P4/1PP1PN2/P2N1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 1 9,I stop her from castling 0-0 as my bishop attacks f8.
17,a4,a2a4,rn3rk1/ppp2ppp/3bpn2/1b1p4/P2P4/1PP1PN2/3N1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 9,So she hits my bishop.
18,Ba6,b5a6,rn3rk1/ppp2ppp/b2bpn2/3p4/P2P4/1PP1PN2/3N1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 1 10,So I drop back.
19,Nh4,f3h4,rn3rk1/ppp2ppp/b2bpn2/3p4/P2P3N/1PP1P3/3N1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 2 10,"This move doesn't achieve much. I think it would be better to continue with the plan of attacking my Ba6, with b3-b4 with the threat of b4-b5 winning my bishop and if, say c7-c6 then Qd1-b3 renewing the threat of b4-b5. If I then play Bd3, she has c3-c4."
20,Nbd7,b8d7,r4rk1/pppn1ppp/b2bpn2/3p4/P2P3N/1PP1P3/3N1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 3 11,I continue to develop.
