1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Hi everyone - I have had some fascination for the Ponziani opening ever since a 1200  player played it against me in my previous annotated game A Ponziani Opening.  My opponent gave me the opportunity to transpose into it - things did not work out though.
2,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,3. c3 - this move is characteristic of the Ponziani Opening.
3,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 2,3. c3 - this move is characteristic of the Ponziani Opening.
4,e5,e7e5,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,3. c3 - this move is characteristic of the Ponziani Opening.
5,c3,c2c3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,3. c3 - this move is characteristic of the Ponziani Opening.
6,d5,d7d5,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/3pp3/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,5. d3 - fairly main-linesh!
7,Qa4,d1a4,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n5/3pp3/Q3P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 1 4,5. d3 - fairly main-linesh!
8,f6,f7f6,r1bqkbnr/ppp3pp/2n2p2/3pp3/Q3P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 5,5. d3 - fairly main-linesh!
9,d3,d2d3,r1bqkbnr/ppp3pp/2n2p2/3pp3/Q3P3/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 5,5. d3 - fairly main-linesh!
10,Be6,c8e6,r2qkbnr/ppp3pp/2n1bp2/3pp3/Q3P3/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 1 6,8. b4? - this pawn push was made in one of the illustrative games from the database - it strikes out at the flank and allows Frere Lenoir to come out on b7 or a6.  In hindsight though I should have castled first.  It will be a long time before I have the opportunity to castle short and by then it was all too late!
11,Nbd2,b1d2,r2qkbnr/ppp3pp/2n1bp2/3pp3/Q3P3/2PP1N2/PP1N1PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 2 6,8. b4? - this pawn push was made in one of the illustrative games from the database - it strikes out at the flank and allows Frere Lenoir to come out on b7 or a6.  In hindsight though I should have castled first.  It will be a long time before I have the opportunity to castle short and by then it was all too late!

14,Ng6,e7g6,r2qkb1r/ppp3pp/2n1bpn1/3pp3/Q3P3/2PP1N2/PP1NBPPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 5 8,8. b4? - this pawn push was made in one of the illustrative games from the database - it strikes out at the flank and allows Frere Lenoir to come out on b7 or a6.

15,b4,b2b4,r2qkb1r/ppp3pp/2n1bpn1/3pp3/QP2P3/2PP1N2/P2NBPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 0 8,8. b4? - this pawn push was made in one of the illustrative games from the database - it strikes out at the flank and allows Frere Lenoir to come out on b7 or a6.

16,Nf4,g6f4,r2qkb1r/ppp3pp/2n1bp2/3pp3/QP2Pn2/2PP1N2/P2NBPPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 1 9,"8. ......... Nf4 - nasty, nasty, attacks g pawn and prevents castling short because my bishop will be en prise - if I play g2 then black may move his bishop to h3.  If I then exchange bishops my castled position will be very weak should I choose to put Henry on g1.  Reluctantly I put my development into reverse gear and perhaps play Bb2 next move to prepare for long castling - but ....."
