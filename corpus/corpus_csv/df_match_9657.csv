The Pirc is not a Queen side counter attacking system like the Sicilian, but still it is a counter attacking system. The Pirc is good for beginners. What ever white plays, black can play d6; Nf6; g6; Bg7; 0-0 setting up a Indian defense. In this game black has to play to an exception"

The chessgames.com database calls this the Lion's Jaw hence the name of my title. Black can play into it and continue playing g6; Bg7; 0-0 transposing into a King's Indian defense if white plays c4; nc3; Be3. But I, knowing theory, do not play into it!"
