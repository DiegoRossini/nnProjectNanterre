1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,English opening.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Symmetrical. What uncomfortable players play. So do I...
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Referred to as hedgehog system.
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"This is off the main line.
We classically see 3. d4 cxd4.
My opponent maybe tries to open ways for the c Bishop aiming at my c pawn.
But watch out! The diagonal is open to the a Rook as well. Keep this in mind."
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"This is off the main line.

My opponent maybe tries to open ways for the c Bishop aiming at my c pawn.
But watch out! The diagonal is open to the a Rook as well. Keep this in mind."

7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/p3pppp/1p1p4/2p5/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"Simply developing without any weird idea, I promise."
8,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/p4ppp/1p1pp3/2p5/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,Opening ways for the Queen now?
9,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/p4ppp/1p1pp3/2p5/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,Putting pressure on d4 while preparing for castling.
10,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/p4ppp/1p1ppn2/2p5/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,"Preparing for castling too, but no pressure of any kind."
11,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqkb1r/p4ppp/1p1ppn2/2p5/2PP4/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 6,A gentle move? Not exactly. The Bishop is already in position to aim at the King side.
12,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/p3bppp/1p1ppn2/2p5/2PP4/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 3 7,Still trying to castle King-side.

14,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/p3bppp/1p1ppn2/2p5/2PP4/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 5 8,So was this.
15,e4,e3e4,rnbq1rk1/p3bppp/1p1ppn2/2p5/2PPP3/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 8,Pushing pawn because it's time for the battle.
16,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bq1rk1/p2nbppp/1p1ppn2/2p5/2PPP3/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 9,"This was a bit puzzling, I confess.
Probably 8. ... Nc6 would have been a better move, putting pressure on the center."
17,e5,e4e5,r1bq1rk1/p2nbppp/1p1ppn2/2p1P3/2PP4/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 9,Still pushing pawn and going to exchange.

Please note there's no advantage in pieces."
19,dxe5,d4e5,r1bq1rk1/p2nbppp/1p2pn2/2p1P3/2P5/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 10,"Now I have advantage in the center.

A classical response would be ... h3. But this was not in my mind."
21,Qe2,d1e2,r1bq1rk1/p2nbppp/1p2p3/2p1P3/2P3n1/2NB1N2/PP2QPPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 2 11,"I move my Queen because I want to take control of the e column.
Of course Qe4 is now so tempting for the next move..."
22,f6,f7f6,r1bq1rk1/p2nb1pp/1p2pp2/2p1P3/2P3n1/2NB1N2/PP2QPPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 0 12,"A poor move.
I figure out my opponent was avoiding a move of my f Knight."
23,Qe4,e2e4,r1bq1rk1/p2nb1pp/1p2pp2/2p1P3/2P1Q1n1/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 1 12,"Turning on the fast forward now.
Remember the freed diagonal after 3. â€¦ b6? Payback time!
At this point, what do you see at first? I'd say, there's the evidence: a fork on Rook and Knight.
What can he do? Moving the Rook - the Knight is dead. Moving the Knight - the Rook is dead. As you will see, he will choose to make some mess in my defence with his Knight while losing his Rook, and win a tempo to move his Knight back.
But... there's something else. My Queen and d Knight are now aligned. This means that I will no longer consider taking pieces and preferably will rely on my position advantage."
