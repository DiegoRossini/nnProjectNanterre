1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,2. ........ Nf6 - this is the Petrov's defense.  Some say it does have a high percentage of draws but for the unwary like myself it does not always work out that way.  The purpose of the Petrov is to counterattack my e pawn.  I decide to defend it by playing 3. Nc3 - this is called the Petrov's 3 knights - but how sound is it?
