22,Qe7,d8e7,r4rk1/pppnqppp/2b1pn2/8/2QP4/P1P1PN2/4BPPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 5 12,"the idea was double: or you change, and I reconstruct my pawns line (which happened), or you go away and lose a tempo."
23,Qb4,c4b4,r4rk1/pppnqppp/2b1pn2/8/1Q1P4/P1P1PN2/4BPPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 6 12,"the idea was double: or you change, and I reconstruct my pawns line (which happened), or you go away and lose a tempo."

25,axb4,a3b4,r4rk1/pppn1ppp/2b1pn2/8/1P1P4/2P1PN2/4BPPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 0 13,seems obvious... though this will lead to gain.

30,Ne4,f6e4,r3r1k1/1ppn1ppp/p1b1p3/R7/1P1Pn3/2P1PN2/1B2BPPP/5RK1 w - - 4 16,"this move, though apparently placing a good knight, has no perspective: c3 and d2 are protected."

33,c4,c3c4,r3r1k1/1pp2ppp/pnb1p3/R7/1PPPn3/4PN2/1B2BPPP/R5K1 b - - 0 17,"well, then, we are going to get more soldiers.. on b5?"
34,h6,h7h6,r3r1k1/1pp2pp1/pnb1p2p/R7/1PPPn3/4PN2/1B2BPPP/R5K1 w - - 0 18,NO! we eliminate a defensor.

38,Bd7,c6d7,r3r1k1/1ppb1pp1/p3p2p/RPPn4/3Pn3/4PN2/1B2BPPP/R5K1 w - - 1 20,"so, just potentially loses a pawn."

As black moves' Nd2 is without consequence, we can liberate our f3-defender and make him attack the bishop"
