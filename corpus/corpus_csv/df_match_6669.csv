It's necessary push away the c5 bishop with b4 and start an attack on queenside to be ready in every side; i think with the right plan the white is a little better

- 2 good bishop versus the castle
- a new problem, the G-column (a pawn it's now enough...)
- some time will be lost to save the queen from rook attack

it's a strange move for a good player...in general computers make this kind of wrong"
