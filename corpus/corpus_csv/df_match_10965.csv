1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The English opening is very flexible and often transposes into other openings.  It was named for the unofficial English world champion, Howard Staunton, who played it during a match in 1843."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"1...e5 often leads to a transposed Sicilean defense, in which white has an extra tempo."
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,Prepares for a d pawn push to d4.

Edit:  sicilian_monster pointed out that g3 followed by Bg2 is strong because of the fianchettoed bishop, especially since black has already played c5, weakening his queenside.  He further commented that it should be met by d5 because of the advanced e pawn and weak d3 square."
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/2p1p3/2P5/2N1P1P1/PP1P1P1P/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,The fianchettoed bishop puts a lot of pressure on black's queenside and controls the critical central squares e4 and d5.
9,Bg2,f1g2,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/2p1p3/2P5/2N1P1P1/PP1P1PBP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 2 5,The fianchettoed bishop puts a lot of pressure on black's queenside and controls the critical central squares e4 and d5.

The knight supports a d4 push if White were interested in clearing the center and opening the game."

Black is forced to defend it with pieces rather than pawns.  I played this move thinking to prevent Nd5, but realized a move later that it encourages white to occupy it since Nxd5, cxd5 forks black's knight and bishop.  

Bf5 is better."

18,Rb8,a8b8,1r1q1rk1/pp2bppp/2npbn2/2pNp3/2P5/1P2P1PP/P2PNPB1/R1BQK2R w KQ - 3 10,"I had originally planned to play Qd7 further pressuring h3 and preventing white from castling.  After Nd5, I decided against it but believe it would have been the better move since it would have protected both b7 and c6.

Rb8 supports the b pawn, which I had planned to advance, and removed the rook from the long diagonal."

The push I was thinking of, overlooking the fact that my c6 knight is unprotected and that Nxf6  forces a reply."

This opens the b file and prevents Bb2 without preparation."

This was played to prevent castling.  I hold the a6-f1 diagonal for most of the midgame, imprisoning white's rook in the corner."
