1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game started out very closed were white had the bishop pair but could not profit from it due to the mentioned closed structure, while allowing white the bishop pair, I still inflicted a long lasting structural damage on his queen side pawn structure. White temporarily blocked the king side and I opened up the queen side for some serious counter-play and was able to force the exchange of pieces wining one pawn, latter on white blundered positionally and allowed me to get the upper hand and exert some pressure on his king until he finally cracked.
Worth mention the queen maneuver that won a pawn:
Qa8- to c6 (attacking a pawn) then from c6 to e8 and finally to h5 were it helped to win the f5 pawn"
