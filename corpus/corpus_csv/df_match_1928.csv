1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The title is there for a reason; after a dubious opening from White, a queen exchange leaves Black in a far better position, and eventually a rook up after some careless moves on White's behalf. Whilst most would have given up, White graciously fought back his material and remained a pawn down to the very end until Black himself made two costly careless errors at the end that cost him the win; White escapes with an entertaining draw."
