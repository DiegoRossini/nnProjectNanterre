5,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3Pp3/5P2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,A more common third move for Black is e4

7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3P4/5p2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,I would either bring out Nf6 or Qxd5 to bring more immediate pressure.
8,Bc5,f8c5,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/2bP4/5p2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,I would either bring out Nf6 or Qxd5 to bring more immediate pressure.
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/2bP4/5p2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 5,development and protection
10,Ne7,g8e7,rnbqk2r/ppp1nppp/8/2bP4/5p2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 4 6,clearing the way for castling and more immediate support for a potential Bb5+.  It also leaves an option of Ng6 to protect the f4 pawn if desired.  I think this was Black's top play.
11,d4,d2d4,rnbqk2r/ppp1nppp/8/2bP4/3P1p2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,clearing room for DSB to come and play and threatening f4 pawn simultaneously.
12,Bb4,c5b4,rnbqk2r/ppp1nppp/8/3P4/1b1P1p2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,Moving bishop from danger and applying pin pressure on knight.  Another option worth considering is Bd6.

14,c6,c7c6,rnbqk2r/pp2nppp/2p5/1B1P4/1b1P1p2/2N2N2/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"This move is a mistake on my part.  The idea was cxb5, Qxb5+ to win the DSB on b4, but either knight defends against that play and I lose a bishop for a pawn.  Luckily for me, Black missed it."

24,Nd5,e7d5,rn1qr1k1/p4ppp/2p5/3n4/1bBP1pb1/2N2N2/PPPBQ1PP/2KR3R w - - 8 13,"I like the idea of the pin for extra pressure.  Another path to consider is Nf5.  While it doesn't have all of the immediate double attack options, it's a projection of power I can't easily dislodge, which will cause trouble long term."
