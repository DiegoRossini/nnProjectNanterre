1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Time control was two hours each, though I started half an hour down on the clock due to flooding here.   Interestingly, when I arrived, my board (5) was already being played on!   So was 6 - I (as captain) had sent the team through while en route, but the early players missed this and played to the team as it had been the day before!   In the meantime, one game had been postponed and board order had changed.   I couldn't play on 7 due to ratings gaps, so a quick rejig saw board 6 - ten moves in - re-designated as board 7, while their board 7 was bumped up to 6 to play me with colours reversed.   The fun of being a captain!"
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The Sicilian.   I've put the game into Fritz as I've posted it here, so its thoughts are noted as we go.   But of course Fritz can't really take the time to explain its rationale, particularly in positional positions - which is where I'm hoping the gameknot community can come in!"

5,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pP4/8/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"After a couple of standard book moves, this is an inaccuracy I think.   Nf6 or Nc6 are the main moves.   Fritz doesn't like 4. ... e6 - but of course the question is what to do about it."

11,cxd4,c3d4,rnb1kbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/3q4/3P4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"So for the next while, the d-pawn is free to advance.   But for the next few moves, I try to set up the standard IQP threats - a bishop to c4, a knight to e5, rooks into the centre, the queen to d3.   It seems a bit early yet for an attack given I'm hardly developed."

15,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/8/2BP4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 4 8,"So I start with this, easing the threat of Nd5, blockading the pawn."
16,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/8/2BP4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 5 9,"Seems logical.   I need to keep a future Na5 in mind if it means taking my LSB off the a2-g8 diagonal.   For now, it's not a threat though."
17,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/8/2BP4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 6 9,"After 9. d5, black swaps off lots - 9. d5 ed 10. NxP NxN 11. BxN - and the position looks quite dull.   So - more pieces into the game."

NxP NxN 15. BxN, I didn't see what I had.   But Fritz says black has nothing better then than 15. ... Be6, allowing 16. BxN PxB, when black has some pawn weaknesses.   I would have thought the d5 push should achieve more than this though?"

But again Fritz calls for 16. d5 - yet as it plays through the analysis, it becomes less enamoured with the move.   So is it time for the move yet?   There don't seem to be any material-winning tactics as yet."
