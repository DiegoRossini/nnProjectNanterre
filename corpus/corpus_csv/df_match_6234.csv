14,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1nppn2/6B1/3NPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,this opens a nice possibility for white. Nc6 has to be very cautious with black

22,Nd5,f6d5,r1b1kb1r/5ppp/p1p1p3/3nP1B1/8/2N5/PPP3PP/3RKB1R w Kkq - 1 12,this is the punishment... Where?

32,Kg7,f8g7,r1b4r/4npkp/p1pNp1p1/4P3/8/3B4/PPP3PP/3R1RK1 w - - 2 17,the vague solution here was more in Nf5 followed by enventual Nh6 or a good exchange with one of the minor pieces... this becomes now a tragedy.
