1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"This is a White open. It is not e4 or d4. 
It is time to take advantage of this open as it is NOT what I would ever do. Check my records."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 2,Mirroring an unusual open is okay for me like the English (aka Bird's Eye or Reverse Sicilian) I could have done something else as I have done against this nf3 (current game) against blitzkov.  I am just doing what I do to digest the game into a classical formation. Today a lot of people think by doing a move 2nd to e4 or d4 is some sort of shock operation.  I just look ahead and make it a classical game.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,A sort of Bird's Eye or English or Reverse Sicilian move.  I am thinking to treat this as a Bird's Eye that develops after n3 open.
4,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,An English Open can always be successfully mirrored. And so I do it.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2p5/2P5/2N2N2/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,It appears White is definitely doing a Reverse Sicilian here. I will do the same.
6,b6,b7b6,rnbqkb1r/p2ppppp/1p3n2/2p5/2P5/2N2N2/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,White's King Bishop is yet to develop.  White MUST evacuate the King's 0-0 box at this point. I have no threat anymore from White at this point. I am going to attack using Sicilian....
7,e4,e2e4,rnbqkb1r/p2ppppp/1p3n2/2p5/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,Expected and anticipated.
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/p2ppppp/1pn2n2/2p5/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,My Sicilian in operation. In Sicilian the Queen knight has to go there.
9,d4,d2d4,r1bqkb1r/p2ppppp/1pn2n2/2p5/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,I respect this move. White is advancing his IN (Infantry LIGHT) in a Battalion IN (LIGHT) Commander's orders!
10,cxd4,c5d4,r1bqkb1r/p2ppppp/1pn2n2/8/2PpP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,Have to protect the knight if it remains. Have to have a bishop diagonal in case I deploy the knight....or just exchange....with development.
11,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkb1r/p2ppppp/1pn2n2/8/2PNP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,Have to protect the knight if it remains. Have to have a bishop diagonal in case I deploy the knight....or just exchange....with development.
12,Bb7,c8b7,r2qkb1r/pb1ppppp/1pn2n2/8/2PNP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,Have to protect the knight if it remains. Have to have a bishop diagonal in case I deploy the knight....or just exchange....with development.
13,Be2,f1e2,r2qkb1r/pb1ppppp/1pn2n2/8/2PNP3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 7,Time to exchange the Queen's knight. And sucker the opposition's Queen toward the center of the board where she becomes vulnerable with what I can do!
14,Nxd4,c6d4,r2qkb1r/pb1ppppp/1p3n2/8/2PnP3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,Time to exchange the Queen's knight. And sucker the opposition's Queen toward the center of the board where she becomes vulnerable with what I can do!
15,Qxd4,d1d4,r2qkb1r/pb1ppppp/1p3n2/8/2PQP3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 0 8,"This is a safe move for me on defense.  It reverts to my favorite Sicilian: The Shev!  I know by setting this pawn from e7 to e6 I am containing my ""Mirror or Reverse"" Sicilian to White.  Now I can further move into the Shev to make the center of the board askew from White Attack."
16,e6,e7e6,r2qkb1r/pb1p1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2PQP3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 0 9,"This is a safe move for me on defense.  It reverts to my favorite Sicilian: The Shev!  I know by setting this pawn from e7 to e6 I am containing my ""Mirror or Reverse"" Sicilian to White.  Now I can further move into the Shev to make the center of the board askew from White Attack."
17,O-O,e1g1,r2qkb1r/pb1p1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2PQP3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 1 9,"But of course White Castles! 
I have yet to castle as Black! 
White seems to know something is a bit askance on the field here....."
18,Bc5,f8c5,r2qk2r/pb1p1ppp/1p2pn2/2b5/2PQP3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 2 10,Attacking the Queen....
19,Qd3,d4d3,r2qk2r/pb1p1ppp/1p2pn2/2b5/2P1P3/2NQ4/PP2BPPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 3 10,Developing my Queen.  One move in the right direction develops the most powerful piece on the board.
20,Qc7,d8c7,r3k2r/pbqp1ppp/1p2pn2/2b5/2P1P3/2NQ4/PP2BPPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 4 11,Developing my Queen.  One move in the right direction develops the most powerful piece on the board.
21,Bf3,e2f3,r3k2r/pbqp1ppp/1p2pn2/2b5/2P1P3/2NQ1B2/PP3PPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 5 11,White is worried about the bishop I have on b2 and makes an adjustment.
22,h5,h7h5,r3k2r/pbqp1pp1/1p2pn2/2b4p/2P1P3/2NQ1B2/PP3PPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 0 12,Nothing wrong with advancing the LIGHT INFANTRY!
23,g3,g2g3,r3k2r/pbqp1pp1/1p2pn2/2b4p/2P1P3/2NQ1BP1/PP3P1P/R1B2RK1 b kq - 0 12,White does a sort of delayed fianchetto action here to either hide his bishop or advance pawns. In the former case it is okay in the latter the pawn has opened the King's Box and therefore subject easily from forward or diagonal attack. The fianchetto is only useful in the King's Indian Defense against d4:  In my time at the very least.
24,h4,h5h4,r3k2r/pbqp1pp1/1p2pn2/2b5/2P1P2p/2NQ1BP1/PP3P1P/R1B2RK1 w kq - 0 13,Time to take apart the fianchetto position without the bishop actually in front of the King...
25,Bf4,c1f4,r3k2r/pbqp1pp1/1p2pn2/2b5/2P1PB1p/2NQ1BP1/PP3P1P/R4RK1 b kq - 1 13,Attacking my Queen. But my Shev Sicilian Pawn (LIGHT INFANTRY) shall push him OUT!
