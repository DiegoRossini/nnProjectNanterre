1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I played this move knowing that my opponent was going to play the Sicilian! I know this because ""goldaxe2006"" is one of my friends in real life...not just on gameknot. The bad thing is...he knows 25 moves of Theory for the Dragon..."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,As I expected...
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,I chose to play Nf3(fully knowing that I could go into some highly theoretical lines where he is the favourite)
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"d6 can lead into many lines such as the Scheveningen,Acc Drag,Dragon,Najdorf(etc)."
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,I was prepared to play the Open Sicilian.
6,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,He takes...obviously.
7,Nxd4,f3d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,Nxd4!? I was willing to let him play his pet line because I had a novelty in store for him...
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,Alas! Dragon it is!
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,"Nc3 is White's best choice here...the alternative Bd3?! doesn't command as much space as Nc3. This relates back to the general Opening Rule: ""Knights before Bishops""."
10,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p1np1/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"with g6, Black aims to fianchetto his Bishop and then to castle king-side; setting up the main line of the Sicilian Dragon"
11,Be3,c1e3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p1np1/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,Be3 is the most logical and theoretical move here.
12,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 7,Black Fianchetto's his Bishop very logically.
13,f3,f2f3,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"f3! A very common move in the Sicilian Dragon. f3 supports the e pawn which can come under massive threats in the next couple of moves, it also allows White the option of playing g4!? after he has developed his Queen to d2 and castled Queen-Side. The variation where g4!? is played is known as the ""Yugoslav Attack"" and I believe it is very effective for White."
14,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk2r/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,Nc6 is theoretical once again on Black's part.
15,Qd2,d1d2,r1bqk2r/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 2 8,"Qd2, My aims are clear, To prepare a huge king-side attack, with moves such as g4,h4 and Be2."
16,Bd7,c8d7,r2qk2r/pp1bppbp/2np1np1/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 3 9,"In the Sicilian Dragon, White aims to attack on the King-Side whereas Black will always try to attack on the Queen-Side - This can lead to some very entertaining play and lots of games end in a quick finish. Bd7 portrays Black's ideas of attacking on the Queen-Side as it allows moves such as Rac8(etc)."
17,O-O-O,e1c1,r2qk2r/pp1bppbp/2np1np1/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR1B1R b kq - 4 9,"White brings his A rook into the game by castling Queen-Side, now White will try to attack on the King-Side."
18,Rc8,a8c8,2rqk2r/pp1bppbp/2np1np1/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR1B1R w k - 5 10,"Rc8...The most theoreticalk move here, note that Black has chosen to not castle here as he is aware of my knowledge and understanding in the Yugoslav Attack Line."
19,g4,g2g4,2rqk2r/pp1bppbp/2np1np1/8/3NP1P1/2N1BP2/PPPQ3P/2KR1B1R b k - 0 10,g4! I have been preparing this for several moves...You can see how White has a commanding lead on the King-Side!!
20,Ne5,c6e5,2rqk2r/pp1bppbp/3p1np1/4n3/3NP1P1/2N1BP2/PPPQ3P/2KR1B1R w k - 1 11,"This is a very common move, which threatens many different ideas such as Nc4 for instance?"
