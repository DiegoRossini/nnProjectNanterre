1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

This is my last game in the Traxler MT.  It ended on a fairly high note with a High Draw against Paolo, but, alas, wrapped up in gaining material parity with him, I missed a chance to get a five point lead in material against him which would have been enough to win despite our rating differential.  The moral here is, always look for a better move and try not to get too wrapped up in your plan, otherwise you will end up with a missed opportunity.  Gameknot analysis is provided as follows and I will pick up commentary on Move 7.  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15146349&fb=1&rnd=0.6709744076164328"
