Doubling Blacks pawns on f6 (6.Bxf6) was a threat since recapturing with the Q loses the d5 pawn i.e. 6.Bxf6 Qxf6  7.cxd exd  8.Nxd5! but, it is too early to know if the Bg5 will be missed.

Playing in the Center with 7.e4 or 7.dxc will leave me with better control of the Center but, it will just open up the position for his 2B which I feel, I did not want to allow. My plan at this point is to close up with ...c5 and follow up with an eventual b2-b4-b5 & a2-a4."

It's hard to prove but, I just wouldnt feel comfortable giving up e5 & g5 to Whites Knights.

Black made the mistake of losing control of e5 with 9 ...f5 but, this is a strategic game, nobody is going anywhere. The e5 square isnt going anywhere. I did not want to put my Knight on e5, start some attack on the Queenside only to have to pause to castle because Black played a well-timed ...Rg8!! attacking my undefended g pawn. Castling first does allow Black to cover up the e5 square with 10 ...f6 but, my previous note explains why that would just make things worse for his 2B."

Even at the cost of a pawn with 10 ...e5?! 11.Nxe5 (11.dxe Bxc5 12.Nxd5 Be6 13.Nc3 Bd6 and despite being a pawn dow, I feel the the 2B and the open g file give Black the better game) 11 ...Nxe5  12.dxe c6! followed up with 13 ...f6 opens up the position for Blacks Bishops."

I was afraid that giving Black another open file on the kingside would help him find counterplay on that side of the board later when I have all my pieces committed on the Queenside. To me, that was not worth the pawn. I would rather just slowly squeeze the position rather than win a pawn and possibly allow some counterplay."

THEN 13 ...a4! & White would never accomplish the b4 push).
