He proved that the concept of universallism: in essence, this means being strong and having the ability to connect positional and tactical play was needed to be most successful in this game. Being such an active player, he preferred active, not passive moves."

Even in his day, this move at first look makes little sense at first glance. I mean, choosing to push a pawn instead of continuing to develop the bishops? Seems like an amateur mistake to me. But never underestimate the mind of a genius such as Fischer. Think smarter, not harder. What could Fischer possibly be planning?"

He is saying if you are going to delay your development and gain space, then I will just play fast and exploit it.

Why am I mentioning 2 obvious things here and now? Well, let's look and see: black started advancing and attacking, but overlooked a very important detail: the follow-up! It's a mistake you often see in games at the 2000+ level, where positional chess becomes more of a deciding factor in games. But now you see why this attack failed."
