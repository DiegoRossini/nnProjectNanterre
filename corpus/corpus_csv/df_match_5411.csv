1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Standard Stuff
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,Standard Stuff
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Still nothing unusual
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Still nothing unusual
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,I play the Grunfeld.
6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,I play the Grunfeld.
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3p4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,4. Nf3 is less common than cxd5 but perfectly playable. One can transpose into the other.
8,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3p4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,4. Nf3 is less common than cxd5 but perfectly playable. One can transpose into the other.
9,Bf4,c1f4,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3p4/2PP1B2/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 3 5,"I knew White had a little combination here to win a pawn, but Black gets counterplay."
10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3p4/2PP1B2/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 4 6,"I knew White had a little combination here to win a pawn, but Black gets counterplay."

12,Nxd5,f6d5,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/6p1/3n4/3P1B2/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 7,So White plays it. Note that White cannot transpose into the main line of the Grunfeld Exchange variation with 7. e4?? because of NxBf4. I have had an opponent play that a drop a Bishop!
13,Nxd5,c3d5,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/6p1/3N4/3P1B2/5N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 7,White continues with his plan
14,Qxd5,d8d5,rnb2rk1/ppp1ppbp/6p1/3q4/3P1B2/5N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 8,White continues with his plan
15,Bxc7,f4c7,rnb2rk1/ppB1ppbp/6p1/3q4/3P4/5N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 8,"I am actually far more familiar with this gambit when White has played e3 rather than Nf3. 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. Bf4 Bg7 5. e3 O-O 6. cxd5 Nxd5 7. Nxd5 Qxd5 8. Bxc7 
Then Black can regain the pawn with Na6 9. Bxa6 Qxg2 10. Qf3 Qxf3 11. Nxf3 bxa6 
I was thinking for myself now! Looking at the Databases afterwards, I see that 8. Bg4 is not best in this position, either Nc6 or Na6 seems better."

This move is not on the database, Nc6 is the only move which is. After the game I compared my moves with the computer recommendation. Computer does like Na6 and assesses the position as equal."
