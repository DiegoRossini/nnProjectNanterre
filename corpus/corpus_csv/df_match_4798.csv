7,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1p1p/2n3p1/4p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,I move bishop to c4 after I notice black's weakness in the middle so I eye down f7 with lsb.

9,d4,d2d4,r1bqkb1r/pppp1p1p/2n2np1/4p3/2BPP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,I know that I am leaving e4 pawn vulnerable with this move but my plan is to move knight or bishop to g5 which is bad because then if ne4 then the knight will be defending g5. which is what will happen
