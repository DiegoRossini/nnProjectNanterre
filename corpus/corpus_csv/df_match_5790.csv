5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 3,Bc4?!  d4 is better.
6,Be6,c8e6,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3pb3/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 4,Be6? Putting it to my king bishop right away in a very risky manner.
7,Bxe6,c4e6,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3pB3/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,"I considered Bb3 but giving him this weakness without compensation or development this early can't be passed up. An immediate king-side attack is necessary now.
In Bernstein vs Tartakover,1937, Black had a similar idea but developed his pieces a bit more and planned it out: e4...e5,Nf3...d6,d4...Nf6,PxP...NxP,Bc4...Be6,BxB...PxB,Qe2...d4,Qb5?...Nc6!,Nd4...Qd7, QxNP?...Bb4+!
It's all over in a few more moves with a double rook sacrifice by Black and an unstoppable mate threat."
