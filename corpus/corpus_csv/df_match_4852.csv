The only advantage he got right now is the pawns in the middle. Maybe to keep his bishop by returning back to c1 would have given better attack further in the game for white.

Don't forget that if I would have taken it with my queen, white would have done e4-e5, giving him better counter-attack. Anyway, my king is not threated at all and it will be better if I castle on the queen side."

From my side, I'm now ready to unleash a huge attack. The f2 pawn is now pinned and there's now many way to reach the king. With the knight I've got in the beginning of the game, I don't really care right now to sacrifice some of my pieces. Bxf2 or Bg4 would be a nice continuation for black."
