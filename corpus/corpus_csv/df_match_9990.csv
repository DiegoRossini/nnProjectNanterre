1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,(dieselengine9) d4. It presents the most options for an open position from my experience.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"(graderguy) Nf6: a look at the GK database shows that this gives the best odds for black. 
It controls some center squares and clears one spot for eventual castle on that side. The
 common lines have a fianchetto King side, but I don't always play that as I am really not
 a fan of fianchetto ahead of my king."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 2,"dieselengine9) Nf3: It's not the 'book' move, but it's my preferred response to Nf6. c4 
makes me feel behind because of Black's 2:e6 which gets his bishop out and gets him
 to a kingside castle, and also tends to force queen movement earlier than I'm comfortable with."
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"(graderguy) e6: Like I said, Fianchetto is not my favored playing style. This move opens 
up the BS Bishop to development and will allow a rapid castle once it's played. I am looking
 at d6 for my bishop later, pointing at the h2 square after white castles. White might play 
b-g5 but I am willing to suffer the pin right now as there are many ways to remove or nullify it.."
5,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"(dieselengine9) c4: While I feel e3 would be much safer, c4 is the book move and also 
stands to promise for a more open game. If I'm going to beat a player of better caliber 
than myself, I've learned that I need the game to be more of an open than a closed position."
6,b6,b7b6,rnbqkb1r/p1pp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"(graderguy) b6: We are now in pretty familiar territory for me, from either side of the board.
 I also like the open positions a queen's pawn game can lead to. This puts us in the Queen's 
Indian Defense. I like the QS fianchetto as it puts the bishop in attacking position on his castled 
king ( when he castles). I will still be able to get my DS Bishop out and allow for the castle. I always 
like a knight on f6 when I castle king side. I do have a tendency to forget to defend it with 
something besides the g pawn sometimes and end up with a torn up pawn defense in front 
of my king. I often move B-e7 to avoid the getting the knight pinned to the queen. B-b7, B-e7, 
or B-b4 will likely be my next move, I will be inclined to move the BS bishop to allow for a castle asap."
7,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/p1pp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2PP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"(dieselengine9) e3: It releases the w/s bishop for castling. g3 is the book move, but f@ck a
 k/s finchetto when playing a high rated 7th degree asshat. It's a prayer to be checkmated
 in such a situation."
8,Bb7,c8b7,rn1qkb1r/pbpp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2PP4/4PN2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"(graderguy) B-b7: WS Bishop pointing squarely at his soon to be castled king. Allows for 
c5 in the future, which N-c6 prevents. I keep wondering what my explanation for giving 
away a minor piece will be later on.. :)"
9,Be2,f1e2,rn1qkb1r/pbpp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2PP4/4PN2/PP2BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 5,"(dieselengine9) Be2: I'm gonna play this hand close to my chess till Dave screws up and 
gives away a minor piece later on.
(graderguy) HA HA HA..."
10,Be7,f8e7,rn1qk2r/pbppbppp/1p2pn2/8/2PP4/4PN2/PP2BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 3 6,"(graderguy) B-e7: Castling is on my mind. Also protecting the knight with something 
besides the queen. I hate that some asshat knows every move I'm thinking of."
11,O-O,e1g1,rn1qk2r/pbppbppp/1p2pn2/8/2PP4/4PN2/PP2BPPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 4 6,"(dieselengine9) O-O: I castle. My pieces are all protected and my opponent has not 
reached out to attack yet. It's great knowing what Dave thinks, though I feel when 
he has one of his ""fits"" and puts THAT in the comment box it's going to be even MORE 
disturbing than a usual game on his lunatic fringe.
(graderguy) I'm gonna show him ""lunatic""......"
12,O-O,e8g8,rn1q1rk1/pbppbppp/1p2pn2/8/2PP4/4PN2/PP2BPPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 5 7,"(graderguy) 0-0: it's why I moved all those other damn pieces. Still have a lingering knight to develop, 
but he can wait...."
13,Nc3,b1c3,rn1q1rk1/pbppbppp/1p2pn2/8/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 6 7,"(dieselengine9) Nc3: I couldnt really think of anything better to do that I couldn't still do 
with this knight developed. I also wonder why N got designated to the knight when the 
king moves so infrequently. That really has to confuse younger players who are studying 
both grammar and the game of chess (and it's scoring.)"
14,d5,d7d5,rn1q1rk1/pbp1bppp/1p2pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 8,"(graderguy) d5: I have three pieces pointing towards d5, so it seemed like a good time to
 advance my center pawn. With the B pawn advanced White cannot simply bypass the 
attack of the D pawn. This also clears d7 for the b square knight if I decide to move it there. 
I have not yet come up with an overall strategy yet, Need to make a few more moves. 
My pieces seem to be in decent shape and there is attacking potential with the ws Bishop if 
white makes an error...."
15,cxd5,c4d5,rn1q1rk1/pbp1bppp/1p2pn2/3P4/3P4/2N1PN2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 8,"(dieselengine9) cxd5: I thought of resigning. This f**ker I'm playing has three pieces pointing
 towards d5. With his B pawn advanced I can't bypass the attack of his freshly pushed D pawn.
 If I screw up, he's going to frickin kill me with his w/s Bishop. All seems lost at this point for 
black. Instead, I opted for cxd5, trading pawns and possibly a piece or two. This is going to give
 him ridiculous position. I should know better than to play this sandbagging grandmaster."
16,exd5,e6d5,rn1q1rk1/pbp1bppp/1p3n2/3p4/3P4/2N1PN2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 9,(graderguy) exd5: D'oh!
17,a3,a2a3,rn1q1rk1/pbp1bppp/1p3n2/3p4/3P4/P1N1PN2/1P2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 9,"(dieselengine9) a3: Limits movement of his black square bishop to twice as many squares
 as mine can move, hoping to close off the position and last more than 20 moves. My king
 is getting his affairs in order. He knows this asshat grandmaster will be at his door soon."
18,Nbd7,b8d7,r2q1rk1/pbpnbppp/1p3n2/3p4/3P4/P1N1PN2/1P2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 10,"graderguy) Nb-d7: After some recent experiences with getting my f file knight raped by weird
 cosmologists, I am totally into guarding that knight like it's a rare gemstone. This does free 
the DS bishop from guarding the knight and B-d6 attacking H2 might come into play at some
 point. I like to keep h7 under guard because _I_ like to attack the other guy there, and I 
assume he'd like that too! Which may be a horrible flaw in my thinking!"
19,b4,b2b4,r2q1rk1/pbpnbppp/1p3n2/3p4/1P1P4/P1N1PN2/4BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 10,"(dieselengine9) b4: This is in anticipation of his c5, which I honestly expected instead of his 
Nbd7. This asshat is playing me like I'm some super intelligent cosmologist or something. 
That doesn't bode well for a slug such as myself."
20,c6,c7c6,r2q1rk1/pb1nbppp/1pp2n2/3p4/1P1P4/P1N1PN2/4BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 11,"c6: I am avoiding c5 for now. I am hoping that white will play b5 in response. Then I will 
move c5. If white does not, then I will likely move a6 shoring up b5 so it is not a safe 
haven for one of white's nasty little pawns."
