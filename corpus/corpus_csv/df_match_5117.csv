1,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Thought I'd try something different. It seems interesting, controls the e5 square and allows the knight to be developed behind the pawn rather than in front. Sounds a bit like the philidor rationale haha."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I was a bit taken a back with the fianchetto, I presumed black would rather play an open game versus white's future cramped position, but what do I know?"
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/5P2/5N2/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"I was a bit taken a back with the fianchetto, I presumed black would rather play an open game versus white's future cramped position, but what do I know?"

5,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pp1p/6p1/3p4/5P2/4PN2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,That's more like it
6,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk1nr/ppp1ppbp/6p1/3p4/5P2/4PN2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,That's more like it
7,Be2,f1e2,rnbqk1nr/ppp1ppbp/6p1/3p4/5P2/4PN2/PPPPB1PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 4,That's more like it

9,d4,d2d4,rnbqk1nr/pp2ppbp/6p1/2pp4/3P1P2/4PN2/PPP1B1PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,Contest the center immediately. I don't want to be pushed back
10,b6,b7b6,rnbqk1nr/p3ppbp/1p4p1/2pp4/3P1P2/4PN2/PPP1B1PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,I was again confused with this move. I thought better would be 5. ... cxd4 6. exd4 Nc6 7. 0-0
11,dxc5,d4c5,rnbqk1nr/p3ppbp/1p4p1/2Pp4/5P2/4PN2/PPP1B1PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"A rather confusing move for black to respond to, in blitz anyways. Goes against intuition to not lose material if a few seconds are spent observing the situation."

14,Bd7,c8d7,rn1qk1nr/p2bppbp/6p1/1Bpp4/5P2/4PN2/PPP3PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 8,And there's the mistake. 7. ... Kf8 is the move.
15,Qxd5,d1d5,rn1qk1nr/p2bppbp/6p1/1BpQ4/5P2/4PN2/PPP3PP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 8,Comfortable game shall ensue.

19,Nc3,b1c3,Qn2k1nr/p3ppbp/6p1/qbp5/5P2/2N1PN2/PPP3PP/R1B1K2R b KQk - 2 10,Qb6 is still preferential here. Black does bad to be greedy. I spent 30 seconds and decided to really bait black with the next couple of moves
