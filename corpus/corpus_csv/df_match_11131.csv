15,Rd1,a1d1,rnb1k1nr/1pqp1p1p/p3p1p1/8/1b1NP1Q1/2N5/PPPB1PPP/3RKB1R b Kkq - 1 8,placing my rook on a file that im eventually going to try to open and on which the rook might prove a handy tool for discovered attacks
16,Nf6,g8f6,rnb1k2r/1pqp1p1p/p3pnp1/8/1b1NP1Q1/2N5/PPPB1PPP/3RKB1R w Kkq - 2 9,preparing to castle (not really putting pressure on e4 which is needed) also trying to obtain a tempi by attacking my queen

19,Qxf6,f3f6,r1b1k2r/1pqp1p1p/p1n1pQp1/8/1b1NP3/2N5/PPPB1PPP/3RKB1R b Kkq - 0 10,forcing exchange of queens; note exchanging simplifying the position when down in material leads to a losing endgame; you should never try to exchange when down in material; white happliy accepted queen trade
20,Qe5,c7e5,r1b1k2r/1p1p1p1p/p1n1pQp1/4q3/1b1NP3/2N5/PPPB1PPP/3RKB1R w Kkq - 1 11,forcing exchange of queens; note exchanging simplifying the position when down in material leads to a losing endgame; you should never try to exchange when down in material; white happliy accepted queen trade
21,Qxe5,f6e5,r1b1k2r/1p1p1p1p/p1n1p1p1/4Q3/1b1NP3/2N5/PPPB1PPP/3RKB1R b Kkq - 0 11,when you have a material advantage always try to exchange and simlify into a winning endgame
