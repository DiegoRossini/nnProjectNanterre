1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,My first game with Freddy
2,a5,a7a5,rnbqkbnr/1ppppppp/8/p7/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,"I reviewed black's past games and noticed a recent loss with this opening move when his opponent ignored the rook pawn all the way to axb2 followed by bishop capture. I didn't understand much of the game and not sure if the pawn loss was pivotal, but maybe I can do the same thing. I think he's trying to provoke me into something I'll regret. (post game note: plenty of that later)"
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/1ppppppp/8/p7/8/2N2N2/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Wait.... what if he doesn't capture b2 and just sits there? Hold on, that was a recent game, he probably won't do that again. Why didn't I move c4 again?"
4,a4,a5a4,rnbqkbnr/1ppppppp/8/8/p7/2N2N2/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"Wait.... what if he doesn't capture b2 and just sits there? Hold on, that was a recent game, he probably won't do that again. Why didn't I move c4 again?"
5,a3,a2a3,rnbqkbnr/1ppppppp/8/8/p7/P1N2N2/1PPPPPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"so I push c3, no apparent resolve to stick to my plan. After I click move, this looks really ugly."
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/1ppppppp/2n5/8/p7/P1N2N2/1PPPPPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,"post game note: analysis shows this as an inaccuracy, but I intended on the fianchetto and wanted to castle as soon as possible. Not sure why its an inaccuracy."
7,g3,g2g3,r1bqkbnr/1ppppppp/2n5/8/p7/P1N2NP1/1PPPPP1P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"post game note: analysis shows this as an inaccuracy, but I intended on the fianchetto and wanted to castle as soon as possible. Not sure why its an inaccuracy."
8,e5,e7e5,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/p7/P1N2NP1/1PPPPP1P/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"I don't really know the name of this board configuration, but have seen it a lot. Seems like the d6 blocks in his black bishop. So maybe he's going to fianchetto his bishop."
9,e4,e2e4,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/p3P3/P1N2NP1/1PPP1P1P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"I don't really know the name of this board configuration, but have seen it a lot. Seems like the d6 blocks in his black bishop. So maybe he's going to fianchetto his bishop."

12,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk1nr/1pp1bppp/2np4/1B2p3/p3P3/P1N2NP1/1PPP1P1P/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 7,"Why not g6 and then Bg7? Seems like this blocks in the queen, but I think he's castling short."
13,d4,d2d4,r1bqk1nr/1pp1bppp/2np4/1B2p3/p2PP3/P1N2NP1/1PP2P1P/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,"I thought about Nxa4, but thought he would advance on d file. I also didn't want to give up the pinned knight position yet."
14,exd4,e5d4,r1bqk1nr/1pp1bppp/2np4/1B6/p2pP3/P1N2NP1/1PP2P1P/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"I see an opportunity to get his pawns doubled, seems like maybe that will be an advantage. I need every one I can get. Also, I read somewhere that a fianchetto is easy to defeat when the opponent has the queen and bishop with the same color as your fianchetto bishop. I think if I take his bishop with mine, I may be able to defend better. Maybe another advantage."
