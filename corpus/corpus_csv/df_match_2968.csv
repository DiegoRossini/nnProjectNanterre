1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Constructive and instructive comments are welcome on this game. I'm a pretty inexperienced chess player seeking to improve his game, and I was grateful that my opponent didn't simply cancel this blitz game after he saw my rating. I've removed black's name for protection from the disgrace of losing against such a low-rated player, though I do believe we both had a good game :)

Now for my comments on the game:
I've heard queen pawn games are good when your opponent is better than you, because it's less easy to attain a distinct advantage right away."
