1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The most popular opening of all time chess playing. From the known history, the most played response to 1.e4 is 1...e5 and by a recent time there was an emerging initiative opening move to conduct robust games and may change the statistics, and that is..."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The Sicilian Defense, an aggressive choice by black where white is discouraged to push immediate 2.d4 (other than KP openings, of course)!"
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"The second 'best' move to respond to 1...c5. The Closed Sicilian, probably it might transpose to the Open Sicilian as per mutual interest, but not necessarily. The replies would be more or less similar if played 2.Nf3."
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Playing a second pawn to the center, White controls the two light squares in the center and the rest is in the domain of Black so far."
5,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,An interesting move to take partial control over e4.
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/2p5/4PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"In the current position, both players have four pieces in total near the center."

9,g4,g2g4,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2npp3/2p5/4PPP1/2N2N2/PPPP3P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,White is about to launch a king side pawn thrust. A typical intention in Grand Prix Attack.
10,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk1nr/pp2bppp/2npp3/2p5/4PPP1/2N2N2/PPPP3P/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,"All king-side pawns are on the 4th rank. IMO, it was too immediate to launch the attack. I'd prefer advancing the h-pawn further than rank 3 if Black castles in the king-side, a typical line being Bb5 (or more aggressive Bc4)/O-O/Qe1/Qg3 etc. to proceed with the 'steamroller' scenario."

12,d5,d6d5,r1bqk1nr/pp2bppp/2n1p3/2pp4/4PPPP/2N2N2/PPPP4/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"A straightforward move where White has immediately decide about the e4 pawn. Along on the way to the war on the center, Qc7 would be preferably played before d5 which would create alternative threats on the pawn structure where White has to be really cautious."
13,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqk1nr/pp2bppp/2n1p3/1Bpp4/4PPPP/2N2N2/PPPP4/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,"On the contrary, a threat to destruct the queen-side pawn structure with Bxc6 check where bxc6 is anticipated unless it is defended with bishop (or queen). If Black proceeds with dxe4, there would be isolated pawns and doubled c-pawns with another unstable pawn on e4."
14,Bd7,c8d7,r2qk1nr/pp1bbppp/2n1p3/1Bpp4/4PPPP/2N2N2/PPPP4/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 8,The best of the available decisions regarding to the e-pawn. e5 push would continue as 8...d4! 9.Ne2/Ne4 f5 which makes development for Black pieces much clearer and easier than before (9.Na4 Qa5 -+).

En passant would create two isolated pawns on f and h files where the 'passive' horse finds an easy and good looking spot. En route, Black could play Qc7! (threatening Qxf4) which clears the way for O-O-O which makes White's plans severely off course."
