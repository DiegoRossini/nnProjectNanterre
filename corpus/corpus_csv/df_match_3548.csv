The idea is that Black can build a shell nigh-impossible to crack if he keeps all his pawns close to home and doesn't do anything ""crazy"" ...like develop his pieces beyond the 2nd or 3rd ranks. As weird and unchesslike as all this sounds, the Hedgehog actually is a difficult defense to overcome. White's soundest plan requires patience: it's simply to develop normally and to gradually play to gain space, controlling the first 5, and then 6, ranks of the board, constricting Black like a big python and working for an unstoppable breakthrough. If Black can survive this process, he can generally catch White napping at some point, and suddenly start playing ""real chess"" with pawn breaks and piece-led attacks of his own. Back in the 80s, the Canadian GM Duncan Suttles was a virtuoso of the Hedgehog, and occasionally used it to beat or draw with world-class players much better than himself."
