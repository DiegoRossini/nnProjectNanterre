I don't pretend to be perfect! This is an attempt for me to get better, so if you see a hole in my logic feel free to message me! Also, if you see any typos please message me as I think they're ugly. Thanks!

I want to give a lot of thanks to rt4sm for reviewing my analysis and pointing out holes in my logic! Many of my comments revolving around ...Nxg4 have been changed as per his analysis."

However, it's not bad as if Black plays anything that doesn't capture the pawn on d4 (other than 5. ...Qe7 which will force him to have the ugly pawn island) he is forced to isolate his doubled c pawns, and if he doesn't he'll be forced to take on an ugly pawn island consisting of c6, c7, and d6."
