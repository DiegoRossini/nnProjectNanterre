1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,The trumpets of war sound the beginning of another epic battle.  White King decides to throw caution to wind and sends his personal Pawn bodyguard to e4.  This shows White King's ambition to avoid the slow manoeuvring that other opening battle moves tend to emphasise.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Black King decides that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and sends his own Pawn bodyguard to e5.  This challenges directly for the centre, but since it is White's move the symmetry simply allows the White King to retain the initiative."
3,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,"White's ""light-side"" Bishop, taking advice from the Force, immediately jumps to c4 and draws his blue lightsaber.  The White King is furious at the insolence of the ""light-side"" Bishop, taking matters into his own hands by listening to the Force above the King's orders.  The ""light-side"" Bishop is threatening the Black's weak f7 Pawn, however the Black e5 Pawn remains under no threat."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 3,"The Black King sends his cavalry to f6, threatening the White central defences.  The Black e5 Pawn sees he now has the advantage over his opposite number and begins hurling abuse at the White e4 pawn, implying that the e4 Pawn's mother is a hamster and smells of elderberries!"
5,d3,d2d3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 3,"White King over-hears the hamster remark, so sends a Pawn to d3 as backup for the e4 Pawn.  The insults cease as quickly as they began, the Black e5 Pawn looking slightly chastised now that the White e4 Pawn is defended."
6,Bb4+,f8b4,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/1bB1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 4,"The White King is flabbergasted as the ""dark-side"" Black Bishop places him under direct threat.  The Black ""dark-side"" Bishop draws his red lightsaber, swishing it through the air menacingly."
7,c3,c2c3,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/1bB1P3/2PP4/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 4,"White King must respond quickly so sends another Pawn forward to defend against the Force wielding ""dark-side"" Bishop.  The Black ""dark-side"" Bishop looks contemptuously at the defending Pawn, but prior to attacking notices that a trap has been laid and the White Pawn is well defended.  The Black ""dark-side"" Pawn cautiously looks towards his King, because in the end those that use the ""dark-side"" are always cowards."
8,Be7,b4e7,rnbqk2r/ppppbppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/2PP4/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 5,"The Black King nods and allows the Black ""dark-side"" Bishop to retreat, becoming part of the Black King's bodyguard."
9,f4,f2f4,rnbqk2r/ppppbppp/5n2/4p3/2B1PP2/2PP4/PP4PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,"Once more White King sends a Pawn forward, this time directly challenging for the centre by attacking the Black e5 Pawn."

11,exd5,e4d5,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/5n2/3Pp3/2B2P2/2PP4/PP4PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 6,"The White e4 Pawn is sent into battle by his King, he moves to engage the Black Pawn at d5 and decimates his defences.  White goes up in material by +1"
12,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qk2r/ppp1bppp/5n2/3Pp3/2B2Pb1/2PP4/PP4PP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 7,"But this allows the Black ""light-side"" Bishop to draw his green lightsaber and rush to g4, threatening the White Queen."
