1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Nick (moistcomrade) had previously played two games against sabyyavin, for which he lost both because he cracked under the pressure of being behind in material. Nick already drops a rook early, and whilst most players would have given up, Nick gallantly fought on and against the material deficit, generated a strong attack. Black still maintains a material advantage after the exchange of queens, but makes a costly blunder and White queens his pawn. Even with accurate defence, Black could have drawn the game, but he ends up dropping a rook at the end, and concedes."
