He attacks d4 and has plenty of opportunity to become aggressive on the queenside. In fact this is exactly why, from time to time, theory has considered the Advance Variation to be inferior. But the crucial question is: how does Black's short-term initiative compare to White's long-term prospects? This is where theory has changed its mind again and again in the past (and is likely to keep on doing so in the future)."
