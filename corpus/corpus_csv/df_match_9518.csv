The purpose of Qa5 was, I think, to pile up on the white c5 pawn hoping to win it next move."

White is still lagging behind with his dsb still on its home square and white is not castled.  White needs to develop that bishop asap - maybe white castling long is not a bad idea as the queens are off the board.

White cannot contest the d file because the d2 square is controlled by the black dsb.  The dsb must move, however, because it is en prise to the white rook on a2.  So black plays Bd3 which is a strong move because if the lsbs are exchanged then the d8 rook can come to d3 where it will be a cat among pigeons as I explain in a later note."
