1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi all! This is the first game in a very fun team match. I have the Black pieces, and I experiment with the Dutch Defense--though it quickly turns into more of a Dutch Attack! I thought it was a very entertaining game; I hope you enjoy it!"
2,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The Dutch Defense. I'm not very familiar with all the theory, but I'm eager to learn it more thoroughly!"
3,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5pB1/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"This is one of a few so-called 'anti-Dutch' lines. Black's dark squares in the center are notoriously weak, so this aims (among other things) to take advantage of them."
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/ppppp2p/6p1/5pB1/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"I found a couple of mentions of this little Knight maneuver in the literature. I thought it was interesting, so I wanted to try it. The idea is to plant the Knight on f7 to lend support to the e5 and g5 squares weakened by Black's first move."
5,Nd2,b1d2,rnbqkbnr/ppppp2p/6p1/5pB1/3P4/8/PPPNPPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"I found a couple of mentions of this little Knight maneuver in the literature.

7,e4,e2e4,rnbqkb1r/ppppp2p/6pn/5pB1/3PP3/8/PPPN1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,And the maneuver is complete! Now to see if it's as strong as I want it to be.
8,Nf7,h6f7,rnbqkb1r/pppppn1p/6p1/5pB1/3PP3/8/PPPN1PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,And the maneuver is complete! Now to see if it's as strong as I want it to be.
9,Be3,g5e3,rnbqkb1r/pppppn1p/6p1/5p2/3PP3/4B3/PPPN1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 2 5,"Both sides keep developing, albeit the pattern is a little strange thanks to the Knight maneuver and exchange in the middle."
10,fxe4,f5e4,rnbqkb1r/pppppn1p/6p1/8/3Pp3/4B3/PPPN1PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"Both sides keep developing, albeit the pattern is a little strange thanks to the Knight maneuver and exchange in the middle."

13,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqk2r/pppppnbp/6p1/8/2BPN3/4B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 2 7,"? It looks like a natural place to develop this Bishop, but unfortunately it also loses a piece."
14,d5,d7d5,rnbqk2r/ppp1pnbp/6p1/3p4/2BPN3/4B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 0 8,Forking Bishop and Knight.
15,Bb5+,c4b5,rnbqk2r/ppp1pnbp/6p1/1B1p4/3PN3/4B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 1 8,"Not particularly effective, I think."
16,c6,c7c6,rnbqk2r/pp2pnbp/2p3p1/1B1p4/3PN3/4B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 0 9,"Black's isolated e-pawn is now his only real weakness, and he's up a Knight for a pawn. All he has to do now is hang on to that advantage."
17,Bd3,b5d3,rnbqk2r/pp2pnbp/2p3p1/3p4/3PN3/3BB3/PPP2PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 1 9,"Black's isolated e-pawn is now his only real weakness, and he's up a Knight for a pawn. All he has to do now is hang on to that advantage."

20,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qk2r/pp2pnbp/2p3p1/5b2/3PB3/4B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 1 11,So Black gives White an opportunity to help him out.
21,Bxf5,e4f5,rn1qk2r/pp2pnbp/2p3p1/5B2/3P4/4B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 0 11,"Now the e-pawn is no longer isolated. The more Black can trade down, the more his extra piece will be worth."
22,gxf5,g6f5,rn1qk2r/pp2pnbp/2p5/5p2/3P4/4B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 0 12,"Now the e-pawn is no longer isolated. The more Black can trade down, the more his extra piece will be worth."
23,Qd3,d1d3,rn1qk2r/pp2pnbp/2p5/5p2/3P4/3QB3/PPP2PPP/R3K1NR b KQkq - 1 12,Threatening f5 and preparing to castle queenside if White wants to.
24,Nd6,f7d6,rn1qk2r/pp2p1bp/2pn4/5p2/3P4/3QB3/PPP2PPP/R3K1NR w KQkq - 2 13,"In retrospect I think 12...Qd7 was stronger, maintaining my claim to e5 in preparation for a pawn advance."
25,Ne2,g1e2,rn1qk2r/pp2p1bp/2pn4/5p2/3P4/3QB3/PPP1NPPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 3 13,Threatening to win b2 and putting pressure on d4.

27,Rb1,a1b1,rn2k2r/pp2p1bp/1qpn4/5p2/3P4/3QB3/PPP1NPPP/1R2K2R b Kkq - 5 14,"Probably the best way to defend, and get the Rook off the long diagonal. White should be on the lookout now for opportunities to advance d4-d5 and discover an attack on the BQ."
28,e6,e7e6,rn2k2r/pp4bp/1qpnp3/5p2/3P4/3QB3/PPP1NPPP/1R2K2R w Kkq - 0 15,"Attempting to free the Knight from defense duty, but I think this is actually pretty weak. In fact, the placement of this pawn on e6 will prove to hound me for the rest of the game."

32,Nd7,b8d7,r3k2r/pp1n2bp/2pnp3/q4p2/3P4/P2QB3/1PP1NPPP/1R3RK1 w kq - 1 17,"This Knight is hoping to make a journey across to the kingside. Now that White has castled over there, Black intends to use his open lines to blast in--or at least force some more favorable exchanges."
