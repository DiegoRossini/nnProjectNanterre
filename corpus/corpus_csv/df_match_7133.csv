1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I think when I began this game against kippenvel I was around 1230.

My reason for annoting this game is to 
A.) Show how decisive a strong outpost can be.
B.) Generally examine strategic play, for which I am grateful for any and all feedback.

I start with the QP."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Pretty basic continuation, vying for a direct challenge on the center."

4,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"I would say this is not such a good move by black because it doesn't do much beside protect d5, not a bad move, just not great."
5,f3,f2f3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3P4/2N2P2/PPP1P1PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"f3 prevents the Bg3 Nb4 king/castle fork while protecting e4, and thus accomplishes two things by attacking the center and preventing the development of his WSB.

Another intesting point is that now that the Bg3 Nb4 king/castle fork (which I am personaly fond of) is no longer available, blacks knight is not so good.  He cant really play Na6, because all he can do from there is go back to b8 or goto b4, which as I said isn't really viable anymore.  His other option is Nd7, a terrible move that bottles up his Queen and WSB.  My point is that from 3 moves in black is already positionally hampered, and that I love a strategic game."
