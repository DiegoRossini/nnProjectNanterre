1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Here playing white on a king gambit game. It's a very quick blitz game. The opening look unsound but still very reliable.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Here playing white on a king gambit game. It's a very quick blitz game. The opening look unsound but still very reliable.
3,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Here playing white on a king gambit game. It's a very quick blitz game. The opening look unsound but still very reliable.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,Declined. I found d6 better if you want to decline it.
5,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4PP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 3,"Developping and prevent Qh4. 3.fxe5 Nxe5 4.d4 look winner, but black could answer with Qh4 followed by Qxe4."
6,f6,f7f6,r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/2n2p2/4p3/4PP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,? d6 or exf4 is better. Black is breaking his protection and lose tempo.
7,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/2n2p2/4p3/2B1PP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,To castle the most quickly as possible + threatening his knight and Bf7.
8,d6,d7d6,r1bqkbnr/ppp3pp/2np1p2/4p3/2B1PP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,Well he should have done it sooner. He's late on development now.
9,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkbnr/ppp3pp/2np1p2/4p3/2B1PP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 5,"Moved quickly, but I think Bxg8 would have been better, messing up his castling on king side."
10,Nge7,g8e7,r1bqkb1r/ppp1n1pp/2np1p2/4p3/2B1PP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 6,"Well he should have developped his pieces on queen side instead to castle quickly. Or maybe do Na5, the bishop is too much strong right now."
11,fxe5,f4e5,r1bqkb1r/ppp1n1pp/2np1p2/4P3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 6,? he should have done dxe5 here or Na5. Now with this open line I can do Bf7+.
12,fxe5,f6e5,r1bqkb1r/ppp1n1pp/2np4/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,? he should have done dxe5 here or Na5. Now with this open line I can do Bf7+.
13,d4,d2d4,r1bqkb1r/ppp1n1pp/2np4/4p3/2BPP3/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,Ng5 could have been fine but there was no hurry. Not enought pieces developped to have a very strong combination.
14,Bg4,c8g4,r2qkb1r/ppp1n1pp/2np4/4p3/2BPP1b1/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 8,"! well it was logic, but I don't think it change really something because 8.Bf7+ Kxf7 9.Ng5+ Ke8 10.Qxg4. and white keep the advantage."
15,dxe5,d4e5,r2qkb1r/ppp1n1pp/2np4/4P3/2B1P1b1/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,"?! Probably not the best move here, but I thought there was still no hurry."
16,Nxe5,c6e5,r2qkb1r/ppp1n1pp/3p4/4n3/2B1P1b1/5N2/PPP3PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 9,"It look a fine move, threatening both my bishop and my knight."
17,Nxe5,f3e5,r2qkb1r/ppp1n1pp/3p4/4N3/2B1P1b1/8/PPP3PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 9,!!
18,dxe5,d6e5,r2qkb1r/ppp1n1pp/8/4p3/2B1P1b1/8/PPP3PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 10,There was no escape at this point!
19,Bf7#,c4f7,r2qkb1r/ppp1nBpp/8/4p3/4P1b1/8/PPP3PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 10,Mate. Really enjoyed this 2-3 mins blitz game.
