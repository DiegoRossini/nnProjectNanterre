1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,A very fine first move.
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"A fine move, as well."
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"Hmm, not too bad; I'd have gone Nf3. I don't really like blocking my c-pawn in this type of White-setup."
4,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3P4/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,This could turn into the Caro-Cann. Via e4.
