1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"Garry Kasparov tries accumulating small advantages without risking anything during this War.  Deep Blue seemed a little confused at first and played a few innacurate and weakening moves, but it came right back into the game with later moves that no one would have foreseen.  Kasparov kept his nerve, and still held a small advantage.  However the lead, Kasparov muttered to himself after not making the best move.  With the tension rising, Deep Blue was provoked into an unsound attack that weakened its position still further, but such was the ferocity of its assault that it took all of Kasparov's tactical skill to defeat the computer.  Although ahead on material, Deep Blue was strategically lost after the queens were exchanged and the world champion methodically wrapped up the endgame.  Hope you have fun looking through this game, I will be showing Game 2 between Garry Kasparov and Deep Blue tommorow.  They played a 6 game series of flawless playing."
