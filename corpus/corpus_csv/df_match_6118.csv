11,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"6...e6 can also be played here, and is more mainline [correct me if I'm wrong] than the move played. However, since this move develops a piece and prevents Nakamura from doubling pawns, it can hardly be faulted [though it does make it harder for Van Wely to get out his light-square bishop]"

13,f4,f2f4,r1bqkb1r/1p1npppp/p2p1n2/6B1/3NPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"Nakamura plays a move usual for White in the Sicilian - a kingside pawn expansion which looks to generate activity kingside. White's logical course of action now would most likely be queenside castling, and perhaps Van Wely will be thinking about queenside castling too because of White's kingside activity..."
14,Qb6,d8b6,r1b1kb1r/1p1npppp/pq1p1n2/6B1/3NPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,Van Wely brings out his queen and targets the b2 pawn...

I have annotated another game with this variation [between chess computers Rybka and Shredder] only Black has his knight on b8 and his pawn on e6  [in other words, Black had played 6...e6 instead of 6...Nbd7] here's the link to that game, by the way... http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/technological-brilliance?gm=32287"
16,Qxb2,b6b2,r1b1kb1r/1p1npppp/p2p1n2/6B1/3NPP2/2N5/PqPQ2PP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 9,"The poisoned pawn is accepted here as well, and after looking through both games, I can say with confidence that I would never take the pawn as Black! That's just my personal opinion though, because Black probably has some chances in this variation... just not in this game! :P"
17,Rb1,a1b1,r1b1kb1r/1p1npppp/p2p1n2/6B1/3NPP2/2N5/PqPQ2PP/1R2KB1R b Kkq - 1 9,"The obvious continuation, chasing the queen away, saving the rook and grabbing the half-open b-file. This rook will prove to be vital later in the game"

The capture was not forced by any means, and the bishop pair would be useful in this variation of the Sicilian [from what I can gather, the poisoned pawn variation is counting on White having superior spatial advantage for the lost pawn] However, the motif for this will be revealed..."

25,Nd5,c3d5,r1b1kb1r/1p1npppp/p7/3NP3/3N4/q7/P1PQ2PP/1R2KB1R b Kkq - 2 13,"! Nakamura's knight finds a snug home in the centre of the board! As well as centralising the knight, this move also threatens the standard king-rook fork. Easy enough for a Grandmaster player like Van Wely to handle... right?"
26,Qc5,a3c5,r1b1kb1r/1p1npppp/p7/2qNP3/3N4/8/P1PQ2PP/1R2KB1R w Kkq - 3 14,"? What a natural looking move... but incorrect! Any alternative - namely, Kd8 [best, I presume] Ra7 and Rb8 [the king has to move after Nc7+] might have been better, but it's hard to see what's so bad about this move. What we have to remember, however, is that Nakamura is also a Grandmaster..."
27,Nb3,d4b3,r1b1kb1r/1p1npppp/p7/2qNP3/8/1N6/P1PQ2PP/1R2KB1R b Kkq - 4 14,watch how the knight pair gets to work to achieve the final position of this game :)

29,Na5,b3a5,r1b1kb1r/1p1npppp/p1q5/N2NP3/8/8/P1PQ2PP/1R2KB1R b Kkq - 6 15,another attack on the queen
