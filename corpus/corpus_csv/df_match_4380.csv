1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game is from a thematic mini tournament I am currently playing in, it begins with a queens gambit. 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 it's for people with ratings from 1500-2050 and I am already very glad I entered. Especially as I have already managed a couple of good results like a win against a 2011 rated player (incidentally another Benko gambit won me that game) and now a second win against someone rated over 1700."

5,d5,d4d5,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2pP4/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,Since white has not pushed his e pawn yet figured I would simply continue developing. I wonder though if playing d6 would have been a better idea just incase white had tried to shake things up by playing d6 himself.

9,cxb5,c4b5,rnbqkb1r/p2ppp1p/5np1/1PpP4/8/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,So now white is going to accept the gambit after all.
10,a6,a7a6,rnbqkb1r/3ppp1p/p4np1/1PpP4/8/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,If white was going to do this he may as well have taken on a6 as it leads to the same thing anyway.

14,Ba6,c8a6,rn1qkb1r/3ppp1p/b4np1/1NpP4/8/5N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,So now we have a regular Benko gambit.

Blacks ideas are seem to reveal themselves for this opening and very little theory knowledge is needed to play black in the benko gambit. A general idea of blacks usual plans is sufficient.

26,Qb6,d8b6,r4rk1/3nppbp/1q1p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N2NP1/PP3PKP/R1BQR3 w - - 5 14,I find I often bring my queen to b6 however in the Benko gambit in can just as often end up on a5. either way the point is to pressure whites queen side by having a rook on the a & b files and often supported by the queen.
27,Qc2,d1c2,r4rk1/3nppbp/1q1p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N2NP1/PPQ2PKP/R1B1R3 b - - 6 14,This just creates weaknessess in whites position. So far blacks position only really has a weakness on e7.
28,Rfb8,f8b8,rr4k1/3nppbp/1q1p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N2NP1/PPQ2PKP/R1B1R3 w - - 7 15,This just creates weaknessess in whites position. So far blacks position only really has a weakness on e7.

30,Ng4,f6g4,rr4k1/3nppbp/1q1p2p1/2pP4/4P1n1/1PN2NP1/P1Q2PKP/R1B1R3 w - - 1 16,Aiming for e5. When I made this move I hoped for an intersting variation. I began spending alot of time calculating 16.h3 Ne5 17.Nxe5 Nxe5 18.f4 then the spectacular sacrafice 18...c4!? Of course after making the move I realised that I had spent all my time considering this unlikely variation and not put any thought into what would happen if white did anything else. A rather silly thing to do on my part.
31,Bb2,c1b2,rr4k1/3nppbp/1q1p2p1/2pP4/4P1n1/1PN2NP1/PBQ2PKP/R3R3 b - - 2 16,I had wondered if white might try this. It is at least consiestant with whites play so far however it does allow blacks next move.
32,c4,c5c4,rr4k1/3nppbp/1q1p2p1/3P4/2p1P1n1/1PN2NP1/PBQ2PKP/R3R3 w - - 0 17,This should win back atleast one pawn for black. though this is not why I made the move.
33,Na4,c3a4,rr4k1/3nppbp/1q1p2p1/3P4/N1p1P1n1/1P3NP1/PBQ2PKP/R3R3 b - - 1 17,This was expected and is the natural move. Of course there were other options as well.
34,Rxa4,a8a4,1r4k1/3nppbp/1q1p2p1/3P4/r1p1P1n1/1P3NP1/PBQ2PKP/R3R3 w - - 0 18,Obviously if bxa4 black is better after Qxb2 However I hoped in vain that white might try bxc4?? then I prepared 18...Qxb2 19.Qxa4 Qxf2+ 20.Kh3 Qxf3 and a piece up then if white tried to get the piece back 21.Qxd7?? Nf2+ 22.Kh4 Bf6# of course it is extremely unlikely this would ever have occurred and even if white had not seen this 18.bxc4 is still bad as black could simply retreat the rook. Though it is fun to look at these lines even if they will never happen.
35,Bxg7,b2g7,1r4k1/3nppBp/1q1p2p1/3P4/r1p1P1n1/1P3NP1/P1Q2PKP/R3R3 b - - 0 18,"This is natural, obvious and best. I know that it is usually a bad idea to allow the DSB to be taken off however in this game I felt that black gets compensation in other ways."
36,cxb3,c4b3,1r4k1/3nppBp/1q1p2p1/3P4/r3P1n1/1p3NP1/P1Q2PKP/R3R3 w - - 0 19,This is practically forced.
37,axb3,a2b3,1r4k1/3nppBp/1q1p2p1/3P4/r3P1n1/1P3NP1/2Q2PKP/R3R3 b - - 0 19,As is this. Any other move would have lost for white.
38,Rb4,a4b4,1r4k1/3nppBp/1q1p2p1/3P4/1r2P1n1/1P3NP1/2Q2PKP/R3R3 w - - 1 20,"Black could have immediately regained the pawn with Rxa1 Bxa1 Qxb3. With a sort of dull equality. However I felt it was in blacks best interest to keep material on, besides whites pawn isn't going anywhere and black can take it at anytime. Plus I feel more comfortable with blacks position here. What do you think? would you prefer white or black in this position?"
39,Bc3,g7c3,1r4k1/3npp1p/1q1p2p1/3P4/1r2P1n1/1PB2NP1/2Q2PKP/R3R3 b - - 2 20,It was either this or Bb2
