5,Bxf7+,c4f7,r1bqkbnr/pppp1Bpp/2n5/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 3,"TN. (Although there is a known opening with this idea, the Jerome Gambit, if anyone wants to look it up.) White gives up a whole piece to tear open the Black king's pawn cover. This is certainly dangerous, but instinctively I feel it must be unsound; White has not enough pieces developed to organise an attack. It's true that Black is not yet developed either, but that gives Black the advantage of flexibility. For instance, since Black has not moved the king's knight, he can respond to Qf3+ with Qf6 -- and the last thing White wants is to exchange queens."
6,Kxf7,e8f7,r1bq1bnr/pppp1kpp/2n5/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQ - 0 4,"So, White to play and justify his gambit. As just stated, Qf3+ doesn't work, and nor does Qh5+; Black just plays g6 and there's no follow-up. White's only recourse is to develop his pieces rapidly, with this move and Nf3 in either order to prepare Ng5+."

11,O-O,e1g1,r1bq3r/ppppbkpp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 4 6,"But White chooses to castle instead. ""Do not castle except when strictly necessary, for the initiative is often lost by it."" That said, Ng5+ at this point is really no more than a mild inconvenience to Black -- showing, I think, that Black has already refuted White's sacrifice. Black would respond with moves such as Ke8, Rf8, d6, and the king is safe enough in the centre, while White's having given Black a half-open file could actually work in Black's favour."

(Though GameKnot thinks this increases Black's advantage by a third of a pawn and 12... a6 gives it back again, so did I miss something?)
