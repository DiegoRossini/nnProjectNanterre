1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Tactical opening.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I feel classical.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Thinking Spanish.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,Thinking Spanish.
5,a3,a2a3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/P4N2/1PPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"A miscue. Better is Bb5 or Bc4, Spanish or Italian. The text move strives to limit black bishop counterplay, which it does at the price of giving black the initiative."
6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/P4N2/1PPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,Attacking e4 and developing with 0-0 in mind.
7,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/P1N2N2/1PPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,White is playing on the defensive.
8,d6,d7d6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4p3/4P3/P1N2N2/1PPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Not a bold move, but it does open a bishop line without commiting to pawn and piece exchanges."
9,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/1B2p3/4P3/P1N2N2/1PPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,"White plays the belated bishop move, but the game is now out of the standard character of the Spanish."
10,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/2np1n2/1B2p3/4P3/P1N2N2/1PPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 6,Developing a piece and almost daring white to play BxN.
11,d3,d2d3,r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/2np1n2/1B2p3/4P3/P1NP1N2/1PP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,White plays a symetrical pawn move which opens a bishop line and frees the c3 knight for operations.
12,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/ppp1bppp/2np1n2/1B2p3/4P3/P1NP1N2/1PP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 1 7,Black plays for rapid development.
13,Bxc6,b5c6,r1bq1rk1/ppp1bppp/2Bp1n2/4p3/4P3/P1NP1N2/1PP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 7,"The text move offers the advantage of a flawed pawn structure for black, but it yields the bishop pair in the process, and no other gains are apparent due to the captured steed not being particularly dangerous."
14,bxc6,b7c6,r1bq1rk1/p1p1bppp/2pp1n2/4p3/4P3/P1NP1N2/1PP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 8,A unassuming move that overlooks a certain knight reprisal by black.
15,Be3,c1e3,r1bq1rk1/p1p1bppp/2pp1n2/4p3/4P3/P1NPBN2/1PP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 1 8,A unassuming move that overlooks a certain knight reprisal by black.
16,Ng4,f6g4,r1bq1rk1/p1p1bppp/2pp4/4p3/4P1n1/P1NPBN2/1PP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 2 9,"Not the best move, Bd7 is better. Perhaps white has a strategy to play NN vs BB."
17,h3,h2h3,r1bq1rk1/p1p1bppp/2pp4/4p3/4P1n1/P1NPBN1P/1PP2PP1/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 9,"Not the best move, Bd7 is better. Perhaps white has a strategy to play NN vs BB."
18,Nxe3,g4e3,r1bq1rk1/p1p1bppp/2pp4/4p3/4P3/P1NPnN1P/1PP2PP1/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 10,"White is still uncastled and reaching an uncomfortable position due to the lack of support for the king. It is not an immediate problem, but the cookie will begin to crumble."
19,fxe3,f2e3,r1bq1rk1/p1p1bppp/2pp4/4p3/4P3/P1NPPN1P/1PP3P1/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 10,"White is still uncastled and reaching an uncomfortable position due to the lack of support for the king. It is not an immediate problem, but the cookie will begin to crumble."
20,Rb8,a8b8,1rbq1rk1/p1p1bppp/2pp4/4p3/4P3/P1NPPN1P/1PP3P1/R2QK2R w KQ - 1 11,"Like a Lasker move, attacking a weakness while developing a piece to a useful line."
21,b4,b2b4,1rbq1rk1/p1p1bppp/2pp4/4p3/1P2P3/P1NPPN1P/2P3P1/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 11,"Playing like Lasker who would play on both flanks. The text move seeks to break up the pawns in the centre if ignored by white, or develop a bishop if white exchanges."
22,f5,f7f5,1rbq1rk1/p1p1b1pp/2pp4/4pp2/1P2P3/P1NPPN1P/2P3P1/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 12,"Playing like Lasker who would play on both flanks. The text move seeks to break up the pawns in the centre if ignored by white, or develop a bishop if white exchanges."
23,exf5,e4f5,1rbq1rk1/p1p1b1pp/2pp4/4pP2/1P6/P1NPPN1P/2P3P1/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 12,"The bishop sits on a centralized position, but it could be pushed back by  the move g4 - which would cost white by opening up more space around the king. The bishop is bad for the moment due to the pawn structure."
24,Bxf5,c8f5,1r1q1rk1/p1p1b1pp/2pp4/4pb2/1P6/P1NPPN1P/2P3P1/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 13,"The bishop sits on a centralized position, but it could be pushed back by  the move g4 - which would cost white by opening up more space around the king. The bishop is bad for the moment due to the pawn structure."
25,Qd2,d1d2,1r1q1rk1/p1p1b1pp/2pp4/4pb2/1P6/P1NPPN1P/2PQ2P1/R3K2R b KQ - 1 13,"White seems to want 0-0-0, but is there time now?"
26,Bg5,e7g5,1r1q1rk1/p1p3pp/2pp4/4pbb1/1P6/P1NPPN1P/2PQ2P1/R3K2R w KQ - 2 14,The text move may not be the best. 13...Bh4  looks better due to 14. Nxh4 Qxh4  and white is out castling rights with a slight advantage for black. There is a slow controlling positional aspect to the text move that prevents the e pawn from moving at the moment.
