Well, the main reason is that driving back Black's King doesn't cure my weakness at b4 which can be attacked in two moves by Black's Knight. Strategically, the more important square for White's Knight is d4, attacking Black's own conspicuous weakling at c6 which can't be defended by Black's King except from d7, so that he gets driven back anyway, and farther away from the passed pawn White can create on the Kingside. And if I capture at c6, then b4 is defended at least for one critical tempo."
