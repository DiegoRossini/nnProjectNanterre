My main fear in playing this is the 3.Bb5+ line, which I have had very little experience with outside of blitz.
The lines with 3.d4 are also very good for White, and we'll see an example of this in this game.   Black is very uncomfortable early on and maybe was lucky to salvage a playable middlegame"
