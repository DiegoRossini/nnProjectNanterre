8,Bb4+,f8b4,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/1bBpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,"The Bishop check nets a pawn, but Black must tread softly on thin ice in order to achieve a tenable position, as there are several possible ways for White to obtain a clear advantage.  The counterattacking Two Knights Defense and solid Giuoco Piano offer Black a much better game."
9,c3,c2c3,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/1bBpP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"Here 6.O-O is possible, since 6...cxb2 7.Bxb2 gives White the ominous-looking Horwitz Bishops in a Danish Gambit position.  I prefer 6.bxc3 as it only gambits one pawn and forces Black to do something with his b4 Bishop."
10,dxc3,d4c3,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/1bB1P3/2p2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"Here 6.O-O is possible, since 6...cxb2 7.Bxb2 gives White the ominous-looking Horwitz Bishops in a Danish Gambit position.

11,bxc3,b2c3,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/1bB1P3/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"Black now has several continuations:
1) 6...Bf8? undevelops the Bishop.  That can't be good.
2) 6...Be7?? loses material after 7.Qd5 Nh6 8.Bxh6 O-O followed by retreating the Bishop.
3) 6...Bd6? blocks in Black's own pieces.
4) 6...Bc5? allows White a clear advantage after 7.Bxf7  Kxf7 8.Qd5  followed by Qxc5, and Black cannot castle.
5) 6...Ba5 is the only real try, but White gets a strong position after 7.O-O.
6) 6...Qf6 is an interesting try, but White can force matters with 7.Bg5 Bxc3  8.Kf1! Bxa1 9.Bxf6 Bxf6 10.e5! Bd8 (leaving e7 open for a Knight) 11.Qd5 Nh6.  Although Black is ahead in material with a position that's somewhat difficult to attack, White does enjoy the Queen, better development, and control of the center.  White is slightly better.  I had Fritz 10 play both sides of this position and White eventually won with an accurately-played kingside attack."
12,Bd6,b4d6,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2nb4/8/2B1P3/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 7,"This move can hardly be recommended, as it interferes with natural development."
13,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2nb4/8/2B1P3/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 2 7,Here the routine 7...Nf6?? drops material after 8.e5 Nxe5 9.Nxe5 Bxe5 10.Re1 and 11.f4.  This convenient tactic is made possible by the poor placement of Black's dark-squared Bishop.
14,Nge7,g8e7,r1bqk2r/ppppnppp/2nb4/8/2B1P3/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 3 8,"A question mark.  The Black Queen is suffocating behind her pieces.  A better try would be 7...Qf6 and then ...Nge7 (similar to the main line of The Scotch Game), since Black is OK after 8.Bg5 Qg6.  Now White gets a powerful initiative!"
15,Ng5,f3g5,r1bqk2r/ppppnppp/2nb4/6N1/2B1P3/2P5/P4PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 4 8,"Without a Knight on f6, it's much easier for White to attack the kingside.  Here 8...O-O?? walks into 9.Qh5 h6 10.Nxf7 and huge material losses are inevitable [10...Qe8 leads to checkmate after 11.Nxh6  Kh8 (or 11...Kh7) 12.Nf7  Kg8 13.Qh8#].  Black's next move is forced."
