1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Well this is my third attempt at writing up a game. For many years the scandinavian defense was my standard response to 1.e4 but over the past year i have been learning the Sicillian and The Hyper Accelerated Dragon is one of the most logical Sicillians and difficult for white to get a definative edge, at the same time it is true it is hard to win with but given the chance black gets more than equality."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,So here goes the game starts in the standard way.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Natural move.
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,Indicating the Hyper accelerated Dragon. Black does not play d6 as if allowed will try to play d5 in one go and not lose the tempo.
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,This has to be the best move and has been seen in thousands of games.
6,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,Naturally
7,Nxd4,f3d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,There are many sidelines. Qxd4 is possible and playable as is c3.
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,Black challenges White for control of the central squares
9,c4,c2c4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/8/2PNP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,The Moroxcy Bind. One of the reasons why many Sicillian players stopped playing this line but the bind can be broken and the counterplay is available with the breaks a6 and b5 and in some lines just b5 on its own. I am actually very happy about playing against it because the play is slower and more manoevering rather than bang and crash tactics.
10,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppp1p/2n2np1/8/2PNP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,Hitting the e4 pawn hoping for e4-e5 When Qa5+ wins the pawn
11,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppp1p/2n2np1/8/2PNP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 6,Naturally White places his knight on the best square develops and defends has to be best.
12,d6,d7d6,r1bqkb1r/pp2pp1p/2np1np1/8/2PNP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,Sadly in this line i have to play d6 now. With the bind in place i have to give up my dreams of playing d5 in one go but now i am going to start counter attacking.
13,Be2,f1e2,r1bqkb1r/pp2pp1p/2np1np1/8/2PNP3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,Bishop e3 would have been met by Knight g4 so fairly natural to prevent that.
14,Nxd4,c6d4,r1bqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p1np1/8/2PnP3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,The Knight on d4 is a vital piece for White and now White starts to go wrong.
15,Qxd4,d1d4,r1bqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p1np1/8/2PQP3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 0 8,Obviously best
16,Bg7,f8g7,r1bqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PQP3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 1 9,Natural preparing a discovered attack on the queen.
17,Qd1,d4d1,r1bqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/2P1P3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 9,This move was definately wrong. Best was Bishop e3 as the bishop on g7 is not defended yet so did not have to worry yet about me moving my knight. The follow up would have been Queen d2 ready to force the way to h6.
18,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/2P1P3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 3 10,Natural development
19,O-O,e1g1,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/2P1P3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 4 10,Natural enough
20,Be6,c8e6,r2q1rk1/pp2ppbp/3pbnp1/8/2P1P3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 5 11,The counter attack begins
