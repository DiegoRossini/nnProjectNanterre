1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Nearly all my games on the Fast Ladder have been against lower-rated opposition whom I challenged because they were higher up the ladder, so in most I have been Black.  Recently, the tables have been turned on me as higher-rated played lower down the ladder have challenged me.  Here is one such challenge I survived by the skin of my teeth.  I open with 1.d4, which has recently been my habit against higher-rated players."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Black replies with the Albin Counter-Gambit, a favourite of two of my colleagues at Didcot Chess Club. Despite several knockabout games at the club, I still don't know it."

5,dxe5,d4e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3pP3/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,This seems to be the principled response.
6,d4,d5d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/2Pp4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,This pawn is designed to be a thorn in White's front.
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4P3/2Pp4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"I hasten my development, attacking the pawn at the same time and inadvertently avoid the Lasker Trap: ""The careless move 4.e3? can lead to the Lasker Trap. After 4...Bb4+ 5.Bd2 dxe3 6.Bxb4?? is a blunder â€” 6...exf2+ 7.Ke2 fxg1=N+ and Black wins. The Lasker Trap is notable because it is rare to see an underpromotion as early as move 7.""

8,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/8/2p1P3/2Pp4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Black bolsters the pawn, establishing a powerful centre that I'm going to have to play around."
9,g3,g2g3,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/8/2p1P3/2Pp4/5NP1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"As mentioned, I decide to develop around the Black pawns, rather than challenge them directly with 5. e3 (The Lasker trap would no longer work because the pawn on c5 prevents 5...Bb4+).  Of 5. g3, Wikipedia says: ""Perhaps White's surest try for an advantage is to fianchetto his king bishop with 5.g3 followed by Bg2 and Nbd2. Black will often castle queenside. A typical continuation is 5.g3 Be6 6.Nbd2 Qd7 7.Bg2 0-0-0 8.0-0 Bh3."""
10,Be6,c8e6,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/4b3/2p1P3/2Pp4/5NP1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,"I diverge from Wikipedia's line, not that I was following it at the time (I'm just using it as reference for the annotation).  I think this move is in the Gameknot database, though.  It's consistent with my avoidance of 5. e3 and plan to fianchetto, defending the c4 pawn with another pawn."
