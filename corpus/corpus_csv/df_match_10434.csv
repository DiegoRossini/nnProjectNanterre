2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,Not the most usual move(most usual is d6) but it is the best move as well.(according to the chess database it is the only usual move that has a advantage for black)

5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"not the most usual move, it has played a little more then 6000 times on GK, Nc3 is played over 12000 times, but it has a little advantage for white instead of a little disadvantage(according to the Chessdatabase)"
6,Bb4+,f8b4,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,"This only 1078 times played on Gameknot. The more usual moves are b6 and d5. According to the chess database it is  a little disadvantageful for black and so I want to call it a bad move. However, all outcomes of the game are possible at the moment!!"
7,Bd2,c1d2,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/5N2/PP1BPPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 3 4,"Most usual is Nc3(1021 times). Bd2 is played 789 times. But Bd2 is more advantageful for white, if you may believe the chess database. 
By the way, this opening is called the Bogo-indian defence."
8,Qe7,d8e7,rnb1k2r/ppppqppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/5N2/PP1BPPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 4 5,"All possible moves are a little advantageful for white. This is the most usual, a little more usual than Bxd2, with a difference of 3 times. But according to the chess database, Bxd2 is a little more advantageful for white. So this is a better move.
By the way, this is the Nimzovich variation of that Bogo-indian defence."
9,Qa4,d1a4,rnb1k2r/ppppqppp/4pn2/8/QbPP4/5N2/PP1BPPPP/RN2KB1R b KQkq - 5 5,Most usual is g3(158 times played). There are five other moves that are more usual than this one. This one is played 3 times. But it is the most advantageful one for white. I didnt look in the chess database when I played this move. I dont know exactly why I played this.
10,Bxd2+,b4d2,rnb1k2r/ppppqppp/4pn2/8/Q1PP4/5N2/PP1bPPPP/RN2KB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Now he takes my bishop. All three times this is played on GK, black took the bishop!!"
11,Nbxd2,b1d2,rnb1k2r/ppppqppp/4pn2/8/Q1PP4/5N2/PP1NPPPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"All three players of whit have done this. The king stays in his shelter on this way, the moving knight is more active, and the other knight stays active and is defended now."
12,O-O,e8g8,rnb2rk1/ppppqppp/4pn2/8/Q1PP4/5N2/PP1NPPPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 1 7,"He thought, this is a good moment to do the rochade. I think so. All 3 players in the chess database have done this."
13,e4,e2e4,rnb2rk1/ppppqppp/4pn2/8/Q1PPP3/5N2/PP1N1PPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 0 7,"1 player did e4, 2 players did e3. The e4-player has wonnen the game, The first e3-player loosed and the other e3-player has wonnen the game.
I cant explain why everyone has played with the e-pawn. Maybe it is a kind of challenge to the black knight. It is also a preparing of the offer in the next move."
14,d6,d7d6,rnb2rk1/ppp1qppp/3ppn2/8/Q1PPP3/5N2/PP1N1PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 0 8,"This is the preparing of the offer. That player in the database was more aggressive, he did d5. So this is the end of the things I say about the chess database. Starting with this move it is an original game on GK."
15,e5,e4e5,rnb2rk1/ppp1qppp/3ppn2/4P3/Q1PP4/5N2/PP1N1PPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 0 8,Making a fork between pawn and knight and offering the pawn in this way.

18,Nfd7,f6d7,rnb2rk1/pppnqppp/4p3/4P3/Q1P5/5N2/PP1N1PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 1 10,"Of course the knight is running away.(and in this way he treats my pawn, that is undefended)"
19,Qa5,a4a5,rnb2rk1/pppnqppp/4p3/Q3P3/2P5/5N2/PP1N1PPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 2 10,Defending my pawn
