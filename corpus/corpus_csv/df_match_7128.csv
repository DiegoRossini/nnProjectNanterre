1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I don't usually annotate my losses publicly but I feel I need to publish this one in order to sublimate the experience!  My opponent reduced me to paralysis and then converted his positional advantage into material superiority with inevitable mate to follow.  He kicked off with the English Opening.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"I responded with this flexible reply, intending a King's Indian formation."
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 2,The Saemisch Variation of the KID.

5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,The Saemisch Variation of the KID.
6,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,The Saemisch Variation of the KID.
7,e4,e2e4,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,The Saemisch Variation of the KID.
8,d6,d7d6,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,The Saemisch Variation of the KID.
9,f3,f2f3,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2P2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,The Saemisch Variation of the KID.
10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2P2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR w KQ - 1 6,"This seems a sensible developing move, given that the QB has nowhere useful to go at present."
11,Be3,c1e3,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N1BP2/PP4PP/R2QKBNR b KQ - 2 6,"This seems a sensible developing move, given that the QB has nowhere useful to go at present."
12,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bq1rk1/pppnppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N1BP2/PP4PP/R2QKBNR w KQ - 3 7,"This seems a sensible developing move, given that the QB has nowhere useful to go at present."
13,Bd3,f1d3,r1bq1rk1/pppnppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2NBBP2/PP4PP/R2QK1NR b KQ - 4 7,"White develops his minor pieces behind his wall of pawns: a very flexible formation, slightly more aggressively placed than Black's.  This bishop development might have been less attractive had Black played 6...Nc6 because Black could then have harassed the B with ...Nb4."
14,e5,e7e5,r1bq1rk1/pppn1pbp/3p1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2NBBP2/PP4PP/R2QK1NR w KQ - 0 8,Black attacks White's centre: a typical KID move.
15,Nge2,g1e2,r1bq1rk1/pppn1pbp/3p1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2NBBP2/PP2N1PP/R2QK2R b KQ - 1 8,Discourages White from playing Nb5 but weakens b6.
16,a6,a7a6,r1bq1rk1/1ppn1pbp/p2p1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2NBBP2/PP2N1PP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 9,Discourages White from playing Nb5 but weakens b6.
17,O-O,e1g1,r1bq1rk1/1ppn1pbp/p2p1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2NBBP2/PP2N1PP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 9,"The reason why Black played 8... a6, since this move weakens d6.  Black wanted to cement the centre and then attack it from the flanks."
18,c5,c7c5,r1bq1rk1/1p1n1pbp/p2p1np1/2p1p3/2PPP3/2NBBP2/PP2N1PP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 10,"The reason why Black played 8... a6, since this move weakens d6.  Black wanted to cement the centre and then attack it from the flanks."
19,d5,d4d5,r1bq1rk1/1p1n1pbp/p2p1np1/2pPp3/2P1P3/2NBBP2/PP2N1PP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 10,"This pawn proves to be a real thorn in Black's centre.  This is a common pawn formation in the KID, so I doubt that Black has made his decisive error yet but his position deteriorates fast now, so look out for errors over the next few moves.  White applies a vice to the position."
20,Ne8,f6e8,r1bqnrk1/1p1n1pbp/p2p2p1/2pPp3/2P1P3/2NBBP2/PP2N1PP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 1 11,"Black plans to assault the centre with ...f5.  The alternative way of achieving this was 10...Nh5, which puts a dim knight on the rim but at least does not cramp Black's position."
21,Ng3,e2g3,r1bqnrk1/1p1n1pbp/p2p2p1/2pPp3/2P1P3/2NBBPN1/PP4PP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 2 11,"White's natural response, already planned for when he played 8.Nge2.  White might not have wanted to play this after 10... Nh5"

23,a4,a2a4,r1bqnrk1/1p3pbp/pn1p2p1/2pPp3/P1P1P3/2NBBPN1/1P4PP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 12,White threatens to push the N back again
24,Rb8,a8b8,1rbqnrk1/1p3pbp/pn1p2p1/2pPp3/P1P1P3/2NBBPN1/1P4PP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 1 13,"Black finds a somewhat passive response, planning to retreat the attacked N to a8.  Perhaps 12....Bd7 followed by ...Nc8 might have been better?  However, I generally find that ...Bd7 is a mistake whenever I play it in the KID.  Therefore I think 12....a5 would have been better."
25,a5,a4a5,1rbqnrk1/1p3pbp/pn1p2p1/P1pPp3/2P1P3/2NBBPN1/1P4PP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 13,Only one of Black's pieces is off the back rank.  This cannot be good at this stage of the game.
26,Na8,b6a8,nrbqnrk1/1p3pbp/p2p2p1/P1pPp3/2P1P3/2NBBPN1/1P4PP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 1 14,Only one of Black's pieces is off the back rank.  This cannot be good at this stage of the game.

28,Nac7,a8c7,1rbqnrk1/1pn2pbp/p2p2p1/P1pPp3/Q1P1P3/2NBBPN1/1P4PP/R4RK1 w - - 3 15,"a8 was such an awful square for the N, I felt it more important to redevelop it than to play the planned ...f5"
29,b4,b2b4,1rbqnrk1/1pn2pbp/p2p2p1/P1pPp3/QPP1P3/2NBBPN1/6PP/R4RK1 b - - 0 15,"This accentuates the weaknesses in Black's position.  If Black allows White to exchange pawns on c5, White simply wins the pawn and then the exchange as the Rf8 cannot move.  If Black exchanges on b4, White can play Bb6, pinning the Nc7 against Black's Q"
