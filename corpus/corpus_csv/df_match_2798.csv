18,Qc8,d8c8,rnq2rk1/pbppbp1p/1p2p1p1/3nP3/3PQ3/P2B1N2/1PP2PPP/RNB2RK1 w - - 1 10,The knight is not pinned any longer. But the DSB has lost the queen's protection.
19,Bg5,c1g5,rnq2rk1/pbppbp1p/1p2p1p1/3nP1B1/3PQ3/P2B1N2/1PP2PPP/RN3RK1 b - - 2 10,Bh6 was another candidate move but I thought that the rook on f8 blocked the black king and white's plan is to attack the king straight away as most black pieces are on the queenside. White has to bring his queen on h4 to have two possibilities of attack : e7 (with the  assistance of the DSB) or h7 (with the help of the f knight which could come on g5 if black plays Nxg5 or if white Bxe7).

White's b knight is still in his garage but I do not want to let the initiative to black and the 4 pieces aiming at black's kingside (not counting the e pawn) seems to be enough. So white launches his attack.
