1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Been a long time since I've played actively in chess because of exams and real life but I'm getting myself back into the game slowly. It will take awhile for me to reclaim the 1600+ rating I lost through timeouts, especially isnce it will take a fair few games for me to really get back into the game! With this game...well, nothing special, basically I get crushed! :P"

16,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk2r/p4ppp/2p2n2/n1b1p1N1/B7/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 9,Castling on both sides - it ought to be safe for White I think with correct play but I can safely say that after this game I don't know as much about this opening than I need to!
17,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk2r/p4ppp/2p2n2/n1b1p1N1/B7/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 3 9,Castling on both sides - it ought to be safe for White I think with correct play but I can safely say that after this game I don't know as much about this opening than I need to!
18,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/p4ppp/2p2n2/n1b1p1N1/B7/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 4 10,Castling on both sides - it ought to be safe for White I think with correct play but I can safely say that after this game I don't know as much about this opening than I need to!
19,a3,a2a3,r1bq1rk1/p4ppp/2p2n2/n1b1p1N1/B7/P7/1PPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 0 10,Eyeing b4 - I think this is where things start to go wrong for me. I become obsessed with that pawn fork when really it was never going to work in the first place!
20,Qd4,d8d4,r1b2rk1/p4ppp/2p2n2/n1b1p1N1/B2q4/P7/1PPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 1 11,The pressure on f2 will be highly significant later on!
21,Nc3,b1c3,r1b2rk1/p4ppp/2p2n2/n1b1p1N1/B2q4/P1N5/1PPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 2 11,"Advancing e4, which basically leaves my g5 knight stranded..."
22,e4,e5e4,r1b2rk1/p4ppp/2p2n2/n1b3N1/B2qp3/P1N5/1PPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 12,"Advancing e4, which basically leaves my g5 knight stranded..."
23,b4,b2b4,r1b2rk1/p4ppp/2p2n2/n1b3N1/BP1qp3/P1N5/2PP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 12,? Re1/d3 was better. There are key problems with my position I am already missing - such as how the queen attacks a4 should the b4 pawn be moved and the pin on the knight protecting it - in short my pawn fork really threatens nothing!
24,h6,h7h6,r1b2rk1/p4pp1/2p2n1p/n1b3N1/BP1qp3/P1N5/2PP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 13,! Of course...
25,Ngxe4,g5e4,r1b2rk1/p4pp1/2p2n1p/n1b5/BP1qN3/P1N5/2PP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 13,Instead of Nh3 which would allow Black to weaken my kingside I attack the pawn...
26,Nxe4,f6e4,r1b2rk1/p4pp1/2p4p/n1b5/BP1qn3/P1N5/2PP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 14,My rook is unguarded of course but White still has a game after 14...Qxa1 15.Nxc5 Nc4 16.Bxc6 Rb8 17.d3
27,Nxe4,c3e4,r1b2rk1/p4pp1/2p4p/n1b5/BP1qN3/P7/2PP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 14,My rook is unguarded of course but White still has a game after 14...Qxa1 15.Nxc5 Nc4 16.Bxc6 Rb8 17.d3
28,Qxe4,d4e4,r1b2rk1/p4pp1/2p4p/n1b5/BP2q3/P7/2PP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 15,Black chooses this move instead
29,Re1,f1e1,r1b2rk1/p4pp1/2p4p/n1b5/BP2q3/P7/2PP1PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - - 1 15,"I think I ought to have taken the bishop at this point - Black would be winning in the resulting positing but I would still have had reason to play on! Instead, I'm thinking that I can be clever here...."
30,Qd4,e4d4,r1b2rk1/p4pp1/2p4p/n1b5/BP1q4/P7/2PP1PPP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 2 16,....famous last words!
31,c3,c2c3,r1b2rk1/p4pp1/2p4p/n1b5/BP1q4/P1P5/3P1PPP/R1BQR1K1 b - - 0 16,?? Bad! Very bad! I think I can survive the attack on f2 - that Black has nothing that can exploit the weakened position that will come and that I can easily drive the queen away...
32,Qxf2+,d4f2,r1b2rk1/p4pp1/2p4p/n1b5/BP6/P1P5/3P1qPP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 0 17,Queens...funny you should mention them...
33,Kh1,g1h1,r1b2rk1/p4pp1/2p4p/n1b5/BP6/P1P5/3P1qPP/R1BQR2K b - - 1 17,!! Goodnight White! If I want to play on I play without my queen - 18.Bc2 Bxd1 is best but of course completely losing! I resign after my next move after spending about 15 minutes considering how Re8 after Qxg4 leads to my doom while overlooking the obvious move!
34,Bg4,c8g4,r4rk1/p4pp1/2p4p/n1b5/BP4b1/P1P5/3P1qPP/R1BQR2K w - - 2 18,!! Goodnight White! If I want to play on I play without my queen - 18.Bc2 Bxd1 is best but of course completely losing! I resign after my next move after spending about 15 minutes considering how Re8 after Qxg4 leads to my doom while overlooking the obvious move!
35,Qxg4,d1g4,r4rk1/p4pp1/2p4p/n1b5/BP4Q1/P1P5/3P1qPP/R1B1R2K b - - 0 18,"The computer analysis I have for this game hasn't been completed yet but when it does I suspect that it'll identify my first inaccuracy back at move 10 - if not, move 12! All the same, it is clear I need to know more about this particular opening as well as sharpen up my tactics in general! Still, watch this space - gonna be getting my rating back some way or another! :)"
