6,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk1nr/ppppbppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,Be3 becomes Hungarian Defence.
7,c3,c2c3,r1bqk1nr/ppppbppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,"White is planning to convert this in Ruy Lopes as his plan is to move his Bishop to b5.  The game would progress as a6, Ba4, b5, Bb3, Na5 and Bc2.  So to make the space to Bishop, move c3 is essential or else Black will capture the White's Bishop and will create the weakness by creating double pawn on 'b' file as White will have to capture the Knight by one of his a2 or c2 pawn."
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/2n2n2/4p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 5,Normal development move.  Also preaparing for King side castling.
9,Bd3,c4d3,r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/2PB1N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 5,"This move is a violation of chess opening principles that in the opening stage one should not move the same piece twice unless the development of all the pieces is complete.  Bc4 to Bd3 also doesn't show any further game plan.  In chess, each move must have some purpose or game plan i.e., either development, attack, pin, fork etc.  It will be seen further that how this single move slowed down White's development."
10,d5,d7d5,r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/2n2n2/3pp3/4P3/2PB1N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,d5 has two purposes.  One is a development move and opening the diagonal of Bishop at c8.  Another purpose is if white doesn't play e4xd5 then to take e4 pawn with d5 pawn and fork White's Knight & Bishop with a pawn.  White has to loose a piece as after d5xe4 the knight at f6 is supporting e4 square.
11,exd5,e4d5,r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/2n2n2/3Pp3/8/2PB1N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,White correctly plays e4xd5.
12,Nxd5,f6d5,r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/2n5/3np3/8/2PB1N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"By playing knf6xd5, another chess principle is followed i.e., never bring out Queen at the early stage of the game unless it is creating mating threat.  If Queen comes out at d5, White can simply develop his game by attacking the Queen with Bc4 or b3 etc and Black has no option but to move the Queen all over the board to save itself from attack.  This will result in complete development of White's pieces and Black's development will be completely hampered due to Queen's continuous movement."
13,Be4,d3e4,r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/2n5/3np3/4B3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,Be4 has resulted Bishop's 3 moves from opening.  It means White has lost 2 opportunities of developing his other pieces.  Whereas Black is about to complete the development of all pieces by moving Bishop at c8 and then kingside castle.  The violation of opening principle of chess of not moving the same piece again and again unless the development is completed is causing troubles in white's development.
14,Be6,c8e6,r2qk2r/ppp1bppp/2n1b3/3np3/4B3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 8,"This is most ideal situation for black as his entire development except castling is complete.  At present their is no threat to Black's king and hence Black has an option to develop the game further and do the castling either at Kingside or Queen side depending on situation.  White's Bishop and Knight at c1 and b1 are not yet developed.  In fact, white always need to maintain the first move advantage."
15,O-O,e1g1,r2qk2r/ppp1bppp/2n1b3/3np3/4B3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 3 8,"This is most ideal situation for black as his entire development except castling is complete.

18,Nf6,d5f6,r3k2r/pppqbppp/2n1bn2/4p3/4B3/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 10,"This is first time that Black's Knight has moved twice but it is perfectly fine as f6 is a natural square for g8 knight.  The previous move of knight i.e., f6xd5 was for capturing the pawn and to avoid bringing Queen on the open board at the early stage of the game."
19,Bg5,c1g5,r3k2r/pppqbppp/2n1bn2/4p1B1/4B3/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 2 10,Finally White's long awaited Bishop is developed.  Black do not want his knight to be pinned for long and hence White's Bishop is attacked by h6.
20,h6,h7h6,r3k2r/pppqbpp1/2n1bn1p/4p1B1/4B3/2PP1N2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 0 11,Finally White's long awaited Bishop is developed.  Black do not want his knight to be pinned for long and hence White's Bishop is attacked by h6.
21,Be3,g5e3,r3k2r/pppqbpp1/2n1bn1p/4p3/4B3/2PPBN2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 1 11,"Now again a violation of Chess principle by taking back Bishop at e3.  Remember that White's knight at b1 is not yet developed but by playing Bishop to g5 allowed Black to develop his pawn at h6.  Pawn at h6 is very important move for Black if he intent to castle king side.  If White would not have played Bishop to g5, then black would have spent one move in future for playing h6.  However, here White himself is helping Black to develop his game by violating the principles."
22,O-O-O,e8c8,2kr3r/pppqbpp1/2n1bn1p/4p3/4B3/2PPBN2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - - 2 12,"Now by castling, Black's development is technically completed in all respects.  Black's all pieces are active on Board and king is placed at safe place by castling.  Now Black has an advantage of deciding further game plan and white is still struggling for development."
23,Bxc6,e4c6,2kr3r/pppqbpp1/2B1bn1p/4p3/8/2PPBN2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b - - 0 12,"Now again, this was completely unwarranted move as White's Knight at b1 is still not developed.  Since White's knight is not developed, White's Rook at a1 cant move and the ideal concept of connected Rooks is not possible for White.  White's Bishop is moved 4th time in the game without completion of development."
24,Qxc6,d7c6,2kr3r/ppp1bpp1/2q1bn1p/4p3/8/2PPBN2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - - 0 13,"After queen captures Bishop, White's knight finally moves at 13th move of the game.  Self invited underdevelopment and giving the opponent an edge over the game. Also Knight's move at d2 is wrong as it is taking away Queen's protection to d3 pawn.  Black can now capture the free pawn at d3 by its Rook at d8.  What a blunder.  This is what happens if the pieces are not developed at the opening stage.  Here now White do not have any game plan and he want to take out his knight.  He cant take out his knight at a3 as Black will capture it with it's Bishop at e7 thereby creating weakness for White as White need to capture Bishop with its b2 pawn resulting in Double Pawn."
25,Nbd2,b1d2,2kr3r/ppp1bpp1/2q1bn1p/4p3/8/2PPBN2/PP1N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 13,"After queen captures Bishop, White's knight finally moves at 13th move of the game.

26,Bf5,e6f5,2kr3r/ppp1bpp1/2q2n1p/4pb2/8/2PPBN2/PP1N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 2 14,"Black doesn't capture the pawn at d3 with his Rook as it is possible that White will attack the Rook with it's Queen and then Black will probably have to take back the Rook at d8 thereby loosing one move and allowing White to develop his Queen.  So White's pawn is double attacked by Black's Bishop and Rook.  Black has given up his pawn at e5 as his intention is to attack and break open the center by capturing d3 pawn.  Also if White captures e5 pawn, it gives Black an open file for his Rook.  Remember, Rooks are very powerful in open files and for positioning it correctly pawn sacrifice is worth. Also if White captures the pawn Black can bring his queen into attack i.e., 3rd attack on d3 pawn and then it would become impossible for White to hold on the center and Black would be in complete control of the center."
27,Nxe5,f3e5,2kr3r/ppp1bpp1/2q2n1p/4Nb2/8/2PPB3/PP1N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 14,White is happy to capture free pawn at e5 as expected.
28,Qd5,c6d5,2kr3r/ppp1bpp1/5n1p/3qNb2/8/2PPB3/PP1N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 1 15,"Black continues with the game plan of concentrating on the center.  By moving Queen to d5, Black is also protecting a Knight fork at f7 on both Black's Rooks."
29,d4,d3d4,2kr3r/ppp1bpp1/5n1p/3qNb2/3P4/2P1B3/PP1N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 15,White trying to hold the center.  Here it should be noted that Black's Queen is also eyeing on a2 pawn and White must protect that pawn with his Rook.  Most unwanted situation for white that a very strong piece like Rook is occupied in protecting a simple pawn.
