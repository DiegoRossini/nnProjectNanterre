1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Hello everybody! I liked that game a lot so i decided to annotate it! Please feel free to comment and rate! I started with d4.
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"He played d5, good move though i would played Nf6."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,c4 then.....
4,dxc4,d5c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2pP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,And he accepted the pawn....
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2pP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,So far it's good for both.
6,b5,b7b5,rnbqkbnr/p1p1pppp/8/1p6/2pP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,b5 i think is quite risky and holds him back in development.....
7,a4,a2a4,rnbqkbnr/p1p1pppp/8/1p6/P1pP4/5N2/1P2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,a4 is logical reply...
8,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/p3pppp/2p5/1p6/P1pP4/5N2/1P2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,c6? i think is quite worthless move. e6 or Nf6 would be better i guess...
9,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/p3pppp/2p5/1p6/P1pP4/4PN2/1P3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,i was wondering between e3 and e4 but i played e3.
10,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkbnr/p3pppp/2p5/1p6/P1pP2b1/4PN2/1P3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,He opened his bishop...
11,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qkbnr/p3pppp/2p5/1p6/P1pP2b1/2N1PN2/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 6,I wanted to develop all my pieces...
12,a6,a7a6,rn1qkbnr/4pppp/p1p5/1p6/P1pP2b1/2N1PN2/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,a6 is bad i think....The king's side is still unorganized...
13,axb5,a4b5,rn1qkbnr/4pppp/p1p5/1P6/2pP2b1/2N1PN2/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,i decided to take the pawn...
14,cxb5,c6b5,rn1qkbnr/4pppp/p7/1p6/2pP2b1/2N1PN2/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,He took it too...I'm a pawn down but i'm doing better in development...
15,Be2,f1e2,rn1qkbnr/4pppp/p7/1p6/2pP2b1/2N1PN2/1P2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 8,i wanted to rooke so i opened the bishop..
16,Bxf3,g4f3,rn1qkbnr/4pppp/p7/1p6/2pP4/2N1Pb2/1P2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,We exchanged the pieces...Now his rook is in danger!
17,Bxf3,e2f3,rn1qkbnr/4pppp/p7/1p6/2pP4/2N1PB2/1P3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 9,We exchanged the pieces...Now his rook is in danger!
18,Ra7,a8a7,1n1qkbnr/r3pppp/p7/1p6/2pP4/2N1PB2/1P3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQk - 1 10,So he moved it....His pieces and generally his defence is disorganized and he's back in development...
19,O-O,e1g1,1n1qkbnr/r3pppp/p7/1p6/2pP4/2N1PB2/1P3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b k - 2 10,i rooked
20,f6,f7f6,1n1qkbnr/r3p1pp/p4p2/1p6/2pP4/2N1PB2/1P3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w k - 0 11,f6? Another bad move....He's blocking his knight and opens the white line too...
21,d5,d4d5,1n1qkbnr/r3p1pp/p4p2/1p1P4/2p5/2N1PB2/1P3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b k - 0 11,I think d5 was the best move to do...
