1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"King's Pawn followed by my standard response, the Sicilian Defence.  King's Pawn has always been my favourite opening move for White, I think it avoids the slow manoeuvring type of games which I generally dislike."

19,Qa4+,d1a4,r1b1kb1r/p1q1pppp/5n2/3P4/Q1Pp4/8/PP3PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 2 10,"I preferred Qxd4 here, gaining White another piece of material and defending the vulnerable c4 pawn.  Qa4 was a fairly pointless check, easily defended with. . ."
20,Bd7,c8d7,r3kb1r/p1qbpppp/5n2/3P4/Q1Pp4/8/PP3PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 3 11,"Bd7, which forces the Queen to retreat."
21,Qb4,a4b4,r3kb1r/p1qbpppp/5n2/3P4/1QPp4/8/PP3PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 4 11,I think Qb3 was slightly better here. I see an opportunity to quickly. . .

26,Nxd5,f6d5,r3kb1r/p2b1ppp/4p3/3n4/2qp1Q2/8/PP3PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 0 14,That places me in front in material and places another threat on White's poor bullied Queen.
