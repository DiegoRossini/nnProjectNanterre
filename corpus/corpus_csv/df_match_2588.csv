Move 1- Book opening pawn E4"
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,c5. I opened Book Sicilian defense c5
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Book NF3
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,Book d6
5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 3,Book Bc4 it appears white is playing the Italian game opening putting pressure on the weak f6 square.
6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/3pp3/2p5/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,e6. I chose to play e6 to prevent kf6-combination attack and to also open diagonal for future bishop development.
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/3pp3/2p5/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,kc3. White plays book Nc6 development threatening the d5 and b5 squares respectively.
8,a6,a7a6,rnbqkbnr/1p3ppp/p2pp3/2p5/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,book a6. This move is in preparation to develop Nc6 without having to worry about being the king being pinned by Bb5 should white choose. Also preparing to force the white bishop to retreat off the positionally valuable long diagonal facing my weak f7 pawn.
9,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/1p3ppp/p2pp3/2p5/2BPP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,d4. White plays book d4- thrust to the center in attempt to take the center of the board.
10,b5,b7b5,rnbqkbnr/5ppp/p2pp3/1pp5/2BPP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,I played b5 to attack the white bishop and force him off the valuable long diagonal. This also prepares me to develop bishop b7 to attack white square g2 expecting white to castle king side.
11,Be2,c4e2,rnbqkbnr/5ppp/p2pp3/1pp5/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,White retreats bishop to e2 fearing being kicked again if my response would be c4 as opposed to cxd4. Other options lead the white bishop to a trap if b3 and nulls all previous development and prohibits king side castling if f1
12,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/5ppp/p2pp3/1p6/3pP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,cxd4. I chose cxd4 to disrupt whites strong central position and to potentially open new future attack lanes specifically placing the black queen on either b6 or c7 if the opportunity presents itself.
13,Qxd4,d1d4,rnbqkbnr/5ppp/p2pp3/1p6/3QP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 0 7,Qxd4.This move I feel was a mistake and set the president for the failures of white in this game. I believe that white wanted to start out on an aggressive footing. Taking d4 with the queen technically stymies the development of the black bishop ex: if Be7 then QxG7 - BF6. I may be one pawn down material but I would have no viable place to castle and it would be a loosing game . Other reasons for this move I believe is to add pressure to the weak pawn on d6 by future castling and preparing to move rd1. This would become a liability to me and would make development difficult.
14,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/5ppp/p1npp3/1p6/3QP3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 1 8,Nc6. Simple development move that fulfills multiple purposes e6 d4 b4 and a5 are now controlled by black and now while is forced to retreat the queen back to a square that is not a grave threat to the future of blacks king side safety g7.  Most importantly this simple move has shifted the initiative from white to black which is especially not good when white is trying to aggressively take position.
15,Qd2,d4d2,r1bqkbnr/5ppp/p1npp3/1p6/4P3/2N2N2/PPPQBPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 2 8,Qd2. Queen moves back to d2 still hoping to overpower the weak pawn on the d file in the future. This square also allows the white queen to get into action with my king side if an opportunity presents itself. All in all probably the best possible response to the threat of my knight.
16,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/5ppp/p1nppn2/1p6/4P3/2N2N2/PPPQBPPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 3 9,Nf6. Simple development move kf6 attempting to prepare for castling and wanting to take further control of the wavering white center.
17,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkb1r/5ppp/p1nppn2/1p6/4P3/2N2N2/PPPQBPPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 4 9,O-O While castles king side The obvious choice for white who wants to get king side safety along with the ability to move rd6 in the future should it prove viable.
18,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/4bppp/p1nppn2/1p6/4P3/2N2N2/PPPQBPPP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 5 10,Be7. Simple development move enabling king side castling and preventing a potential pin that may hamper future development.
19,Qg5,d2g5,r1bqk2r/4bppp/p1nppn2/1p4Q1/4P3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 6 10,Qg5. Knowing that I will not play kxe4 white plays aggressive move Qg5 threatening blacks weak spot square g7. This also puts the queen in a prime place to attack once castling happens by controlling the g file whilst hoping in the future to play Bh6 for an extreme threat to black.
20,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/4bppp/p1nppn2/1p4Q1/4P3/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 7 11,O-O. the only good move on the board. Playing g6 would protect this vulnerable pawn but the response would be Qh6. This would cut off the king on the diagonal  and prevent  castling whilst making a much weaker position overall.
