2,b6,b7b6,rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/1p6/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,White does ok with Nc3 here.
3,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/1p6/8/2P1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,White does ok with Nc3 here.

5,d3,d2d3,rn1qkbnr/pbpppppp/1p6/8/2P1P3/3P4/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"Pd3, however, seems to favor black in the database."
6,a5,a7a5,rn1qkbnr/1bpppppp/1p6/p7/2P1P3/3P4/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Pa5 is not in the database.  Black seems to do ok with Pe5 instead, but not many games with this variation are recorded in the database yet."
7,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qkbnr/1bpppppp/1p6/p7/2P1P3/2NP4/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,"Generally speaking returning a piece does not promote development.  Black would have been better off with Pe6 or Pe7 here, which lets the queen protect the knight.  Let white trade--white drops behind in development when the black queen advances into the field."

Better would be Re1.  White might also think BxPe5.  NxBg4, QxN, BxB.  We see black comes out ahead of white seizes that wayward pawn."
