1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"By creating this, I am hoping to learn some better moves from the veteren players and showing off a mediocre win against a player under 1000. It's been a while since I last played on gameknot...."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I don't like these openings. I am not comfortable with this opening.
3,Qe2,d1e2,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPPQPPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"My method for chess at the moment is to try to get as many pieces as I can. This may not work so well in higher chess matches, but it tends to work decently in the lower leagues. This move is an attempt to save my pawn, if he chooses to take it."
4,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4P3/8/PPPPQPPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 0 3,What is he trying to do here? Does he have a simular tactic as me?
5,d3,d2d3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4P3/3P4/PPP1QPPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 0 3,I knew that the right side of my board was covered by a row of pawns...it would be hard to try to attack in that situation.
6,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pp1p/2p3p1/3p4/4P3/3P4/PPP1QPPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"This move eventually costed him dearly when he had the momentum. I assume he is trying to take out his bishop, but I like the e4 move better."
7,h3,h2h3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pp1p/2p3p1/3p4/4P3/3P3P/PPP1QPP1/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"I've seen this used many times, and I thought I'd give it a try. This makes it hard for bishops (mostly) and other pieces to get close to the main part of my ""fleet""."
8,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk1nr/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/3p4/4P3/3P3P/PPP1QPP1/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 1 5,I saw this one coming.
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk1nr/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/3p4/4P3/2NP3P/PPP1QPP1/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 2 5,"This was a multi purpose move. It prevented that bishop from ever coming near my rook, and protected the pawn above the queen."
10,d4,d5d4,rnbqk1nr/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/8/3pP3/2NP3P/PPP1QPP1/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 0 6,Things went downhill from here.
11,Na4,c3a4,rnbqk1nr/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/8/N2pP3/3P3P/PPP1QPP1/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 1 6,"I didn't think it would be wise to move my knight back to where it came from. The only other logical choice was here. Unfortunatly, my lack of vision cost me."
12,Qa5+,d8a5,rnb1k1nr/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/q7/N2pP3/3P3P/PPP1QPP1/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 2 7,I don't like falling behind with pieces in chess matches. This made me very upset at myself.
13,c3,c2c3,rnb1k1nr/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/q7/N2pP3/2PP3P/PP2QPP1/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 0 7,"Was this the right thing to do? I wanted to try to gain a pawn after losing a knight to try to make the ""score"" more even. But I'm not sure if I saw that bishop."
14,Qxa4,a5a4,rnb1k1nr/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/8/q2pP3/2PP3P/PP2QPP1/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 0 8,Anticipated move.
15,b3,b2b3,rnb1k1nr/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/8/q2pP3/1PPP3P/P3QPP1/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 0 8,I wanted to be on the offensive. I wanted vengence in the form of chess pieces...
16,Qa6,a4a6,rnb1k1nr/pp2ppbp/q1p3p1/8/3pP3/1PPP3P/P3QPP1/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 1 9,An expected move.
17,cxd4,c3d4,rnb1k1nr/pp2ppbp/q1p3p1/8/3PP3/1P1P3P/P3QPP1/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 0 9,"As I said before, I wanted to gain back some pieces to even our score."
18,Bxd4,g7d4,rnb1k1nr/pp2pp1p/q1p3p1/8/3bP3/1P1P3P/P3QPP1/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 0 10,"This is where I actually started thinking. You see now that the bishop is not protected. If I move my bishop to the spot diagnal to the rook, I could scare it off and take down the rook. That would easily make up the loss."
19,Bb2,c1b2,rnb1k1nr/pp2pp1p/q1p3p1/8/3bP3/1P1P3P/PB2QPP1/R3KBNR b KQkq - 1 10,Done.
20,Bxb2,d4b2,rnb1k1nr/pp2pp1p/q1p3p1/8/4P3/1P1P3P/Pb2QPP1/R3KBNR w KQkq - 0 11,"It just depended on weather or not he cared about leaving his bishop alive, or saw my tactic."
