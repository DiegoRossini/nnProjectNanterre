I'd like to block the Q's view down the a7-g1 diagonal with my B but first I have to protect e3 with my Q.  To do this without interfering with my other B, I must first develop the KB then move my Q to e2.  Developing the KB to d3 also ensures that a black N coming to f5 to attack e3 can be swapped off, giving Black doubled pawns to match White's own."
