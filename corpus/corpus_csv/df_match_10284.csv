1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"I enter the final round of the Space City Open sitting on 2.5/4, and have a shot to tie for 2nd place should I win. My two wins so far have been relatively easy, and I realize that this game will be for real. My opponent, an actual adult, is rated almost 100 points higher than me, and I really need to beat him. I tell myself that since I have the white pieces, I should play with purpose and go for the throat. My buddy, who played this guy earlier and won, tells me that I should stick with the Queen's Gambit. He seems to think that holds the most promise for me. I've been playing 1. Nf3 a lot lately with really good results, and am hesitant to rock my own boat. Many times, 1. Nf3 can transpose into QG lines, but the Reti has been yielding me many good results over the last 4 months or so. I'm totally tortured as to what to open with. As my opponent and I shake hands, I still don't know what to play. He hits the clock to start the game, and I spend about 5 minutes on my first move. I'm finally reminded of the axiom my dad has said to me many times before - ""Dance with the one that brung ya"", and play 1. Nf3."
2,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,"I don't see this move at this stage too often, and decide that a transposition into the QG may be the best idea should he aim for a Kings Indian."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,...and I prepare myself to play against the KID.
4,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 3,...and I prepare myself to play against the KID.

6,f5,f7f5,rnbqk1nr/ppppp1bp/6p1/5p2/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Oh crap....these Dutch type setups make me want to hurl. I simply can't stand facing them. Unbeknownst to him, my opponent is winning a psychological battle."
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk1nr/ppppp1bp/6p1/5p2/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"Once again, an old axiom comes to mind....""When facing the uncomfortable in the opening, just play solid developing moves."""
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqk2r/ppppp1bp/5np1/5p2/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,I sense that the long light square diagonal seems primed for me to occupy it.
9,g3,g2g3,rnbqk2r/ppppp1bp/5np1/5p2/2PP4/2N2NP1/PP2PP1P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,I sense that the long light square diagonal seems primed for me to occupy it.
10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppppp1bp/5np1/5p2/2PP4/2N2NP1/PP2PP1P/R1BQKB1R w KQ - 1 6,"This move was played rather quickly, and I sense that my opponent is in his comfort zone. I tell myself to react sensibly, and don't give anything away in the opening. Just get developed, and look for weaknesses."
11,Bg2,f1g2,rnbq1rk1/ppppp1bp/5np1/5p2/2PP4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 2 6,"I see his LSB winding up on f7, and his Nb8 developing to d7."

15,Re1,f1e1,rnbq1rk1/ppp1p1b1/3p1npp/5p2/2PP4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQR1K1 b - - 1 8,Prepping e4.

23,Rb1,a1b1,1r1q1rk1/pppnpbb1/3p1npp/3P1p2/1PP5/2N2NP1/P1Q1PPBP/1RB1R1K1 b - - 2 12,"I'm thinking that he might, so I line up with him while removing my rook from a1 (where it may be vulnerable to attack from his DSB)."
24,Nb6,d7b6,1r1q1rk1/ppp1pbb1/1n1p1npp/3P1p2/1PP5/2N2NP1/P1Q1PPBP/1RB1R1K1 w - - 3 13,I didn't really anticipate this - though I should have. My c pawn is now vulnerable.
25,Na4,c3a4,1r1q1rk1/ppp1pbb1/1n1p1npp/3P1p2/NPP5/5NP1/P1Q1PPBP/1RB1R1K1 b - - 4 13,"?! As soon as my hand left the piece I see the tactic. I have played right into the strength of his Rb8. All is not lost though, as the pawn he will win is on the edge and impotent."
26,Nxc4,b6c4,1r1q1rk1/ppp1pbb1/3p1npp/3P1p2/NPn5/5NP1/P1Q1PPBP/1RB1R1K1 w - - 0 14,! Nice play which wins a pawn.
