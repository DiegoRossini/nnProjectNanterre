8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"Other moves are g6, e6, d6, but those moves may be played later."
9,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,defends e4
10,e6,e7e6,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,And so we have this variation. Its not the most common variation in the sicilian.
11,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"This is out of book, usually Ndb5 is played."
12,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/pp1pbppp/2n1pn2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 7,The computer likes this move though d6 is played much more.
13,Qd2,d1d2,r1bqk2r/pp1pbppp/2n1pn2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPPQ1PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 3 7,Getting ready to castle queenside and try to march with the kingside pawns. Here black can play an interesting tactic 7 ... Nxe4 8 Nxe4 Bxg5 9Nxg5 Nxd4 and black wins a pawn. We would then already be near the endgame.
14,h6,h7h6,r1bqk2r/pp1pbpp1/2n1pn1p/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPPQ1PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 8,attacks the bishop.

16,Bb4,e7b4,r1bqk2r/pp1p1pp1/2n1pn1p/8/1b1NP3/2N1B3/PPPQ1PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 2 9,"Maybe better is Ng4 and trade the knight for a bishop. That would probably be my move. This puts pressure on the e4, because after the trade on c3 its undefended."
17,Bd3,f1d3,r1bqk2r/pp1p1pp1/2n1pn1p/8/1b1NP3/2NBB3/PPPQ1PPP/R3K2R b KQkq - 3 9,Im thinking that tempo is everything here so I use the bishop here to protect the pawn.
18,Ne5,c6e5,r1bqk2r/pp1p1pp1/4pn1p/4n3/1b1NP3/2NBB3/PPPQ1PPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 4 10,"Still I like Ng4 more. But this is ok. But it doesn't threat anything serious yet. At least, I could not spot it."
19,f4,f2f4,r1bqk2r/pp1p1pp1/4pn1p/4n3/1b1NPP2/2NBB3/PPPQ2PP/R3K2R b KQkq - 0 10,"Tempo is everything, I already decide to move the kingside pawn with a bit of tempo."
20,Nxd3+,e5d3,r1bqk2r/pp1p1pp1/4pn1p/8/1b1NPP2/2NnB3/PPPQ2PP/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 11,Black takes my bishop with check.
21,Qxd3,d2d3,r1bqk2r/pp1p1pp1/4pn1p/8/1b1NPP2/2NQB3/PPP3PP/R3K2R b KQkq - 0 11,Queen takes.

23,e5,e4e5,r1bq1rk1/pp1p1pp1/4pn1p/4P3/1b1N1P2/2NQB3/PPP3PP/R3K2R b KQ - 0 12,"Advancing the pawn, this move stops the knight standing on f6, which is always the key feature of the defense on the kingside."
