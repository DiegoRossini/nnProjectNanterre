1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The queen pawn openings are the 2nd most popular openings behind king pawn.  1. d4 establishes a center pawn and prevents an early e5 reply from black.  The most notable characteristic is that the center pawn is protected from the beginning by the queen, unlike 1. e4."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"2...d4 and 2...Nf6 are the most popular responses, both preventing 2. e4 (which would give white a strong pawn center)."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"2. c4 is the most common continuation, attempting to remove black's center pawn with a flanking pawn.  However, Nf3 is also sound, further influencing the central squares and remaining flexible."
4,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"I often play an early c5, for the same reasons that white would play 2. c4.  I don't know how sound it is, but I've had good luck so far."
5,dxc5,d4c5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2Pp4/8/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"By taking the pawn, white gives up influence in the center.  As white already has a knight on f3, e5 can't be played immediately, but black intends to advance it as soon as possible."
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/2Pp4/8/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,Preparing for 4. e5.
7,g3,g2g3,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2n5/2Pp4/8/5NP1/PPP1PP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,Black's uncontested central pawns will influence the course of the game.
8,e5,e7e5,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n5/2Ppp3/8/5NP1/PPP1PP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,Black's uncontested central pawns will influence the course of the game.
9,Bg2,f1g2,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n5/2Ppp3/8/5NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,"A hypermodern staple, fianchettoed bishops are strong and influence the central squares from a distance.  Fianchetto itself means ""little flank"" in Italian.  The goal of a hypermodern opening is usually to delay occupying the central squares with pieces and try to destroy or undermine the opponent's center."
10,Bxc5,f8c5,r1bqk1nr/pp3ppp/2n5/2bpp3/8/5NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"Recapturing the pawn while developing the bishop to a strong diagonal, attacking the weak f2 pawn."
11,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk1nr/pp3ppp/2n5/2bpp3/8/5NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 6,Nge7 was played to avoid complications with 7. Bg5.
12,Nge7,g8e7,r1bqk2r/pp2nppp/2n5/2bpp3/8/5NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 7,Nge7 was played to avoid complications with 7. Bg5.
13,e3,e2e3,r1bqk2r/pp2nppp/2n5/2bpp3/8/4PNP1/PPP2PBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,"!? (Dubious move).

This seems to have been played to prevent d4 and take pressure off of the a7-g1 diagonal.  However, it weakens the white squares on the kingside and traps the dark bishop.

Any developing move would be better."
14,Bg4,c8g4,r2qk2r/pp2nppp/2n5/2bpp3/6b1/4PNP1/PPP2PBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 8,Taking advantage of the weakened d1-h5 diagonal to pin the knight.  Threatening to win the knight with e4.
15,Nc3,b1c3,r2qk2r/pp2nppp/2n5/2bpp3/6b1/2N1PNP1/PPP2PBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 2 8,"? (Bad move).

Something needed to be done to address the pinned knight, either by moving the queen or advancing the h pawn to threaten the attacking bishop."
16,e4,e5e4,r2qk2r/pp2nppp/2n5/2bp4/4p1b1/2N1PNP1/PPP2PBP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 9,Winning the knight.
17,b3,b2b3,r2qk2r/pp2nppp/2n5/2bp4/4p1b1/1PN1PNP1/P1P2PBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 9,"Perparing to develop the dark squared bishop, which is trapped by the e pawn.  A fianchettoed bishop is strong, expecially one pointing at the king, but again, the pinned knight needs to be addressed."
18,Ne5,c6e5,r2qk2r/pp2nppp/8/2bpn3/4p1b1/1PN1PNP1/P1P2PBP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 1 10,Adding pressure to the unfortunate knight.  There's no need to take it as the pin still hasn't been addressed.
19,h3,h2h3,r2qk2r/pp2nppp/8/2bpn3/4p1b1/1PN1PNPP/P1P2PB1/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 10,Finally forcing action.
20,Bxf3,g4f3,r2qk2r/pp2nppp/8/2bpn3/4p3/1PN1PbPP/P1P2PB1/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 11,"Nxf3  was considered, but ultimately abandoned as I couldn't find a good reply to 11. Kh1."
21,Bxf3,g2f3,r2qk2r/pp2nppp/8/2bpn3/4p3/1PN1PBPP/P1P2P2/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 11,The knight has a strong outpost as it can't be attacked by pawns and is protected by the e pawn.  Kasparov once said that a knight on the 6th (or 3rd) rank is equal to a rook.
22,Nxf3+,e5f3,r2qk2r/pp2nppp/8/2bp4/4p3/1PN1PnPP/P1P2P2/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 12,The knight has a strong outpost as it can't be attacked by pawns and is protected by the e pawn.  Kasparov once said that a knight on the 6th (or 3rd) rank is equal to a rook.
23,Kg2,g1g2,r2qk2r/pp2nppp/8/2bp4/4p3/1PN1PnPP/P1P2PK1/R1BQ1R2 b kq - 1 12,This is better than Kh1 as it protects the h3 pawn and allows the rook to move to h1 if needed.
