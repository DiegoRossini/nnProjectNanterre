http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Pawn_Game

The only thing I really want to point out is that the initial pawn is protected by the queen, so there's no fear of an immediate attack against the pawn."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"It's best to have a plan for developing your pieces to useful squares quickly.  The method both players use to do that is called the opening (I know that seems pretty basic).  

Try to concentrate of moving one or both central pawns to the center (top of the hill), develop both knights and bishops, and castle by move 10.  That takes 7 moves, leaving 3 for defending or retreating if a piece was moved too far out."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"The most common 2nd move seems to be c4, which is the Queen's Gambit.  This move is passive, in that it defends a piece that's already defended and not attacked, but is a good development move in preparation for castling kingside."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,Note that diagonal knights counter each other in the center.
5,e3,e2e3,r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3p4/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"This opens up the light squared bishop, but confines the dark squared bishop.  It's still defensive, in that the d4 pawn is now defended 3 times and attacked once."
6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3p4/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,"The 3rd rank on the c and f files, followed by the 2nd rank on the d and e files, is the best development spots for the knights.  The edge of the board reduces the number of squares they can move do, which greatly decreases their influence and power."
7,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/1B1p4/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 4,"The 5th rank is usually a good place to develop a bishop because of the immediate pin on the knight.  Whether or not you end up exchanging the pieces is a matter of preference, but the pin is what is important.

8,e6,e7e6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/1B1p4/3P4/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"Black should take immediate action to break the pin.  Recognizing, taking advantage of, and breaking pins are important skills to develop.  In this case, it's obvious that black wants castle, which would break the pin on the knight, but castling isn't fast enough..."
9,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/1B1p4/3P4/2N1PN2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,White should be looking at playing Ne5 to attack the pinned knight on c6.  That would force white to defend it again or risk losing material or a weakened pawn structure.
10,Bb4,f8b4,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/1B1p4/1b1P4/2N1PN2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 6,Black plays for a symmetrical position and pins white's knight.  Symmetrical positions tend to be better for the side with initiative (white at the beginning of the game).  This also opens up black's kingside for castling.
11,Ne5,f3e5,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/1B1pN3/1b1P4/2N1P3/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 6,Attacking the pinned knight.
12,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/1B1pN3/1b1P4/2N1P3/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 4 7,"Black castles to break the pin, but is a move too late.  Bd7 would have prevented any material loss, but white would then have the option of exchanging his knight for black's bishop."
13,Nxc6,e5c6,r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2N1pn2/1B1p4/1b1P4/2N1P3/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 7,White exchanges to win a pawn.
14,bxc6,b7c6,r1bq1rk1/p1p2ppp/2p1pn2/1B1p4/1b1P4/2N1P3/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 8,"White tries to break the pin on his knight by forcing the bishop to retreat.  Bd2 would have been better, since an exchange wouldn't result in a weakened pawn structure."
15,Bxc6,b5c6,r1bq1rk1/p1p2ppp/2B1pn2/3p4/1b1P4/2N1P3/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 8,"White tries to break the pin on his knight by forcing the bishop to retreat.  Bd2 would have been better, since an exchange wouldn't result in a weakened pawn structure."
16,Rb8,a8b8,1rbq1rk1/p1p2ppp/2B1pn2/3p4/1b1P4/2N1P3/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 1 9,"White tries to break the pin on his knight by forcing the bishop to retreat.  Bd2 would have been better, since an exchange wouldn't result in a weakened pawn structure."
17,a3,a2a3,1rbq1rk1/p1p2ppp/2B1pn2/3p4/1b1P4/P1N1P3/1PP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 9,"White tries to break the pin on his knight by forcing the bishop to retreat.  Bd2 would have been better, since an exchange wouldn't result in a weakened pawn structure."
18,Bxc3+,b4c3,1rbq1rk1/p1p2ppp/2B1pn2/3p4/3P4/P1b1P3/1PP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 10,Black exchanges rather than retreat.
19,bxc3,b2c3,1rbq1rk1/p1p2ppp/2B1pn2/3p4/3P4/P1P1P3/2P2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 10,"White's queenside pawn structure fragments.  Isolated and doubled pawns are usually considered weak.  Notice that no pawns can help support the a and c pawns on either side, so pieces must be used to defend them.  

Also note the open b file.  Both sides want them for control of the board, but black has already claimed this one with his rook, which will make it difficult for white to use it."
20,Ne4,f6e4,1rbq1rk1/p1p2ppp/2B1p3/3p4/3Pn3/P1P1P3/2P2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 1 11,"Ba6 would have been better, since it would have prevented white from castling and cramped white on both sides of the board.

Move 10 is when both sides should have developed all minor pieces and castled.  Black is a little further along and has a couple small advantages at this point (rook posted on the b file and a centralized knight)."
21,O-O,e1g1,1rbq1rk1/p1p2ppp/2B1p3/3p4/3Pn3/P1P1P3/2P2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 2 11,"c4 would have been a better move.  Black's d pawn is pinned to his knight, so he wouldn't be able to capture white's c pawn immediately, and white could untangle his doubled c pawns by exchanging one or both of them away.

If black decided to play 11...Nc3 anyway, 12. Qd3 would force Ne4, allowing 13. cxd5 exd5 14. c4, which forces Nf6 or wins a pawn."
22,Qf6,d8f6,1rb2rk1/p1p2ppp/2B1pq2/3p4/3Pn3/P1P1P3/2P2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 3 12,"Black seems to have an interesting plan here, but I don't see a way for him to do more than win white's f pawn.  

I think Bd7 is better, since it would force the exchange of white's active bishop and allow black to push his c pawn forward, either tripling and isolating white's c pawns, or pushing it to c4, to further weaken white's c pawns.  

Nxc3 is also an option if black wants to recover his pawn, but I think it's a wasted move."
23,Qf3,d1f3,1rb2rk1/p1p2ppp/2B1pq2/3p4/3Pn3/P1P1PQ2/2P2PPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 4 12,"f3 is better.  It would protect the prevent black from capturing on f2, force black's knight to give up his outpost, and support an e pawn advance in a few moves.  It would slightly weaken the king on g3 and along the a7-g1 diagonal, but since black already gave up his dark squared bishop, it's a minimal risk.

If black responds with Nxc3, then 13. Qd3 wins the knight."
