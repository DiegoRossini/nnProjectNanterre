Chessmaster's TheKing engine believes this an error when Qc2+ is a won game, but a ""won game"" can be an unbelievable uphill battle.  Having examined Qc5+, I cannot imagine how Qc2+ is an improvement.  I also doubt Chessmaster.  Sure it destroys me when I try to play it, but that is based on pure calculation speed.  When analyzing this game, there is a point later where its analysis is deeply flawed in a way that no decent human player would not recognize as being faulty."
