My guesses at this moment are it's going to be a closed one, coz he's more likely to play e5 to challenge my knight."

The idea is to reinforce f6, coz I'm planning to play f5 at some point to disrupt his potential attack on my weak h7 position. If he captures en-passant with e-pawn, then capturing with Nxf6 will reinforce h7."
