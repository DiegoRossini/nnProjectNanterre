1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Has anybody ever heard of Steve Backshall?  Well, he is a guy who just lurves chasing wild animals, although on occasions they chase him.  I found out about him from watching a Children's programme called CBBC with my six year old Charlotte and later played the CBBC game where Steve has to outrun bees, hippos and alligators - this game is called Steve's Deadly Dash.  In this MT in aid of the Christchurch Earthquake I am playing Master Janet.  Things seemed to be OK for me when suddenly Henry was subjected to a deadly dash from her rook and the Wicked Witch of the West.  Alas, Henry got caught and he had to rest up!  Anyhow, on with the game.  Gameknot Analysis is provided in the following link.http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15488483&fb=1&rnd=0.19786173690656117.  Janet kicks off with the English Opening - 1.c4."
