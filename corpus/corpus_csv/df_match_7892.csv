1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

This is an unrated game between myself and my buddy Steve from the Annotations Project.  This is my second Low Draw against Steve but this game did involve plenty of action.  I did temporarily have a pawn advantage in the game but unfortunately I was unable to keep it, although I did make sure that black did not have a remote queenside passer.  I then decided to liven things up a bit with an exchange sac.  This resulted in draw by perpetual check but if my opponent tried to avoid it then there were a few hidden traps.  Anyhow, on with the game, I kicked off with 1. e4 and he gave me the Robatsch Defense g6."
