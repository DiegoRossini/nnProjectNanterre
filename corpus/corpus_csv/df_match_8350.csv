1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

As part of a drive to do some further homework on Master Freddy, I thought I would look up some closely fought battles between him and players near his own rating.  I thought I would start with this one, which sadly was a loss for Freddy and try and see the purpose behind the moves and to spot any possible tactics and potential tactics in the position as the game progresses.  Hope you have a good read.  Freddy kicks off with e4 and his opponent responds with the Sicilian, c5."

His opponent eschews this for the movement and gets on with his development with Be7 after Freddy continues with his development by putting his dsb on e3.

Castling on opposite sides?  That seems to be standard practice in the Naijdorf and Dragon Sicilian.  This usually leads to pawn storms on both sides.  Who will cop Old Matey first I wonder?"

He chooses d5 as it is the most aggressive square and at least there are no pawns to drive it away.  This will trigger off an exchange though.

In my game Six Feet Under, my former IM opponent took advantage of this weakness.  I think Freddy is rather glad to see the back of black's lsb though.  It is very instructive to see how Freddy covers this weakness on d5."

It gives Freddy the option of moving his soon to be attacked horsie to c1 rather than completely on the rim on a1.  In the Sicilian Dragon or Naijdorf the c pawn is vulnerable to a pin by black's heavies on that open column so it is a good idea for Freddy to move his king off that line!
