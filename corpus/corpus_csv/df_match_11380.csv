1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,fairly standard type of opening - attacking my pawn and developing a piece.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,fairly standard type of opening - attacking my pawn and developing a piece.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,fairly standard type of opening - attacking my pawn and developing a piece.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,I could have used the queen's pawn to defend but chose to develop my Knight instead.
5,d3,d2d3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,securing white's King's pawn and opening a diagonal for the black square bishop
6,d6,d7d6,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,respond in kind
7,h3,h2h3,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/4P3/3P1N1P/PPP2PP1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"? questionable (slow) move.  It's only merit is it creates an escape square for the king should he castle on his side.  Too early to really need that though.
Better to developthe queen's knight or one of his bishops."
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4p3/4P3/3P1N1P/PPP2PP1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,I continue to develop my pieces.  This gives me better coverage of the centre of the board.
9,Bd2,c1d2,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4p3/4P3/3P1N1P/PPPB1PP1/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,still a very conservative developing move for his bishop - only one square.
10,Be6,c8e6,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2npbn2/4p3/4P3/3P1N1P/PPPB1PP1/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 3 6,Taking advantage of white's hesitancy I push for more room - usually black does not have this luxury.
11,Be2,f1e2,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2npbn2/4p3/4P3/3P1N1P/PPPBBPP1/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 4 6,Another conservative developing move.
12,d5,d6d5,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1bn2/3pp3/4P3/3P1N1P/PPPBBPP1/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 7,I decide to press early to try and achieve dominance over the centre.
13,Nc3,b1c3,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1bn2/3pp3/4P3/2NP1N1P/PPPBBPP1/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 7,At last the knight comes out.
14,dxe4,d5e4,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1bn2/4p3/4p3/2NP1N1P/PPPBBPP1/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 8,I go for the pawn exchange.  Note that if white re-captures with his knight it will be unsupported by a pawn which makes it vulnerable.
15,dxe4,d3e4,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1bn2/4p3/4P3/2N2N1P/PPPBBPP1/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 8,Pin that knight to a bishop (and potentially his king).
16,Bb4,f8b4,r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2n1bn2/4p3/1b2P3/2N2N1P/PPPBBPP1/R2QK2R w KQkq - 1 9,Pin that knight to a bishop (and potentially his king).
17,Nd5,c3d5,r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2n1bn2/3Np3/1b2P3/5N1P/PPPBBPP1/R2QK2R b KQkq - 2 9,"??? after being so timid white advances his knight agressively with only a pawn supporting it.
It does unmask an attack by the bishop as well as attacking with his knight.  My bishop only has one defender so I must either retreat, exchange or protect it eg with a pawn."
18,Bxd2+,b4d2,r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2n1bn2/3Np3/4P3/5N1P/PPPbBPP1/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 10,! I exchange.  Note that I have my eye on his lone pawn in the centre.  It is also his only support for his knight.  Moving a piece into danger unnecessarily is only wise if you believe you can force the play to your advantage.
19,Qxd2,d1d2,r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2n1bn2/3Np3/4P3/5N1P/PPPQBPP1/R3K2R b KQkq - 0 10,White completes the exchange but note his lone pawn is now vulnerable to my knight.  This wins a pawn and attacks his queen whilst his advanced knight is vulnerable.  One must go!
20,Nxe4,f6e4,r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2n1b3/3Np3/4n3/5N1P/PPPQBPP1/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 11,I go up by a pawn with more to come.
21,Qe3,d2e3,r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2n1b3/3Np3/4n3/4QN1P/PPP1BPP1/R3K2R b KQkq - 1 11,"He counter attacks with his queen, but my bishop can take his knight an then protect mine."
22,Bxd5,e6d5,r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2n5/3bp3/4n3/4QN1P/PPP1BPP1/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 12,Up by a pawn plus knight.  My aim now is to continue to pressurce white now that he is down.  Forcing exchanges until I can queen a pawn is my aim.
23,Rd1,a1d1,r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/2n5/3bp3/4n3/4QN1P/PPP1BPP1/3RK2R b Kkq - 1 12,"White attacks the bishop with a more powerful piece.  As long as the bishop has some support (eg my queen) then it is ok (better would be to attack it with a pawn on c4).  White has, however, pinned my bishop to my queen.
  Note that white's queen side pawns are left quite exposed now."
