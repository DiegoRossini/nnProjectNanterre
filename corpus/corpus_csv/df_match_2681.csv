1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Standard opening for myself.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Standard opening for myself.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Again standard for me.
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,Again standard for me.
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"At this stage I fight not wanting to play cxd4, but everything tells me that is the move to make; and looking at my past experience playing black, my instinctive move is Nc6 - but white usually wins those games 66% of the time with 3% draws. 

So in yielding to pressure I'm trying to play the cxd4 line, which I currently have 50% wins but only 6 games played."

7,Nxd4,f3d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"My experience with this line is extremely limited, I normally play Nc6 the few times I have played this line. But I am not sure why so therefore e5, is something I only played once before and want to know the pluse or minus of e5."
