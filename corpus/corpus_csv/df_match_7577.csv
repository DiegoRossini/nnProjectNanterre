1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I like this game - a) my opponent was my highest rating victory on GK b) It pushed my rating to over 1200 c) Well, it was a great game! :) I play as Black"
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Silican defence
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,White immediately issues a challenge to the center
4,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3pP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"I accept the exchange, reasoning that I can gain tempo when White plays..."
5,Qxd4,d1d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 0 3,this! I immediately chase it away with...
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 1 4,Nc6 - development with tempo
7,Qe3,d4e3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/4P3/4Q3/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 2 4,"I prefer Qc3 here, as it keeps both bishops open - Other moves include retreating the Queen back, but with Q d3, the light square bishop is blocked, with Qd2, the dark square bishop is blocked (well, it is here too, but at least there's Bd2) and with Qd1, it's just a complete waste of tempo!"
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/4P3/4Q3/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 3 5,maybe 4...e5 would have been better here...
9,Bd3,f1d3,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/4P3/3BQ3/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 4 5,"?! I can't see the purpose of this move - it opens up some if White decides to play e5, but Bc4 or Bb5 seems better here"
10,e5,e7e5,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/3BQ3/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 0 6,I make my claim to the centre
11,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/2NBQ3/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 1 6,developing the knight and possibly eyeing that d5 square
12,Bb4,f8b4,r1bqk2r/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/1b2P3/2NBQ3/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 2 7,so I pin the knight to its king
13,Bd2,c1d2,r1bqk2r/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/1b2P3/2NBQ3/PPPB1PPP/R3K1NR b KQkq - 3 7,"This is the usual response I get from White, and this can lead to a strong double attack from White if I'm not careful (a good example is my annotation, 'the f7 knight')"
14,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/1b2P3/2NBQ3/PPPB1PPP/R3K1NR w KQ - 4 8,castling - simple enough
15,Nge2,g1e2,r1bq1rk1/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/1b2P3/2NBQ3/PPPBNPPP/R3K2R b KQ - 5 8,"Looking at this as I played this game, I saw White's defence as strong, and with more active pieces it had the lead in development. I had to do something...."
16,d5,d7d5,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2n2n2/3pp3/1b2P3/2NBQ3/PPPBNPPP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 9,so I do. White has to retake because of the pawn fork
17,Nxd5,c3d5,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2n2n2/3Np3/1b2P3/3BQ3/PPPBNPPP/R3K2R b KQ - 0 9,I was expecting exd5 here
18,Bxd2+,b4d2,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2n2n2/3Np3/4P3/3BQ3/PPPbNPPP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 10,"Logical; White has free choice of where to castle, and wouldn't want to give that up"
19,Qxd2,e3d2,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2n2n2/3Np3/4P3/3B4/PPPQNPPP/R3K2R b KQ - 0 10,"Logical; White has free choice of where to castle, and wouldn't want to give that up"
20,Nxd5,f6d5,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2n5/3np3/4P3/3B4/PPPQNPPP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 11,"and after that trade, the position looks a lot better for Black"
21,exd5,e4d5,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2n5/3Pp3/8/3B4/PPPQNPPP/R3K2R b KQ - 0 11,"and after that trade, the position looks a lot better for Black"

23,O-O,e1g1,r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/2n5/3qp3/8/3B4/PPPQNPPP/R4RK1 b - - 1 12,"Castling queenside might have been better for White, but it was probably looking at the queenside knight when he made the decision Now, both sides have castled, White has a bishop, queen and knight developed, while Black has a knight, queen and pawn. Since I'm on the offensive, I decide to attack, but which one should I use?"
