1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,The English opening... [http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15639050&fb=1&rnd=0.7226811586879194 <-- computer analysis]
2,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"A quick look at the database tell me that this isn't the usual way to deal with this opening - Nf6 and c5 are the two top options - but the win/loss ratio for Black isn't too significant, so no harm done!"
3,e4,e2e4,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/2P1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"!? Simple development... apart from this move! I don't know whether Nf6 may have been better here, but if I had played that, it would have looked like a 'boring' Four Knights opening from my side of the board. Ne7 is passive, but solid enough to be playable, and there's always the g6 square to move to!"

White can exchange pawns, then win one with Nxb5, because if Black plays Rxb5 then the discovered attack d4! wins back the material."

For some reason, I didn't see that the knight could capture on d5 and thought that the knight would be confined to either a2 or b1, and that I'd create a nice passed pawn after dxe4. Though this was inferior to the knight capture, it helped set up the foundation for the fireworks later on"
