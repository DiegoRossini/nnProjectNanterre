4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"Here, theory says Nxd4, but I don't like c4 etc."
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"Here, theory says Nxd4, but I don't like c4 etc."
6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3P4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Icelandic, a little inferior, but I know it."
7,dxe6,d5e6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4Pn2/8/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"Not the best move. White will have a better game by developing, instead."
8,Bxe6,c8e6,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4bn2/8/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,Two developed pieces against a single (but strong) central pawn. Let's see!
9,Nf3,g1f3,rn1qkb1r/ppp2ppp/4bn2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"I know, but I just don't know how to play this without this move. It can be delayed, though."
10,c6,c7c6,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1bn2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"I know, but I just don't know how to play this without this move. It can be delayed, though."
11,Be2,f1e2,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1bn2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,Assuring castling. Not very aggressive.
12,Qa5+,d8a5,rn2kb1r/pp3ppp/2p1bn2/q7/3P4/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 7,"Not with the dsb. Bb5+, c3, Ba5, heading to c7... is just too slow."
13,Bd2,c1d2,rn2kb1r/pp3ppp/2p1bn2/q7/3P4/5N2/PPPBBPPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 3 7,"now I have a tempo on b2, soon."
14,Bb4,f8b4,rn2k2r/pp3ppp/2p1bn2/q7/1b1P4/5N2/PPPBBPPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 4 8,"now I have a tempo on b2, soon."
15,c3,c2c3,rn2k2r/pp3ppp/2p1bn2/q7/1b1P4/2P2N2/PP1BBPPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 0 8,"now I have a tempo on b2, soon."
16,Bd6,b4d6,rn2k2r/pp3ppp/2pbbn2/q7/3P4/2P2N2/PP1BBPPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 1 9,This is the best square for my dsb in this opening.
17,O-O,e1g1,rn2k2r/pp3ppp/2pbbn2/q7/3P4/2P2N2/PP1BBPPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 2 9,"Still passive. I feared b4, c4 and a full pawn storm. I can always castle kingside."
18,Qb6,a5b6,rn2k2r/pp3ppp/1qpbbn2/8/3P4/2P2N2/PP1BBPPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 3 10,"Threatening b2. A silly move, since it is easily defendable with Qc2."
19,b3,b2b3,rn2k2r/pp3ppp/1qpbbn2/8/3P4/1PP2N2/P2BBPPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 0 10,"It's ok. But black is starting to lead the game. White can play b4 later, but Nb1... has no square for some move on!"
20,Nbd7,b8d7,r3k2r/pp1n1ppp/1qpbbn2/8/3P4/1PP2N2/P2BBPPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 1 11,"Developing, in order to castle Qside... if white lets me."
21,c4,c3c4,r3k2r/pp1n1ppp/1qpbbn2/8/2PP4/1P3N2/P2BBPPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 0 11,"Obviously. I play a lot against those two pawns, and normally, with care, I get out of it."
22,Qc7,b6c7,r3k2r/ppqn1ppp/2pbbn2/8/2PP4/1P3N2/P2BBPPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 1 12,"Hitting h2, but I know I won't get it."
23,h3,h2h3,r3k2r/ppqn1ppp/2pbbn2/8/2PP4/1P3N1P/P2BBPP1/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 0 12,"A little help for me. White pawns are nearer. If Nc3 (say), Ng4 and white has to defend. Nothing too bad, but, as often with this scheme, a tense and nice game, with the ""who'll get in faster"" factor that I love."
24,h6,h7h6,r3k2r/ppqn1pp1/2pbbn1p/8/2PP4/1P3N1P/P2BBPP1/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 0 13,"Slow, but necessary. h5 at once just concede g5 for white's N or B..."
25,Re1,f1e1,r3k2r/ppqn1pp1/2pbbn1p/8/2PP4/1P3N1P/P2BBPP1/RN1QR1K1 b kq - 1 13,The right moment for a risk:
