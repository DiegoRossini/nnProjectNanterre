1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"In my OTB experience, I have played exclusively 1.e4. I like open position with attacking prospects and I don't mind giving counter-chances as long as there is lively piece play. Closed games are very much different. It's much harder to organize an early attack against the Black King in case Black plays something wrong and very often most of your play will be on the Q-side. That's just not my style but in correspondence, it's much easier and a lot better to have a wider opening repertoire since it will be difficult for opponents to prepare special lines against you."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,I think this was my first serious game in the Budapest. The only previous knowledge I had of the line was some NiC articles and a few blitz games with a club mate.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,I think this was my first serious game in the Budapest. The only previous knowledge I had of the line was some NiC articles and a few blitz games with a club mate.
4,e5,e7e5,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,I think this was my first serious game in the Budapest. The only previous knowledge I had of the line was some NiC articles and a few blitz games with a club mate.
5,dxe5,d4e5,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4P3/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,Not taking the pawn gives Black a very easy game.
6,Ne4,f6e4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/2P1n3/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"3...Ng4 is the main move, hitting both the e5 pawn and f2. This is less critical and gives White extra options to limit Black's early initiative."
7,a3,a2a3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/2P1n3/P7/1P2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"Preventing a very disruptive check on b4. Since the e5 pawn isn't under direct threat, White can play this quiet move. Also in case the Black Bishop should come to c5, b4 could be played with tempo to drive it back from the good diagonal, provided that f2 is defended, of course."
8,Qh4,d8h4,rnb1kb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/2P1n2q/P7/1P2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"Threatening mate in one. Still such kind of empty attacks don't justify sacrificing a pawn, especially since the Queen is rather exposed now and can provided ""free"" moves for any White piece that attacks it."
9,g3,g2g3,rnb1kb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/2P1n2q/P5P1/1P2PP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,The other move was 5.Nh3 but that would leave the e5 pawn without a good defender.
10,Qh5,h4h5,rnb1kb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4P2q/2P1n3/P5P1/1P2PP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,"I couldn't find this move in GK database but I did find it in my own database. It's less played than 6.Bg2, which gives back the pawn for initiative. It scored 90% in 5 games, just slightly bellow 6.Bg2. Needless to say I like it more because of aesthetics. A Queen in the center is very powerful, even in the opening, if it is on a secure spot that can't be attacked by the enemy pieces."
11,Qd5,d1d5,rnb1kb1r/pppp1ppp/8/3QP2q/2P1n3/P5P1/1P2PP1P/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 2 6,"I couldn't find this move in GK database but I did find it in my own database. It's less played than 6.Bg2, which gives back the pawn for initiative. It scored 90% in 5 games, just slightly bellow 6.Bg2. Needless to say I like it more because of aesthetics.

12,Qf5,h5f5,rnb1kb1r/pppp1ppp/8/3QPq2/2P1n3/P5P1/1P2PP1P/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 3 7,"Black moves his Queen again, to protect the Ne4 and to threaten f2 once more. Three consecutive Queen moves in the opening can't promise anything good."
13,f4,f2f4,rnb1kb1r/pppp1ppp/8/3QPq2/2P1nP2/P5P1/1P2P2P/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 0 7,Bolstering e5 and shutting the Queen off from any more threats. There is a drawback to this move and Black exploits it at once.
14,Bc5,f8c5,rnb1k2r/pppp1ppp/8/2bQPq2/2P1nP2/P5P1/1P2P2P/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 1 8,"Not much of a threat now since at best Black can give a check to uncastle the White King or trade two light pieces for a Rook, which is a bad trade even if you're not a pawn down."
15,Bg2,f1g2,rnb1k2r/pppp1ppp/8/2bQPq2/2P1nP2/P5P1/1P2P1BP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 2 8,Protecting the Rh1 and attacking the Ne4. Since g3 was played this is a nice cosy place to put the Bishop.
16,Nf2,e4f2,rnb1k2r/pppp1ppp/8/2bQPq2/2P2P2/P5P1/1P2PnBP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 3 9,"Black could have also played 8...Bf2+ 9.Kf1 Nc5 10.Kxf2 Nb3, trying to exploit White's 4th and capture the unprotected Rook. But White can use again the precarious position of the Qf5 and play 11.Be4 Qe6 12.Be3 Nxa1 13.Nd2 and the Knight is going to be captured soon."
17,Qxc5,d5c5,rnb1k2r/pppp1ppp/8/2Q1Pq2/2P2P2/P5P1/1P2PnBP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 0 9,Black's little flurry of activity is over and he is material down and undeveloped.
18,Nxh1,f2h1,rnb1k2r/pppp1ppp/8/2Q1Pq2/2P2P2/P5P1/1P2P1BP/RNB1K1Nn w Qkq - 0 10,Black's little flurry of activity is over and he is material down and undeveloped.
19,Bxh1,g2h1,rnb1k2r/pppp1ppp/8/2Q1Pq2/2P2P2/P5P1/1P2P2P/RNB1K1NB b Qkq - 0 10,Black's little flurry of activity is over and he is material down and undeveloped.
20,d6,d7d6,rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/3p4/2Q1Pq2/2P2P2/P5P1/1P2P2P/RNB1K1NB w Qkq - 0 11,Using the pin on the fifth rank to gain a tempo on the White Queen and undermine e5.
21,Qe3,c5e3,rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/3p4/4Pq2/2P2P2/P3Q1P1/1P2P2P/RNB1K1NB b Qkq - 1 11,"I didn't want to play 11.Qxc7, although objectively it might be the strongest move because I didn't want to sharpen the position any further since I was material up."
22,O-O,e8g8,rnb2rk1/ppp2ppp/3p4/4Pq2/2P2P2/P3Q1P1/1P2P2P/RNB1K1NB w Q - 2 12,Blocking the e-file and targeting h7.
23,Be4,h1e4,rnb2rk1/ppp2ppp/3p4/4Pq2/2P1BP2/P3Q1P1/1P2P2P/RNB1K1N1 b Q - 3 12,Blocking the e-file and targeting h7.

25,Nf3,g1f3,rnb2rk1/ppp2ppp/3p4/4P2q/2P1BP2/P3QNP1/1P2P2P/RNB1K3 b Q - 5 13,I was happy to trade a pawn for development and especially a pawn on a file that could be used for a castle assault.

29,Nc3,b1c3,rnb2rk1/ppp2ppp/8/4N3/2P1BP2/P1N1Q1P1/1P2P2q/R1B1K3 b Q - 1 15,Blocking the long white diagonal and controlling d5.
30,c6,c7c6,rnb2rk1/pp3ppp/2p5/4N3/2P1BP2/P1N1Q1P1/1P2P2q/R1B1K3 w Q - 0 16,Blocking the long white diagonal and controlling d5.
31,f5,f4f5,rnb2rk1/pp3ppp/2p5/4NP2/2P1B3/P1N1Q1P1/1P2P2q/R1B1K3 b Q - 0 16,"Trying to take advantage of my advanced pawn to wedge the Bishop in, since now that c6 is played, it doesn't have any active square to develop. The f5 pawn could also serve as a kamikaze against the castled position of the Black King. I'm also preparing to bring my Bc1 into play."
