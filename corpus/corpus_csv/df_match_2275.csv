Kenneth from Casual Group N, challenged me in the Walking the Walk and Learning to Run Welcome MT.  Ken gave me the fright of my life in my game against him as white and in that one, Henry owes his life to Ken moving the wrong rook.  In this game, Henry wasn't in such dire danger, but, despite being a pawn up, Ken made my life difficult by putting pressure on my f7 pawn with his heavy pieces and it wasn't until he lost a second pawn that I was able to start moving my queenside pawns up the board and to distract Ken's heavy pieces from f7.  In the end I was able to successfully promote a pawn and make a new queen.  Ken resigned just before Old Matey was about to descend on him.  So, how did all this happen?  Well, read on ......"
