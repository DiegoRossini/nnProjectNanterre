1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,1.Nf3 is a cautious opening and trying to gauge what black is gonna do. Some move order tricks to get into an open sicilian or others can be employed. I was thinking this might head into an English opening so i play my pet reply.

All forced...?
