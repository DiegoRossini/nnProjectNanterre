1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

My first annotation of 2016!  Sadly my Big Slump (with the exception of some bright interludes) has persisted.  I simply cannot stop the silly mistakes from happening!  In this game it is no different.  After a solid Philidor Defense I end up losing a pawn without any compo and I did not even notice it was en prise.  Thankfully I kept Henry upright because I somehow ended up in an endgame with opposite coloured bishops and despite losing a second pawn I got away with conceding a Low Draw.  So how did all this happen?  Well, read on ......"
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,2. ..... d6.  This move gives the opening its name since it was Andre Danican Philidor's favourite.  He would sometimes follow it up with f4 attacking the e4 pawn from a different angle to wrest control of the board from white.  However it didn't quite happen in this game.
