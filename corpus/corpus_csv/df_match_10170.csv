* - Robertb3079 is embarrassingly better than me."

(It is more important in this opening for white to grab space than to worry about pawns.  If white can emerge better developed with active pieces and clear space for them to maneuver, that should be worth one or two or even three pawns.)"

(There is a famous game, Fisher vs. Fine, at http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1043992 where white makes black PAY for this.  And it's not some patzer, it's Reuben Fine!  I remember after seeing that game a long time ago just realizing that white has so much space, so many attacking chances, while black's king is stuck in the center, his bishop is offside, and his only other developed piece is an Nf6.  Now, he's got to address the threat of Bxf7.)"

(I had gone and looked through the game databases, and saw that there are a number of lines, and the ones that looked promising for white were 9. e5 Qg6 10. Nxc3 Nge7, where white then has the option of 11. Ne2, Ba3, or Rd1.  The 11. Ba3 line looked cute because there is this game http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1227846 available to model my play off of. I made some moves in silence and then decided...)"

Why do I say this?  Because after 11. Ba3, black castles with 0-0, and what does white have?  12. Ra-d1 Re8 13. Bd3 Qh5, and white would love to play Ne4, but the e-pawn is hanging!  What if I played 11. Bb2 instead of 11. Ba3?  Well, wouldn't I just be one tempo ahead of where I would be had I played 11. Ba3?  I think so!

How awesome is that?  ""Evans Gambit, Compromised Defense, Siegel Variation -- far superior to the Paulsen Variation!""  IN YOUR FACE LOUIS!"

Slapping the Potter variation, which is 11. Rfd1, in the face.  That's how it goes, graderguy taught me, think a long time about which rook to move.  Then move the other one."
