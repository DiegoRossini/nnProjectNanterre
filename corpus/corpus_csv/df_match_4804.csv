1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,At this point (looking at my opponents grade in comparison to mine) i was confident of a loss but i still took the challenge!
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,quite common- though i don't remember what this opening is called
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"straight into the attack i decided, as i felt in a rather agressive mood that game"
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,pretty defensive i would say
5,d5,d4d5,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2pP4/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,i decided to push!
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2pP4/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,now black threatens the pawn which i'm using to defend my other pawn- what to do now??
7,dxe6,d5e6,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4Pn2/2p5/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,simply take the swap off
8,Nxe4,f6e4,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4P3/2p5/4n3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"that i thought was not that good a move on black's part, as it put the knight in a weak position"
9,exf7+,e6f7,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1Ppp/8/2p5/4n3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,now i can play my pawn in black's defences
10,Ke7,e8e7,rnbq1b1r/pp1pkPpp/8/2p5/4n3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQ - 1 6,now the king  has to move and black can no longer castle
11,Qe2,d1e2,rnbq1b1r/pp1pkPpp/8/2p5/4n3/8/PPP1QPPP/RNB1KBNR b KQ - 2 6,pinning that knight!
12,d5,d7d5,rnbq1b1r/pp2kPpp/8/2pp4/4n3/8/PPP1QPPP/RNB1KBNR w KQ - 0 7,i thought he had saved the knight but...
13,f3,f2f3,rnbq1b1r/pp2kPpp/8/2pp4/4n3/5P2/PPP1Q1PP/RNB1KBNR b KQ - 0 7,"it was still pinned, so i could play f3"
14,Kxf7,e7f7,rnbq1b1r/pp3kpp/8/2pp4/4n3/5P2/PPP1Q1PP/RNB1KBNR w KQ - 0 8,poor king
15,fxe4,f3e4,rnbq1b1r/pp3kpp/8/2pp4/4P3/8/PPP1Q1PP/RNB1KBNR b KQ - 0 8,more agressive play and a top heavy swap off!
16,Qh4+,d8h4,rnb2b1r/pp3kpp/8/2pp4/4P2q/8/PPP1Q1PP/RNB1KBNR w KQ - 1 9,ooh?
17,g3,g2g3,rnb2b1r/pp3kpp/8/2pp4/4P2q/6P1/PPP1Q2P/RNB1KBNR b KQ - 0 9,obviously
18,Qxe4,h4e4,rnb2b1r/pp3kpp/8/2pp4/4q3/6P1/PPP1Q2P/RNB1KBNR w KQ - 0 10,why would black want a queen swap when it is losing!!????????
