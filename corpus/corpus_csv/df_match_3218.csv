1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I've annotate this game which is a bit long and the second part (after move 20) seems to me the more interresting one (3 sacrifices in total). If you have any comments (mistakes I've made, moves I didn't see), don't hesitate. I cannot see what I missed, had the impression of playing very well (which might well be only an impression...) but couldn't win."
