1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,In this game I make a horrendous mistake which gave me a lost position. I fight back and gain an advantage in the ending. The big question is whether or not I missed a win towards the end.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,So it starts with a Sicilian Defence.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,He continues with the usual.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,As do I.
5,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,This is a popular alternative to 3. d2-d4
6,e6,e7e6,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,I prepare to bring my Ng8 to support its colleague.
7,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 4,He castles.
8,Nge7,g8e7,r1bqkb1r/pp1pnppp/2n1p3/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 5,I continue.
9,Re1,f1e1,r1bqkb1r/pp1pnppp/2n1p3/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq - 3 5,He prepares a retreat square for his bishop.
10,a6,a7a6,r1bqkb1r/1p1pnppp/p1n1p3/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq - 0 6,I hit the bishop.
11,Bf1,b5f1,r1bqkb1r/1p1pnppp/p1n1p3/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQRBK1 b kq - 1 6,It retreats.
12,d5,d7d5,r1bqkb1r/1p2nppp/p1n1p3/2pp4/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQRBK1 w kq - 0 7,So I make a claim to the centre.
13,exd5,e4d5,r1bqkb1r/1p2nppp/p1n1p3/2pP4/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQRBK1 b kq - 0 7,He takes.
14,Nxd5,e7d5,r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1n1p3/2pn4/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQRBK1 w kq - 0 8,"I take back, opening up a diagonal for my Bf8."
15,d4,d2d4,r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1n1p3/2pn4/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQRBK1 b kq - 0 8,He finally does the d2-d4 break.
16,Nf6,d5f6,r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1n1pn2/2p5/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQRBK1 w kq - 1 9,"This retreat adds pressure to d4. Post Game Computer Analysis (PGCA) says this is a mistake, and prefers the simple Be7, but this move has been played before, with good results. 8.....Nf6 is in fact the most popular move in both the Gameknot opening databases."
17,Be3,c1e3,r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1n1pn2/2p5/3P4/4BN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QRBK1 b kq - 2 9,Which he supports.
18,Ng4,f6g4,r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1n1p3/2p5/3P2n1/4BN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QRBK1 w kq - 3 10,"I ""threaten"" to take one of his bishops. In an open position like this, the bishops are slightly better than the knight."
19,c3,c2c3,r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1n1p3/2p5/3P2n1/2P1BN2/PP3PPP/RN1QRBK1 b kq - 0 10,He gives more support to d4. 10. d5 is the move given in both the previous games with this variation. We are now out of my opening databases.
20,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/1p2bppp/p1n1p3/2p5/3P2n1/2P1BN2/PP3PPP/RN1QRBK1 w kq - 1 11,So I develop.
