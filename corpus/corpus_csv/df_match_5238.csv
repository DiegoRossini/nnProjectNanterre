10,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp2pp/2n2n2/4p3/4Q3/P1P5/1P1P1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 1 6,with knight

15,a4,a3a4,r1bqk2r/pppp2pp/1bn2n2/4p3/PP6/2P5/3PQPPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 0 8,at this point I felt that I'm going to win. really he is not developing. considering that he may move a4-a5 I felt like he will lose one more move
16,a6,a7a6,r1bqk2r/1ppp2pp/pbn2n2/4p3/PP6/2P5/3PQPPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 0 9,so I just opened safe square for my bishop
