1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This was a normal open challenge. I was a little suprised to see someone higher ranked accept. Perhaps he had noticed that I was only recently in the ranks of the 1600 . Ironically my rating was below 1600 at the end and my opponents was over 1700

26,h6,h7h6,r1b2rk1/p1p2pp1/5q1p/3p3Q/8/2PB4/P1P2PPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 14,Now we finally move out of the Gameknot database (which suggests g6). I may have made things harder for myself than they should be with this move as it opens the white squares around my king while white still has his lsb
27,Qxd5,h5d5,r1b2rk1/p1p2pp1/5q1p/3Q4/8/2PB4/P1P2PPP/R4RK1 b - - 0 14,grabbing material and threatening my rook
28,Be6,c8e6,r4rk1/p1p2pp1/4bq1p/3Q4/8/2PB4/P1P2PPP/R4RK1 w - - 1 15,Still broadly following the main line of the opening. This move finally completes my development and links my rooks. White has a material advantage but double pawns. To me the game looks pretty even here. My queen is eying up the c3 pawn too which would equalise in material though I doubt white will allow that
29,Qd4,d5d4,r4rk1/p1p2pp1/4bq1p/8/3Q4/2PB4/P1P2PPP/R4RK1 b - - 2 15,Looking at Bh3. I was reluctant to exchange as it would undouble whites pawns against my isolated c pawn
30,Qg5,f6g5,r4rk1/p1p2pp1/4b2p/6q1/3Q4/2PB4/P1P2PPP/R4RK1 w - - 3 16,Looking at Bh3. I was reluctant to exchange as it would undouble whites pawns against my isolated c pawn
31,f4,f2f4,r4rk1/p1p2pp1/4b2p/6q1/3Q1P2/2PB4/P1P3PP/R4RK1 b - - 0 16,Really this represent a change of heart but I am not sure where better I could have put it either

33,Be4,d3e4,r4rk1/p1p2pp1/4b2p/3q4/3QBP2/2P5/P1P3PP/R4RK1 b - - 2 17,white forces the exchange which as I said is to his advantage
34,Qxd4+,d5d4,r4rk1/p1p2pp1/4b2p/8/3qBP2/2P5/P1P3PP/R4RK1 w - - 0 18,"grabbing the open file by my isolated and very sorry looking pawns, would Rad8 be a better move?"

37,d5,d4d5,1r3rk1/p1p2pp1/4b2p/3P4/4BP2/8/P1P3PP/R4RK1 b - - 0 19,"I think white is trying to take advantage of his material advantage and exchanging where he can, particularly with his well advanced d pawn"
38,Bd7,e6d7,1r3rk1/p1pb1pp1/7p/3P4/4BP2/8/P1P3PP/R4RK1 w - - 1 20,"I think white is trying to take advantage of his material advantage and exchanging where he can, particularly with his well advanced d pawn"

40,f5,f7f5,1r3rk1/p1pb2p1/7p/3P1p2/4BP2/8/P1P3PP/1R3RK1 w - - 0 21,"Applying pressure of my own, there is no need for me to take his rook, if he wants mine he will have to take it"
41,Bd3,e4d3,1r3rk1/p1pb2p1/7p/3P1p2/5P2/3B4/P1P3PP/1R3RK1 b - - 1 21,At least now his d pawn is (temporarily) undefended
42,g6,g7g6,1r3rk1/p1pb4/6pp/3P1p2/5P2/3B4/P1P3PP/1R3RK1 w - - 0 22,This is probably a poor move as the f pawn is already well protected
43,c4,c2c4,1r3rk1/p1pb4/6pp/3P1p2/2P2P2/3B4/P5PP/1R3RK1 b - - 0 22,I'm unsure about this move. I would be tempted with Bc4 instead threatening discovered check with d6 which could become nasty for me. As it is the white lsb is now quite restricted
