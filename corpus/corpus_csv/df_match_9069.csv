It is a real pity that Glenda was on f1 and not g2 because I could have pinned that witch to her other half with great pleasure but this is not possible.  My knight drops back to defend the f pawn but now my h pawn will drop to a skewer by the enemy rook on h8.

If the b pawn had still been on the board I could have blocked this bishop move.  My rook must move away allowing Frere Lenoir to be taken.  If Henry moves to c1 to try and get two pieces for the rook then Rc5 simply drives Henry back to b1 and the rook falls next move.  Any rook move will result in Frere Lenoir being taken with check and I could well lose a third pawn and his rook will be a bone in the throat.  I therefore decided to wave the white flag on the grounds of ruinous loss of material.  A sad end to a game of which I had high hopes.
