5,Be2,f1e2,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPPBPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 3,"SO I often do this quiet move, intending to rid myself of this light-squared bishop as soon as I'm able due to how I position my pawn structure. This gives black a chance to wrest the initiative from white, but changes how he intends to play. If instead he stays with the main themes of the Sicilian, he often ends up having trouble deciding how to proceed in the midgame."

I delay that, because I don't want to make that move too early, encouraging black to crash his pawns down on the queenside, or get in f5 before I get in f4, which makes for a very open and challenging contest."

I've played this position out on Fritz, and Fritz actually likes 21. Nf6+ more than 21. Bh6, but both moves win for white. Black made only a couple mistakes here along with ideas that just needed to be better supported. Had black perhaps prepared his idea a bit more thoroughly, or perhaps tried another more aggressive plan with his pawns, I'm sure the game would have been a much greater struggle."
