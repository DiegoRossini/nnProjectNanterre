1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is a common way to arrive at the modern Benoni. Essentially, Black puts off committing to the line until White has played a couple more moves, in order to avoid some nasty ""anti-Benoni"" lines. This is in contrast to the Old Benoni, which is the immediate 1.d4 c5."

3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Obviously this opening can still unfold many different ways: we're still in a generic Indian opening right now. Black is still keeping options on the table.

7,d5,d4d5,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2pP4/2P5/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"And this is the basic setup; clearly it can be reached through any number of transpositions but the key pawn structure has now been set up. From here, play may continue in a number of ways, but the semi-open center and lack of Black d-pawn can make for a very fluid struggle for dominance. I like this opening already."

11,e4,e2e4,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3p1n2/2pP4/4P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,"This is standard. White supports his d-pawn and strengthens his claim to the center. Furthermore, many lines in this opening seem to revolve around an e4-e5 break by White."
12,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pp3p1p/3p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,"As the Black DSB is blocked in by the d6 pawn, fianchettoing it seems to be called for. This is another place this opening is similar to an Indian defense, but unlike in (e.g.) the King's Indian, the fiachettoed Bishop will not be blocked by a Black pawn on e5."
13,f4,f2f4,rnbqkb1r/pp3p1p/3p1np1/2pP4/4PP2/2N5/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 7,"This is a popular move, still in the main variations. It gives White a stronger center and may become crucial to an e4-e5 push."
14,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4PP2/2N5/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 8,"The Taimanov Variation. White develops with check, and announces his intentions to really constrict Black's game. The upshot is that Black's best response is 8...Nfd7, cramping his LSB and Queen's Knight. If he tries 8...Nbd7, the game is still playable but Black will have to give up material of some kind after 9.e5."

17,a4,a2a4,rnbqk2r/pp1n1pbp/3p2p1/1BpP4/P3PP2/2N5/1P4PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 9,"This seems like a sensible next move: preventing Black from gaining queenside breathing space with an ...a6 ...b5 combination. It turns out that the GK computer considers this still in-book, as well."

19,Be2,b5e2,rnbqk2r/1p1n1pbp/p2p2p1/2pP4/P3PP2/2N5/1P2B1PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 10,"Upon reflection, I like 10.Bd3 better. At the time, I thought it would have few prospects there, gazing at the sturdy Black kingside pawns, but I failed to anticipate how much pressure Black would soon be putting on my e-pawn."
20,Qe7,d8e7,rnb1k2r/1p1nqpbp/p2p2p1/2pP4/P3PP2/2N5/1P2B1PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 2 11,"A couple of database games have the line 10...Qh4+ 11.g3 Qe7 instead, which busts up the White kingside a little more. According to my opponent, he did consider that line but decided weakening my kingside wasn't worth the strength that the g3 pawn could lend to my center."

As White, it was about here that I found myself wishing that I had played Bd3 instead of Be2, because then I'd have a move free to play Re1 and hold the center calmly. But, I didn't, so now I was stuck debating between trying to hold e4, or trying to push e5."
27,Bd3,e2d3,rnb1r1k1/1p2qpbp/p2p1np1/2pP4/P3PP2/2NB1N2/1PQ3PP/R1B2RK1 b - - 9 14,"I settled for holding e4. 14.Ng5? doesn't accomplish anything after 14...h6 15.Nf3 Nxe4 16.Nxe4 Qxe4, so I went with the Bishop move, expecting Black's response to be the very-sharp 14...c4!? 15.Bxc4 Nxe4. Now if 16.Nxe4?! Qxe4 17.Qxe4 Rxe4 18.Bd3 Rb4 Black looks pretty strong, so instead White needs to play 16.Re1! and the situation gets even more complex. A sample line might continue 16...f5 17.Bd3 Bxc3 18.bxc3 Qc7!? 19.Bxe4 fxe4 20.Rxe4 Rxe4 21.Qxe4 Qxc3 and now White can force a draw if he wants, or else the shootout begins in earnest!"

29,Rb1,a1b1,rn2r1k1/1p2qpbp/p2p1np1/2pP4/P3PPb1/2NB1N2/1PQ3PP/1RB2RK1 b - - 11 15,"Looking back, I don't like this. I was trying to prepare for either b2-b4 or just the eventualities arising from the Black DSB on the long diagonal, but I think this move is too passive. I think I could have gotten away with 15.e5! (...dxe5 16.Nxe5). I think 15.Bd2 or 15.Re1 were also good options. The GK computer doesn't consider this move an error, but it does quietly drop my perceived advantage by about half a point."
