In retrospect, that was probably the best line, because then it seems white cannot save his knight on c3. Instead, I play for the simpler approach, winning the pinned knight with a pawn. 6. Nf3? needs a question mark for not defending the position at c3. Oddly, general opening principles say to develop pieces, preferably knights before bishops, and white followed that principle - this was just one of those cases where there was danger on the board that needed to be handled before following general opening principles."
