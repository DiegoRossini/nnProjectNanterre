1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

This game had echos of my previous game against Master Janet in which she gave me an exchange sac in the middle game and later on, Henry got caught in a mating net on the d column.  A similar thing happens in this game, only this time, just like the times Steve Backshall managed to evade the bees, hippos and alligators (taking photos at the same time!) and get back to the truck, Henry manages to escape from the clutches of the Wicked Witch and find sanctuary on the a column.  I end up being a whole rook up and with Bob's mating attack completely burnt out it was only a matter of time before I forced a queen swap and ensured safe passage for a pawn to get to Glendadom before Bob waved the white flag.  So, how did this happen?  Well, you can follow the action by the Gameknot Analysis link below.  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15462595&fb=1&rnd=0.16887384178856135"
