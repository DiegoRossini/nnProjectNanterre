1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This game illustrates the explosive potential of the modern benoni.  At move 17 I used a temporary piece sacrifice in order to get a deadly attack on the dark squares. This game also highlights what happens when white strays from solid benoni principles and allows black to achieve his strategic goals without resistance.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,Usually when I see white play this I try to steer the game into the Modern Benoni.

4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Black can play c5 imedaitely but is better not to commit only two moves in. This move leaves white guess on blacks game plan. From here black can play into the siclian, king's indain defence, or QGD."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"This is the start of the Modern Benoni. Black invites white to create a central wedge after d5. In return black can get some dangerous counter play on the queen side. The pawn structure that results is very dynamic.  Black aims for b5-b4 break and White aims for e4-e5. 

The Modern Benoni was achieved in the 2008 WCh in mexico city.

7,d5,d4d5,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2pP4/2P5/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,4. dxc5 is possible but after 4. ...Bxc5 black has no trouble equalizing. The point of 4. D5 is that through it white achieves a central wedge that gives him an enduring space advantage.
8,exd5,e6d5,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/5n2/2pp4/2P5/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,In exchange for strong counter play on the queenside black gets the backward D pawn.

11,e4,e2e4,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3p1n2/2pP4/4P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,I have played players who limp out with 6. e3 and I have gone on to crush them. If you are going to play the benoni then you must be active.
12,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pp3p1p/3p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,"the four pawns attack: this is considered White's most aggressive plan against the Benoni. 

White has tried Nf3; Bd3, Be2. 

The immedaite Bf4 of Bg5 can give black something to think about."

14,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4PP2/2N5/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 8,This fianchetto bishop is the heart and soul of the Benoni. From here it eyes e5 and can later assist in the Queen side pawn expansion.
15,Bb5+,f1b5,rnbqk2r/pp3pbp/3p1np1/1BpP4/4PP2/2N5/PP4PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 2 8,This is annoying check for black.
16,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bqk2r/pp1n1pbp/3p1np1/1BpP4/4PP2/2N5/PP4PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 3 9,"In my experience(and I have a lot of tournament experience using the Benoni )this is blacks most solid reply to the check. Black can try

(8a). ...Bd7 implies a peice sacrifice after:

9.Bxd7 Nxd7 10. Nf3 is hard for black to stop e4-e5. or...

9. e5! dxe5 10. fxe5 Nh5 11. Nf3 0-0 12. Bxd7 Nxd7(12. ...Qxd7 13. 0-0 leaves white with a massive centre) 13. g4 Nxe5 14. gxh5 Nxf3  Qxf3, when it is hard to believe that black has enough compensation 

If white plays 9. e5 then black has....

9... dxe5 10. fxe5 Nh5 11. e6 Qh4  with a good game.

(8b). ...Nfd7

9. a4 Qh4  (A tricky check which is designed to create a weakness in white's kingside. Once white plays g2-g3 black may be able to utilise the h3 square at a later juncture with Bh3 or simply place a peice on g4 with fear of being kicked away by h2-h3) 
10. g3 Qe7

A less agressive approach for black is 

8. ...Ndf7 9. A4 0-0 10. Nf3 Na6 11. 0-0 Nc7!(the advantage of Nc7 over Nb4 is that white does not have time to slide his bishop back to f1, but must instead decide where else it should go,or whether to allow it to be exchanged for the knight) 12. Bd3 a6 17 13. Qe1"
17,Bd3,b5d3,r1bqk2r/pp1n1pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4PP2/2NB4/PP4PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 4 9,This transposes back to normal lines

Also of note is the classical line in which Black plays 9. ...B5 immediately to deflect whites pieces from the defense of e4."
19,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqk2r/1p1n1pbp/p2p1np1/2pP4/4PP2/2NB1N2/PP4PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 10,normally it is not a good thing to allow black to play b5. A4 is considered best.
20,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/1p1n1pbp/p2p1np1/2pP4/4PP2/2NB1N2/PP4PP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 2 11,"The immedaite B5 is too risky. I must follow a benoni cardinal rule:
""Always keep a watchful eye on the e4-e5 break."

22,b5,b7b5,r1bq1rk1/3n1pbp/p2p1np1/1ppP4/4PP2/2NB1N2/PP4PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 12,Black has achieved his major positional goal. Now it will be hard for white to prevent the queen side pawn march.

My hope is that white continues to play like this.  With my queenside up and rolling white will have a hard time finding the time to play e5.
24,Re8,f8e8,r1bqr1k1/3n1pbp/p2p1np1/1ppP4/4PP2/P1NB1N2/1P4PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 13,Re8 is a standard Benoni move that adds pressure to e5 and discourages white from playing e5.
25,Re1,f1e1,r1bqr1k1/3n1pbp/p2p1np1/1ppP4/4PP2/P1NB1N2/1P4PP/R1BQR1K1 b - - 2 13,This maintains the threat of e5 and hold the balance in the centre.
