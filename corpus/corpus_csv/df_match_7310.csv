1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"While I like to play unorthodox openings, my overall style is rather traditional and, frankly, somewhat staid.  I use Gameknot to do research and to improve my play when I transfer into an over-the-board setting. My USCF rating, amazingly, hovers in the 1825 to 1875 range which is considerably more than Gameknot. 

This game features perhaps the wildest game I've ever played on GK. Going into this match I was 2-0 versus Nick but both wins were quite some time ago."
