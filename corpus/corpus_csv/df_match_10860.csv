1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I played this game at my club a couple days ago and decided to annotate it today. I sacrificed a pawn in the opening for superior development.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"Alekhine's defense, I want to entice White's central pawns forward so I can undermine them while White's centre will be left with weaknesses"
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 2,"This is the best move against Alekhine, because e5 is overextensive."
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,This is the most active move. All others will yield White the advantage.
5,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,Other choices are Nxd5 and e5.
6,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/6b1/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"Instead of recapturing, I decide to develop another piece."
7,f3,f2f3,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/6b1/2N2P2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"Althought it seems White has won a tempo, f3 weakens the a7-g1 diagonal, and takes away the knight's best square."
8,Bf5,g4f5,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P1b2/8/2N2P2/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"I can simply move, while White's weakness stays"
9,Bc4,f1c4,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P1b2/2B5/2N2P2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 2 5,White holds onto the pawn.
10,c6,c7c6,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/3P1b2/2B5/2N2P2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,My sacrifice.
11,dxc6,d5c6,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2P2n2/5b2/2B5/2N2P2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 6,"For compensation for the pawn, I  have superior development and more control of centre."
12,Nxc6,b8c6,r2qkb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/5b2/2B5/2N2P2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 7,"For compensation for the pawn, I  have superior development and more control of centre."

14,e5,e7e5,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/4pb2/2B5/2N2P2/PPPPN1PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,It's easy for me to make good developing moves as a result of my sacrifice.

21,fxg4,f3g4,r2qk2r/pp3pp1/2n5/2b1pb1p/2B3P1/2NP4/PPP1N1PP/R1BQ1R1K b kq - 0 11,"For compensation for the knight, I now have an open h-file to White's king, and I have another threat Rxh2 followed by Qh4 mate."

Now I'm down a knight for nothing, and it must take a miracle to win now."
24,Kd7,e8d7,r2q3r/pp1k1pp1/2n5/2b1pb2/2B3p1/2NP2P1/PPP1N2P/R1BQ1R1K w - - 1 13,Sometimes all it takes is an odd-looking move to throw your opponent off. My opponent had a defensive move here d4 which would have given him time to defend properly. I guess White was thrown off by my obscure move it caused him to blunder.
