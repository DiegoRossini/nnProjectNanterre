1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I start with my normal.
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,He replies conventionally.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,I opt for the Queen's Gambit.
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"This is inferior, as his knight gets kicked around. Better is e6 or c6."
5,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/3P4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,So I take.
6,Nxd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3n4/3P4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,He takes back.
7,e4,e2e4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3n4/3PP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"I attack the knight, and seize the centre."
8,Nb6,d5b6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/1n6/8/3PP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"f6 was a better square, where he attacks the e pawn."
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/1n6/8/3PP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 5,I develop.
10,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/1n2p3/8/3PP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,So does he.
11,Be3,c1e3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/1n2p3/8/3PP3/2N1B3/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 1 6,"Developing the bishop, and also discouraging c7-c5 which attacks my centre."
12,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/1nn1p3/8/3PP3/2N1B3/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 2 7,He attacks d4 again.
13,Bd3,f1d3,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/1nn1p3/8/3PP3/2NBB3/PP3PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 3 7,"If he takes on d4 now, I take back, and if he recaptures with the queen he loses it to Bb5 check."
14,Bb4,f8b4,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/1nn1p3/8/1b1PP3/2NBB3/PP3PPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 4 8,Another inaccuracy as an exchange on c3 simply strengthens my centre.
15,f4,f2f4,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/1nn1p3/8/1b1PPP2/2NBB3/PP4PP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 0 8,I prevent the other pawn break by him - e7-e5.
16,Ne7,c6e7,r1bqk2r/ppp1nppp/1n2p3/8/1b1PPP2/2NBB3/PP4PP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 1 9,Not sure why he played this?
17,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqk2r/ppp1nppp/1n2p3/8/1b1PPP2/2NBBN2/PP4PP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 2 9,I develop my last minor piece.
18,h6,h7h6,r1bqk2r/ppp1npp1/1n2p2p/8/1b1PPP2/2NBBN2/PP4PP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 10,Again I think this is rather a waste of a move.
19,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk2r/ppp1npp1/1n2p2p/8/1b1PPP2/2NBBN2/PP4PP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 1 10,"I castle, bringing my king to safety and my Rh1 into play."
20,a6,a7a6,r1bqk2r/1pp1npp1/pn2p2p/8/1b1PPP2/2NBBN2/PP4PP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 11,"I mirror of h6 perhaps, but again, not helping his development."
