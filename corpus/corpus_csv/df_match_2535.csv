1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Just out of the opening, Black tries a speculative piece sacrifice that opens up a whole hive of possibilities on the Queen side.  For the piece, Black gets two pawns, his mobilization proceeds apace, and a temporary bind is clamped over White's Queen wing.  All very well for Black, but then what?  Black's game proceeds by threats, swarming all over the board, White having to fend off attacks here, there and everywhere."

The general idea for White is to develop quickly and quietly, remaining uncommitted for the nonce in the centre.  Once castled, his broad plan is likely enough to bring the King's Knight to d2 then c4, where it attacks d6; then begin breakthrough operations with e2-e4."

Does White have to apprehend a possible ...Ng4 followed by ...Bd4 at some point?"

I guess it is worth pointing out that d6 is the major strategic weakness that Black has to accept when playing a Modern Benoni.  That is the price he pays for the dynamic strengths of the whole opening, and it is not a cheap one."

The e8-Rook supplies the answer: 14.Nxd6 Qxd6  15.Bf4 Re5, and white has no way to augment the pin at e5.  White might take the rook right off - 16.Bxe5 Qxe5  and play on with R and P vs B and N; or retain the pin as long as possible whilst building up elsewhere, e.g. 16.e4 Qe7  17.Qe2 Bd7 and the b8-Rook moves of next turn, whereupon White takes the Exchange.  This might actually be a playable line for White, but I reckon I'd prefer the Black pieces in the ensuing game."

I might have played 14...Bf4, but why invite the thematic e2-e4?  Be it noted, the g4-square isn't available neither.  So this restrained development seems to be indicated.  Sometimes ones choice of move is arrived at by a process of elimination.  But there was more to it than that. In my explorations of this line, I had found an intriguing possibility..."

The latter is unplayable: 17...Bf5 18.g4 puts paid to that.  But 17...f5  18.Nc3 actually costs Black time that White can use to bring his Knights back to safety and into the centre.  Apparently paradoxically, moving the Knight again gains time - by striking at the d-pawn, but also the threat to gain several tempi with the advance of the b-pawn striking at the White Knights."
