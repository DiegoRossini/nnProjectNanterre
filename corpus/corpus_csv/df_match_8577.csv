1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!  This was an interesting game with a material imbalance which Bob kicks off with 1. d4.  Bob had a R + Piece + Pawn for Glenda.  My opponent's material balance so nearly worked in his favour.  At the end Bob's rook, two minor pieces and a pawn were swarming around Henry.  It looked as though I was going to cop Old Matey, but wait, what about Glenda?  Well ....... read on ....."
