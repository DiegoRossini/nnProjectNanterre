I know that I need to play Nf3. I'm guessing that he's ready to capture on f3, and I can't imagine taking back gxf3.
But having pawns on f3 and f2 isn't a completely bad arrangement. They protect e3 and e4 from invasion, and it makes me want to play d4 to control e5, too."

5,Nf3,g1f3,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/6b1/1P3N2/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 3 3,"Sometimes I think that the most valuable thing about extremely uncommon moves like Bg4 is it creates doubt in my mind about my opening. I'm thinking it's because I don't play and read chess so frequently that I have more natural confidence in what I'm doing.
But isn't that an ongoing trade-off? The beginners I teach are always extremely confident -- so confident that they move way too fast and tend to fall off the virtual cliff because of the simple things they overlook."
