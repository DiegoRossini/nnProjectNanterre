10,Ne7,c6e7,r1bqkb1r/ppppn1pp/5n2/1B2pP2/8/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 6,"Black relieves the pressure on its knight and makes a play at the errant pawn. Back in my wild gambiting days I learned if an opponent tried to retain the pawn gain it can oft tie itself into knots or over-extend its forces. White declines, then, Nxe5 (after some pause) as   Black would gain a knight pairing in exchange for White's 2 officers being far in front of the rest of its forces and a single pawn in material. Though admittedly Black would have no pawns operating forward of the 7th rank. None the less, Nxe5 is ignored in a multitude of R-L lines for good reason and I'm unconvinced those reasons are sufficiently overturned in this novel opening."

Yet White's forces are also beginning to link up instead of being over-extended. In the end, with 6 games on the World database and 0 on the gameknot, this is frontier R-L territory so time for Tips to trail blaze! (Especially  since this match is potentially eligible for the GK database! :) ) Allons-y!"

In devising ways to counter, I realised this gem, possible due to the lavish tempo Black handed me with the (forced?) recapture of the gambited pawn and then the pre-castling move too early. Any advantages of clearing out the qside and putting Q and lcb on same diagonal are erased through the pressure about the e4, e5 and f6 squares that White is exerting. Piece coordination is the key to good chess and here the knight pairs, d pawn, Queen and dcb are all combining for some heavy pressure on the centre. With that pressure coming from knights, Blacks better pawn structure is compromised and about to become a liability if Black is not careful. This is quickly becoming the R-L at its best; with quickly developed officers threatening to wreak havoc on Black's over-extended lines."

The downside, for Black, is that those knights will find it hard to co-ordinate so far away from each other. I had previously mentioned the essence of the R-L was to develop officers quickly then hit an over-extended line. 13 d4, then, is perhaps the favoured line as gets the exchanges going. But this is an atypical R-L, demonstrated by the fact White hasn't castled AND has the option of castling both sides. As such there are options aplenty: a4 threatening to push the Black knight into retreat, B/Nh4 tempting an exchange, O-O, O-O-O, Be3, h3 all beckon as White's lucky 13th move.

Well I could just use rmannstaedt's saying, ""If in doubt, scream and shout, or alternatively, castle."" :) But let's go through those options one by one.  ""a4 threatening to push the Black knight into retreat"" comment: why retreat a piece that can't move forward? Let it stay and act as a bulwark to its own forces. For, in time, those same defensive walls that provided shelter in the early middle can become the walls of an opponent's tomb by the late middle or endgame.""B/Nh4 tempting an exchange"" comment: my knight and bishop are co-ordinating and are threatening to a much greater extent than Black's knight on g4. Choosing to exchange here, then, would suit Black better than White.  Be3 exposed, through analysis, that Black could attack the backwards pawn on d3, with a doubling on the d file if allowed to castle long. Once that was exposed O-O-O or Rd1 became favoured over O-O. h4 was also tossed out on its arse for keeping the h3-g4 combo alive. Rd1 was ditched as I didn't want to move my rook off h1, meaning that putting the king (eventually) onto b1 was preferable to having it sandwiched betwixt the 2 rooks. O-O-O, then, provided needed support on the d file, opening the possibility of pawn to d4, whilst allowing the king to get over and support the a pawn. Lots of analysis but necessary when you've got so many seemingly good moves. That concludes this lesson of how Tipsy uses the process of elimination to find the best of a seemingly good bunch. :)"

Now the bishop/knight's coordination shifts from money in the bank to money which needs to be spent. The f pawn needs to be freed up for an attack on e5, in turn releasing the d pawn from its box. Otherwise White can be cramped up."

With lines worked out for the g6 or Qf7/e6 support movements, White is prepared to further simplify on the kside as its pawn majority on that side should be telling over time. Black can retreat the bishop but White has plans for that as well. In the very least, a bishop retreat yields more space to White, allowing it to finally uncoil on the kside. Not bad considering how cramped it looked previously. And, of course, there's always the chance Black will stuff things up completely in the coming set of exchanges/ensuing retreat though unlikely.
