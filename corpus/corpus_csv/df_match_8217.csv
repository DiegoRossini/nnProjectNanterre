1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Kings Gambit, Muzio variation
The idea is to gain a lot in development by allowing black to capture a knight for a pawn
1. centre pawn"
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,usual response
3,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"f pawn attaching black's e pawn, there is no other choice for black but to capture f4"
4,exf4,e5f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,as predicted black capture the f4 pawn
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"taking the knight out, a step to castling king side"
6,g5,g7g5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/6p1/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,black shores up his f pawn in order to hang on to his pawn advantage
7,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/6p1/2B1Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"white ignores the threat of g5-g4, attacking white knight and develops the bishop. The idea is to prepare an attack on black's f7 pawn"
8,g4,g5g4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/8/2B1Ppp1/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"black attacks the f3 knight. If the knight moves, the pawn sacrifice would be in vain as black would send its queen to h4 check. Then, white king would have to move out of check. White will allow black to capture the knight"
9,O-O,e1g1,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/8/2B1Ppp1/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 5,"White castles, allowing black an easy knight, -4 points"
10,gxf3,g4f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/8/2B1Pp2/5p2/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 6,black captures white's knight
11,Qxf3,d1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/8/2B1Pp2/5Q2/PPPP2PP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 0 6,"white capture black's f3 pawn and prepares to take the f4 pawn, to be -2"
12,Qf6,d8f6,rnb1kbnr/pppp1p1p/5q2/8/2B1Pp2/5Q2/PPPP2PP/RNB2RK1 w kq - 1 7,"black protects the f4 to prevent a double attack on f7. This is a good move as black can send the queen to d4 check, and swoop the unprotected white bishop on c4"
13,d3,d2d3,rnb1kbnr/pppp1p1p/5q2/8/2B1Pp2/3P1Q2/PPP3PP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 0 7,white protects the c4 bishops and at the same time shores up the e4 pawn
14,Bc5+,f8c5,rnb1k1nr/pppp1p1p/5q2/2b5/2B1Pp2/3P1Q2/PPP3PP/RNB2RK1 w kq - 1 8,"quite unexplicable, black attacks the queen in a useless check. The only rationale I could see would be to send white king to h1 for a later weak back rank checkmate but given how behind black is on development, I still think this is a useless move"
15,Kh1,g1h1,rnb1k1nr/pppp1p1p/5q2/2b5/2B1Pp2/3P1Q2/PPP3PP/RNB2R1K b kq - 2 8,White king moves out of check
16,c6,c7c6,rnb1k1nr/pp1p1p1p/2p2q2/2b5/2B1Pp2/3P1Q2/PPP3PP/RNB2R1K w kq - 0 9,"black advances c6 pawn to prepare an attack on the bishop and release his own bishop at the same time. It's quite fine from white's perspective as in the end, his queen and bishop will be on the same diagonale and can attack anything in that diagonale"
17,Bxf4,c1f4,rnb1k1nr/pp1p1p1p/2p2q2/2b5/2B1PB2/3P1Q2/PPP3PP/RN3R1K b kq - 0 9,White decides to ignore the impending attack on the c4 bishop and take the pawn to be down -2. White should do everything not to exchange queen. The strategy to gain a huge lead in development would will not be huge if queens are exchanged early.
18,d5,d7d5,rnb1k1nr/pp3p1p/2p2q2/2bp4/2B1PB2/3P1Q2/PPP3PP/RN3R1K w kq - 0 10,Attack on c4 bishop comes
19,exd5,e4d5,rnb1k1nr/pp3p1p/2p2q2/2bP4/2B2B2/3P1Q2/PPP3PP/RN3R1K b kq - 0 10,"Not so good move for black: 1. his king is still in the middle of the board, the bishop is projected twice, rear and front by a pawn. So white takes the pawn. I was worries that black would swoop down the b2 pawn with his queen but then I would have move white f4 bishop to c7 attack the d8 square, and one white had take the d1 rook with his queen, I would have taken the f7 pawn for checkmate"
