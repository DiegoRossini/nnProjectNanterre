There's no way to defend all of them. Exchanging Queens first doesn't help, as Korchnoi can win a piece [after 12... QxQ] with 13 NxN ch! before recapturing the Q. Spassky could save the piece with 12... K-Q1, but after 13 NxN Q-R5 ch 14 P-N3 QxN, Korchnoi has a winning positional advantage with his absolute control of Q5 and the backward Black Q-pawn, not to mention that the Black King would be trapped in the center and wide open to attack."
