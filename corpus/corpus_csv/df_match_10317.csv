1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I am not an e4 player, but as this is a thematic Sicilian, and I am a Sicilian devotee for life, I jumped in feet first.  This game features a Shveshnikov Sicilian, which my opponent plays well in the beginning, however, loses the thread and his game quickly falls apart.  The mating attack at the end is quite amazing."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Just your typical open Sicilian.
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"Not your typical approach to the Shvesh!  2...Nc6 is seen more.  We will transpose, however, as neither of us apparently were concerned with any advantage that the move order might have conveyed."

7,Nxd4,f3d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"More typical is 4...Nf6 followed by ...g6 or ...e6, with a Dragon or Sheveningen respectively."
9,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,"I didn't want to commit the dark-squared bishop just yet, as Black still has the option of playing the Classical set up with ...Nf6, and I wanted to be able to enter the Rauzer with Bg5."
10,e5,e7e5,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2np4/4p3/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"A hypermodern choice!  This anti-positional ""looking"" move has become a great favorite of mine.  Named after its discoverer, Evgeny Shveshnikov, this move weakens the d6-pawn, creates an outpost for White on d5 and keeps the Black dark-squared bishop hemmed in.  So why play it?  Because of the imbalance of dynamic chances versus structual disadvantage.  Black will typically have the initiative.  Black will also typically have the two bishops.  These two factors go a long way in the respectability of this opening.  Some of the top level players who have employed this system: Topalov, Kramnik, Leko, Carlsen, Shirov and Radjabov."
11,Ndb5,d4b5,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2np4/1N2p3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"Although, the Black knight is on f6, rather than the black pawn on d6, we slide right back into the main lines."
12,a6,a7a6,r1bqkbnr/1p3ppp/p1np4/1N2p3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,This shouldn't need explanation.
13,Na3,b5a3,r1bqkbnr/1p3ppp/p1np4/4p3/4P3/N1N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 7,
14,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1np1n2/4p3/4P3/N1N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 8,
15,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqkb1r/1p3ppp/p1np1n2/4p1B1/4P3/N1N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 3 8,"Beginning play against the d5-square.  In many lines White will give up the two bishops to gain control over d5.  If Black is ever allowed to play ...d5, then White has problems equalizing."
16,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/1p2bppp/p1np1n2/4p1B1/4P3/N1N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 4 9,"This is the first positional mistake.  Although, we can still get back to the main lines after 9. Nd5 b5, I decide to cash in on my opponents strategic inaccuracy.  More typical and best is 8...b5; 9. d5 Be7, when White's best move is 10. Bxf6."
17,Bxf6,g5f6,r1bqk2r/1p2bppp/p1np1B2/4p3/4P3/N1N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 9,

19,Nd5,c3d5,r1bqk2r/1p3ppp/p1np1b2/3Np3/4P3/N7/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 10,"It's still not too late to get to the main line after 10...b5.  This keeps the White knight on a3 out of c4.  White will then have the option of c3 (the better of the two) and c4, intending to play Nc2 and Nce3 to cement control of d5.  Black can then attempt an ...f5 break."
20,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/1p3ppp/p1np1b2/3Np3/4P3/N7/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 2 11,"Leaving the c4 square open, however, I played a little too automatically, and again allowed my opponent to get back to the main lines."
