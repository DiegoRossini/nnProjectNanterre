1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone, this match was against the highest rated player in my 1700-1800 mini-tournament, in fact just before the draw offer his rating was 1851.  This was a strange game of which again I was struck down by passivitis and I found myself exchanging my opponent's horsies which were threatening to run riot in my position for both my bishops.  I was very lucky to draw this game, how lucky only you the jury can tell me.  I kick off with e4 and my opponent gives me the Sicilian (c5)."
