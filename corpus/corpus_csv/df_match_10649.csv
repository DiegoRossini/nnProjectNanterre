1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Sorry folks, I just couldn't resist the title (my apologies to Tim Blake Nelson, John Turturro, and George Clooney). Here is recent game vs. one of the newest members of my team, adui. Since it was our first contest I had no idea what to expect. Midway through, I pick up a pawn - then foolishly blunder away the small advantage I had. I don't think either side will win any FIDE titles for our play, but the resulting endgame was quite interesting, as the game concluded with a smothered mate (something not commonly seen). Many thanks to my new teammate for the game, and I hope you enjoy:)"
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Yes, that's right - Mr. Scandanavian is branching out. I've been getting in some good work with the Sicilian as of late, so I deploy it."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"A little early methinks, but very playable."
4,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3pP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"?! This move was made strictly for it's experimentation value. I've gotten burned a few times recently with the line 3...Nc6 4. Bb5, and I wanted to see if I could diffuse that potential position. Yes, I know it's slow and doesn't develop, but like I said it was an experiment."
5,Qxd4,d1d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"?! This move was made strictly for it's experimentation value. I've gotten burned a few times recently with the line 3...Nc6 4. Bb5, and I wanted to see if I could diffuse that potential position. Yes, I know it's slow and doesn't develop, but like I said it was an experiment."
6,a6,a7a6,rnbqkbnr/1p1ppppp/p7/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"?! This move was made strictly for it's experimentation value. I've gotten burned a few times recently with the line 3...Nc6 4. Bb5, and I wanted to see if I could diffuse that potential position. Yes, I know it's slow and doesn't develop, but like I said it was an experiment."
7,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/1p1ppppp/p7/8/2BQP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 1 4,"White jumps on the center with a hit on the weak f7 square, and probably hopes for 4...b5 5. Bd5 Nc6 6. BxN dxN 7. QxQ KxQ and black loses the castling priveledge."
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/1p1ppppp/p1n5/8/2BQP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 2 5,Chasing the queen and developing.
9,Qe3,d4e3,r1bqkbnr/1p1ppppp/p1n5/8/2B1P3/4Q3/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 3 5,"?! Obviously the queen had to move, but I don't like Qe3 as it hinders the scope of white's dark squared bishop."
10,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/1p1ppppp/p1n2n2/8/2B1P3/4Q3/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 4 6,"Catching up in development and intending 0-0 at some point (notice that a future 0-0-0 puts the king on a half open file, and should probably be avoided)."
11,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkb1r/1p1ppppp/p1n2n2/8/2B1P3/4QN2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 5 6,"IMHO, this move signals black's intent for a very defensive set up."
12,e6,e7e6,r1bqkb1r/1p1p1ppp/p1n1pn2/8/2B1P3/4QN2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 7,"IMHO, this move signals black's intent for a very defensive set up."
13,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkb1r/1p1p1ppp/p1n1pn2/8/2B1P3/4QN2/PPP2PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 1 7,"?! Another somewhat questionable play on my part. Like I said, I was in a defensive frame of mind so I wanted to establish a solid position for my pawns. 7...Be7 was probably better."
14,b5,b7b5,r1bqkb1r/3p1ppp/p1n1pn2/1p6/2B1P3/4QN2/PPP2PPP/RNB2RK1 w kq - 0 8,"?! Another somewhat questionable play on my part. Like I said, I was in a defensive frame of mind so I wanted to establish a solid position for my pawns. 7...Be7 was probably better."
15,Be2,c4e2,r1bqkb1r/3p1ppp/p1n1pn2/1p6/4P3/4QN2/PPP1BPPP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 1 8,I remember thinking that white has somewhat declined the offer to be the aggressor. I was expecting 8. Bb3.
16,Bb7,c8b7,r2qkb1r/1b1p1ppp/p1n1pn2/1p6/4P3/4QN2/PPP1BPPP/RNB2RK1 w kq - 2 9,Rook to half open file (the c file ends up being a big area of interest throughout the rest of the game).
17,Nc3,b1c3,r2qkb1r/1b1p1ppp/p1n1pn2/1p6/4P3/2N1QN2/PPP1BPPP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 3 9,Rook to half open file (the c file ends up being a big area of interest throughout the rest of the game).
18,Rc8,a8c8,2rqkb1r/1b1p1ppp/p1n1pn2/1p6/4P3/2N1QN2/PPP1BPPP/R1B2RK1 w k - 4 10,Rook to half open file (the c file ends up being a big area of interest throughout the rest of the game).
19,a4,a2a4,2rqkb1r/1b1p1ppp/p1n1pn2/1p6/P3P3/2N1QN2/1PP1BPPP/R1B2RK1 b k - 0 10,"?! hmmmm....while white does have a pawn advantage on the queenside, this was probably a little premature as it leads to...."
20,b4,b5b4,2rqkb1r/1b1p1ppp/p1n1pn2/8/Pp2P3/2N1QN2/1PP1BPPP/R1B2RK1 w k - 0 11,"! Fairly obvious, but powerful all the same. White must retreat to d1 or a2, and both of those options are retreating moves to ineffectual squares."
21,Nd1,c3d1,2rqkb1r/1b1p1ppp/p1n1pn2/8/Pp2P3/4QN2/1PP1BPPP/R1BN1RK1 b k - 1 11,!? White pushes back with an aggressive thrust to undermine black's ideas on the queenside.
22,Be7,f8e7,2rqk2r/1b1pbppp/p1n1pn2/8/Pp2P3/4QN2/1PP1BPPP/R1BN1RK1 w k - 2 12,!? White pushes back with an aggressive thrust to undermine black's ideas on the queenside.
23,c3,c2c3,2rqk2r/1b1pbppp/p1n1pn2/8/Pp2P3/2P1QN2/1P2BPPP/R1BN1RK1 b k - 0 12,!? White pushes back with an aggressive thrust to undermine black's ideas on the queenside.
24,bxc3,b4c3,2rqk2r/1b1pbppp/p1n1pn2/8/P3P3/2p1QN2/1P2BPPP/R1BN1RK1 w k - 0 13,? Bad idea on my part. I thought about 12...a5 but was scared of 13. Bb5. Why? I'm not sure....I kind of lost my way during this portion of the game. I guess I had stubbornly made up my mind to play safe and think only of defense against this new opponent. I have successfully psyched MYSELF out!
25,Nxc3,d1c3,2rqk2r/1b1pbppp/p1n1pn2/8/P3P3/2N1QN2/1P2BPPP/R1B2RK1 b k - 0 13,! Bingo.......nice pawn push.

28,Ne8,f6e8,2rqnrk1/1b1pbppp/p1n1p3/4P3/P7/2N1QN2/1P2BPPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 1 15,All of a sudden I realize that my position is looking really weak.
29,Ne4,c3e4,2rqnrk1/1b1pbppp/p1n1p3/4P3/P3N3/4QN2/1P2BPPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 2 15,?! I liked 15. Rb1 better there.
30,d5,d7d5,2rqnrk1/1b2bppp/p1n1p3/3pP3/P3N3/4QN2/1P2BPPP/R1B2RK1 w - d6 0 16,"Time to take my medicine. My cramped position must expand, and I'll just have to deal with the consequences."
