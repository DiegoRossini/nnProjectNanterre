1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,English opening.  White generally responds Pe5 or Nf6.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Pe5.  White does well with Nc3 or maybe Pg3.
3,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"For some reason black seems to do better when white plays this, though it looks perfectly fine to me."
4,Qf6,d8f6,rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/5q2/4p3/2P1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,Black opts for a quick checkmate.  White should expect Bc5.  Not that this move must be defended against just yet.  But Nf3 should defend against that just fine.
5,d3,d2d3,rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/5q2/4p3/2P1P3/3P4/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"...this move too works, though white's pawns may get doubled by BxBe3 (in a couple of moves)."
6,Bc5,f8c5,rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/5q2/2b1p3/2P1P3/3P4/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"Yes, black is eying QxPf2#.  White knows better than to fall for such cheap theatrics."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/5q2/2b1p3/2P1P3/3P1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,"The knight!  Excellent.  This is rule 2:  Can I prevent force mate?  (In this case, checkmate equals force mate in one)."
8,d6,d7d6,rnb1k1nr/ppp2ppp/3p1q2/2b1p3/2P1P3/3P1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Mm, here the queen was already defending Nf3.  Black wants this knight because it is the only piece defending Bg5.  BxNf3, BnBf3, QxBg5 for free.  Always a shame to drop 3 points before the tenth move."
9,Bg5,c1g5,rnb1k1nr/ppp2ppp/3p1q2/2b1p1B1/2P1P3/3P1N2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"Mm, here the queen was already defending Nf3.  Black wants this knight because it is the only piece defending Bg5.  BxNf3, BnBf3, QxBg5 for free.  Always a shame to drop 3 points before the tenth move."
10,Qg6,f6g6,rnb1k1nr/ppp2ppp/3p2q1/2b1p1B1/2P1P3/3P1N2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,"Mm, here the queen was already defending Nf3.  Black wants this knight because it is the only piece defending Bg5.  BxNf3, BnBf3, QxBg5 for free.  Always a shame to drop 3 points before the tenth move."
11,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1k1nr/ppp2ppp/3p2q1/2b1p1B1/2P1P3/2NP1N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 3 6,"Mm, here the queen was already defending Nf3.  Black wants this knight because it is the only piece defending Bg5.  BxNf3, BnBf3, QxBg5 for free.  Always a shame to drop 3 points before the tenth move."
12,Bg4,c8g4,rn2k1nr/ppp2ppp/3p2q1/2b1p1B1/2P1P1b1/2NP1N2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 4 7,"Mm, here the queen was already defending Nf3.  Black wants this knight because it is the only piece defending Bg5.  BxNf3, BnBf3, QxBg5 for free.  Always a shame to drop 3 points before the tenth move."
13,Be2,f1e2,rn2k1nr/ppp2ppp/3p2q1/2b1p1B1/2P1P1b1/2NP1N2/PP2BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 5 7,"Mm, here the queen was already defending Nf3.  Black wants this knight because it is the only piece defending Bg5.  BxNf3, BnBf3, QxBg5 for free.  Always a shame to drop 3 points before the tenth move."
14,Bxf2+,c5f2,rn2k1nr/ppp2ppp/3p2q1/4p1B1/2P1P1b1/2NP1N2/PP2BbPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 8,The bishop for pawn was not a good idea.  Black does not gain sufficient advantage pulling the white king into the field.  But black still has a free bishop after the bishop/knight trade.
15,Kxf2,e1f2,rn2k1nr/ppp2ppp/3p2q1/4p1B1/2P1P1b1/2NP1N2/PP2BKPP/R2Q3R b kq - 0 8,Completely wrong.  This bishop was free.  And easy.
16,h6,h7h6,rn2k1nr/ppp2pp1/3p2qp/4p1B1/2P1P1b1/2NP1N2/PP2BKPP/R2Q3R w kq - 0 9,Completely wrong.  This bishop was free.  And easy.
17,Nd5,c3d5,rn2k1nr/ppp2pp1/3p2qp/3Np1B1/2P1P1b1/3P1N2/PP2BKPP/R2Q3R b kq - 1 9,:)  White will ignore the bishop threat in exchange for a rook.
18,hxg5,h6g5,rn2k1nr/ppp2pp1/3p2q1/3Np1p1/2P1P1b1/3P1N2/PP2BKPP/R2Q3R w kq - 0 10,Remarkable.  NxPc7+ nets white a cheap rook.
19,h3,h2h3,rn2k1nr/ppp2pp1/3p2q1/3Np1p1/2P1P1b1/3P1N1P/PP2BKP1/R2Q3R b kq - 0 10,This is no longer a hollow threat given that the queen is covering white's h rook.
20,Be6,g4e6,rn2k1nr/ppp2pp1/3pb1q1/3Np1p1/2P1P3/3P1N1P/PP2BKP1/R2Q3R w kq - 1 11,?  No.  Black can easily prevent the loss of Ra1 with BxNd5.
21,a4,a2a4,rn2k1nr/ppp2pp1/3pb1q1/3Np1p1/P1P1P3/3P1N1P/1P2BKP1/R2Q3R b kq - 0 11,?  No.  Black can easily prevent the loss of Ra1 with BxNd5.
22,c6,c7c6,rn2k1nr/pp3pp1/2ppb1q1/3Np1p1/P1P1P3/3P1N1P/1P2BKP1/R2Q3R w kq - 0 12,"That wasn't it.  Although black saves a pawn, it still costs a rook.  Na6 would be the proper way to stop white's knight aggression."
23,Nc7+,d5c7,rn2k1nr/ppN2pp1/2ppb1q1/4p1p1/P1P1P3/3P1N1P/1P2BKP1/R2Q3R b kq - 1 12,Finally!  I thought this day would never come.
24,Kd7,e8d7,rn4nr/ppNk1pp1/2ppb1q1/4p1p1/P1P1P3/3P1N1P/1P2BKP1/R2Q3R w - - 2 13,"Tasty.  Even if white loses the knight, 5 points is more than 3 points."
25,Nxa8,c7a8,Nn4nr/pp1k1pp1/2ppb1q1/4p1p1/P1P1P3/3P1N1P/1P2BKP1/R2Q3R b - - 0 13,"Tasty.  Even if white loses the knight, 5 points is more than 3 points."

27,Nb6+,a8b6,6nr/pp1k1pp1/nNppb1q1/4p1p1/P1P1P3/3P1N1P/1P2BKP1/R2Q3R b - - 2 14,"While white doubles black's pawns, the pawn trade would have been better."
