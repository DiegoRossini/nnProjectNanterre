1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game features the Evans Gambit of the Giuoco Piano.  I have to say, that defending against these attacks from White is not really my style of play.  I prefer more imbalanced positions like the Sicilian.  However, this game does have a very instructive motif, don't go pawn grabbing if your position is going to suffer.  In fact here, my strong opponent grabs the c-pawn and soon sees his position under such pressure, that all of his pieces are confined to the first rank!"

White sacrifices a pawn for center control and a kingside initiative with a quick attack on the Black king.  As is typical of these gambits, if Black can defend accurately, he stands better in the ensuing endgame, with plenty of chances for a win."
