1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"My favoured opening move, I have reasonable success with e4, but find d4 to lead to games where I am more comfortable. The move immediately strikes for the centre, and leaves many possiblities for tactical and positional matches."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The standard responce, black stakes his claim for the centre with no time lost."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"The queens gambit, I offer a pawn in exchange for the centre and a good initiative. Not often accepted at a high level, as the extra pawn cannot be held without losing material or initiatve."
4,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Copying my move, knowing that just as I could recapture the c4 pawn if he takes, so he can recapture the c5 pawn if I take it. This is a very active opening, both players can anticipate free movement of pieces as the centre is unlikely to stand for long."
5,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/2PP4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"Another pawn move. General opening advice states that you should avoid moving pawns as much as possible and should move pieces instead. However i felt that as my opponent has not yet moved any pieces I can afford to wait. The move also frees the f1 bishop and the queen, and directly protects the c4 pawn."
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2pp4/2PP4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,Following the good opening principles developing the knight to it's best square ready to stand in defence of his king when he castles kingside (with the queenside pawn structure as it is either side would be unwise to plan to castle long)
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/2pp4/2PP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 4,Developing to a natural square
8,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/2PP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"This is played for the same reason as my 3rd move, freeing the bishop which is preventing him from castling. Black here may be thinking about early castling then ripping apart the centre with some exchanges while my king is still central. However the immediate concern is developing quickly and seeing what opportunities arise."
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"Another solid move, the knight stands on his best square and could move to the e5 square, which is a nice outpost for him if I get the chance to attack"
10,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2pp4/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,"Again a solid move. Black delays bringing his bishops out until he has a better idea of where they should go, which is normally dictated by the game, rather than a set principle like the knights."
11,Bd3,f1d3,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2pp4/2PP4/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 6,"Brings the first bishop out to the centre. From here he looks towards blacks kingside, and can easily move round to the queenside if needed. The more modest Be2 may be better if there is a threat of Bg4 pinning the knight, however with the pawn on e6, there is no such threat."
12,Bd6,f8d6,r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2nbpn2/2pp4/2PP4/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 4 7,"Copying the move, and for the same reason. Both sides can now castle when ready."
13,Bd2,c1d2,r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2nbpn2/2pp4/2PP4/2NBPN2/PP1B1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 5 7,"I chose to develop my final minor piece ahead of castling, there is little difference between either choice, and on another day I may well have castled instead of delaying it for a few moves."
14,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2nbpn2/2pp4/2PP4/2NBPN2/PP1B1PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 6 8,"Castle often castle early is the advice, which black duly follows. with his king safe, he can now consider more attacking options, such as breaking up the centre, and moves like Qb6. We'll see what he decides..."
15,a3,a2a3,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2nbpn2/2pp4/2PP4/P1NBPN2/1P1B1PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 8,"I again delay castling, as from what I can see I am ready to do it when needed, so why do it before then...maybe not such good advice for beginners but I think you have to trust your instincts on when you should castle, rather than follow rules mechanically. The move is made to prevent Nb4, a pesky move driving the bishop to a remote square or trading a bishop for a knight."
16,a6,a7a6,r1bq1rk1/1p3ppp/p1nbpn2/2pp4/2PP4/P1NBPN2/1P1B1PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 9,"This move from black carries more threat than my identical move, as he has castled so can make a move like b5 if he wants, I have no intention of doing so, I had made the move defensively. It's interesting that the development from both sides is fairly symmetrical, this tends to lead to draws unless one side unbalances the position."
17,dxc5,d4c5,r1bq1rk1/1p3ppp/p1nbpn2/2Pp4/2P5/P1NBPN2/1P1B1PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 9,"I grow tired of the symmetry so decide to shake things up. This move forces the bishop to move a 2nd time in the opening (which goes against principles) and moves the bishop to a square where he only attacks a pawn, so his movement is restricted"
18,Bxc5,d6c5,r1bq1rk1/1p3ppp/p1n1pn2/2bp4/2P5/P1NBPN2/1P1B1PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 10,Recapturng the pawn - notice that from this new position the only way he can move is back
19,O-O,e1g1,r1bq1rk1/1p3ppp/p1n1pn2/2bp4/2P5/P1NBPN2/1P1B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 10,"I finally decide to castle, the position is starting to open up, so it's time for the king to get to safety. It's still too early to think about good plans other than development, and the symmetry gives few options at the minute, however there's plenty of time..."
20,Re8,f8e8,r1bqr1k1/1p3ppp/p1n1pn2/2bp4/2P5/P1NBPN2/1P1B1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 2 11,"A good move, moving the rook to a file that is likely to be opened in the future, which is where he belongs."
