1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"As the final round od the ASCC begins, I find myself facing Caleb J., who beat me pretty bad a few months ago in another tournament.  In this game, I jump out to a lead and am thrilled at the prospect of winning this last one, but it was not to be. Staying true to my philosophy of playing horrible moves, my 29th and final move was utterly shameful. Ah, well, so goes chess. I only wish that I could win winning positions. My last move so seriously disappointed me that I considered developing a severely bad attitude, but I eventually shook it off and now look forward to me next OTB tourney. I guarantee that you the reader will enjoy this game more than I the annotator. This is painful........"
