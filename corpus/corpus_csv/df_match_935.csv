1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Hey hey all. This is my third game trying this gambit that Ion turned me onto since i liked playing the F pawn to f5 when facing e4  nf3 white players.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"and so it starts with e5! ive played 3 games so far with this gambit, won the first 1, won this one which was my second game with this gambit, and lost the third with a big mistep where i was leading after my opponent blundered and i happily returned him the favor 2 moves later which was game costing for me though in exchange ><"
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"so wierd a game where i start with e5!  im usually a nc6 player, d5, or e6 player. i think the 3 latvian gambit games ive played are the only three in my history that i start with e5."
4,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,and here is the f5! i believe the usual reply by white is nxe5 or be4
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,but already with uncharted territory
6,fxe4,f5e4,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4p3/4p3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,so i procede with the plan. was expecting nxe5 still
7,Nxe4,c3e4,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4p3/4N3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,hmm odd reply. but this game has taken a semblance to an opening im used to so im comfortable with what to reply.
8,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/8/3pp3/4N3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,d5 have total mid control.
9,Nc3,e4c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/8/3pp3/8/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,unanticipated reply. most of the time whites will send their knight to g3.
10,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/ppp3pp/2n5/3pp3/8/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,and so i develop+ protect my e5 pawn. this game has a colorado gambit feel. except of having my LSB on f5 and my e pawn undevelopped. they have swap move order.
11,d3,d2d3,r1bqkbnr/ppp3pp/2n5/3pp3/8/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,hmm i wonder if d4 is stronger.
12,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/ppp3pp/2n2n2/3pp3/8/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,so i develop my other knight
13,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqkb1r/ppp3pp/2n2n2/3pp1B1/8/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 2 7,sends in his dsb. Be7 is playable in reply. but if he wants to take out his DSB and let my Queen develop to f6 ill take it. e5 will need the future extra reinforcement.
14,a6,a7a6,r1bqkb1r/1pp3pp/p1n2n2/3pp1B1/8/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,and so i sneak this in to keep the knight at bay.
15,Qe2,d1e2,r1bqkb1r/1pp3pp/p1n2n2/3pp1B1/8/2NP1N2/PPP1QPPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 1 8,decides to retain his DSB e5 still needs extra reinforcement and since he brought his queen in play. ill take mine into play now too
16,Qd6,d8d6,r1b1kb1r/1pp3pp/p1nq1n2/3pp1B1/8/2NP1N2/PPP1QPPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 2 9,e5 protection.
17,O-O-O,e1c1,r1b1kb1r/1pp3pp/p1nq1n2/3pp1B1/8/2NP1N2/PPP1QPPP/2KR1B1R b kq - 3 9,long castle! i face those so rarely early game. this is turning into quite a nice set up. time to remember Ion's advice on  opposite side castlings and who strikes first.
18,d4,d5d4,r1b1kb1r/1pp3pp/p1nq1n2/4p1B1/3p4/2NP1N2/PPP1QPPP/2KR1B1R w kq - 0 10,and so time to budge the knight thats protecting the king
19,Ne4,c3e4,r1b1kb1r/1pp3pp/p1nq1n2/4p1B1/3pN3/3P1N2/PPP1QPPP/2KR1B1R b kq - 1 10,exchange!
20,Nxe4,f6e4,r1b1kb1r/1pp3pp/p1nq4/4p1B1/3pn3/3P1N2/PPP1QPPP/2KR1B1R w kq - 0 11,exchange!
21,Qxe4,e2e4,r1b1kb1r/1pp3pp/p1nq4/4p1B1/3pQ3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/2KR1B1R b kq - 0 11,"i saw this move as a nice play, to put my DSB on bg7 and allow my LSB to develop gaining time on his queen and to future prevent his queen from going to h5 once he plays knight to g4"
22,g6,g7g6,r1b1kb1r/1pp4p/p1nq2p1/4p1B1/3pQ3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/2KR1B1R w kq - 0 12,"i saw this move as a nice play, to put my DSB on bg7 and allow my LSB to develop gaining time on his queen and to future prevent his queen from going to h5 once he plays knight to g4"
