2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"Black plays a few calmer moves before declaring his intentions with the key move of the opening. These are intended to, among other things, give White a chance to play Nf3 before Black plays ...c5, so that White will be unable to launch into an all-out offensive with f2-f4."

6,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,This is the key move of the Benoni. Black responds to White's center thrust with a direct assault from the wing.
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,Standard (in the Benoni) is 4.d5. Now we're headed for a transposition.
8,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/8/2Pp4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"After the original maneuvering, we've actually arrived at a Sicilian defense!"

12,Qc7,d8c7,rnb1kb1r/1pqp1ppp/p3pn2/8/2PNP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,Black prevents e4-e5.
13,a3,a2a3,rnb1kb1r/1pqp1ppp/p3pn2/8/2PNP3/P1N5/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,Both sides develop. Black puts pressure on e4 while White occupies the center directly.
14,b6,b7b6,rnb1kb1r/2qp1ppp/pp2pn2/8/2PNP3/P1N5/1P3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,Both sides develop. Black puts pressure on e4 while White occupies the center directly.

17,f3,f2f3,rn2kb1r/1bqp1ppp/pp2pn2/8/2PNP3/P1N1BP2/1P4PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 9,Stifling the Black Bishop's diagonal.
18,Be7,f8e7,rn2k2r/1bqpbppp/pp2pn2/8/2PNP3/P1N1BP2/1P4PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 10,Both players quietly continue their development and get their Kings to safety.

23,Qd2,d1d2,rn3rk1/1bq1bppp/pp1ppn2/8/2PNP3/P1NBBP2/1P1Q2PP/R4RK1 b - - 3 12,My opponent and I were discussing the game as we played. Around here we agreed that the position is tough: material equality; White has a strong center but no obvious way to proceed; Black's King is a bit safer and no one has any direct threats. I am not very good in such situations; my opponent confided that he doesn't feel confident with positional play either. So we'll see how both of us do!
24,Nbd7,b8d7,r4rk1/1bqnbppp/pp1ppn2/8/2PNP3/P1NBBP2/1P1Q2PP/R4RK1 w - - 4 13,"?! I don't much like this. White's e-pawn is now only defended by pieces, and Black's Bishop has much better prospects without the pawn on f3. Of course, it's also certainly a threatening play through the center. Now the question is who can make better use of White's aggression."
25,f4,f3f4,r4rk1/1bqnbppp/pp1ppn2/8/2PNPP2/P1NBB3/1P1Q2PP/R4RK1 b - - 0 13,"?! I don't much like this.

27,Qc2,d2c2,r4rk1/1bq1bppp/pp1ppn2/2n5/2PNPP2/P1NBB3/1PQ3PP/R4RK1 b - - 2 14,"The only way to hold the pawn, as far as I can see."
28,Rac8,a8c8,2r2rk1/1bq1bppp/pp1ppn2/2n5/2PNPP2/P1NBB3/1PQ3PP/R4RK1 w - - 3 15,"Setting up a tactic to win a pawn by threatening to remove the White LSB. By my calculation, White can no longer hold on to both his weak pawns without giving something away. To me, the toughest line looks like 15.b3 Nxd3 16.Qxd3 d5, where the c-pawn is pinned to the Knight so White's best continuation is 17.e5 dxc4 18.bxc4 Ng4 and Black will win the c-pawn shortly, although the position is anything but simple."
29,Nf3,d4f3,2r2rk1/1bq1bppp/pp1ppn2/2n5/2P1PP2/P1NBBN2/1PQ3PP/R4RK1 b - - 4 15,? See above for why I think this is inferior. White's Bd3 and Queen are overworked trying to defend all the pawns.
30,Nxd3,c5d3,2r2rk1/1bq1bppp/pp1ppn2/8/2P1PP2/P1NnBN2/1PQ3PP/R4RK1 w - - 0 16,"Of course White has the option to trade down further (18.Bxb6 Bxe4 etc) but that results in a powerful passed d-pawn for Black. With the Queens off the board, pawns are the name of the game."

35,e5,e4e5,5rk1/1b2bppp/pp1ppn2/4P3/2r2P2/P1N1BN2/1P4PP/R4RK1 b - - 0 18,?! Trying to entice 18...dxe5 19.fxe5 where White should be able to hold.
36,Ng4,f6g4,5rk1/1b2bppp/pp1pp3/4P3/2r2Pn1/P1N1BN2/1P4PP/R4RK1 w - - 1 19,Threatening White's unguarded Bishop--which is also the sole defender of the f-pawn. Sound familiar?
37,Rae1,a1e1,5rk1/1b2bppp/pp1pp3/4P3/2r2Pn1/P1N1BN2/1P4PP/4RRK1 b - - 2 19,Not good enough; 19.Bd2 or 19.Bxb6?! Rxf4 20.exd6 Bxd6 were the only ways to avoid falling further behind.
