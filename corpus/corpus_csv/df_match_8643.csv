I take a while to look for clever ideas, and seriously consider plotting on the assumption that my opponent will mimic me. That doesn't lead me to any useful lines of thought, though so I try to station my rook on a file somewhat likely to be open up. But at the rate things are going, I don't expect a lot of action any time soon."

Otherwise, Black has to retreat the knight, which is also not a great idea at this stage in the game. Though I suppose I could have pushed the g-pawn to harass it..."
19,Qxh5,d1h5,r1bq1rk1/ppp2pp1/2n4p/2b1p2Q/2B1P3/2NP3P/PPP2PP1/R1B1R1K1 b - - 0 10,"Moving my queen to the fifth rank on my tenth move was decidedly not part of my plan prior to the game. It had been a long day, however, and my cautiousness had eventually been supplanted by the knowledge that my opponents are just as capable as me at making mistakes. It was a watershed realization."

Nevertheless, this proves to be a useful square for my knight to occupy. I'm anything but conscious of that at the time, though."

I'd like to think that I'm being clever here, but there's some miscalculation involved--I think I forgot that capturing the bishop would give check. Nevertheless, this provides yet another juicy target (the rook on a1), and stands between the queen and the magical f6 square."
