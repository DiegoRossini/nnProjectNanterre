1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I chose to annotate this game because I think it is a good example of how a few passive moves by a player can lead to a positional advantage for his opponent.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I always choose the symmetrical variation of the English as I know it well and the Botvinnik setup is not as effective.
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"As usual, my annotations are for players who have more than a basic understanding of the game. If you dont understand the basic opening moves that I leave unannotated, there are several good books out there."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,"If White were to continue to maintain flexibility with his king's knight, by playing 3.g3, then I would continue the symmetrical motif.  Here I decide to play a ""Botvinnik"" setup myself, although it's technically called the Wedberg variation when black adopts it, after Swedish GM Tomas Wedberg."

I would say it's probably dynamically equal or very slightly better for Black.  At any rate Black has won the opening battle and achieved easy equality."

Its possible to reroute the dark-squared bishop to b2 via c1 after b3 also.  White's play is slow and I decide to begin a kingside attack."

White's position lacks any dynamic aspect and he will have to sit while I crank up the pressure on the position.  Admitting the positional mistakes with 16. Rf1 seems to be better.  White can at least hold for the time being.
