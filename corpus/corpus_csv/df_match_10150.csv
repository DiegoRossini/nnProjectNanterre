1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"1. e4 Bobby Fischer once wrote that 1. e4 was ""best by test."""
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The Sicilian Defense is one of the most popular responses to 1. e4.  It signals a willingness to do battle, because it avoids symmetry."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Developing and centralizing.  The knight benefits more than any piece by its proximity to the center.
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,The Accelerated Dragon.  Black is going to fianchetto his king's bishop and try to obtain counterplay along the dark squares.
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,The principled continuation.  White will try to develop rapidly and attack black's position.
6,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Exchanging a wing pawn for a center pawn, which is a plus for black.  Look, however at the open lines for the white bishops.  Black cannot develop as quickly as white."
7,Nxd4,f3d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/6p1/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"The knight moves twice, but the loss of time is compensated by the fact that material equilibrium is reestablished, and the knight is well placed in the center of the board."
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,Developing and centralizing.
9,Nxc6,d4c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2N3p1/8/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"Playable, but it is the third move of the knight, and it exchances it for a piece that has moved only once.  White's advantage in development is somewhat mitigated now."
10,bxc6,b7c6,r1bqkbnr/p2ppp1p/2p3p1/8/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,5. ...dxc6 would allow the exchange of queens and black would forfeit the right to castle.
11,Bd3,f1d3,r1bqkbnr/p2ppp1p/2p3p1/8/4P3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,The bishop is more active on c4.  A piece's power is tied to its mobility.  The Bishop on d3 is restricted by the pawns on c2 and e4.
12,Bg7,f8g7,r1bqk1nr/p2pppbp/2p3p1/8/4P3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 7,The bishop rakes the long diagonal.  Compare its mobility to the white bishop on d3.
13,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk1nr/p2pppbp/2p3p1/8/4P3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 3 7,Castling is usually good.  It secures the king and prepares to activate the rook.
14,d6,d7d6,r1bqk1nr/p3ppbp/2pp2p1/8/4P3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,"With the dark square bishop actively posted, Black wants to do the same with the bishop on c8."
15,Nd2,b1d2,r1bqk1nr/p3ppbp/2pp2p1/8/4P3/3B4/PPPN1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 8,8. Nc3 is probably better.  White's most active idea is to proceed with development and then play f4-f5.
16,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/p3ppbp/2pp1np1/8/4P3/3B4/PPPN1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 9,"Black's pawn structure is sound, and he wants to complete his development."
17,c3,c2c3,r1bqk2r/p3ppbp/2pp1np1/8/4P3/2PB4/PP1N1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 9,Perhaps not the best use of time.  Every move is precious and ought to be optimized.
18,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/p3ppbp/2pp1np1/8/4P3/2PB4/PP1N1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 10,Black has caught up in development.
19,Nf3,d2f3,r1bq1rk1/p3ppbp/2pp1np1/8/4P3/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 2 10,Blocking the f-pawn.  White now has no active plan of attack.
20,c5,c6c5,r1bq1rk1/p3ppbp/3p1np1/2p5/4P3/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 11,"Black decides to activate the c8 bishop along the other long diagonal, but this might not be the best decision."
