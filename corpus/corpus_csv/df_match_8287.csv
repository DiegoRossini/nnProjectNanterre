1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game was my 9th here at a rating of around 1500 just like my opponent. Like it happens in my games rather often, this was not won by me.. but lost by my precious opponent. He played well and brave but made two unfortunate passive moves backwards when the counter-play should have taken place."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,So far nothing new under the sun. A variation of the Semi-Slav played by many Grand Masters in the 90s but more or less disappeared in the new millenium. White is ahead in development while Black gained a small run in creating outposts and building an attack.

Prevents the advance of Black's e-pawn, keeps a close eye on a centre square, but sadly enough gives away the adventage White had in development and what is most important (and it is going to turn out within two more moves) weakens the e4 square, the one Black was racing for to make an outpost there."

Be7 (preventing it and getting closer to castle) 8.Bd3 (attacking the e4 knight) 8... f5 (defending it) 9.0-0 0-0 10.Rc1 (occupying the most probably opening c-file) 10... Ndf6 is the logical line I think. Let us face it, at analyzis time it is always easier to find the proper moves :-)"

Be7 preventing the bright knight from going to g5 and getting ahead both in development and in securing His Highness was the cool and cautions continuation. Exchanging a precious outpost for a bishop that has no use for a long while is a damn waste!!"
