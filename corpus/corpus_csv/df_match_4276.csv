3,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Even though this odd move does not protect my e pawn, it is required to pull a Bryntse gambit, which is my intention."
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Even though this odd move does not protect my e pawn, it is required to pull a Bryntse gambit, which is my intention."

8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/6N1/4pP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,!? I attack Black's weak f7 pawn while leaving my queen open for an attack. Black has two main moves here: Either block the bishop with 5...e6 where the advanced e pawn eventually falls (5...e6 6.Nc3) OR threaten the white queen with 5...Bg4. Both are good.

12,Nxg4,f6g4,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p5/6N1/2B1pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 7,"It is possible to switch the order of moves 6 and 7 without any consequences, although Black can make the mistak of not taking the queen in this variation."
