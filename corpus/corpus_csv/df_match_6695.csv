1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,One of my favorite openings. It's flexible and usually gives White the Q-side spatial advantage.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Logical.

4,Qf6,d8f6,rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/5q2/4p3/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,"Very unusual, and a little premature to develop the Q. It also blocks the Black KN from its natural square."
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/5q2/4p3/2P5/2N2N2/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 3,"Now because of Black's Q and KN, his KB is blocked in."
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1b1kbnr/pppp1ppp/2n2q2/4p3/2P5/2N2N2/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 4 4,"Now because of Black's Q and KN, his KB is blocked in."
7,g3,g2g3,r1b1kbnr/pppp1ppp/2n2q2/4p3/2P5/2N2NP1/PP1PPP1P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"Now because of Black's Q and KN, his KB is blocked in."

10,h6,h7h6,r1b1kb1r/ppppnpp1/2n2q1p/4p3/2P5/2N2NP1/PP1PPPBP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,My King is now safe and I still have both center Pawns held in reserve to open the position at my leisure.

This would also strengthen the QB3 square, in preparation for ...P-QB3, sealing off the QB file as an avenue of attack."
