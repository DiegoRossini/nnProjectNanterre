1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,The start of the Sicilian defence.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,The start of the Sicilian defence.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Preparing to fight over d4.  Also allows for a fight over e5 later on.
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,Supports development to d5.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"White switches focus to d5, supported by the e4 pawn."
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,More focus on d4.
7,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 4,Further fighting over d5 by White.  The trouble with this is white has to wait for Black to start that fight and may risk being outmanouevred if Black pushes the kingside instead.
8,Bd6,f8d6,r1bqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/2nbp3/2p5/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 4 5,The Black LSB is now very restricted as is the black pawn centre.
9,d4,d2d4,r1bqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/2nbp3/2p5/2BPP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,A line like 5. ... cxd4 6. Nxd4 Nxd4 7. Qxd4 Bf8 looks very good for white.
10,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/pp1p1ppp/2nbpn2/2p5/2BPP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 6,"Which is probably why black ignores it.  Black instead atacks the e4 pawn, although the c3 knight defends it adequately."
11,d5,d4d5,r1bqk2r/pp1p1ppp/2nbpn2/2pP4/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,Probably the best square for the knight to retain activity.
12,exd5,e6d5,r1bqk2r/pp1p1ppp/2nb1n2/2pp4/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,Probably the best square for the knight to retain activity.
13,exd5,e4d5,r1bqk2r/pp1p1ppp/2nb1n2/2pP4/2B5/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,Probably the best square for the knight to retain activity.
14,Ne7,c6e7,r1bqk2r/pp1pnppp/3b1n2/2pP4/2B5/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 8,Probably the best square for the knight to retain activity.
15,Qe2,d1e2,r1bqk2r/pp1pnppp/3b1n2/2pP4/2B5/2N2N2/PPP1QPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 2 8,"Intending to pin the knight on e7, but the threat is rather hollow since Black can escape easily by castling (which he probably wants to do anyway) without hanging the knight.  Probably better was 8. Nb5 which leads to:

A: 8. Nb5 Bc7 9. d6 Bxd6 10. Nxd6+ Kf8 11. Nxf7 Qa5+
B: 8. Nb5 Bb8 9. d6 (after which White should win a piece at least)
C: 8. Nb5 Qa5+ 9. Bd2 (due to the cramped queenside, this either hangs a piece or transposes into line D below)
D: 8. Nb5 Qb6 9. a4 a5 10. Bb3 (intending to follow Nd2 Nc4 - probably winning for white but the sequence is long and it's hard to be sure how black will defend)"
16,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp1pnppp/3b1n2/2pP4/2B5/2N2N2/PPP1QPPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 3 9,"Black duly castles, unpinning the knight"
17,O-O,e1g1,r1bq1rk1/pp1pnppp/3b1n2/2pP4/2B5/2N2N2/PPP1QPPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 4 9,"White's castle has three effects: it unpins the queen before a pin can form, it activates the kingside rook and it tucks the king away."
18,Qa5,d8a5,r1b2rk1/pp1pnppp/3b1n2/q1pP4/2B5/2N2N2/PPP1QPPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 5 10,"Seems weak to me.  Black's queenside is lightly developed and the black pawn on c5 blocks the queen from swinging quickly over to the active kingside.  9. ... B6 to prepare Bb7 and Re8 looks interesting to me, and with the white pawn on d5 so far ahead of its army, white might struggle to defend it easily"
19,Bd2,c1d2,r1b2rk1/pp1pnppp/3b1n2/q1pP4/2B5/2N2N2/PPPBQPPP/R4RK1 b - - 6 10,Obviously preparing a discovered attack on the queen.
20,Qb4,a5b4,r1b2rk1/pp1pnppp/3b1n2/2pP4/1qB5/2N2N2/PPPBQPPP/R4RK1 w - - 7 11,Meets the threat by posing a new one at b2 and c2 (as in 11: Ne4 Qxb2 12: Nxd6 Qxc2 although 13: Qxe7 looks good)
21,Ne4,c3e4,r1b2rk1/pp1pnppp/3b1n2/2pP4/1qB1N3/5N2/PPPBQPPP/R4RK1 b - - 8 11,Nb5 was better as it prevents Qb6 protecting the d6 bishop
22,Qb6,b4b6,r1b2rk1/pp1pnppp/1q1b1n2/2pP4/2B1N3/5N2/PPPBQPPP/R4RK1 w - - 9 12,The trade leaves Black with a damaged kingside pawn structure - not as useful as the reuslt of Nb5 would have been but better than nothing. The defences around the king are damaged by more than the attack thanks to the completely immobile lsb and a8 rook.
23,Nxf6+,e4f6,r1b2rk1/pp1pnppp/1q1b1N2/2pP4/2B5/5N2/PPPBQPPP/R4RK1 b - - 0 12,The trade leaves Black with a damaged kingside pawn structure - not as useful as the reuslt of Nb5 would have been but better than nothing. The defences around the king are damaged by more than the attack thanks to the completely immobile lsb and a8 rook.
24,gxf6,g7f6,r1b2rk1/pp1pnp1p/1q1b1p2/2pP4/2B5/5N2/PPPBQPPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 13,The trade leaves Black with a damaged kingside pawn structure - not as useful as the reuslt of Nb5 would have been but better than nothing. The defences around the king are damaged by more than the attack thanks to the completely immobile lsb and a8 rook.
25,Bh6,d2h6,r1b2rk1/pp1pnp1p/1q1b1p1B/2pP4/2B5/5N2/PPP1QPPP/R4RK1 b - - 1 13,"Immediately, a threat on the f8 rook.  Gives good control over the important g7 square (Qg7 is mate now, thoguh White can't hit it yet).  White needs to watch for Nf5, perhaps through his own Nh4."
26,Re8,f8e8,r1b1r1k1/pp1pnp1p/1q1b1p1B/2pP4/2B5/5N2/PPP1QPPP/R4RK1 w - - 2 14,"The open file, threatening the queen, is the rook's natural home."
