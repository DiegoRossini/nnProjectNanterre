1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"From a tournament, my second game with Jbravo58d. I lost the first one on passed pawns. White's first four moves and Black's first 3 are a theme opening of the tournament."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,classic response
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,white knight attacks Black's e3 pawn
4,Qf6,d8f6,rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/5q2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"In this variation, black queen comes out on f6 to defend the e3 pawn. I usually do not like taking out my queen early and I think in most cases it is a mistake to defend a piece with a queen anyway."
5,d4,d2d4,rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/5q2/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,white attacks the e3 pawn again. The other benefit is that white bishop on c1 has now an open diagonal to take part in the game
6,Bd6,f8d6,rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/3b1q2/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,"Black defends it again with the bishop on d6. If it was not for the themed opening with the first four moves set, I would have played d5 to restrict the black queen and c1-g5 to a attack the black queen and after f6-g6, develop my knight on b1 to c3 to defend my e pawn"
7,Bg5,c1g5,rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/3b1q2/4p1B1/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,White attacks Black's queen
8,Qg6,f6g6,rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/3b2q1/4p1B1/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 3 5,"This is the first ""free"" move of black. He moves his queen to g6 and attacks the e pawn"
9,dxe5,d4e5,rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/3b2q1/4P1B1/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"White ignores the attacks on the e pawn and takes Black's e5 and attacks the black bishop on d6. Black can play g6xe4 check, and probably the best move for white at that point would be d1-e2. f1-e2 would be met by d6xe5 with a Black strong attack on b2 and White rook on a1. Therefore, if 5... Qxe4+, 6.f1-e1 Bxe5, 7. Nxe5 Qxe5 with a fine game for Black despite being behind in development"
10,Bxe5,d6e5,rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/6q1/4b1B1/4P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,Black has now an eye on the rook on a1
11,c3,c2c3,rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/6q1/4b1B1/4P3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,a protection against the bishop attack as I was not keen on trading pieces at that point. I was happy to allow the check from Qxe4 as it will allow me to develop white chasing away the Black queen across the board
12,Qxe4+,g6e4,rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/8/4b1B1/4q3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,The Qxe4 comes with check as expected
13,Be2,f1e2,rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/8/4b1B1/4q3/2P2N2/PP2BPPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 1 7,Again not keen on trading pieces. My idea was to castle white Black's king in still in the middle of the board. Nothing works like an absolute pin... There is nothing that Black can attack that is not well defended
14,d5,d7d5,rnb1k1nr/ppp2ppp/8/3pb1B1/4q3/2P2N2/PP2BPPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 8,Not sure what this move was about. I think Black was trying to open up a1-f6 diagonale so that he can attack my rook but he surely must have known that I was about to develop my knight with tempo by attack his queen. By the queen his queen could not run too far away from the bishop which itself was under attack from the knight on f3
15,Nbd2,b1d2,rnb1k1nr/ppp2ppp/8/3pb1B1/4q3/2P2N2/PP1NBPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 8,I attack Black's queen. She has nowhere else to go but f5
16,Qf5,e4f5,rnb1k1nr/ppp2ppp/8/3pbqB1/8/2P2N2/PP1NBPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 9,"As expected, Black's queen in her retreat must protect the bishop. So far so good..."
17,Bd3,e2d3,rnb1k1nr/ppp2ppp/8/3pbqB1/8/2PB1N2/PP1N1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 3 9,"White attacks Black's queen. The idea here is to trade piece my white squared bishop with Black's black squared bishop and a strong attack on Black's position. if 9...Qxd3, 10. Nxe5 (a double attack on the f7 pawn and Black queen on d3) Qf5 11.f4 preparing my queen to join the attack after castling"
18,Qe6,f5e6,rnb1k1nr/ppp2ppp/4q3/3pb1B1/8/2PB1N2/PP1N1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 4 10,Black decides not to trade pieces and retreats again constrained by the cover it must provide to his black squared bishop
19,O-O,e1g1,rnb1k1nr/ppp2ppp/4q3/3pb1B1/8/2PB1N2/PP1N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 5 10,"I castle. Now, let's go for the open centre and try and pin a piece to the Black king..."
20,Qd6,e6d6,rnb1k1nr/ppp2ppp/3q4/3pb1B1/8/2PB1N2/PP1N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 6 11,Black again takes his queen out of the e file to avoid a deadly pin to the queen. But the bishop must stay thre and wait patiently for the rook pin
