1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

I feel honoured!  A Master who I had never played or before with a rating of 2345, sent me a challenge!  Despite the fact that I had all the extra games I accepted the challenge with some gusto.  Maybe, after being Freddied quite often you could say that I was a glutton for punishment though!  He gave me the Lopez, I was considering playing the Open Lopez but after the debacle with Dave I really wanted to redeem myself somehow.  The first 7 moves follow Autopilot Part 1, but on the 7th move I played the Main Line d6.  I still stuck to that bally DB like the proverbial limpet though!"
