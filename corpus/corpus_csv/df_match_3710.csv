By move nine, I have offered up a pawn to the opponent twice already. If you see a sacrifice for a gain in activity, you should always just play it, after calculating the basic variations. Since gaining activity is the main goal of chess, you will be doing the right thing. Usually, the opponent cannot use a pawn actively until the endgame. Most players are afraid to sacrifice activity unless it leads to a direct attack against the opponent's king. They are under the delusion that the opponent can simply neutralize their activity and trade to an endgame, where their material is decisive. Certainly that CAN happen, and the activity is a temporary advantage. Yet it is a much greater advantage than a pawn, and can easily lead to a quick win as well as gaining other permanent advantages. There are countless obstacles a player needs to pass before consolidating a pawn advantage. Also, it is much harder to find good moves when you have less activity, because that implies a defence. The attacker just makes threats, while the defender needs to check the opponent's tactics and think much harder."

If your opponent has the better activity, he will easily counter your weaker forces and repulse your attack. But your more active pieces will overwhelm the defense easily if they are more active than them. Gaining activity is simple: Develop your pieces on the squares where they are most advanced and can also go to other forward squares. Also, do not capture the opponent's pieces unless you can get a tactical advantage, since that will increase your opponent's activity while decreasing yours. By the way, notice I am not talking about doubled pawns, open files, and space etc. The chess books offer these ideas to think about a position, but it is too much. All these ideas are smaller aspects of activity. Doubled pawns, if really weak, will always reduce the activity of your pieces or allow the opponent's pieces to become active by attacking the weakness. Open files, if occupied naturally give you activity. Just thinking about activity in general is much more useful for most class players to avoid getting too confused."
