1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game between brewinski and flemming was played during the Toccata team mini-tournament. After a fairly passive opening, the middle game turns to chaos. The game has incredible swings of fortune. White, a Queen down, manages to draw the game, but as we shall see in the end game, analysed by Yttrio and l-d-j, there are missed chances for Black and White to play for a win. Many thanks to Yttrio, l-d-j and liam1260 for their comments, corrections and analysis."

It leaves b7 undefended and, as we shall see, this proves to be a mistake: 3.d4 Bg4 4.dxe5 Bxf3 5.Qxf3 dxe5 and now White starts an attack on f6. 6.Bc4 Nf6 7.Qb3 - a double attack on f7 and b7.

The difference is that the light square Bishop is already developed which allows castling and Re1, defending e4 and allowing c3 to be played shortly after. With this in mind, 4.Bb5 pins the Knight and prepares for d4, while keeping Nc3 ready to defend e4 when Black plays Nf6."
