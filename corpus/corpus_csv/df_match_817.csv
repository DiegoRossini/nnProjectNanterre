The other would have been to move the King up one row to allow the Queen to protect the rook, and then I wouldn't have been able to make the next move with my bishop and gain an advantage in territory.

The two pieces that can help at this point are the bishop and the Queen, but the queen can only make a useless interposition, and if the bishop goes to f4 to block my queen's path to protect the knight (thereby allowing the king to escape mate by taking the knight), I would take the bishop with my queen and mate on the next move. One thing that I really find that helps is before actually submitting my move in a game, I analyze the board first to see what my last few moves were (which can sometimes serve as a reminder of what move I wanted to make next) and I can play around with different outcomes, like if I move my Queen here, what would White do in response, and things like that."
