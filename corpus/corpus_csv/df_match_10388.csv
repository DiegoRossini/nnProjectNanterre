1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"Round 4 of the 2007 Alabama State Championship begins, and I've got the white pieces against an old nemesis. I'm 0-3 lifetime vs. Miles, and my attitude about this tournament starts to falter a little. I really want to finish day 1 with a 3/4 score, but this is gonna be tough. I play my new favorite, 1. Nf3."

As I mentioned, I've played this guy 3 times before, and each time I simply got worn down in a endgame. I've never gotten into a tactical shootout with him before. My goal here is to sack the knight to double his f pawns, then BxN to double his c pawns if I can. Then, I reason, that I can gets my rooks vertical quicker than he can to snag a few targets. This whole upcoming sequence just doesn't work out like I envision it......"

31,f3,f2f3,r4rk1/ppp2p1p/2nb4/1B3p2/3Pn2P/4PP2/PP4P1/R2R2K1 b - - 0 16,"?! Black gets a little conservative, and takes a little breather to regroup. I thought for sure he would keep his knight close to my king. I now entertain the idea of a massive pawn push on the kingside if I can double his c pawns first."
