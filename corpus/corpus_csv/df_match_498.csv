1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Morphy's favorite response against 1. e4. Morphy delighted in piece play, and there is more than ample opportunity for it in the Open Games."

3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"(!?) - At one time thought to be inferior, but revived by Garry Kasparov in some of his World Championship encounters. (It is most likely that this move will lead to the Scotch Game, or even ... the Scotch Gambit.) It is certainly completely playable, and abides by all the opening principles. [3.Bc4 Nf6 4.d4 exd4 5.e5,  is the normal move order to arrive at the position we achieve in the game.]"

6,exd4,e5d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"(!?) - Gambiting a pawn, which was common and accepted at that time. [ 4.Nxd4 is a straight Scotch Opening.] Still acceptable play today."

8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,(!?) - White thinks to disturb Morphy's development. White has great play for the Pawn that was sacrificed.

10,d5,d7d5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3pP3/2Bp4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq d6 0 6,"(!) - Black does not move or retreat a well-posted piece. Instead he vigorously counter-attacks in the center! (Hitting White's Bishop.) We now have transposed to a Scotch Opening. This is actually the most common response today, but in the time of Morphy, it was unheard of. One of many ways Morphy played ahead of his time."

19,Bxe4,d3e4,r2qk2r/p1pb1ppp/2p5/2bpP3/4B3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 10,"(!!) - This, and Black's next move, are in reality so complicated that I seriously doubt many people could have calculated this combination to its logical conclusion. Perhaps Paul Morphy was guided by his superior intuition! The move, 10...Qh4 is a zwischenzug, or an in-between move. This is a nice way for Black to keep the advantage."

GM Edmar Mednis writes in a book of his: ""A perfectly reasonable move. White wants Black to capture on e4 with his pawn and thus be left with a broken pawn structure on the Queenside. After the routine 11.0-0, Qxe4; Black has, at no cost to himself; the advantage of the Bishop-pair in an open position. He therefore has a very pleasant advantage.""

(In some variations - in order to reach an evaluation that is beyond dispute - you sometimes had to calculate more than 15 moves ahead. I don't know if Morphy did this though GMs are capable if I am not mistaken, but instead relied on his intuition and his genius. We do know, from various reliable eyewitness reports, that Morphy could calculate 5-7 moves ahead very rapidly. We will never know exactly how far ahead Morphy did calculate, however.)"
