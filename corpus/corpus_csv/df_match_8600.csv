2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"OK, I really played this move fast, cycling between all the opening moves in two mini-tournaments I had just started. I thought I was playing the third move of the Ruy Lopez here. Fortunately for me, this is a real line of the Sicilian too, the Rossolimo, also known as the Hispano-Sicilian because of its similarity to the Ruy Lopez (Spanish Game)."

She could run, but almost all available squares allow white to get her by moving the knight with discovered check. Of the few that don't, such as 17. ... Qb6, white wins with 18.
