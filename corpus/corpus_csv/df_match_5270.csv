6,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,5.Bb5?! First move out of book.  I was not prepared for this move.  Does White want to trade the versatile knight in this closed position for his strong light bishop which normally goes on the d3 square?  Only about a dozen players over 2100 have played this move.  Definitely some advantage for black now.  Two best responses are block pin with Bd7 or continue with thematic Qb6 earlier than normal.  I chose Qb6 thinking it would force the trade or bring more play to the queenside where I have a space advantage.  I thought the line would progress 5...Qb6 6.Bxc6+ bxc6 with my side pawn toward the center which would soon continue to pressure d4.

I did not think about this move because normally a well timed a3 and b4 pawn advance is very strong for white which is now lost. I decide to open play a bit here, take the d4 pawn and being in my kingside knight into play with ...Nge7 and then ...Nf5 to put pressure on the backward pawn that white would now have to defend."
