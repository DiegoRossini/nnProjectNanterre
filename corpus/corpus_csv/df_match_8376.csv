1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone, 

I have just taken a trip down memory lane and found happiness.  I feel like doing this after yet another Expert loss.  Here is another game against The Dentist which ended in an overwhelming victory for me at the end.  Here is the beginning and The Dentist kicks off with d4 against me.  He did that for many games against me and then tried e4 and the Patzer's Opening.  Thankfully I beat him then but that is another story.  Anyhow, on with this one and I respond with d5."

I hope this will proved a useful lesson to all ye beginners and intermediate players on how to convert such a material advantage to a forced win."
