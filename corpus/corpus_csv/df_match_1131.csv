1,g3,g2g3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/6P1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Benko's Opening (I almost always open with g3) generally with the intention of playing the Kings Indian Attack or one of the many king side fianchetto openings.

I've read this is an uncommon opening and I don't see any names for it. I'm sure I'm making a mistake here by opening with Bg2 but it tends to be how I continue unless Nf6 is played in response to g3."

Black's response, I guess, is a Semi-Slav defense. 

As white I'm beginning laying the groundwork for the Kings Indian Attack. Apparently, looking back on this game, better here for white would have been to castle. I played d3, defending the e4 square from the knight on f6."

Black: Qa5+

I played a3 here... completely out of book, but I felt as though he was going to play Bb4+. I have played several games where my opponent and I were in this same position and they followed the 4th sequence with Bishop b4 check. Unfortunately, I was in a blitz game and didn't think about my prophylactic a3 leaving Qa5+ open."

Black: Bb4

I don't know if it's considered a good move or not, but I like Black's choice to play Bb4 here. My first reaction was to take with the a pawn but I quickly saw how that sequence would result in the loss of the rook on a1. The a pawn is effectively pinned and he's got a strong attack on the Knight on d2 and my king who still hasn't castled. We were playing with semi-tight time restraints as it was a blitz game so there wasn't a lot of time to analyze position. 

I played Nbd2, continuing my KIA development and blocking the check on my King."

Black Bd6

I played c3 attacking the Bishop and putting another line of defense up against the Queen on a5. I had two intentions here, one was to have the black bishop retreat and two planning to attack with my pawn on b2. I wanted to push it to b4, furthering development, and hoping the queen would either retreat or possibly move to a4. a4 would be a blunder, but I see stuff like that a lot in blitz games."

Black: dxe4

I played e4 completing my opening development and was fairly confident going into the late opening early middle game. I neglected to castle which probably was a mistake. I've been experimenting with waiting longer to castle and seeing how the game develops with the rapid development that not sacrificing a move to castling allows.

My opponent took my pawn on e4 effectively beginning the material exchanges that are usually inevitable in blitz games."

I quickly took back the lost pawn and my opponent surprised me with Ng4. I expected my opponent to bring his bishop back to c7 preventing me from pushing the e pawn to e5 attacking the Knight, yet still maintaining a strong presence on the dark b-h diagonal."

I attacked with my Knight on c4 forking his Queen and Bishop. My opponent shocked me by forking both my queen and rook at f2. I hadn't even considered this possibility when I moved my Knight to c4."

Black: Qc5+

I took my opponents Knight on f2 with my King and he responded by checking my King with his Queen on c5 and attacking my Knight on c4. This was a very bad move on my part. Going back to move 10, had I taken the Bishop on d6 with my Knight I would have forked his King and Bishop. This would have allowed me to gain the Knight on f2 without losing any material. I noticed this immediately after I made the move, but unfortunately it was a blitz game and I was trying to play intuitively. Looking back this may have been my worst move."

Black: Nd7

I wanted to regain some tempo and material and I saw a clear opportunity to do so by taking my opponents Bishop on d6... This had the added benefit of attacking his King (check) and giving me control of the d file for the most part. At this point, I expected to bring a rook to the semi-open d file and have my opponent castle. My opponent blocked the check by moving his Knight to d7."

Black: Qb3

I strengthened my control of the d file by bringing my Rook from a over to d1 supporting my Queen. My opponent moved his Queen to d2, I guess attacking the b pawn and planning the check that would be a result. I believe better for black would have been to Castle here. I had already considered this move by black when I moved my queen to d6. My Knight on f3 would block at d2 and attack forcing him to move to a4 or b5/b6. Qa2 would be a major blunder on his part. After Qa2 Rda1; Qb3, Qc4, Qd5 would all result in the loss of his Queen."

Black: Qa4

I moved my Rook on a to d2 with the intention of doubling my rooks and gaining more control of the d file. My opponent responded by moving his Queen to a4. I'm not sure what his plan was here. I guess he was planning to attack the weak pawn on e4, but this was a fatal mistake. Mate can easily be achieved from here. MUCH better was Qb5."

Black: Resigned

The game ended when I moved my bishop to c5. From here mate can be achieved several ways... though I was trying to get mate in one after: Nxc5 Qd8#

Had Black responded 
16. Kd8 
17. Ne5 Qd4+ (his only chance)
18. Rxd4 Rf8 
19. Qxf8+ Kc7
20. Qd6+ Kd8
21. Nxf7+ Ke8
22. Qxe6#

Had black not sacrificed his rook at move 18... you have: 19. Nxf7+ Ke8 20. Qe7#

All in all a good game. Black made some poor choices, as did I. I submit the game wondering how I played it wrong outside of move 11. I really enjoyed this game. Up until the end, I never really felt confident in a victory. I'm proud of the result, obviously, but I really like saving all of my games and reviewing them. Annotating them is a good way to see where my mindset is as I progress."
