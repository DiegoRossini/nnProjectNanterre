1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

My matches in the Inter-team championship 1700-1800 are coming to a close.  I was certainly pleased with this result.  My opponent's rating at the start of the game was 1686 so I got 7.4 points out of this.  Normally it is me that has passivitis but somehow I inflicted the malady on my opponent.  I am black and I end up playing the closed Ruy Lopez."
