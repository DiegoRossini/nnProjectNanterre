15,d4,d2d4,r1bqk2r/2p2ppp/p1np1n2/1pb1p3/3PP3/1BP2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,"White attacks the centre with the pre-planned d4. In my short time playing this opening, it seems like White's intention is to get into a position similar to this and play d4. Although under-developed on the queen-side, White has a strong pawn structure and a lot of pieces are aimed towards Black's king-side."
16,Ba7,c5a7,r1bqk2r/b1p2ppp/p1np1n2/1p2p3/3PP3/1BP2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 9,"A GK computer inaccuracy as it recommends 8. Bb6. That would provide additional support to c7 and a5, if needed, and doesn't restrict the rook's view of the a-file... and it still has the view of the same diagonal."

The bishop because vulnerable from either d5 or e5, and now I'm going to get doubled pawns on the e-file. I've just assisted Black in taking the centre. Hindsight is a wonderful thing, but I should definitely have played 13. Re1 (or even 14. Re1) to support my e3 bishop."

It was here that I noticed how passive most of my pieces were while Black was threatening to come at me from every angle. 17. Qe1 was an obvious move to defend e3 and move my queen from behind my knight... I don't want to be forced into an exchange."
33,Nd4,f3d4,r2qr1k1/1bp2ppp/p7/np2P3/3N2n1/4P3/PPBN2PP/2RQ1RK1 b - - 2 17,"In an attempt to become more active, I move my knight into the centre and threaten the g4 knight. I've given up any attempt to save the pawns because I felt the e3 pawn was safe for now. I was going to respond to Qh4 with 18. N2d4 and felt I'd mobilised my knights better. My opponent and I exchanged chat during the game in which she admitted that she wanted to thought about playing 17... Bxg2. GK analysis shows up Qg5 which would have been utterly devastating for myself as White, especially against someone rated over 300 points more."
