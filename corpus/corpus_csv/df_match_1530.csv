1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Time to annotate a game I won for a change. I am not a confident attacker and even less confident when making sacrifices so this game was a little nerve-wracking for me.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Moves like this are what it takes for me to try to attack out of the opening, because if I let someone get away with it, then how grievous could such a waste of time really be?"

7,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1pp1/2n4p/4p3/2BPP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,"The Göring Gambit of the Scotch Game goes 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 exd4 4. c3. Its goal, like the goal of many gambits, is (at least in part) to gain a lead in development. Because White already has a lead in development thanks to each side's third move, I overcame my aversion to giving away pawns in the opening, with, ideally, an even greater lead in development as compensation."

10,dxc3,d4c3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1pp1/2n4p/8/2B1P3/2p2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,At some point here the Game Database comes into play. Here Black picks the most common move in this position.

13,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk1nr/pppp1pp1/2n4p/8/1bB1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 2 7,As do I in this position.
14,Nge7,g8e7,r1bqk2r/ppppnpp1/2n4p/8/1bB1P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 3 8,"The position after White's 7th move is in the World database precisely once, but has been reached nearly 100 times on Gameknot. 7...Bxc3 is most popular here. Black's actual move is played more often than the knight to f6, but I'm not sure why."

I expected 17...Rg7 when I made the knight sacrifice, and was planning 18. Qxh6 Rg8 (or Kf8) 19. Qxf6 here. I think White has some play there, otherwise I'm not playing 16.
