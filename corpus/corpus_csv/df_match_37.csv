But still, if I believe to the +1600' rating of my opponent, I should be a little proud of the outcome. Unfortunately, I doubt you can reach this rating being so unprepared on this opening. // Here, my K can go to d7. Somehow, I felt I had to spend my tempoes building some threat. The key must be the exposed position of the WK, so I have to open the game, using my R on the central columns."

The check only helps his K to move away from my R's column... BUT WAIT, now I see that Ne5+ would have been almost a winner, after: 17... Ne5+, Kmust go to 18. d5 (or Nxc4). Rh-e8, and black threats c5+, Ke5 (forced, e.p. is impossible due to the Rd8), and black's attack seems unstoppable. Did I miss it?"
