4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,"The Vienna Gambit!  Akin to the King's Gambit, but black has no possibility of Qh4 , so he must play carefully."
5,f4,f2f4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"The Vienna Gambit!  Akin to the King's Gambit, but black has no possibility of Qh4 , so he must play carefully."
6,exf4,e5f4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/8/4Pp2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"?  This move is bad, as the text shows.  d5! is much better, where both sides have great attacking chances."
7,e5,e4e5,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4P3/5p2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"The knight has no safe squares, and will have to retreat to g8."
8,Qe7,d8e7,rnb1kb1r/ppppqppp/5n2/4P3/5p2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,Postponing the inevitable.
9,Qe2,d1e2,rnb1kb1r/ppppqppp/5n2/4P3/5p2/2N5/PPPPQ1PP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 2 5,"Development, sure, but this is necessary to keep the queen out of h4!"
10,Ng8,f6g8,rnb1kbnr/ppppqppp/8/4P3/5p2/2N5/PPPPQ1PP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 3 6,"Development, sure, but this is necessary to keep the queen out of h4!"
11,Nf3,g1f3,rnb1kbnr/ppppqppp/8/4P3/5p2/2N2N2/PPPPQ1PP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 4 6,"Development, sure, but this is necessary to keep the queen out of h4!"
12,g6,g7g6,rnb1kbnr/ppppqp1p/6p1/4P3/5p2/2N2N2/PPPPQ1PP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 0 7,?  Neglecting your development when you're behind is a dangerous move. Nc6 and d6 both look better here.
13,Nd5,c3d5,rnb1kbnr/ppppqp1p/6p1/3NP3/5p2/5N2/PPPPQ1PP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 1 7,!  A strong move that forces the queen to move and to address the fork at c7.
14,Qd8,e7d8,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/6p1/3NP3/5p2/5N2/PPPPQ1PP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 2 8,"Alright.  Time to take stock.  Black is up a pawn, and ALL of his pieces are back at home.  White has many options, and the fact that I didn't win in this position is both a testament to my opponent's fighting spirit and my own failings."
15,Nf6+,d5f6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/5Np1/4P3/5p2/5N2/PPPPQ1PP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 3 8,"A trappy, tricky move.  Nxf6 is met by exf6 , where black must lose a piece on the next move."
16,Ke7,e8e7,rnbq1bnr/ppppkp1p/5Np1/4P3/5p2/5N2/PPPPQ1PP/R1B1KB1R w KQ - 4 9,The only way to avoid losing a piece.
17,Nd5+,f6d5,rnbq1bnr/ppppkp1p/6p1/3NP3/5p2/5N2/PPPPQ1PP/R1B1KB1R b KQ - 5 9,Daring the king to come out into the open to e6...
18,Ke8,e7e8,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/6p1/3NP3/5p2/5N2/PPPPQ1PP/R1B1KB1R w KQ - 6 10,"He doesn't take the bait.  At this point, I had gotten him into the situation I wanted -- all his pieces are at home, his king has moved so he's lost the right to castle, and it's still my move.  This is an ideal King's Gambit/Vienna Gambit position.  So where did I blow it?"
19,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/6p1/3NP3/3P1p2/5N2/PPP1Q1PP/R1B1KB1R b KQ - 0 10,"Completely dominates the center and paves the way to win back the gambit pawn.  g6 looks like a waste for black, as Bg7 doesn't have much scope."
20,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk1nr/ppppbp1p/6p1/3NP3/3P1p2/5N2/PPP1Q1PP/R1B1KB1R w KQ - 1 11,Looks like a huge developmental edge for white.
21,Bxf4,c1f4,rnbqk1nr/ppppbp1p/6p1/3NP3/3P1B2/5N2/PPP1Q1PP/R3KB1R b KQ - 0 11,Looks like a huge developmental edge for white.
22,c6,c7c6,rnbqk1nr/pp1pbp1p/2p3p1/3NP3/3P1B2/5N2/PPP1Q1PP/R3KB1R w KQ - 0 12,Forces the knight to move.
23,Nf6+,d5f6,rnbqk1nr/pp1pbp1p/2p2Np1/4P3/3P1B2/5N2/PPP1Q1PP/R3KB1R b KQ - 1 12,"?! Getting greedy!  Nxf6 is met with exf6, winning the bishop, but maybe Nxe7 was safer.  White is in danger of overextending."
24,Kf8,e8f8,rnbq1knr/pp1pbp1p/2p2Np1/4P3/3P1B2/5N2/PPP1Q1PP/R3KB1R w KQ - 2 13,"?! Preparing Bh6 , which leads to Nxh6 Qxh6#.  This is too slow, however,  and now black exposes that white is overextended."
25,Qe3,e2e3,rnbq1knr/pp1pbp1p/2p2Np1/4P3/3P1B2/4QN2/PPP3PP/R3KB1R b KQ - 3 13,"?! Preparing Bh6 , which leads to Nxh6 Qxh6#.  This is too slow, however,  and now black exposes that white is overextended."
26,Bxf6,e7f6,rnbq1knr/pp1p1p1p/2p2bp1/4P3/3P1B2/4QN2/PPP3PP/R3KB1R w KQ - 0 14,"White's threats have been parried pretty well, and black looks to be okay."
27,exf6,e5f6,rnbq1knr/pp1p1p1p/2p2Pp1/8/3P1B2/4QN2/PPP3PP/R3KB1R b KQ - 0 14,"White's threats have been parried pretty well, and black looks to be okay."
28,Nxf6,g8f6,rnbq1k1r/pp1p1p1p/2p2np1/8/3P1B2/4QN2/PPP3PP/R3KB1R w KQ - 0 15,"White's threats have been parried pretty well, and black looks to be okay."
29,Bh6+,f4h6,rnbq1k1r/pp1p1p1p/2p2npB/8/3P4/4QN2/PPP3PP/R3KB1R b KQ - 1 15,"White's threats have been parried pretty well, and black looks to be okay."
30,Kg8,f8g8,rnbq2kr/pp1p1p1p/2p2npB/8/3P4/4QN2/PPP3PP/R3KB1R w KQ - 2 16,"White's threats have been parried pretty well, and black looks to be okay."
31,O-O-O,e1c1,rnbq2kr/pp1p1p1p/2p2npB/8/3P4/4QN2/PPP3PP/2KR1B1R b - - 3 16,"?!  This works out poorly, as black can play Ng4 with a fine game.  Bg5 could have been better, as white is really looking for black to stumble into mate (which isn't the best way to play).  Note that if the queen moves, a major piece on e8 is mate."
