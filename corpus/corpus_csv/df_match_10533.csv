1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I'm pretty sure everyone who plays on this site regularly is familiar with gothicgirl. She is a true warrior and fine chess talent. She is also legendary for the number of games she has played - and that is no understatement. Gothicgirl is also a fine team captain and all around good blokette:) A few days ago, abe66 contacted me - he had read many of my annotations and liked them, so he asked me to annotate this game of his vs. gothicgirl. Evidently, it was a sweet win for him because she had been getting the best of him as of late. So, without further ado, I dedicate this annotation to abe66, gothicgirl, Caissa, and the rest of you who love GameKnot. I hope you enjoy:)"
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Black employs the Philador Defense. I've always thought of Philador players as a truly demented bunch:) Black locks in his dark squared bishop and commits himself to a passive game. His hope is to counter-punch at the big center that white can obtain by playing 3. d4 followed by logical development.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Black employs the Philador Defense.

5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"!? Hmm....3. d4 or 3. Bc4 seem much stronger. I don't totally discredit this move, as it develops, but this is one of those situations where the Nb1 is best placed on c3 after c4 has been played. I mean, why retard the c pawn for no reason? Maybe marin or ion can explain the dynamics of this move better than I. It just doesn't feel right to me at this juncture."
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,"? Black must really be fearful of some sort of sac on f7 or white playing Bg5. Due to white always having the opening initiative, black shouldn't squander the chance to keep up in development. Much better was Bg4 or Be7 IMHO."
7,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 4,"? Black must really be fearful of some sort of sac on f7 or white playing Bg5. Due to white always having the opening initiative, black shouldn't squander the chance to keep up in development. Much better was Bg4 or Be7 IMHO."
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 4 5,"? Black must really be fearful of some sort of sac on f7 or white playing Bg5. Due to white always having the opening initiative, black shouldn't squander the chance to keep up in development. Much better was Bg4 or Be7 IMHO."
9,d3,d2d3,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4p3/2B1P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"? Black must really be fearful of some sort of sac on f7 or white playing Bg5. Due to white always having the opening initiative, black shouldn't squander the chance to keep up in development. Much better was Bg4 or Be7 IMHO."
10,h6,h7h6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2pp1/2np1n1p/4p3/2B1P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"? Black must really be fearful of some sort of sac on f7 or white playing Bg5.

11,Be3,c1e3,r1bqkb1r/ppp2pp1/2np1n1p/4p3/2B1P3/2NPBN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"White gets her last minor developed to a good square and prepares to castle. She is enjoying the superior position at this point, and is preparing to coordinate her offense."
12,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/ppp1bpp1/2np1n1p/4p3/2B1P3/2NPBN2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 7,"Down some developmental tempo, black hurries to catch up and hastens 0-0."
13,h3,h2h3,r1bqk2r/ppp1bpp1/2np1n1p/4p3/2B1P3/2NPBN1P/PPP2PP1/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 7,"?! There is no reason for white to fear 7...Bg4 here. My immediate thought is 7. Qd2 (preparing 0-0-0) Bg4 8. h3 Bh5 9. g4 Bg6 10. Nh4! and white has a strong attack. Having said that, I do agree that 7. h3 secures the g4 square into white's real estate. I guess it just depends on how aggressive you want to be:)"
14,b6,b7b6,r1bqk2r/p1p1bpp1/1pnp1n1p/4p3/2B1P3/2NPBN1P/PPP2PP1/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 8,Consolidates c5 and gives the light squared bishop another option.
15,Qd2,d1d2,r1bqk2r/p1p1bpp1/1pnp1n1p/4p3/2B1P3/2NPBN1P/PPPQ1PP1/R3K2R b KQkq - 1 8,"Gothicgirl and I may be thinking the same thing here. White can now castle either way (a nice option if you can get it) and may very well be thinking of a kingside assault. Notice the firepower she has pointed that way, and since she is out-hitting d5, it just may be a good launching platform."
16,Bb7,c8b7,r2qk2r/pbp1bpp1/1pnp1n1p/4p3/2B1P3/2NPBN1P/PPPQ1PP1/R3K2R w KQkq - 2 9,"?! I didn't like this move for black. He makes a premature commitment in my opinion. With all of the ammo white has pointed at his kingside, I feel it is better to keep this bishop on a closer diagonal. I see the idea of him playing 0-0-0, but it seems to me that this move is a little slow. 8...Be3 9. BxB fxB should not be dismissed out of hand because of the doubled pawns. They would be central and black would have an early bead on the f file after 0-0."
17,O-O-O,e1c1,r2qk2r/pbp1bpp1/1pnp1n1p/4p3/2B1P3/2NPBN1P/PPPQ1PP1/2KR3R b kq - 3 9,"Not content to wait around for black to tip his hand, white castles long and prepares for kingside action."
18,Qd7,d8d7,r3k2r/pbpqbpp1/1pnp1n1p/4p3/2B1P3/2NPBN1P/PPPQ1PP1/2KR3R w kq - 4 10,OK - 0-0-0 it will be. These two players are going to be slugging it out on the kingside.
19,Kb1,c1b1,r3k2r/pbpqbpp1/1pnp1n1p/4p3/2B1P3/2NPBN1P/PPPQ1PP1/1K1R3R b kq - 5 10,"Curious. I can only wonder what this was all about. 10. Nh4! would have been sweet, as it puts the Nf3 one step closer to the natural outpost on f5 AND hastens f4!"
20,O-O-O,e8c8,2kr3r/pbpqbpp1/1pnp1n1p/4p3/2B1P3/2NPBN1P/PPPQ1PP1/1K1R3R w - - 6 11,"As planned, but not best right now as black's f pawn is hanging. What about 10...Na5!? which would instigate a favorable trade getting rid of whites strong light squared bishop?"
21,g4,g2g4,2kr3r/pbpqbpp1/1pnp1n1p/4p3/2B1P1P1/2NPBN1P/PPPQ1P2/1K1R3R b - - 0 11,"White doesn't take the free f pawn. Instead, she starts pushing the kingside. Good idea, but I still like the idea of playing Nh4 first."
22,a6,a7a6,2kr3r/1bpqbpp1/ppnp1n1p/4p3/2B1P1P1/2NPBN1P/PPPQ1P2/1K1R3R w - - 0 12,Prevents intrusion on b5.
23,a3,a2a3,2kr3r/1bpqbpp1/ppnp1n1p/4p3/2B1P1P1/P1NPBN1P/1PPQ1P2/1K1R3R b - - 0 12,Does gothicgirl not see the free pawn? or is she wisely creating an escape square for her Bc4 first because she sees the threat black has of Na5? I'm betting she sees it:)
24,Rhf8,h8f8,2kr1r2/1bpqbpp1/ppnp1n1p/4p3/2B1P1P1/P1NPBN1P/1PPQ1P2/1K1R3R w - - 1 13,"Black shores up the hanging f pawn. Was it the right rook? Most likely, as the other one will be useful on the d file should conflict occur on the potentially volital g5 square."
25,Nh2,f3h2,2kr1r2/1bpqbpp1/ppnp1n1p/4p3/2B1P1P1/P1NPB2P/1PPQ1P1N/1K1R3R b - - 2 13,"White is anxious to play f4, but I STILL like Nh4! C'mon gothicgirl! Go for the throat!"
26,b5,b6b5,2kr1r2/1bpqbpp1/p1np1n1p/1p2p3/2B1P1P1/P1NPB2P/1PPQ1P1N/1K1R3R w - - 0 14,"Black makes his first truly aggressive move of the game, and threatens white's powerful light squared bishop. That's the thing about the Philador - it usually is very passive early on, but if black can weather the opening, opportunities eventually arise."
