3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,I probably should have studied the Gruenfeld a bit more than I did. I was quite confident that I could play this opening well enough to at least get an equal position.

7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3p4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,cxd5 is considered the main line. I played this because I am sure that my opponent was a lot more prepared for that response than I was.
8,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3p4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,This move made sense to me. I simply wanted to develop my DSB to a nice diagonal before playing e3.

My intuition told me that it would be wise not to do that because it would be quite difficult for white to defend all of these queenside attacks, so I played a logical move."
