20,c6,c7c6,rnb1r1k1/pp2bppp/2p5/8/3P4/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNB2RK1 w - - 0 11,This hinders black's development slightly as c6 was a good place for his knight.
21,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1r1k1/pp2bppp/2p5/8/3P4/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 1 11,Now I want the two bishop advantage. I need to trade this knight for one of his bishops. In the endgame play will be on both sides of the board. A bishop can easily watch both sides of the board whereas a knight cannot. With Bishop over knight and a pawn up the win would be very feasible.
