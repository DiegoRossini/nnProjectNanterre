1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

My buddy Gerhard/Chicoboy asked me to annotate this brevity.  His Class C opponent Dan, resigned, presumably because he thought he was gonna cop Old Matey.  However, Gameknot Analysis provided a way out for Dan, although it did state that Dan had a positional disadvantage of exactly 1 point - so, I guess there was a potential for a resignation on the grounds of ruinous loss of material x moves down the line.  So, how did all this happen?  Well, read on......"

To Gerhard's credit, he can say that he swindled his opponent into a premature resignation.  One must remember that a premature resignation is as bad as leaving your king to cop Old Matey.  We have all been there and if and when we resign, we make the decision that seems right at the time and to the best of our knowledge.  I will therefore be contacting both players respective mentors regarding this result for their valuable input.  Anyhow, Gerhard, kudos to you - you have kept your rating in the 1300s for quite a while now and are nudging up to 1350 - keep it up!  As for you, Dan, I know only too well what you are capable of when you are at the top of your game against Class A 1800 oppo. and I can see your rating get back into the mid-1500s sooner or later ......"
