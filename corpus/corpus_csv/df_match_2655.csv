1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,A long and tight game.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"That was a thematic game, we decided both to explore two openings during a couple of games but the games are rated."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 2,"English opening . I do not like very much this opening, for it can lead to closed and complex situations with concentration of pièces on the center which i do not like at all. So, I'll try to evitate them. I think that my oponent prefers open games as well but he is far better than me in closed situations, so that he could choose this tactic. On the other hand, we play those game to experiment, so that everything can happen..."

The queen is in front of mine on the open file, so that he can choose between two options after 8.dxc5 (8. ... dxc5 or 8. ... bxc5)  and they would quickly lead in very complex situations which my opponent likes. Although I like them as well, I do not want to let him choose the line... So that..."
15,d5,d4d5,rn1qk2r/pb2bppp/1p1ppn2/2pP4/2P5/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,I could not see anything else to do. It seemed me the safest move and I didn't find any efficient attacking plan but I didn't like this move very much for my opponent would be able to block the game in the center which was exactly the opposite of my plan.
16,exd5,e6d5,rn1qk2r/pb2bppp/1p1p1n2/2pp4/2P5/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 9,But black takes. Thank you Bwaa for having choosen this line.
17,cxd5,c4d5,rn1qk2r/pb2bppp/1p1p1n2/2pP4/8/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 9,"The other candidate move was 9. Nxd5 wether fo 9. ... Bxd5 or 9. ... Nxd5 but black was not obliged to take, for the knight menaces nothing important. So that I prefered to build a strong center by 10. e4"
18,O-O,e8g8,rn1q1rk1/pb2bppp/1p1p1n2/2pP4/8/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 10,"King in safe. White still has the initiative but black's counterattack can come very quickly because black can easily remove the c knight if he can bring his b pawn on b4. At least it was the danger, I felt exposed."
19,e4,e2e4,rn1q1rk1/pb2bppp/1p1p1n2/2pP4/4P3/2N2NP1/PP3PBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 10,"I didn't like this situation very much but now I felt I had to protect the d5 pawn and try, so doing, to conserve the center's control, or to improve it, for if having a pawn on the 5th line blocks the opponent, the pawn is hard to defend. Now white's weak pawn is the e one. The c knight protect the two pawns and, in this condition is not reliable (even lancelot the brave has his limit.)"
20,Nfd7,f6d7,rn1q1rk1/pb1nbppp/1p1p4/2pP4/4P3/2N2NP1/PP3PBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 11,"I didn't expect this move, for I imagined wether 10. ... Ba6 or 10. ... Re8. and even now, I'm not sure about it, for it lead to a line which went very dangerous for white (at middle term) but also dangerous for black. Anyway, the game was very funny and interresting.  It's a drawback move, which at first sight doesn't seem important but which proved to have very big conséquences on the rest of the game at long term."

I thought the move weakened to much the king so that black wouldn't dare to play it. Of course it's a very offensive position and black will now easily gain the initiative."
27,Rc1,a1c1,rn1q1rk1/pb2b1pp/1p1p4/2pPp3/4P3/2N2NP1/PP3PBP/2RQR1K1 b - - 1 14,"At this point white changed his plan once again. I have to fully open and take control of the b1g8 diagonal and attack the king this way (Bwaa did the same to me two games ago, so that it was ok to show him that I learned the lesson he gave me) I estimated that black's attack on the f file was not that dangerous (wrong estimation). The rook is aimed at c4 where I want to bring my LSB."
