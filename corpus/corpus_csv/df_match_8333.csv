8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"As White, I often struggle finding a good way to attack the Sicilian.  The Levenfish here seemed rash to me when I first encountered it, but its potential to loosen Black's defenses won me over."
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,"As White, I often struggle finding a good way to attack the Sicilian.  The Levenfish here seemed rash to me when I first encountered it, but its potential to loosen Black's defenses won me over."

12,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/3NPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,"Not good.  Definitely a mistake, though it doesn't look that dangerous.  The Bb5+ threat is obvious, but combined with the e5 pawn advance that's coming, Black gets locked into a losing position.  If I were Black, I believe my move would have been 6. .. e5.  Exchanging queens looks better than the coming situation, to me."
13,e5,e4e5,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/4P3/3N1P2/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"Black's choices are all bad ones.  I think Ng4 looks like the best one, though Black is still down at least a knight."

16,Nd5,f6d5,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/6p1/3nP3/3N4/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 9,"A good general rule, at least: exchanging a piece whose position is untenable.  But putting another piece between the two Queens weakens Black's position against the coming check."
17,Bb5+,f1b5,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/6p1/1B1nP3/3N4/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 9,"Inevitable, really."
18,Kf8,e8f8,rnbq1k1r/pp2ppbp/6p1/1B1nP3/3N4/2N5/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 3 10,"Might be the best move.  9. .. Nc6 10. Nxc6 bxc6 11. Bxc6+ leaves Black down a pawn and a rook, while I don't know where exactly 9. .. Bd7 10. e6 would go.  It doesn't seem any better at first glance."

22,Bd7,c8d7,rn1q1k1r/pp1bppbp/6p1/1B2P3/3N4/2P5/P1P3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 12,"Black offers another exchange.  If taken, Black will gain some room on the queenside.  If not taken, 13. .. Bxb5 14. Nxb5 Qxd1 15. Rxd1 Bxd5 leaves Black a pawn up."
23,Qf3,d1f3,rn1q1k1r/pp1bppbp/6p1/1B2P3/3N4/2P2Q2/P1P3PP/R1B2RK1 b - - 2 12,"White threatens 13. Qxf7# checkmate.  Be6 can't prevent it.  Qe8 doesn't go well, either.  f5 or f6 look good, but even the best-case scenario results in 13. Qxb7, threatening 14. Qxa8 netting a rook, 14. Bxd7 Nxd7 15. Ne6+ forking Black's King and Queen, or 14. e6's various consequences."
24,Bxb5,d7b5,rn1q1k1r/pp2ppbp/6p1/1b2P3/3N4/2P2Q2/P1P3PP/R1B2RK1 w - - 0 13,"Unexpectedly quick.  Black just didn't see it.

While it was a simple mistake that led to checkmate so soon, this game made me reconsider the Sicilian.  Though I knew this particular line (the Levenfish Attack) better than recursiondepth, it would be just as easy for me to fall into a trap with a move that appears relatively safe in any of the infinite other lines.

I felt that, despite Black's tactical mistakes, this game was decided primarily by memorization, which didn't sit well with me.  I enjoy fianchettos and asymmetrical openings both, but I won't be playing the Sicilian as often."
