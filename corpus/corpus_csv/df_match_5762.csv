1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hey this is a game that i played for the 61st Gk Tournament, round 5. It was a strong match with a tough opponent. Comments about the game are really welcomed! So i played with black ( i like white more but what can i do?). The game started with e4."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I played e5. I don't often play the sicilian cause e5 suits me better.
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,And then d4. Nice though most prefer to play Nf3.
4,exd4,e5d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3pP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,I accepted the challenge and took the pawn.
5,Qxd4,d1d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 0 3,Typical reply.
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 1 4,Open the knight and push the queen back.
7,Qd5,d4d5,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/3Q4/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 2 4,Instead he played Qd5. I think Qd1 is better.
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/3Q4/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 3 5,I open the other one knight. I wanted to develop all my pieces and hold a strong position.
9,Qc4,d5c4,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/2Q1P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 4 5,Again not the greatest position for his queen i think.
10,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/2n2n2/8/2Q1P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 5 6,I wanted to castled and though the position is quite pathetic i think is the best.
11,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqk2r/ppppbppp/2n2n2/8/2Q1P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 6 6,he developed the knight!
12,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/ppppbppp/2n2n2/8/2Q1P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQ - 7 7,I castled and try now to develop the rest of my pieces.
13,c3,c2c3,r1bq1rk1/ppppbppp/2n2n2/8/2Q1P3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQ - 0 7,c3? Playing Nc3 or Bd3 is better i think.
14,d5,d7d5,r1bq1rk1/ppp1bppp/2n2n2/3p4/2Q1P3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQ - 0 8,And now d5. Good move as i open the diagon for my bishop and also push the queen and the centre.
15,exd5,e4d5,r1bq1rk1/ppp1bppp/2n2n2/3P4/2Q5/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQ - 0 8,He took the pawn.
16,Nxd5,f6d5,r1bq1rk1/ppp1bppp/2n5/3n4/2Q5/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQ - 0 9,And i took it back with my knight.
17,g3,g2g3,r1bq1rk1/ppp1bppp/2n5/3n4/2Q5/2P2NP1/PP3P1P/RNB1KB1R b KQ - 0 9,g3? For me it's a bad move but ok if he's gonna play then Bg2.
18,Re8,f8e8,r1bqr1k1/ppp1bppp/2n5/3n4/2Q5/2P2NP1/PP3P1P/RNB1KB1R w KQ - 1 10,Still his king is exposed and i wanted to check and attack( generally).
19,Nbd2,b1d2,r1bqr1k1/ppp1bppp/2n5/3n4/2Q5/2P2NP1/PP1N1P1P/R1B1KB1R b KQ - 2 10,He should have played Be2 i guess.
20,Bc5+,e7c5,r1bqr1k1/ppp2ppp/2n5/2bn4/2Q5/2P2NP1/PP1N1P1P/R1B1KB1R w KQ - 3 11,And check.
