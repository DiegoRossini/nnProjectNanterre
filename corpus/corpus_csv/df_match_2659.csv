I don't think he has played too well here. If he had a pawn on g6 with a  fianchettoed bishop behind it, and his e-pawn on e6 not e5, I would not have been able to play f5 so easily. I believe his position is cramped and I am gaining in confidence by this point."

25,Nd5,c3d5,2rqnrk1/pp1bbppp/2np4/2pNpP2/4P1P1/3P2NP/PPP3B1/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 4 13,I defend the knight and free the g-file in case its later possible to get a rook or two on it.
