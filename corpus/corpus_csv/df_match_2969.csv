19,d4,d2d4,r3kb1r/pp3ppp/2n5/7q/3P2b1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 10,Black hesitated to castle long which would give a quick and mighty attack but a very weak king. I finally opted for developping. Black pieces are separated but everybody is protected and they cover quite a big amount of squares.

Another hesitation but with two pawns late, black didn't dare to trade bishop and queen for a second double pawn. (with bishop alone, I might have try this line because white's pawn structure would have been far inferior. further more I begin to have a plan to attack c2 and c3."
