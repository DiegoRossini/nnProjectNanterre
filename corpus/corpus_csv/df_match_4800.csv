1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,here i began another game in high hopes and an aim to win
2,b6,b7b6,rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/1p6/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"but i also wanted to do something different to my usual e4, so i decided to try and play something like the 'modern' opening"
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/1p6/8/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,still playing the developing moves
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/p1pp1ppp/1p2p3/8/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"here i am, only moving my pawns to the 6th row!"
5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/p1pp1ppp/1p2p3/8/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 3,white played the very common Bc4
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/p1pp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 2 4,but now it is time for other pieces apart from pawns to advance
7,d3,d2d3,rnbqkb1r/p1pp1ppp/1p2pn2/8/2B1P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 4,but white prefers pawns
8,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/p1p2ppp/1p2pn2/3p4/2B1P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,i'm now in a more agressive mood
9,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkb1r/p1p2ppp/1p2pn2/3P4/2B5/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,a very likely move (other option is to play something like e5?)
10,exd5,e6d5,rnbqkb1r/p1p2ppp/1p3n2/3p4/2B5/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,not going to stay a pawn down
11,Qe2+,d1e2,rnbqkb1r/p1p2ppp/1p3n2/3p4/2B5/2NP4/PPP1QPPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 1 6,white wants an early check to keep this game rolling
12,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/p1p1bppp/1p3n2/3p4/2B5/2NP4/PPP1QPPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 2 7,probably my best option apart from Be6
13,Bb5+,c4b5,rnbqk2r/p1p1bppp/1p3n2/1B1p4/8/2NP4/PPP1QPPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 3 7,still checking!
14,c6,c7c6,rnbqk2r/p3bppp/1pp2n2/1B1p4/8/2NP4/PPP1QPPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 0 8,i play my pawn pushing again
15,Ba4,b5a4,rnbqk2r/p3bppp/1pp2n2/3p4/B7/2NP4/PPP1QPPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 1 8,that has forced that all to powerful bishop back where it belongs (somewhere useless)
16,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/p3bppp/1pp2n2/3p4/B7/2NP4/PPP1QPPP/R1B1K1NR w KQ - 2 9,i take the oppurtunity to play rook out
17,Nf3,g1f3,rnbq1rk1/p3bppp/1pp2n2/3p4/B7/2NP1N2/PPP1QPPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 3 9,still developing
18,Re8,f8e8,rnbqr1k1/p3bppp/1pp2n2/3p4/B7/2NP1N2/PPP1QPPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 4 10,"now i am in the hope of getting that queen which could mean trouble for white, unless it does something about it soon!"
19,Be3,c1e3,rnbqr1k1/p3bppp/1pp2n2/3p4/B7/2NPBN2/PPP1QPPP/R3K2R b KQ - 5 10,ah- he blocks!
20,Bc5,e7c5,rnbqr1k1/p4ppp/1pp2n2/2bp4/B7/2NPBN2/PPP1QPPP/R3K2R w KQ - 6 11,but that wasn't that good a move after all
