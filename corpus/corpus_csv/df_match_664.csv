1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,the_k_lags is one of the co-captains of my team and we periodically play some matches against each other for fun.  Welcome any and all comments to help us improve together.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I prefer playing Petrov to the other defenses, and since I dislike the Ruy Lopez, this line prevents it."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"I prefer playing Petrov to the other defenses, and since I dislike the Ruy Lopez, this line prevents it."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"I prefer playing Petrov to the other defenses, and since I dislike the Ruy Lopez, this line prevents it."
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"And now we've gone modern attack.  This move starts things off with a bang.  Black has a few responses: Nxe4, exd4, and d6 being my favorite.  I don't like d6, since it allows White to get some pawns deep into my territory.  exd4 isn't bad at all, but I like the tactical options of Nxe4 best."
6,Nxe4,f6e4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/3Pn3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"This move strikes first blood for Black.  To regain parity White has several options, dictating the flow of the remainder of the game."
7,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/3Pn3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"Good choice.  Developing the LSB, making space for a castle, and threatening the knight at e4.  Any time you can accomplish three things in one move, it's a good one."
8,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3pp3/3Pn3/3B1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"Seeking to preserve my knight's post, I'm not ready to give that spot up yet.  It can't be threatened by a pawn until White moves his knight at f3..."
9,Nxe5,f3e5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/8/3pN3/3Pn3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"and here we are.  Regaining pawn parity, White now has a projection of power on his own and can play f3 at some point to shoo away my knight."
10,Nd7,b8d7,r1bqkb1r/pppn1ppp/8/3pN3/3Pn3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 6,"Threatening his posted knight and developing a piece at the same time.  As a general rule of thumb in early development, try not to move your power pieces more than you have to, and get your main pieces into play.  If you can do multiple things at once, go for it.

Some might consider Bd6 here, in mirrored play.  I'm not as much a fan of that line and symmetrical play tends to be more boring."
11,Nxd7,e5d7,r1bqkb1r/pppN1ppp/8/3p4/3Pn3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,Exchanging knights.
12,Bxd7,c8d7,r2qkb1r/pppb1ppp/8/3p4/3Pn3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"As another general rule of thumb, don't get caught up in moving your queen early if you don't have to.  Better here to take with the LSB vice queen."
13,O-O,e1g1,r2qkb1r/pppb1ppp/8/3p4/3Pn3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 7,"Getting the king to protection is of high priority in early development.  Additional options include bringing the knight into action on Nd2 or Nc3, though I prefer the castle more."
14,Bd6,f8d6,r2qk2r/pppb1ppp/3b4/3p4/3Pn3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 8,Time to get ready for my own castle.  Centralization of the DSB also projects good power on White's kingside.
15,c4,c2c4,r2qk2r/pppb1ppp/3b4/3p4/2PPn3/3B4/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,A strong play by White.  It threatens the protector for my knight and provides additional mobility options for his queen.  I can no longer castle immediately and must see to my defense.
16,c6,c7c6,r2qk2r/pp1b1ppp/2pb4/3p4/2PPn3/3B4/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 9,"This move is the best White can make.  White is closer to finishing his development.  At first blush another strong consideration would be pushing the pawn to c5, however, I don't think that helps much, as it allows me to retreat my bishop to c7, making an easy match up for a queen/bishop diagonal."
17,Nc3,b1c3,r2qk2r/pp1b1ppp/2pb4/3p4/2PPn3/2NB4/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 9,"This move is the best White can make.  White is closer to finishing his development.  At first blush another strong consideration would be pushing the pawn to c5, however, I don't think that helps much, as it allows me to retreat my bishop to c7, making an easy match up for a queen/bishop diagonal."
18,O-O,e8g8,r2q1rk1/pp1b1ppp/2pb4/3p4/2PPn3/2NB4/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 2 10,"And now Black finishes his development, not terribly concerned with the c4 pawn threat, as there are several options to regain pawn parity."
19,cxd5,c4d5,r2q1rk1/pp1b1ppp/2pb4/3P4/3Pn3/2NB4/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 10,Making a go of the center.
20,Nxc3,e4c3,r2q1rk1/pp1b1ppp/2pb4/3P4/3P4/2nB4/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 11,"In this context, the only two options to consider are Nxc3 and cxd5.  cxd5 isn't bad, I just like the lines in the move I played more."
21,bxc3,b2c3,r2q1rk1/pp1b1ppp/2pb4/3P4/3P4/2PB4/P4PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 11,"Now the game begins in earnest.  By my reckoning, we are close in position/points.  My isolated central pawn will become a victim soon if White wants it, but White will normally lose the c pawn in a few more moves..."
22,cxd5,c6d5,r2q1rk1/pp1b1ppp/3b4/3p4/3P4/2PB4/P4PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 12,"Now the game begins in earnest.  By my reckoning, we are close in position/points.  My isolated central pawn will become a victim soon if White wants it, but White will normally lose the c pawn in a few more moves..."
23,Qh5,d1h5,r2q1rk1/pp1b1ppp/3b4/3p3Q/3P4/2PB4/P4PPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 1 12,"Good attack by White's queen, immediately going after my d pawn."
24,g6,g7g6,r2q1rk1/pp1b1p1p/3b2p1/3p3Q/3P4/2PB4/P4PPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 0 13,I thought long and hard about playing f5 instead.  This position won out on personal whim.  Notice if I don't move one of my kingside pawns 13. Qxh7#
