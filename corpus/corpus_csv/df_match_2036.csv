1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,The opening I dislike facing and have yet to settle on a system to use.  Early in my career I played the Budapest Gambit but as I moved up in rating  this does not work as well against the strong opponent who has seen it  before. I have dabbled with other responses and at this tournament was going  to aim to play the Cambridge Springs against the queens gambit.
