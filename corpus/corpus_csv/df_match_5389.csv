To be honest at the time I felt that it must be downright inaccurate and very well may be but I struggled to an extent. The only sensible continuation at this point is Bxf6, Qxf6, cxd5 as otherwise I felt as if some of the purpose behind Bg5 was misguided."

In hindsight dxe6 is by fr and away the best move where it isn't too relevant that Black can give White an isolated pawn on c3 as he will have his own weakling on e6. Sadly the aesthetics of having a passed pawn on d5 and the c pawn potentially supporting this caused me to play the following.

19,e4,e2e4,rnb1k2r/pp3pp1/4p2p/3P4/1b1NP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 10,Black though a pawn down does in fact now have an extent of compensation. The White knights aren't particularly good in spite of the seeming strength of the outposted d4 horseman. This is because there isn't actually any significant threats to be made on the dark squares c7 or e7 in time and the large amount of options for both of Black's bishops mean that the squares controlled by the knight are devalued. Meanwhile the d pawn can be easily attacked by Black and if it drops and material is restored it is likely he will have the better chances thanks to the bishop pair in the open position.

Black now should probably play Bf8 after which Ng3, Nxb2, Nb5, Rd8, Rac1 he will stand marginally better with the bishops if he can find good squares for them. Black opts instead however to maintain some traps which is in itself a perfectly viable option."

In fact though Ra1b1 is just the better move. It looked a bit hairy at first with Nc4, Rb7 in which both Nd6 and potential backrow mate tricks are in circulation but the tempo on the bishop makes this irrelevant and White will have regained his pawn with a winning position. Disappointingly though this entire branch was missed during the game."

The other main candidate was Rxe8+, Rxe8, d7 after which Rb1 (Re1, Kf8 gives White a lost position as Black's knight will round up the pawn with via c4-b6) Nc4 (Rxd7 does not work as the night covers d1) Rb7 where Nxa3 looks full of possibilities in which White sacks a pawn with Na4 playing for Nc5 and Rc8. Sadly though instead on Nxa3 if Black plays Nb6 the line simplifies into a dead level position. Therefore in the adventurous spirit of the game d7 was played with optimistic (misguided) ideas initially of Re7, Kf8, Re1 followed by routing the Knight to d6 with a won game."
