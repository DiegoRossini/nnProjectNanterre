1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Started with the king pawns taking the center. Pretty ordinary.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Started with the king pawns taking the center. Pretty ordinary.
3,Qh5,d1h5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p2Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 1 2,He brings the queen out attacking my pawn.  I've messed up many times in this situation before by trying to chase the queen away with g6.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p2Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 2 3,So I decided to just protect my pawn and at the same time develop a piece.
5,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p2Q/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 3 3,It always takes me a couple a minutes to respond to this attack.
6,g6,g7g6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1p1p/2n3p1/4p2Q/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 0 4,now I thrust out g6 and this is why I had new I had to bring out my knight in the previous turn.  Also later on if i want to i can fianchetto the bishop.
7,Qf3,h5f3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1p1p/2n3p1/4p3/2B1P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 1 4,He is still going for the quick mate so I just block that square with...
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1p1p/2n2np1/4p3/2B1P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 2 5,Nf6. I think its a good developing move and next move I can develop my bishop.  In general I love it when the opponent brings his queen out too early because it is sometimes easier to develop your own pieces while attacking his queen.
9,c3,c2c3,r1bqkb1r/pppp1p1p/2n2np1/4p3/2B1P3/2P2Q2/PP1P1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 0 5,I can see his idea is probably to take control of the center with d4 on his next move.
10,Bh6,f8h6,r1bqk2r/pppp1p1p/2n2npb/4p3/2B1P3/2P2Q2/PP1P1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 1 6,so I figured that I could pin his pawn to his bishop and with this move he cannot properly develop his queen side pieces.
11,Ne2,g1e2,r1bqk2r/pppp1p1p/2n2npb/4p3/2B1P3/2P2Q2/PP1PNPPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 2 6,he brings out his knight to e2 the only place it can really go while his queen is taking up the f3 square. Obviously he is planning to castle.
12,d6,d7d6,r1bqk2r/ppp2p1p/2np1npb/4p3/2B1P3/2P2Q2/PP1PNPPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 7,"It took me a while to decide whether or not i was going to castle king side I did not like how the pawn structure was a little messed up for proper protection, so decided that I should try to bring my bishop into the game and also start preparing for a queen side castle."
13,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk2r/ppp2p1p/2np1npb/4p3/2B1P3/2P2Q2/PP1PNPPP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 1 7,"Castles king side and in my opinion I think this was his only good move cause now his knight on e2 does not have to guard the bishop on c1, therefore his knight is free to attack the d4 square when he brings his pawn to d4."
14,Be6,c8e6,r2qk2r/ppp2p1p/2npbnpb/4p3/2B1P3/2P2Q2/PP1PNPPP/RNB2RK1 w kq - 2 8,"It took me a while to determine where to put my bishop and in the end I figured that right now his only good piece that is on the board and I just thought it was a good trade. Plus after bxe6, then fxe6 I think that even though i have a temporary weakness having doubled up pawns. I planned attacking the center with my d pawn and if we trad pawns my center position would be strong and plus I figured by opening up the f-file my rook would have a nice place to go."
15,Bxe6,c4e6,r2qk2r/ppp2p1p/2npBnpb/4p3/4P3/2P2Q2/PP1PNPPP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 0 8,we trade bishops and then he attacks with his d pawn.
16,fxe6,f7e6,r2qk2r/ppp4p/2nppnpb/4p3/4P3/2P2Q2/PP1PNPPP/RNB2RK1 w kq - 0 9,we trade bishops and then he attacks with his d pawn.
17,d4,d2d4,r2qk2r/ppp4p/2nppnpb/4p3/3PP3/2P2Q2/PP2NPPP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 0 9,we trade bishops and then he attacks with his d pawn.
18,Bxc1,h6c1,r2qk2r/ppp4p/2nppnp1/4p3/3PP3/2P2Q2/PP2NPPP/RNb2RK1 w kq - 0 10,I could have brought my bishop to g7 but I did not want to let him take control of the h6-c1 diagonal and I did not want to lose tempo. so I took his bishop...
19,Rxc1,f1c1,r2qk2r/ppp4p/2nppnp1/4p3/3PP3/2P2Q2/PP2NPPP/RNR3K1 b kq - 0 10,...and he took back. At this point I think his position is a little better then mine because of his center pawns.
20,Rf8,h8f8,r2qkr2/ppp4p/2nppnp1/4p3/3PP3/2P2Q2/PP2NPPP/RNR3K1 w q - 1 11,I put my rook onto the half-open file which I think is usually a good move at least now i have a possible discovered attack opportunity.
21,Qe3,f3e3,r2qkr2/ppp4p/2nppnp1/4p3/3PP3/2P1Q3/PP2NPPP/RNR3K1 b q - 2 11,Of course he will not give me the opportunity but at least I drove his queen away just a little bit.
22,Ng4,f6g4,r2qkr2/ppp4p/2npp1p1/4p3/3PP1n1/2P1Q3/PP2NPPP/RNR3K1 w q - 3 12,I attack his queen and the f2 pawn at least maybe I can win a pawn.
23,Qg3,e3g3,r2qkr2/ppp4p/2npp1p1/4p3/3PP1n1/2P3Q1/PP2NPPP/RNR3K1 b q - 4 12,He attacked my knight on g4 then I took his pawn.
24,Nxf2,g4f2,r2qkr2/ppp4p/2npp1p1/4p3/3PP3/2P3Q1/PP2NnPP/RNR3K1 w q - 0 13,He attacked my knight on g4 then I took his pawn.
