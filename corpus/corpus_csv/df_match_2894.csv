However, as that tends to change the nature of the game, Black figures that that might not be the best way to go.  A judgment call."

Clearing away the centre as it does, one is left with rather an arid looking game, with neither side able to establish an ascendancy.  Well, appearances can fool you, as you will find out!  Better might have been to develop the dark-square bishop to e3 or f4."

Capablanca lost his first match game with Alekhine through making the wrong such decision.
