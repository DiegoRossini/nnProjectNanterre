1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi, everyone! Here is another game I played at my local chessclub. Though the  end result was a draw, it was a really exciting game. My opponent got the advantage in the opening, but then I surprised him with a daring combination, temporarily sacrificing two minor pieces and eventually even getting a slightly better postion. Have fun!"

9,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"Another possibility is 5.Bg5, but I like playing the move e3 in these positions, so the light squared bishop can go to d3 and maybe fianchettoing the dark squared bishop to b2. Notice how symmetrical the position is."
10,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/4pn2/2pp4/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,"This bishop is now aiming at h7, wich will become vulnerable to attacks when black castles kingside, as we're about to see in this game."

14,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qk2r/pp2bppp/5n2/2pp4/3P2b1/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 8,"Black plans to play Nc6 soon, increasing the pressure against the d4 square."
15,b3,b2b3,rn1qk2r/pp2bppp/5n2/2pp4/3P2b1/1PNBPN2/P4PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,I wanted to prevent the black c-pawn from moving forward to c4. Also this move  enables the fianchetto.
16,Nc6,b8c6,r2qk2r/pp2bppp/2n2n2/2pp4/3P2b1/1PNBPN2/P4PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 9,As expected. Black is now threatening to win a pawn with 9. .. cxd4 10.exd4 Nxd4.
17,dxc5,d4c5,r2qk2r/pp2bppp/2n2n2/2Pp4/6b1/1PNBPN2/P4PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 9,"Now black has an isolated pawn on d5, and the b2 square is an even stronger outpost for white's dark squared bishop because of the increased scope on the a1-h8 diagonal."
18,Bxc5,e7c5,r2qk2r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/2bp4/6b1/1PNBPN2/P4PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 10,"?! This weak move proved to be very important in this game. I think 10.Be2 would have been better, releasing the pin on the f3 knight, but instead the text move keeps the pin and gives black the opportunity to take advantage of this by playing knight to e5. But as we're about to see, the diagonal d1-h5 will prove to be very prolific for the white queen...
The actual reason I played this move was to stop black from playing 10. .. d5, but my opponent later told me he wasn't even planning on playing that move:)"

Notice how this was all possible because at the 10th move, the white queen 1: stayed on the d1-h5 diagonal and 2: cleared the d-file for the rook! 
So I guess I made the best of a weak move? Well, black's 18th move has still to come..."
