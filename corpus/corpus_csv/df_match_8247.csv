9,dxc3,d2c3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B5/2P2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,This completes the moves needed to produce the BKG.
10,f6,f7f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp2pp/5p2/4p3/2B5/2P2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"Here is seen the (5...f6) alternative move. The computer typically likes to play ...Nc6, but I make it play the text move so I can have some fun with this variation of the Boden-Kierseritsky Gambit."
11,O-O,e1g1,rnbqkb1r/pppp2pp/5p2/4p3/2B5/2P2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 6,Activates the rook. White has 5 active pieces vs black who has almost 2 active pieces.
12,c6,c7c6,rnbqkb1r/pp1p2pp/2p2p2/4p3/2B5/2P2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,"!? An interesting move with the idea of ...d5 to follow. This creates a strong center, or is it? Pawns chains are only as strong as their weakest link. Note the expansive pawn structure that follows."
13,b4,b2b4,rnbqkb1r/pp1p2pp/2p2p2/4p3/1PB5/2P2N2/P1P2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,"!? Sure, you are thinking what kind of a dumb move is that? It does nothing to challenge ...d5? I made this move based on intuition and because it can be used to break the pawn chain later by b4-b5, and it prevents ...Bc5, denying the bishop a centralized position."
14,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/pp4pp/2p2p2/3pp3/1PB5/2P2N2/P1P2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,Expected.
15,Bb3,c4b3,rnbqkb1r/pp4pp/2p2p2/3pp3/1P6/1BP2N2/P1P2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 8,"The text move maintains the bishop on its best attacking line and allows for a later c4, which if follows ...0-0, becomes a very useful move."
16,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/pp2b1pp/2p2p2/3pp3/1P6/1BP2N2/P1P2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 9,...0-0 is expected.
17,Nh4,f3h4,rnbqk2r/pp2b1pp/2p2p2/3pp3/1P5N/1BP5/P1P2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 3 9,"!? Opens a queen line, pushes the knight towards an expected castle, and can possibly entice a bad move like ...g5 creating an ever increasing amount of luft around the king. Threatens Qh5+ where if ...g6 then Nxg6 wins a pawn."
18,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp2b1pp/2p2p2/3pp3/1P5N/1BP5/P1P2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 4 10,Blissfully unaware.
