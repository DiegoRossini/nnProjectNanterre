I won without too much difficulty, and I'm only annotating it for sake of completeness, having decided to annotate all my games from the tournament (at which I was disapointed to score  2 wins, 2 draws and 3 losses, the first time I had scored less than 50% points in a chess tournament of two or more rounds)."

While the king's defenses are opened after 9...Qxf6 10.Qxf6 gxf6 anyway, in that position it is far less dangerous since the queens are off. This gives an open route to the black king and blocks the queen off from defense."
