1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!  I have recently been annotating games based on chess blunders and some of the types of blunder we all encounter in our chess careers.  But why do we blunder?  Do they come from a clear blue sky, e.g. as a result of lack of concentration or poor board analysis?  Or does our opponent put us under so much pressure that we succumb and make that irreversible blunder?  In this game, Freddy does put the squeeze on.  Even though I am a pawn up for the best part of the game I still end up right in the mire and eventually lose a piece - I play on - more on that one later, but at the end ..... guess what ..... I get Freddied for the eighth time in my 18 games against him!  Ah well, on with the game.  Freddy starts off with d4."
