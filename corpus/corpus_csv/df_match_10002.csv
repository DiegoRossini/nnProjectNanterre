2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,If you are going to bring the queen out early (which isn't advised) I prefer h5

You saw in the latter half of our match that I was chasing you around a lot. true I was taking pieces but nowhere near mating you. It wasn't until I brought more material in I was able to get a mating position. Rem he who controls the middle 16 squares controls the game....get those bishops and knights moving!
