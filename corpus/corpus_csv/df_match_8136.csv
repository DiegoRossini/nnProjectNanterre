1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is an annotation of my favourite opening, the ""Max Lange Attack"". It's out of fashion nowadays, because there are several simple moves against it that put White in a crappy position. With some practice, even those situations are playable and can lead to victory. This is an example that proves my point."
