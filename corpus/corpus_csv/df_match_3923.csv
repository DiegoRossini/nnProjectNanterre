1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

I was playing in a MT called New Year's Eve Party which was hosted by Master Chrisobee.  I found myself playing against a Master called Klauno (Klaus) and after he responded to my 1. e4 with the Sicilian (c4), I decided to play the Sicilian Grand Prix Attack and we ended up in Easy 19's Experimental Demolition Derby Attack line which involved a queen sac.  Unfortunately it went belly up for me but I thought I would annotate it so that whoever wants to be the white player in this line can see the refutation.

As I couldn't effectively block the check I resigned on the spot.  I should have played either f5 or 0-0.  Black would have still had an advantage but not enough to force resignation.  Although my rating got to within 17 points of 1900 I still have a lot to learn!
