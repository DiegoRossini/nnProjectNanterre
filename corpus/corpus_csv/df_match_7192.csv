5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"The first two pawn moves solidify the center for white directly, while blacks bishop on g7 will indirectly attack the center and black will also look to play d6, and then e5 to counterattack whites center.  Nc6 enables white to play e4 while developing a piece."
6,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"Developing another piece, so far the game matches all the book moves in the king's indian defense."

12,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bq1rk1/pppnppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 4 7,This move is a key move for black in the king's indian as it looks to support ...e5 and can also go to b6 when it would attack whites c-pawn.
13,O-O,e1g1,r1bq1rk1/pppnppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 5 7,"Most players keep the center tension by not advancing to d5.  This was my mistake locking in the pawn chain.  Here both sides will look to attack in the direction in where their pawn chains are pointing (white on the queenside, black on the kingside)."
14,e5,e7e5,r1bq1rk1/pppn1pbp/3p1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 8,"Most players keep the center tension by not advancing to d5.  This was my mistake locking in the pawn chain.

16,c6,c7c6,r1bq1rk1/pp1n1pbp/2pp1np1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 9,"Not the best move for black, this makes blacks d-pawn very weak and black is concentrating on attacking whites pawn chain on the wrong side.  Better is Nf8 followed by f5 and f4"
17,Ne1,f3e1,r1bq1rk1/pp1n1pbp/2pp1np1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1BQNRK1 b - - 1 9,"White could have played dxc6 bxc6 and then look to attack the weak pawn on d6, but I decided keep the pawn chain and continue with the normal strategy behind the kings indian defense - queenside pawn rush."
18,Nc5,d7c5,r1bq1rk1/pp3pbp/2pp1np1/2nPp3/2P1P3/2N5/PP2BPPP/R1BQNRK1 w - - 2 10,"In looking at my opponents past games once he played the kings indian, I found out that he preferred this move with a double attack on the pawn on e4.  In the game that he played it beforehand, white did not play Ne1 and instead his knight on f3 blocked white from playing f3 to support the pawn on e4 and strengthen the pawn chain."
19,f3,f2f3,r1bq1rk1/pp3pbp/2pp1np1/2nPp3/2P1P3/2N2P2/PP2B1PP/R1BQNRK1 b - - 0 10,Black is still focusing on the wrong side of the board

22,a6,a7a6,r1bq1rk1/1p3pbp/p2p1np1/2nPp3/4P3/2N2P2/PP2B1PP/R1BQNRK1 w - - 0 12,A move that must be made somepoint to prevent Nb5 which would attack the weak pawn on d6.

The c-file is also open for whites rooks.  Lastly, look at blacks pieces...they are all very inactive besides the Queen which is soon to be threatened."
