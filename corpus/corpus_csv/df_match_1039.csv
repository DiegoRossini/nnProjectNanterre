1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I kick off the game with a standard e4.
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"My opponent plays the Caro-Kann, which is a relatively safe opening for black. Black prepares a d5 push in order to contest my e4 pawn."
3,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"The usual move here is 2.d4, but I had some other plans in mind. I wanted to throw him a little off game. The main downside of this move is that it opens the g1-a7 diagonal, which could prove troublesome."
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Black follows his plans, and strikes at the center."
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4PP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"!? Yes, I'm leaving my e pawn ripe for the taking while also allowing my opponent to poke check my knight. However, White can either recover that lost pawn or get a huge attack."
6,dxe4,d5e4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/4pP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Black obliges, and chases my knight away."
7,Ng5,f3g5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/6N1/4pP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,I move my knight into safety and I attack the pawn.
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/6N1/4pP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,"Black plays the most natural move which develops a piece and protects his advanced e pawn. 4...f5 is dubious, because of 5.Bc4 (attacking f7) Nh6 6.Nxh7!? Rxh7 7.Qh5+ Kd7 8.Qg6."
9,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/6N1/2B1pP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 5,"! This is not exactly what I'd call subtle, but the attack on f7 has to be dealt with. Or does it?"
10,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/6N1/2B1pP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"Well, much to my dismay, my opponent went for the safe route. The risky but still playable other option was 5...Bg4!? 6.Qxg4! Nxg4 7.Bxf7+ Kd7 8.Be6+ Kc7 9.Bxg4 and the position is very unclear."
11,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/6N1/2B1pP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,I hit Black's advanced e pawn once more. It is attacked twice and defended once.
12,Bc5,f8c5,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/2b3N1/2B1pP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 7,"Black decides to give back the pawn and develops his bishop on the g1-a7 diagonal, preventing me to castle kingside."
13,Ngxe4,g5e4,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/2b5/2B1NP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,I think either recapture is fine.
14,Bb6,c5b6,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/1bp1pn2/8/2B1NP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 8,"Black tucks his bishop into safety, while keeping an eye on that pesky diagonal."
15,d3,d2d3,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/1bp1pn2/8/2B1NP2/2NP4/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,I free my bishop while reinforcing my advanced pieces.
16,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/1bp1pn2/8/2B1NP2/2NP4/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 1 9,Black castles.
17,Qe2,d1e2,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/1bp1pn2/8/2B1NP2/2NP4/PPP1Q1PP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 2 9,"I move my queen out of the back rank, allowing me to eventually castle queeside. This also give me the option to play 10.Be3 to exchange bishops."
18,Re8,f8e8,rnbqr1k1/pp3ppp/1bp1pn2/8/2B1NP2/2NP4/PPP1Q1PP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 3 10,Good move. It would be very troublesome if the e file was to open...
19,Rf1,h1f1,rnbqr1k1/pp3ppp/1bp1pn2/8/2B1NP2/2NP4/PPP1Q1PP/R1B1KR2 b Q - 4 10,"I plan to play 11.f5 after black tries to open the middle with 10...e5. Even if he doesn't, my rook could jump to f3 into g3 or h3."
20,Nd5,f6d5,rnbqr1k1/pp3ppp/1bp1p3/3n4/2B1NP2/2NP4/PPP1Q1PP/R1B1KR2 w Q - 5 11,Black puts his knight on a strong square. It cannot be taken due to the discovered attack/pin on the e file.
