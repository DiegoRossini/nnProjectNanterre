1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,At the moment I prefer to play against d4 then e4 because I am in the proccess of 'booking up' on the petroff defense.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"My two big choices here are either 3... b5 or e6 (as I did play), b5 being the benko and e6 being the benoni. I personally opt for the benoni because I feel I have more opening knowledge on the benoni but the benko I still perfectly reasonable."

7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2pP4/2P5/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,This is all very standard.
8,exd5,e6d5,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/5n2/2pp4/2P5/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,This is all very standard.

10,d6,d7d6,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3p1n2/2pP4/8/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,This is all very standard.
11,e4,e2e4,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3p1n2/2pP4/4P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,6... g6 followed by Bg7 is the norm here but I decide to play Be7 which I would say is probably worse because this bishop now has no future whilst on g7 it controls a large part of the centre.
12,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/3p1n2/2pP4/4P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 7,6... g6 followed by Bg7 is the norm here but I decide to play Be7 which I would say is probably worse because this bishop now has no future whilst on g7 it controls a large part of the centre.
13,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/3p1n2/2pP4/4P3/2NB4/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 2 7,Most people play Nf3 here but Bd3 is still good.
14,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bqk2r/pp1nbppp/3p1n2/2pP4/4P3/2NB4/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 3 8,As expected.
15,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqk2r/pp1nbppp/3p1n2/2pP4/4P3/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 4 8,As expected.
16,Ne5,d7e5,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/3p1n2/2pPn3/4P3/2NB1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 5 9,This is an interesting move. At first this is very weakening because after 9.Nxe5 dxe5 white will have a nice outpost on d5 which good come into good use later but it turns out that this pawn may of cost him the match.
17,Nxe5,f3e5,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/3p1n2/2pPN3/4P3/2NB4/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 9,Here 11.Bb5+ would have been slightly better but is nothing that spectacular.
18,dxe5,d6e5,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/5n2/2pPp3/4P3/2NB4/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 10,Here 11.Bb5+ would have been slightly better but is nothing that spectacular.

23,f4,f2f4,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/3b1n2/2pPp1B1/4PP2/2NB4/PP4PP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 12,Looks good at first with the intention of the eventual pawn push to e5! but really just gives black a chance to push the strong bishop on g5 away.
24,h6,h7h6,r1bq1rk1/pp3pp1/3b1n1p/2pPp1B1/4PP2/2NB4/PP4PP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 13,The correct move.

27,Bf4,g5f4,r1bq1rk1/pp3pp1/5n1p/2pPb3/4PB2/2NB4/PP4PP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 1 14,Bd4+ would have kept the tempo up.
28,Bxf4,e5f4,r1bq1rk1/pp3pp1/5n1p/2pP4/4Pb2/2NB4/PP4PP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 15,Bd4+ would have kept the tempo up.
29,Rxf4,f1f4,r1bq1rk1/pp3pp1/5n1p/2pP4/4PR2/2NB4/PP4PP/R2Q2K1 b - - 0 15,"This is a complete inaccuracy, White has a much more favourable position after 16. e5 Nd7 17. Qe2."

32,Qd6,d8d6,r1b2rk1/1p3pp1/p2q1n1p/2pP4/P3PR2/2NB4/1P4PP/R2Q2K1 w - - 1 17,"Here I spend 45 minutes contemplating this move, can you see why? I was looking at a couple of variations including 17...Nh5 or B/Ng4. If Nh5 then white can just proceed with e5 or Rh4 (both of these are acceptable). I thought that the must surely be some way of me trapping his rook but even the computer says not."
33,Qf3,d1f3,r1b2rk1/1p3pp1/p2q1n1p/2pP4/P3PR2/2NB1Q2/1P4PP/R5K1 b - - 2 17,"Here I spend 45 minutes contemplating this move, can you see why?
