1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Standard King's Pawn opening
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Standard King's Pawn opening
3,Bb5,f1b5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/1B2p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,"A strange move already - if there is a name for this opening, I certainly don't know it!"
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/1B2p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 3,"The bishop doesn't threaten anything at the moment, so I ignore it. This move develops, threatens the e-pawn and stops White's idea of Qg4 (if that was his idea - it probably wasn't) straight away"
5,d3,d2d3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/1B2p3/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 3,White defends the e-pawn
6,Bc5,f8c5,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/1Bb1p3/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 4,Nf6 and Bc5 (or Nf3 and Bc4) are common themes in my King's Pawn games
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/1Bb1p3/4P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 2 4,simple development so far - Black castles his king to safety and White brings out both of his knights
8,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/5n2/1Bb1p3/4P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQ - 3 5,simple development so far - Black castles his king to safety and White brings out both of his knights
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/5n2/1Bb1p3/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 4 5,simple development so far - Black castles his king to safety and White brings out both of his knights
10,d5,d7d5,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/5n2/1Bbpp3/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 6,"!? Black starts to get aggressive, with a pawn stab at the centre - but maybe better was Re8, offering protection to the hanging pawn at e5"
11,Bg5,c1g5,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/5n2/1Bbpp1B1/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 1 6,either White just didn't see it or he chose not to capture it. This is a standard pin on the queen...or is it?
12,Qd6,d8d6,rnb2rk1/ppp2ppp/3q1n2/1Bbpp1B1/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 2 7,"Black brings out his queen, which breaks the queen and provides protection the the e-pawn"
13,Qd2,d1d2,rnb2rk1/ppp2ppp/3q1n2/1Bbpp1B1/4P3/2NP1N2/PPPQ1PPP/R3K2R b KQ - 3 7,"Develops the last piece, but I'm not sure if this is White's best move - perhaps better was 7.Bxf6 (where either Black has to bust up his pawn structure or lose a pawn; 7...Qxf6 8.Nxd5 Qd6 [White threatens Nxc7] 9.Nc3 [to avoid the pawn fork at c6])"
14,c6,c7c6,rnb2rk1/pp3ppp/2pq1n2/1Bbpp1B1/4P3/2NP1N2/PPPQ1PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 8,"Now White loses the threat of the pawn advantage, the d-pawn is backed up and the bishop is driven back - not a bad move! (the loss of the outpost for the knight doesn't seem that bad, since there's still Nd7, but it turns out that Black never needed the knight in the final attack"
15,Ba4,b5a4,rnb2rk1/pp3ppp/2pq1n2/2bpp1B1/B3P3/2NP1N2/PPPQ1PPP/R3K2R b KQ - 1 8,the only square for the bishop
16,Bg4,c8g4,rn3rk1/pp3ppp/2pq1n2/2bpp1B1/B3P1b1/2NP1N2/PPPQ1PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 2 9,"To me, this was the best square to develop the bishop to. Of course, there is no pin on the knight, so..."
17,O-O-O,e1c1,rn3rk1/pp3ppp/2pq1n2/2bpp1B1/B3P1b1/2NP1N2/PPPQ1PPP/2KR3R b - - 3 9,"? Wait, scratch that, there's a pin (though it is consistant with White's 7th move). This alone should have stopped White from castling queenside (kingside castling would be better) but it turns out, though neither of us saw it, that this allows for a powerful attack later on..."
18,Bb4,c5b4,rn3rk1/pp3ppp/2pq1n2/3pp1B1/Bb2P1b1/2NP1N2/PPPQ1PPP/2KR3R w - - 4 10,Black had been threatening this since last move - Black now threatens to win the c3 knight with d4
19,a3,a2a3,rn3rk1/pp3ppp/2pq1n2/3pp1B1/Bb2P1b1/P1NP1N2/1PPQ1PPP/2KR3R b - - 0 10,The White queen has only one safe square to break the pin - Qe2 (Qe3? d4!)
20,Ba5,b4a5,rn3rk1/pp3ppp/2pq1n2/b2pp1B1/B3P1b1/P1NP1N2/1PPQ1PPP/2KR3R w - - 1 11,maintaining the pin (it's here when I started the idea of an attack should White play b4...which he does...)
21,b4,b2b4,rn3rk1/pp3ppp/2pq1n2/b2pp1B1/BP2P1b1/P1NP1N2/2PQ1PPP/2KR3R b - - 0 11,"I guess that White either just didn't want to move the queen, or he wanted to keep the queen on the d2 square (perhaps hoping that Black would play h6, where he has the option of Bxh6, similar to what I did, actually... I've tried this before, with not much luck. It has also happened to me before, with great success for my opponent) At any rate, weakening the defence around the king is never good, and Black may, in the near future, be able to take advantage of it..."
22,Bxb4,a5b4,rn3rk1/pp3ppp/2pq1n2/3pp1B1/Bb2P1b1/P1NP1N2/2PQ1PPP/2KR3R w - - 0 12,"!! That 'near future' comes sooner than White expected! Black sacs his bishop for two pawns. The way I see it, there are three major factors that made this successful; 1) The sac has occurred at the uncastled positon; i.e. the rook is on the end file. 2) It's difficult for White to get his pieces to the defence and 3) The pieces that are queenside prove to be more of a hinderance, as it allows Black's pawns to advance with tempo"
23,axb4,a3b4,rn3rk1/pp3ppp/2pq1n2/3pp1B1/BP2P1b1/2NP1N2/2PQ1PPP/2KR3R b - - 0 12,"White accepts the bait - It seems forced to me. If White ignores, d4 still wins material"
