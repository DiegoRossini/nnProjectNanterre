5,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"And this is the Grand Prix Attack. White wants to play on the kingside. His plans involve Nf3, d3, either Bb5 (and an exchange on c6) or Bc4 and O-O. The queen usually goes to e1 and then either to f2, g3 or h4 depending on Black's play. If Black is well-prepared it shouldn't be too dangerous, but most Black players aren't."

10,Bd7,c8d7,rn1qk1nr/pp1bppbp/3p2p1/1Bp5/4PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 4 6,"6.Bxd7+ is also possible, but I wanted to keep the tension between the two Bishops. Moreover, I had played another game in which a similar position occurred (but Black had played ...e6 and ...Be7 instead of ...g6 and ...Bg7) and there the computer recommended O-O."

But if I exchange (7.Bxd7+ Nxd7) his knight is not in a very good position. Had he played 6...Bxb5 7.Nxb6 a6 8.Nc3, he had had the choice to develop his knight to a better position (8...Nc6). It would be the same position as in the game after move 7, but then with the knight on c6 instead of d7, which is probably better for Black. Black's choice is less flexible for him (and more flexible for me, as I could also have played 7.Bc4 if I had liked to)."

It's a serious weakening of the central light squares, my knight gets a nice outpost on d5 and the d6 pawn becomes weak. I don't think the g7 bishop liked to see this move either. More solid is 8...e6. White had 1:26 on his clock, Black 1:14 (we started with 1:30 and got 30 seconds extra time per move, so I had used 8 minutes and my opponent 20)."

I chose this move because I can damage Black's pawn structure on the kingside and open up his king (if it castles on the kingside) next move. But probably 11.fxe5 is a more direct approach.
22,Nf6,d7f6,r2qk2r/1p3pbp/p1np1np1/2p1pP2/4P3/2NP1NQ1/PPP3PP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 1 12,"I'm not sure what Black is doing, he seems to be moving his knights around with no purpose. It's not that he makes very bad moves or anything, but he seems to lack a plan."

27,Nxe5,f3e5,r3k2r/1p1q1pb1/p1np1np1/2p1N1B1/4P3/2NP2Q1/PPP3PP/R4RK1 b kq - 0 14,"! This nice little combination wins a pawn due to the discovered attack on the knight. Also good was 14.Bxf6! Bxf6 15.Nd5 with the threat of Nb6 forking queen and rook, as well as a threat to the bishop, so the ugly 15...Bd8 is forced when White has a strong bind on the position."
