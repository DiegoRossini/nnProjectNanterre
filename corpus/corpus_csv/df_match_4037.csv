1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Here I'm playing white on a Philidor defense.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Here I'm playing white on a Philidor defense.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Here I'm playing white on a Philidor defense.
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,Here I'm playing white on a Philidor defense.
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"? Bad move, forcing the lost of a pawn or the Bishop. Black entering into a risky game."
6,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/3PP1b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,"? Bad move, forcing the lost of a pawn or the Bishop. Black entering into a risky game."
7,dxe5,d4e5,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4P3/4P1b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,If Black does 4.dxe5 then 5.Qxd8+ Kxd8 6.Nxe5 and black lose a pawn. Blackburne played a gambit on this variation with good results: 4.Nc6 5.exd6 Bxd6. Giving him some tempo for a lost of the pawn.
8,Bxf3,g4f3,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4P3/4P3/5b2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,Black chose to lose his Bishop. Bishops are better than knight in most of the end games that's why Larsker said to play knights before to play bishops.
9,Qxf3,d1f3,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4P3/4P3/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"Well right now I play the same opening that Morphy used in his well-known Opera game. The position of white is pretty nice, threatening Qf7, and is better developed than black."
10,dxe5,d6e5,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Well right now I play the same opening that Morphy used in his well-known Opera game. The position of white is pretty nice, threatening Qf7, and is better developed than black."
11,Bc4,f1c4,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 1 6,"Well right now I play the same opening that Morphy used in his well-known Opera game. The position of white is pretty nice, threatening Qf7, and is better developed than black."
12,Qe7,d8e7,rn2kbnr/ppp1qppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 2 7,"I think the best position for black is Qf6, asking for an exchange of queens. The queen is bad placed here because he blocks the way of his bishop; black will have to lose tempo if he wants to castle on the king side or develop his rook. It's quite obvious now that black gonna try to castle on his queen side."
13,O-O,e1g1,rn2kbnr/ppp1qppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 3 7,"Well here I had a lot of choice. I didn't want to go to Qb3 because white could have done Qb4+ and forcing the trade of queens. Nc3 would have been fine but it would have blocked the way for my queen if I wanted to attack on the queen side. Bg5 would have been too slow, I think. My main concern right now was to block the castling of white on the queen side, that's why I have castled right now. If black does Nc6 instead of Nd7, I would get a great advantage."
14,Nf6,g8f6,rn2kb1r/ppp1qppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB2RK1 w kq - 4 8,Pinning the knight and forcing the queen to stay at e7.
15,Bg5,c1g5,rn2kb1r/ppp1qppp/5n2/4p1B1/2B1P3/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RN3RK1 b kq - 5 8,Pinning the knight and forcing the queen to stay at e7.
16,Nbd7,b8d7,r3kb1r/pppnqppp/5n2/4p1B1/2B1P3/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RN3RK1 w kq - 6 9,! Well done. Now my rook can't take possession of the d line.
17,Qb3,f3b3,r3kb1r/pppnqppp/5n2/4p1B1/2B1P3/1Q6/PPP2PPP/RN3RK1 b kq - 7 9,"If black castle, then I can take the f pawn. Now my queen gonna be ready to enter in the battlefield.

18,b6,b7b6,r3kb1r/p1pnqppp/1p3n2/4p1B1/2B1P3/1Q6/PPP2PPP/RN3RK1 w kq - 0 10,This move was almost forced if Black doesn't wanted to lose a pawn or the d line.
19,Nc3,b1c3,r3kb1r/p1pnqppp/1p3n2/4p1B1/2B1P3/1QN5/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 b kq - 1 10,Now my position is pretty nice!
20,a6,a7a6,r3kb1r/2pnqppp/pp3n2/4p1B1/2B1P3/1QN5/PPP2PPP/R4RK1 w kq - 0 11,?? Huge lost of tempo. Black was probably thinking about to do b5 after that.
21,Rfd1,f1d1,r3kb1r/2pnqppp/pp3n2/4p1B1/2B1P3/1QN5/PPP2PPP/R2R2K1 b kq - 1 11,"?! I don't remember why I have done this move loll. I think it was to have a more accurate attack and to force the queen to not go on the d line.

25,Bb5+,c4b5,3rkb1r/2p1qppp/pp3n2/1BnNp1B1/4P3/1Q6/PPP2PPP/R2R2K1 b k - 5 13,"!! Qf3 and Qh3 could have been fine, but it would have given the option to black to do Rxd5. My goal was to take the queen or the king! If black take the Bishop in his next move, it will mean the lost of his queen. The sac is sound if white play accurately."
