1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The dear old Sicilian Defence, more popular these days even than the Mutual king's Pawn (1...e5), owing to its aggressive attempt to wrest from White the initiative."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The dear old Sicilian Defence, more popular these days even than the Mutual king's Pawn (1...e5), owing to its aggressive attempt to wrest from White the initiative."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"A popular second move by Black, but it obviates - for reasons I won't go into here - lines like the Dragon Defence or the Najdorf.  Not that's any hardship for Black, nor ought this information be hugely reassuring for White."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"A popular second move by Black, but it obviates - for reasons I won't go into here - lines like the Dragon Defence or the Najdorf.

5,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"A crossroads.  White still had the option to play a Closed Sicilian, but with this central thrust irrevocably embarks on the much more popular Open game."
6,cxd4,c5d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"The Lowenthal Variation - described in MCO 11 as 'a kind of hyper-accelerated Boleslavski-Pelikan-pawn-push dating back to 1839!'  It goes on: 'It has ... retained its feasibility.'  These ...e5 counter-thrusts by Black (a feature also of the Najdorf) herald an aggressive approach to the game by Black.   There is a downside, however, and that is the d5 and d6 squares become weak and the Black d-pawn backward.  Black 'expects' that his active play will mask or offset this strategic defect."
7,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"The Lowenthal Variation - described in MCO 11 as 'a kind of hyper-accelerated Boleslavski-Pelikan-pawn-push dating back to 1839!'

8,e5,e7e5,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n5/4p3/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"The Lowenthal Variation - described in MCO 11 as 'a kind of hyper-accelerated Boleslavski-Pelikan-pawn-push dating back to 1839!'

9,Nb5,d4b5,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n5/1N2p3/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"This move is just about White's automatic response to Black's central aggression, and indicates White's readiness to go toe-to-toe with his opponent.  Also feasible were 5.Nb3 and 5.Nf3, but neither places any pressure on Black.  The text move immediately tries to exploit Black's weaknesses on the d-file."
10,Nd4,c6d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/8/1N2p3/3nP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,"(?)  In general, moving a piece twice in the opening is not a good idea 'unless there is a tactic'.  On the other hand, White's knight has moved 3 times already, and will soon have to make a 4th.  But given the strategic risk inherent in Black's choice of line, perhaps more celerity in development is called for.  Indicated (and usual) is 5...d6, solidifying the centre, and freeing the light-square bishop (LSB), and gearing up for Q-side expansion within a few moves."
11,Nxd4,b5d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/8/4p3/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"Oh, yes.... and Black lost a pawn as well.  He is now left into the bargain, an isolated d-pawn (a.k.a. IQP or 'isolani').  Note that White's Q is nicely placed, unassailable, in centre board."
12,exd4,e5d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/8/8/3pP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"Oh, yes.... and Black lost a pawn as well.  He is now left into the bargain, an isolated d-pawn (a.k.a. IQP or 'isolani').  Note that White's Q is nicely placed, unassailable, in centre board."
13,Qxd4,d1d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/8/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"Oh, yes.... and Black lost a pawn as well.  He is now left into the bargain, an isolated d-pawn (a.k.a. IQP or 'isolani').  Note that White's Q is nicely placed, unassailable, in centre board."
14,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/5n2/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 1 8,"(?!) 'Knights before Bishops' quoth GM Lasker.  But circumstances alter cases.  At the moment, White's small advanced guard is imposing a little bit of a crimp in Black's game.  One way to free this is to enquire of White if he is interested in exchanging Queens: 7...Qa5ch  8.Bd2 Qc5.  After 9.Qxc5 Bxc5, Black will have at least have caught up in the race for mobilization (development).  The Queen exchange itself would be justified by its effect in freeing Black's game.  Meanwhile..."
15,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/5n2/6B1/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RN2KB1R b KQkq - 2 8,"(!?) Was this intended to provoke Black's next?  Instead, White could have caused at least one red face across the board by playing 8.e5, whereat Black's only feasible response is 8...Ng8 - a loss of two tempi!"
16,Qa5+,d8a5,r1b1kb1r/pp1p1ppp/5n2/q5B1/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RN2KB1R w KQkq - 3 9,"Forking K and B.  Fortunately, White can defend both..."
17,c3,c2c3,r1b1kb1r/pp1p1ppp/5n2/q5B1/3QP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RN2KB1R b KQkq - 0 9,"(??) ...but fails to spot the threat, and hence loses a piece and, pretty much, the game.  Instead 9.Bd2 Qc5 invites Q exchanges in circumstances similar to that two moves ago, but in which Black has stolen a march (...Nf6)."
18,Be7,f8e7,r1b1k2r/pp1pbppp/5n2/q5B1/3QP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RN2KB1R w KQkq - 1 10,"(??) Black hadn't seen it either!  Well, this sort of mutual oversight is not unknown even among grandmasters, but all the same, one wonders what Black had in mind for the Queen check.  Bearing in mind that the move played is a poor second best, it still made a lot of sense to prevent the further break-up of Black's pawns after Bxf6.  Of course, ...QxB would have served the same function."
19,Bc4,f1c4,r1b1k2r/pp1pbppp/5n2/q5B1/2BQP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RN2K2R b KQkq - 2 10,"(??) Developing, but still failing to connect the dots between a5 and g5.  Black is the first to wake up..."
20,Qxg5,a5g5,r1b1k2r/pp1pbppp/5n2/6q1/2BQP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RN2K2R w KQkq - 0 11,"Gotcha!! (I've always rather hated that headline in the British Press, but it works here).  Not only does this pick up a piece, free, gratis and for nothing; it threatens ...Qxg2 and ...Qc1ch.  Fortunately White can escape with a developing move..."
21,O-O,e1g1,r1b1k2r/pp1pbppp/5n2/6q1/2BQP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RN3RK1 b kq - 1 11,"Completing his mobilization.  Black still has some work to do there, but with his extra piece has nothing to worry about."
22,O-O,e8g8,r1b2rk1/pp1pbppp/5n2/6q1/2BQP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RN3RK1 w - - 2 12,"Completing his mobilization.  Black still has some work to do there, but with his extra piece has nothing to worry about."
23,Nd2,b1d2,r1b2rk1/pp1pbppp/5n2/6q1/2BQP3/2P5/PP1N1PPP/R4RK1 b - - 3 12,"Completing his mobilization.  Black still has some work to do there, but with his extra piece has nothing to worry about."
24,Bc5,e7c5,r1b2rk1/pp1p1ppp/5n2/2b3q1/2BQP3/2P5/PP1N1PPP/R4RK1 w - - 4 13,"(!)  Fine move, placing his bishop on a more active posting before mobilizing his Q-side.  12...d6 would have shut the DSB pretty much out of the game."
25,Qd3,d4d3,r1b2rk1/pp1p1ppp/5n2/2b3q1/2B1P3/2PQ4/PP1N1PPP/R4RK1 b - - 5 13,Note that White will have trouble generating any kind of counterplay based upon f2-f4.  Maybe already he should be looking to the d-file and the Q-side for possible counter-action.
26,d6,d7d6,r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/3p1n2/2b3q1/2B1P3/2PQ4/PP1N1PPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 14,"Hoping to induce h2-h3, perhaps?"
27,Nf3,d2f3,r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/3p1n2/2b3q1/2B1P3/2PQ1N2/PP3PPP/R4RK1 b - - 1 14,"Hoping to induce h2-h3, perhaps?"
28,Qg4,g5g4,r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/3p1n2/2b5/2B1P1q1/2PQ1N2/PP3PPP/R4RK1 w - - 2 15,"Hoping to induce h2-h3, perhaps?"
29,Rae1,a1e1,r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/3p1n2/2b5/2B1P1q1/2PQ1N2/PP3PPP/4RRK1 b - - 3 15,"The e-pawn had to be defended, and White in understandably reluctant to relax his guard over f2."
30,a6,a7a6,r1b2rk1/1p3ppp/p2p1n2/2b5/2B1P1q1/2PQ1N2/PP3PPP/4RRK1 w - - 0 16,"(?!) The GK engine much prefers 15...Be6, here, and I'm inclined to agree (I don't always).  For one thing, if White exchanges bishops (he has little other option), Black find his f-file opened for the Rook(s).  However, this pawn advance does secure the DSB's tenure of the a7-g1 diagonal, and its pressure on f2."
