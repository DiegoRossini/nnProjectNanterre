1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This annotation is mainly because a puzzling position in the end. My opponent resigned. I tried to create a puzzle from this position, but it halted as ""too many possible variations"". It was a nice mate in 13 moves that for a moment I thought it would really ""work"". And maybe it does... but I'll need a program to check it for sure. GK's puzzle engine is a good tool to check a position, but it stops too quickly for some complex positions."
