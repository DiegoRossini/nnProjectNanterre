1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,A quick game in a GK tounament where my opponent made some poor choices and I made the most of them. I liked it because of the many attacking options/moves I could have played and guessing the defensive plays black could use once I was behind enemy lines. I have never studied any chess books so I am not up with chess lingo so I'll keep it simple. Hope you like...

20,Ne7,g8e7,r1bq1b1r/pp1knQpp/3p1p2/2pNp3/2P1B3/4P3/PP1P1PPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 4 11,Moving the bishop in the way I could then have taken g7 followed by the rook. If black had moved king to c6 it would be nicely in line with white bishop
21,b4,b2b4,r1bq1b1r/pp1knQpp/3p1p2/2pNp3/1PP1B3/4P3/P2P1PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 0 11,I want the pawn out of the way so i can advance c-pawn and get black d-pawn away from its king. This opens up the possibility of moving the queen to check on the d file and also whites black bishop onto the a file in another threatening diagonal.

I welcome all comments as I remember while playing there were lots of things going through my mind. I have not annotated them all as its a while since the game and I can't remember them all. Thanks to my opponent who's a good player but on this occasion just got it wrong."
