1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I've been slowly creeping up the slow ladder and have now reached the point where I am seen as ""easy meat"" for some of the higher ranked players. Usually I oblige by making a daft move. Sometimes however my opponent gets stiffer opposition than they expect. This is one of those rare games and I was very pleased with the outcome."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I start with the Kings gambit as this is something I have played quite a bit recently with some success. My theory is that its not seen so often and so it takes some players out of their comfort zone

I decided on the latter as I can double black's pawns on c which not only hampers him but means his a8 rook can be tied down to defending his a pawn while his other rook is hemmed in.
