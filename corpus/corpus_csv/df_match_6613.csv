1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This time my opponent opened with the d-pawn, which frequently leads to closed games."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I am not really familiar yet with the hypermodern defences that occur when playing the Indian Defence 1... Nf6, so I choose to simply control the center by maintaining symmetry. It's quite interesting that only 25% of the games (according to the GameKnot 'World' database) in this opening are won by Black! White wins in 39% of all archived games and the other 34% are drawn."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Offering the popular Queen's Gambit.
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"I seldom accept gambits that I haven't studied before, so I decline with the 'Orthodox Defence' of the QGD. Accepting (2... dxc4) is not considered to be risky and the 'gambit' isn't even a true material sacrifice at all, because Black won't retain his pawn for long anyway, but nevertheless I prefer to decline."
5,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3P4/3P4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"After this pawn exchange, the statistical White win, Black win and draw chances are totally equal in the GameKnot 'World' database (33% each)."
6,exd5,e6d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"After this pawn exchange, the statistical White win, Black win and draw chances are totally equal in the GameKnot 'World' database (33% each)."
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3P4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,Just simple development moves for both sides. I'm planning to castle kingside.
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 5,Just simple development moves for both sides. I'm planning to castle kingside.
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 5,"First I wanted to play the passive 5... Be7, but then I thought, why not pin his knight? Of course, you have to be careful about White's potential queen check on a4."
10,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/1b1P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 4 6,"First I wanted to play the passive 5... Be7, but then I thought, why not pin his knight? Of course, you have to be careful about White's potential queen check on a4."
11,Bd2,c1d2,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/1b1P4/2N2N2/PP1BPPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 5 6,"Okay, the pin didn't last long."
12,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/1b1P4/2N2N2/PP1BPPPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 6 7,That white-squared bishop wants to get developed.
13,e3,e2e3,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/1b1P4/2N1PN2/PP1B1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 7,That white-squared bishop wants to get developed.
14,Bg4,c8g4,rn1q1rk1/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/1b1P2b1/2N1PN2/PP1B1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 1 8,Let's try it on the other knight ;-) The reason I played this was because I didn't want his knight to have control over e5.
15,Be2,f1e2,rn1q1rk1/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/1b1P2b1/2N1PN2/PP1BBPPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 2 8,"... and another pin destroyed. Somehow I feel that my bishop 'ha-knight-you-are-pinned' moves are unsound and I should have placed them on other squares. On the other hand, I can't see anything bad in it - it's just a feeling. Any comments or alternative development suggestions on that?"
16,Nbd7,b8d7,r2q1rk1/pppn1ppp/5n2/3p4/1b1P2b1/2N1PN2/PP1BBPPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 3 9,"8... Nc6 came to my mind first but I thought advancing the c-pawn sooner or later - be it one step for creating a strong pawnchain on the queenside or two steps for opening up the center - could be useful, so I'd head for b6."
17,O-O,e1g1,r2q1rk1/pppn1ppp/5n2/3p4/1b1P2b1/2N1PN2/PP1BBPPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 4 9,Protecting my center pawn once more and fancying the outpost on c4...
18,Nb6,d7b6,r2q1rk1/ppp2ppp/1n3n2/3p4/1b1P2b1/2N1PN2/PP1BBPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 5 10,Protecting my center pawn once more and fancying the outpost on c4...

20,Re8,f8e8,r2qr1k1/ppp2ppp/1n3n2/3p4/1b1P2b1/1PN1PN2/P2BBPPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 1 11,"As all of the minor pieces have been developed, I was without plan. But I thought possessing the e-file can't be wrong."
21,Rc1,a1c1,r2qr1k1/ppp2ppp/1n3n2/3p4/1b1P2b1/1PN1PN2/P2BBPPP/2RQ1RK1 b - - 2 11,"Ah, he is interested in the c-file. Time to strengthen my queenside..."

23,h3,h2h3,r2qr1k1/pp3ppp/1np2n2/3p4/1b1P2b1/1PN1PN1P/P2BBPP1/2RQ1RK1 b - - 0 12,Forcing my bishop to make a difficult decision. Take it (the knight) or leave it?
24,Bf5,g4f5,r2qr1k1/pp3ppp/1np2n2/3p1b2/1b1P4/1PN1PN1P/P2BBPP1/2RQ1RK1 w - - 1 13,"Leave it! Bxf3 was *very* tempting at first because it avoids his knight to go the fine center square e5 by simply killing it. But keeping the pair of bishops and thus not throwing away the minor imbalances was eventually more important to me, so I possessed the b1-h7 diagonal."
25,Ne5,f3e5,r2qr1k1/pp3ppp/1np2n2/3pNb2/1b1P4/1PN1P2P/P2BBPP1/2RQ1RK1 b - - 2 13,'No surprises' by Radiohead came into my mind when the opponent made this move.
