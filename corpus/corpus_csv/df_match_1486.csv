1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I am annotated this game to ask others about the position and get feedback. The computer calls a set of moves near end of game a blunder. However, I purposely sacrificed a knight to gain a rook. Please comment on this and let me know your thoughts. Black resigned, so I really don't know how it would have turned out, but it didn't look good for black."

8,h6,h7h6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2pp1/4pn1p/3p2B1/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"I prefer playing Be2 here as black. Otherwise, my king pawns get skewed and reduces the effectivity of a king side castle"
9,Bxf6,g5f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2pp1/4pB1p/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,First blood! I don't mind the exchange and his only option is to double the pawns kingside. Notice black still has no minor pieces developed.

14,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp3p2/5p1p/2pp4/3P4/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/R3KBNR w KQkq - 0 8,"Mistake on blacks part. I think maybe he thought I would take and give him the center, but that would never happen."
15,Nxd5,c3d5,rnbqkb1r/pp3p2/5p1p/2pN4/3P4/5Q2/PPP2PPP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 0 8,Things are setting nicely. I just need to coax his bishop out of position.

20,Qxf6,d8f6,rn2kb1r/pp1b1p2/5q1p/1Bp2p2/3P4/5Q2/PPP2PPP/R3K1NR w KQkq - 0 11,"Really should have moved the king, but I don't think he sees the rook threat."
21,Qxb7,f3b7,rn2kb1r/pQ1b1p2/5q1p/1Bp2p2/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/R3K1NR b KQkq - 0 11,Black resigns here.
