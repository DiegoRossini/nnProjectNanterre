1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Again it has been a long time before I have been in a position to annotate a game - I have been trying to keep up with my moves in my regular games, but now at long last an annotation and it is a victory for Yours Truly.  Very late on in the game, Glenda emerges from her defensive role, much to the chagrin of my team captain, Julia-Celine who just happened to be my opponent in this game.  Glenda was aided by a humble pawn which lured Julia's king into a mating net.  How did this happen?  Well, gameknot analysis is provided here for you guys to follow the game. http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15957675&rnd=0.8891978702023171"
