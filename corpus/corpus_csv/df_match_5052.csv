1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This was a random challenge and my opponents rating was very close to mine. I have annotated it in the hope that more skilful players can suggest more efficient ways that it could have come to a conclusion

It was about this time that I was starting to form a plan, although I have not completed my development yet, I am ready to castle, and white isn't, so I decided to try to take him by surprise and attack aggressively"

This was partly a distraction in the hope that I would get the opportunity to move some of my pieces into better positions, in particular my lsb and queen."
