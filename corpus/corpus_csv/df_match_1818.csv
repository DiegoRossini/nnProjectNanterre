1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"MOVE BY MOVE ANNOTATION: This is a move by move annotation and the outcome is unknown at this time. Trying something a little new.I am annotating this game as I play it to avoid a rushed annotation later. Also, I do not like to skip ahead lots of moves. I usually pass on annotations where several moves leading to a crucial position are skipped over. I don't have time to figure it out and I will figure from comments I have read I am not the only one with this issue. So starting now all my annotations will show every move, however trivial, to make viewing easier. I will publish the game after it is completed as to avoid getting comments while the game is going on.

I only open with D4 or E4 as white. I try to do about 50/50 with each opening. And it is E4's turn this time."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Here is a move by black that should be a sound and aggressive response to E4 but it never seems to pan out for black, at least at level I play at, the 1250 to 1550 range usually.  I never play it as black myself.  I am not sure what the objectives are really but it always evolves into a board setup I do not like. Where black and white's pieces are stuck behind their pawns too long and a big open battle field sits empty between the two sides. Oh well. It seems a popular reply to E4 at GK so I am a little used to it and handle well these days winning most games that start in this position, according to my personal database."
3,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,I think this is the standard way to go.
4,Qxd5,d8d5,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Queen takes pawn.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"Knight to C3. This move forces his queen to do something, letting her know she is not welcome to roost on D5 as she pleases. It also develops a piece on white's side. The book responses tend to be queen back to her station on D8 or moving to A5 and establishing a formidable outpost for a possible flanking attack later."
6,Qe6+,d5e6,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/4q3/8/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,But he does what 75% of players do in this position and he checks the king. Why? They seem like they cannot resist that early check either on E6 or E5. In my early games I did get myself tied up with the queen jumping around my king side and it can get messy and I lost a few early games with this one.   But with a little experience you will find that this usually this works against black since he seems to try to win the game with a queen alone. As he jumps around trying to check you or get the G2 pawn you are developing pieces and often corralling his queen little by little. White just needs to take a breath and relax and let it play out.
7,Be2,f1e2,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/4q3/8/8/2N5/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 3 4,"Bishop to E2. This works better, I think, than putting your knight on E2. A queen trade only leads to a long and boring game from the get go. Even if I win I have won a long and boring game and there is little thrill. He probably wants a queen trade off but I am not interested. Players who rush in early with queen attacks tend to run out of steam and I will move my lady out when the time is right."
8,b5,b7b5,rnb1kbnr/p1p1pppp/4q3/1p6/8/2N5/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,"I do not know what is up here. Maybe he was thinking that because my LS bishop was pinned he could advance that pawn. Maybe he wants to attack the G2 square with his bishop, but pawn to B6 would have worked better for that. I hesitated thinking it was sort of trap but decide it was a blunder."
9,Nxb5,c3b5,rnb1kbnr/p1p1pppp/4q3/1N6/8/8/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,Knight takes pawn.
10,Ba6,c8a6,rn2kbnr/p1p1pppp/b3q3/1N6/8/8/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 1 6,"I think I can see what he is thinking here.  Or maybe not. Seems he may be attacking the LS bishop on E2 with his bishop and queen? Not sure. It is double guarded anyway by my queen and knight. Or he got antsy because he just lost a piece and wants to be aggressive and takes the "" in your face"" approach. I don't know, but I have found a queen loss is common for black with the Scandinavian if he is not cautious and patient. His best move was to move his queen back to protect the vulnerable C7 square. But sometimes people see this as ""retreating"" and giving up gained (though worthless) territory."
11,Nxc7+,b5c7,rn2kbnr/p1N1pppp/b3q3/8/8/8/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 6,"Black often can lose his queen with the Scandinavian if he is not careful, but it is usually not this quick and easy. I have made goofs like his too and I would have resigned the game and flagellated myself. My opponent is not disturbed by this turn of events, as if it is all in the expected course of events."
12,Kd7,e8d7,rn3bnr/p1Nkpppp/b3q3/8/8/8/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK1NR w KQ - 1 7,King gets out of check.
13,Nxe6,c7e6,rn3bnr/p2kpppp/b3N3/8/8/8/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK1NR b KQ - 0 7,Queen is butchered on move 7.
14,Bxe2,a6e2,rn3bnr/p2kpppp/4N3/8/8/8/PPPPbPPP/R1BQK1NR w KQ - 0 8,"My opponent seems to think the loss of a queen so early on is nothing to prevent him from continuing attacks and trading off material. I think hanging on to that bishop would have been better but I would not even be playing any longer, so I don't know. I do not play what I see as ""lost"" games."
15,Qxe2,d1e2,rn3bnr/p2kpppp/4N3/8/8/8/PPPPQPPP/R1B1K1NR b KQ - 0 8,"Move my queen out. Want my knight on F3 for some reason, not on E2 slowing down my queen deployment and blocking my rook on the E file later.
....
Maybe taking his DS bishop and checking him last move and then taking his LS bishop would have been better, but I am not worried really."
16,fxe6,f7e6,rn3bnr/p2kp1pp/4p3/8/8/8/PPPPQPPP/R1B1K1NR w KQ - 0 9,"He takes the knight and doubles up pawns. Note the big expanse of board between the two sides, a common formation with the Scandinavian and one reason I loathe it."
17,Nf3,g1f3,rn3bnr/p2kp1pp/4p3/8/8/5N2/PPPPQPPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 1 9,Develop knight.
18,Nc6,b8c6,r4bnr/p2kp1pp/2n1p3/8/8/5N2/PPPPQPPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 2 10,Knight to C6.
19,O-O,e1g1,r4bnr/p2kp1pp/2n1p3/8/8/5N2/PPPPQPPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 3 10,I castle and plan on getting my rook out to the soon to be semi-open E file ASAP.
20,h6,h7h6,r4bnr/p2kp1p1/2n1p2p/8/8/5N2/PPPPQPPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 0 11,"I guess he is trying to prevent my knight from going to G5, but I no longer have any reason to go to that square with my knight. His king is open and in the center of the board and off the 8th rank."
