1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Last game I opened with a knight move. I've since been using the KP. I've had much more success.
2,Na6,b8a6,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/n7/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"Didn't expect that, I've not had someone play this before."
3,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/n7/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"I like the center, but awaiting the flank attack."
4,b6,b7b6,r1bqkbnr/p1pppppp/np6/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Here it comes.
5,c4,c2c4,r1bqkbnr/p1pppppp/np6/8/2PPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"I thought if I could get the d pawn on d5, that would be a strong center."
6,c5,c7c5,r1bqkbnr/p2ppppp/np6/2p5/2PPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"I really wish I could've played d5, but it just doesn't look good anymore. I would like to know what others think."
7,Be3,c1e3,r1bqkbnr/p2ppppp/np6/2p5/2PPP3/4B3/PP3PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,Protecting the pawn to try and keep some center control
8,cxd4,c5d4,r1bqkbnr/p2ppppp/np6/8/2PpP3/4B3/PP3PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,There goes the center.
9,Bxd4,e3d4,r1bqkbnr/p2ppppp/np6/8/2PBP3/8/PP3PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"My bishop announces ""Here I am!"""
10,d6,d7d6,r1bqkbnr/p3pppp/np1p4/8/2PBP3/8/PP3PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"Further central loss. I don't want to push my pawns forward too much further, lest he get behind them."
11,Qd3,d1d3,r1bqkbnr/p3pppp/np1p4/8/2PBP3/3Q4/PP3PPP/RN2KBNR b KQkq - 1 6,"This felt premature, but I liked the symmetry."
12,Nc5,a6c5,r1bqkbnr/p3pppp/1p1p4/2n5/2PBP3/3Q4/PP3PPP/RN2KBNR w KQkq - 2 7,Symmetry is really overrated.
13,Qe3,d3e3,r1bqkbnr/p3pppp/1p1p4/2n5/2PBP3/4Q3/PP3PPP/RN2KBNR b KQkq - 3 7,Didn't want to trade my bishop for a knight. It looked like an open game and I think the bishop more valuable.
14,e5,e7e5,r1bqkbnr/p4ppp/1p1p4/2n1p3/2PBP3/4Q3/PP3PPP/RN2KBNR w KQkq - 0 8,"I can't remember exactly when it happened, but I am fairly disappointed in my performance and this point."
