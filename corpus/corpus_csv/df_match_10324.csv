But here, white should see the pin and sacrifice by 19.Nxf6!. this sac is quite sound . For example if 19...Nxf4 20.Rxf4 20...Bxf6 , you can easily summon your second rook to platy and you win your material back with all extras.

There's nothing good really left for black, 

if Black tries to escape the pin by 18...Kg8 the same sacrifice is possible, but only after moving your bishop away by Be3 (not allowing queen to take) and the sacrifice.      (19.Be3! 19...Ne6 20.Nxf6 20...Bxf6 21. Qg6! and double thread)"
