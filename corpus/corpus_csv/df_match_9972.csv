The game is now reaching the middlegame and both sides need to find a plan to follow. If allowed, white will play h4-h5xg6, Be3-h6xg7, Qh6 and mate on the h-file. In general, there are two kinds of plans that black can adopt. The first is to play the minimum amount of defencive moves on the kingside and take all measures possible to embarrass the white king on the queenside - a common race-situation. The other one is completely ignore whites play and try to find a sac-sac-mate-solution!.

In this position, it seems that black needs to find something more than ...Qc7, ...Rfc8 etc, since whites attack is likely to be quicker. 14...Re8 is one approach, aiming to keep the dark squared bishops on board and maybe prepare ....Qa5. I opted for different solution."

Here I thought for a long time, but the thing is that the rook does not have a good retreat square. So I figured out that the rook would have to go. I have to admit, still, that I had in mind that complications are my only chance to beat a player over 200 elo higher than me. This is bit unhealthy aproach and I think I should try to get over that kind of attitude."
