1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Centre game opening. Interesting in a lot of respect. Any hints as to mistakes, moves that could have been more efficient is much appreciated"
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,The balance on the board is restored
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,White attacks Black's e pawn
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"Defence of the e pawn, a fight for the centre"
5,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,White decide to re-attack the my centre pawn by d2-d4. Capturing White's d pawn is better than trying to protect it as Black's position could become cramped pretty quickly
6,exd4,e5d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,Black takes White's pawn and puts the question back to him: reclaim your lost pawn!
7,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"White takes the d pawn. I could have taken White's knight in the centre of the board but decided against it because then the his queen would be in the centre of the board white no obvious way to attack it as most of my pieces were still firmly hemmed in. However, the decision of not taking the knight off means that I should be prepared for doubled up pawns (Am I the only one who hates doubled up pawns?)"
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"Deciding against attacking the d4 knight, I attack the undefended e pawn. Continue fighting for the centre. The doubled up pawn could be coming..."
9,Nxc6,d4c6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2N2n2/8/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"As expected (or feared), White takes my knight off the board"
10,bxc6,b7c6,r1bqkb1r/p1pp1ppp/2p2n2/8/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Black retakes his knight. I was not keen on using the d pawn as White would be more than happy to exchange queens, whereby my king would loose the right to castle"
11,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkb1r/p1pp1ppp/2p2n2/8/2B1P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,White prepares to castle (or for any subsequent attack on my king after it has castled king side. I want to restore my pawn structure...
12,d5,d7d5,r1bqkb1r/p1p2ppp/2p2n2/3p4/2B1P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,Double attack on his bishop and his e pawn. I gain a tempo in development
13,Bb3,c4b3,r1bqkb1r/p1p2ppp/2p2n2/3p4/4P3/1B6/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,"White decided to retreat to enforced my double up pawn. The best move I thought was to prepare to castle by moving my dark square bishop to e7, but then I would still be on step behind in development to white. Seeing that all of his queen side was still full, I decided to fix the White king in the middle of the board for now."
14,Ba6,c8a6,r2qkb1r/p1p2ppp/b1p2n2/3p4/4P3/1B6/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 8,"The sole idea is to keep white from castling to allow up a better game through superior and faster development. In my mind, this move was the key in winning the game, even if in the middle of the action, I was very worried about putting my bishop unprotected"
15,Bg5,c1g5,r2qkb1r/p1p2ppp/b1p2n2/3p2B1/4P3/1B6/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 3 8,"In my mind, this is a useless move as my next move was Be7 anyway, to prepared to castle. The only rationale I saw was: 1)that White had given up trying to castle king side and wanted to castle queen side instead and 2) preparing to take my d5 pawn off (attacked 3 times, defended 3 times), so by taking the knight out, he'd be a pawn ahead"

18,Bxf6,e7f6,r2qk2r/p1p2ppp/b1p2b2/3p4/4P3/1B6/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 10,"I recapture. Regardless of what White does, I will castle next and start putting pressure on this well centred king"
19,c3,c2c3,r2qk2r/p1p2ppp/b1p2b2/3p4/4P3/1BP5/PP3PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 0 10,"White did not White take the pawn? Was he worried about his king being still in the centre? If he is, why is 1) destroying his pawn structure queen side and 2) depriving his knight of the better c3 position?"
