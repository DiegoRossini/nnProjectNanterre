7. ... Be6 allows white to play Bxf6 with Nd5 - fork on c7. Taking knight allows white to play exd5 - cramping blacks position.
h6 - why? white is going to take the knight anyway. Wasted tempo.
7. ... Be7 8.Bxf6 - looses the d pawn. Black has to play gxf6 otherwise white takes the d pawn and the black bishop is ""stuck"" behind the pawns.
7. ... Bg4 8.f3 any bishop move, Nd5 ... same problem as stated. 
Leaving the knight on b5 usually leads to trouble."

Lesson: after this game, it seems to me, that the d5 square is the critical one. (Be6)"
