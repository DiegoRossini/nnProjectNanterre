4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Black defends his pawn. I see this option almost every time I play Queen's gambit.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"So, I continued with Nc3, intending Bf4 and Nb5 later on, which I have never tried to play."
6,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk1nr/ppp1bppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,Black continues by developing his Bishop on e7.

But two things were sure. 1:He has no Nc6 move 2: ..."
