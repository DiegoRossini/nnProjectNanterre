5,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,Many possible variations from here. I hoped for the boring Nf6 so i could use my favourite Fried Liver Attack but it turns out to be...
6,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,"The Giuoco Piano! Also known as the Italian Game. White logically places his Bishop on an active diagonal and eyes the vulnerable pawn on f7. This opening was very popular in the 1800s but better defensive techniques, and the advent of the more subtle Ruy Lopez, took away some of its luster."
7,c3,c2c3,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,"4.c3 leads to the main line. White takes control of the d4 square and prepares to grab the center with a d2-d4 advance. Black has to take active measures against this; indecisive play will allow White to carry out his plan, with all spatial gains and perks that go along with a successful annexation of the center. Have you noticed the difference between me and armita's rating? it's about 600!!!"

10,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p1N1/2B1P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 3 6,"I didn't see that to be honest, Black safely castles to avoid any sort of trap."
11,O-O,e1g1,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p1N1/2B1P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 4 6,"So, I castled as well, now i hope to bring my f1 rook into the game."

19,Nh7,g5h7,r2q1rk1/ppp2ppN/5n1p/n1bPp3/6b1/2PB4/PPQP1PPP/RNB2RK1 b - - 1 10,"Targeting that rook on f8. My chess teacher told me to think that your opponent will do the best possible move, so i thought 10 Bh7+ Kh8 then nothing really happens. But 10 Bh7+ Nxh7?? 11 Qxh7#."
