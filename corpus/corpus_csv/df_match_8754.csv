Black's disadvantages before this move were: loss of a piece and uncompleted development with black king in the center. The latter could be improved by castling NOW. Moreover, white couldn't immediately start attacking as the center pawns protected black. With this move, black helps white by opening lines in front of the king, and ruins own chances of castling (black can't castle for a few moves now)"
