1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Playing against easy19 has a kind of psychological effect on me... I play worse than ever, as you will see. This is a lesson about how NOT to play. Still, there is a somewhat interesting countergame I couldn't manage well."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"A mini tournament on this is currently being played. I never faced it, so I was looking into the database."

4,Ne4,f6e4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/6B1/3Pn3/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 3 3,"This seems logical and naive, but I couldn't see any damage."
5,Bf4,g5f4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/8/3PnB2/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 4 3,The idea is to get the knight back to f6 taking advantage of a kind of Dutch set for black.

7,Nd2,b1d2,rnbqkb1r/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/3PnB2/8/PPPNPPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,"...but this was a blunder. I thought after NxN, my extra central pawn would have somewhat cramped white, but I was plainly wrong."
8,b6,b7b6,rnbqkb1r/p1ppp1pp/1p6/5p2/3PnB2/8/PPPNPPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"...but this was a blunder. I thought after NxN, my extra central pawn would have somewhat cramped white, but I was plainly wrong."
9,Nxe4,d2e4,rnbqkb1r/p1ppp1pp/1p6/5p2/3PNB2/8/PPP1PPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"My kingside is wide open now, and I am behind in developement. I can see I'm doomed right now."
10,fxe4,f5e4,rnbqkb1r/p1ppp1pp/1p6/8/3PpB2/8/PPP1PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"My kingside is wide open now, and I am behind in developement. I can see I'm doomed right now."

12,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/p1ppp2p/1p4p1/8/3PpB2/4P3/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,"The queen's check in h5, followed by Qe5, is already very annoying. Now, the bishop can go to e5 and makes me lose my castling on the queenside, but I have to think about a queenside castling - if ever."
13,h4,h2h4,rnbqkb1r/p1ppp2p/1p4p1/8/3PpB1P/4P3/PPP2PP1/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 7,"Very easy to spot: an exchange on h5 is lethal, so..."
14,h5,h7h5,rnbqkb1r/p1ppp3/1p4p1/7p/3PpB1P/4P3/PPP2PP1/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 8,Another tempo wasted for developement. But h4 was lethal.
15,Nh3,g1h3,rnbqkb1r/p1ppp3/1p4p1/7p/3PpB1P/4P2N/PPP2PP1/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 8,I expected g4 at once... but white can play as he wants.
16,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/p1pp4/1p2p1p1/7p/3PpB1P/4P2N/PPP2PP1/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 9,"Hard choice. d6 prevents the bishop to go e5, but does little for my developement. This at least opens the way for my dsb to exchange some white pieces. Another option was d6. But this would have meant to admit b3 was just a wasted tempo."
17,Ng5,h3g5,rnbqkb1r/p1pp4/1p2p1p1/6Np/3PpB1P/4P3/PPP2PP1/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 9,Bb7 is impossible since e6 would be taken.
