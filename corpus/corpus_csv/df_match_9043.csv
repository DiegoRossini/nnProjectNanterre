12,Qf6,d8f6,rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/5q2/8/1bB1P3/2N5/PB3PPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 3 7,"Generally,the queen should not be developed too early. Anyway, this violation of general principle does come with the simple threat of BxN ."
13,Nge2,g1e2,rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/5q2/8/1bB1P3/2N5/PB2NPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 4 7,Defending against BxN  and also clearing the way for a kingside castle while developing the knight as well!
14,Nh6,g8h6,rnb1k2r/pppp1ppp/5q1n/8/1bB1P3/2N5/PB2NPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 5 8,"f6 was the ideal square for this knight. But f6 is occupied by Her Majesty the black queen. So, my opponent develops the knight on the edge. Perhaps Ne7 was better."
15,O-O,e1g1,rnb1k2r/pppp1ppp/5q1n/8/1bB1P3/2N5/PB2NPPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 6 8,Getting my king to safety was my first priority which is now achieved.

17,f4,f2f4,rnb1k2r/pppp1ppp/3b1q1n/8/2B1PP2/2N5/PB2N1PP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 9,With the simple threat of e5. But this move was the pivotal point where I weakened my king position. Now black starts attacking!
18,Ng4,h6g4,rnb1k2r/pppp1ppp/3b1q2/8/2B1PPn1/2N5/PB2N1PP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 1 10,The knight is planted into my kingside.

20,Bc5+,d6c5,rnb1k2r/pppp1ppp/5q2/2b5/2B1PPn1/2N2R2/PB2N1PP/R2Q2K1 w kq - 3 11,This wins material! But its still difficult to achieve checkmate.
21,Kh1,g1h1,rnb1k2r/pppp1ppp/5q2/2b5/2B1PPn1/2N2R2/PB2N1PP/R2Q3K b kq - 4 11,From here the queen targets both h2 and f2.

28,Kd8,e8d8,rnbk3r/pppp1ppp/8/3N4/2B1PP1q/7P/PB2NbP1/R2Q3K w - - 2 15,"This seems to save the rook, but it loses the game. In my view, this is the losing move. Simply Bb6 may prove better in the long run. But even that leads to an attack thats difficult to refute. Nevertheless, it is better than Kd8."
29,Bxg7,b2g7,rnbk3r/pppp1pBp/8/3N4/2B1PP1q/7P/P3NbP1/R2Q3K b - - 0 15,This is a very strong move which threatens both the rook and Bf6  which wins the mighty black queen.
