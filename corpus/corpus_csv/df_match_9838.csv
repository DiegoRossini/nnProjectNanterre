1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I'm annotating this game at the request of my opponent, nathanman22.  Although Black won this game, that result was an extremely lucky break.  Earlier, in the game I had been in great trouble... I'll try to keep the annotations thematic as far as possible - not too many long variations... Here goes (comments very welcome):"
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,White is either aiming for a closed Sicilian or simply trying to cut out some overworked lines by delaying the pawn advance d4.  The plan makes Black think carefully since he doesn't yet know what kind of game will be played.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,White is either aiming for a closed Sicilian or simply trying to cut out some overworked lines by delaying the pawn advance d4.  The plan makes Black think carefully since he doesn't yet know what kind of game will be played.

Because Black's c-pawn has not yet been exchanged for White's d-pawn (as in a normal open Sicilian), there is a potential threat of playing ...b5 and the white bishop can't retreat to its natural square b3 as it would then be trapped by the advance of Black's c-pawn."

18,b4,b5b4,r2qkb1r/1b1p1ppp/p1n1pn2/8/1p1NP3/2N1B3/PPPQBPPP/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 10,"So, Black is a pawn up out of the opening.  He must be careful, however, to complete his development now and not get greedy..."

Another reason why White's ninth move was a mistake is that Black captures the e-pawn with tempo, attacking White's Queen, which has to move again.  However, d3 was the wrong square to go to since it allows Black to defend his knight on e4 by opening the Bb7's diagonal at the same time as attacking White's queen - again."

It's so important in the opening (which can be viewed as a race to be the first to get properly developed) not to allow your opponent too many of these ""free"" moves."
23,Qd1,d3d1,r2qkb1r/1b1p1ppp/p3p3/4n3/Np1Nn3/4B3/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 3 12,"Heading back where she started but all these queen moves have allowed Black to get quite active quite quickly.

24,d5,d7d5,r2qkb1r/1b3ppp/p3p3/3pn3/Np1Nn3/4B3/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 13,The knight on e4 is defended properly and Black gets his liberating ...d5 move with ease.
25,Nf3,d4f3,r2qkb1r/1b3ppp/p3p3/3pn3/Np2n3/4BN2/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 13,"It seems a shame to have to retreat the knight from its central point on d4 but the threat was ...Qa5 by Black, which would have attacked the knight on the edge of the board at a4 -- a piece which has nowhere to go.  By moving the other knight back to f3 White can answer ...Qa5 with Nb6 - since that sq is now covered by the Be3 - instead of being forced to play b3 to defend it.  The move also asks Black what he's going to do about his unsupported knight on e5."
26,Bd6,f8d6,r2qk2r/1b3ppp/p2bp3/3pn3/Np2n3/4BN2/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 14,This piece exchange probably doesn't improve White's position.  Now Black is attacking the b-pawn and making it harder for White to play b3 to defend his knight on a4.
27,Nxe5,f3e5,r2qk2r/1b3ppp/p2bp3/3pN3/Np2n3/4B3/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 14,This piece exchange probably doesn't improve White's position.  Now Black is attacking the b-pawn and making it harder for White to play b3 to defend his knight on a4.

29,Bb6,e3b6,r2qk2r/1b3ppp/pB2p3/3pb3/Np2n3/8/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 15,"(!?) an interesting practical decision, trying to disrupt the coordination of the Black pieces."
30,Qd6,d8d6,r3k2r/1b3ppp/pB1qp3/3pb3/Np2n3/8/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 16,Black moves his queen out of danger and now threatens to play Bc6 (attacking the knight on a4) and consequent threat of ...Bxa4 followed by ...Qxb6.  White's position is already quite difficult.
31,c4,c2c4,r3k2r/1b3ppp/pB1qp3/3pb3/NpP1n3/8/PP2BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq c3 0 16,"(?!) Although this move isn't quite sound, it does force Black to navigate certain dangers as he picks up more material."
32,Bxb2,e5b2,r3k2r/1b3ppp/pB1qp3/3p4/NpP1n3/8/Pb2BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 17,"(?) Black goes wrong almost immediately.  Perhaps he was confused by having three different pawn captures available: ...dxc4; ...bxc3 e.p.; and the move played.  Taking the c-pawn en passant would have been the best choice - then there wouldn't have been a DSB en pris on b2 in many variations.  However, Black is eying the Ra1..."
33,c5,c4c5,r3k2r/1b3ppp/pB1qp3/2Pp4/Np2n3/8/Pb2BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 17,"(!) Making the most of Black's mistake to muddy the waters.  This move has several points: (1) it creates a passed pawn which provides compensation for the lost material; (2) it defends the bishop on b6 so now White is threatening to take the Black bishop on b2 with his knight; and (3) it attacks Black' s queen, forcing it to move away from the defence of his own king, which soon finds itself under attack."
34,Qe5,d6e5,r3k2r/1b3ppp/pB2p3/2Ppq3/Np2n3/8/Pb2BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 1 18,There wasn't much else -- Black needs to move his Queen and at the same time defend his bishop.
35,Nxb2,a4b2,r3k2r/1b3ppp/pB2p3/2Ppq3/1p2n3/8/PN2BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 18,White's decision to exchange the Bb2 has brought the Black queen into the heart of the White position.  Together with the knight on e4 this presents a real danger and White must be careful.
36,Qxb2,e5b2,r3k2r/1b3ppp/pB2p3/2Pp4/1p2n3/8/Pq2BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 19,White's decision to exchange the Bb2 has brought the Black queen into the heart of the White position.  Together with the knight on e4 this presents a real danger and White must be careful.
