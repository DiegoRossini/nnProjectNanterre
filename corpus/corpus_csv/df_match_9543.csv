As my opponent was still on-line I knew that I would come back to my desk and receive a gameknot message telling me that I have delivered mate or at the very least received a white flag!  When I returned to my desk Gameknot sent me this message ""Game Won (Checkmate), Congratulations!  I then went and did some filing in excellent spirits knowing that my rating was within 4 points of my highest provisional rating, 1695.  My current rating to date is 1691 and I have scored 20.5 points out of 32 games from my 3 mini-tournaments put together.  Nice."
