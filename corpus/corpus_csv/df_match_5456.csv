Back then I was revealling in the strength and security of the berlin defence. It is a solid defence and is aptly names the berlin wall for a reason. The Berlin endgames are quiet and boring

Q: Who is better here?

A: To answer this question we need to know what the indicators are of an advantage. There are 5 indicators and they are as follows:
1. advantage in development and control of the centre
2. Possession of supporting points and open lines
3. material superiority
4. advantageous pawn structure

5. presence of weaknesses in the enemy position. 

Based upon the above indicators we can use the follow model to make a solid evaluation what white should play next. 

1. Material relationship
- The material relationship between forces is equal, no advantage to either side.
2. Presence of direct threats
- white has no direct threat, while black has the threat of securing the plus of a bishop pair with ...Nxb5. the advantage is to black. Black also has the strategically better ...c6 to harass the bishop which increases control of D5. 
3. King position and their safety
- white has castled to safety while the black king is still in the centre, advantage white
4. Possession of support squares and open lines
- white current controls sole possession of the e-file while black has nothing, advantage to white
5. Pawn structure, weak and strong squares.
- both pawn structures are identical, there are no immediate weaknesses, and no strong squares have emerged, no advantage to either side
6. The centre and space
- white currently enjoys more space and mobility based on the fact that he has great control and influence in the centre, Black has yet to make a difference in the centre, advantage white.
7. Development and position of pieces. 
-White has a slight lead in development because his king is castled. This however has not had a significant impact on the game, White pieces are temporally more active but blacks piece are more harmoniously placed. neither side has an advantage

Conclusion:

Whites plan must include:
- must deal with the immediate threat of the bishop capture
- consolidate control in centre
- complete development

Black's plan must include:
- challenge for control in the centre
- fight for the e-file
-castle king to safety
- complete development

Final evaluation: White has a slight advantage. 

so as black I was expecting 8. Be2 f6 to fight for control of the e-file and challenge for space in the centre."

It was better to move the bishop. Although it looks like e7 is shaky it is not because black has a wonderful resource that allows him to beat up on the white rook."

Black is clearly better but how should he proceed? Based upon the prior evaluation we know that black has to work on two other negatives. 

1. complete development
2. king safety
3. fight for the e-file

*completely development would increase black'  current advantage in centre and space
*the king safety is not currently an issue so black can forgo castling in order to take advantage of tempo
*black currently does not have the resources to fight for the e-file. 

So I played ...Be6 it accomplishes two out of the 3 objectives"
