1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

Here is the first of two endgames from a new sparring partner called Dan.  He is a Class C player but with his stats - he has only lost 3 games out of 6 against me - he can start looking up towards Class B status.  I will now show you a couple of games against him in Chicoboy's Club's Mini-Tournament.  My score against him was 1.5 - 0.5 in my favour.  This is the game in which I was to concede a Low Draw in a K & P ending.  So, how did this happen?  Well, I end up trying out the Philidor Defense against him.  Surprisingly when I have played it I have done pretty well with it and one of those victories was my first ever Class A victory when I had a Class C rating - so I thought I would try it.  Here is how it all panned out.  Dan opens with 1. e4."
