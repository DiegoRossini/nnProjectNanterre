1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Tried and true.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,One of the most common responses.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Here both knights are attacking their respective pawns, white has the slight upper hand of the first move."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"Here both knights are attacking their respective pawns, white has the slight upper hand of the first move."
5,Nxe5,f3e5,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,He takes that initiative.
6,d6,d7d6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"My counter was simple, force him to return..."
7,Nxf7,e5f7,rnbqkb1r/ppp2Npp/3p1n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,Unless of course he does that.  I can't afford to allow him to take a rook or queen so I must take with my King.
8,Kxf7,e8f7,rnbq1b1r/ppp2kpp/3p1n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQ - 0 5,I have lost my right to castle and my King is more than a little vulnerable
9,d4,d2d4,rnbq1b1r/ppp2kpp/3p1n2/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQ - 0 5,Opens up his bishop for attack and strengthens his center.
10,Be7,f8e7,rnbq3r/ppp1bkpp/3p1n2/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQ - 1 6,A plan to set up something that looks like I castled and get my king a little out of danger (quite hopeful am I not?).
11,Bc4+,f1c4,rnbq3r/ppp1bkpp/3p1n2/8/2BPP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQ - 2 6,I expected this move as it makes sense that he would like to take advantage of his prior moves.
12,Be6,c8e6,rn1q3r/ppp1bkpp/3pbn2/8/2BPP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 3 7,I counter with an attack with my bishop.
13,Bxe6+,c4e6,rn1q3r/ppp1bkpp/3pBn2/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQ - 0 7,I did not suspect this move.  Perhaps better would be to lay off this move and either  Qd3 or Bb3.  Either could cause some future problems for black.
14,Kxe6,f7e6,rn1q3r/ppp1b1pp/3pkn2/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 0 8,Still this can be called some serious problems.
15,Qf3,d1f3,rn1q3r/ppp1b1pp/3pkn2/8/3PP3/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 1 8,I have to find a way to get my King out of the unprotected center of the board.
16,g6,g7g6,rn1q3r/ppp1b2p/3pknp1/8/3PP3/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 0 9,Hmmm.. I seem confused.
17,d5+,d4d5,rn1q3r/ppp1b2p/3pknp1/3P4/4P3/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 0 9,Yuck.
18,Kf7,e6f7,rn1q3r/ppp1bk1p/3p1np1/3P4/4P3/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 1 10,I started returning to my previous plan.
19,b3,b2b3,rn1q3r/ppp1bk1p/3p1np1/3P4/4P3/1P3Q2/P1P2PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 0 10,This could spell trouble as all of his attackers will soon be pointed in the only real direction that my King may have a little protection at this point.
20,Re8,h8e8,rn1qr3/ppp1bk1p/3p1np1/3P4/4P3/1P3Q2/P1P2PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 1 11,"My continuation.  Similar to a castling.  Normally I would have preferred Rf8, but then Bh6 would have caused me to waste time, and I am already behind in time and position.  In this case both E and F files are half open so E is best."
21,O-O,e1g1,rn1qr3/ppp1bk1p/3p1np1/3P4/4P3/1P3Q2/P1P2PPP/RNB2RK1 b - - 2 11,"Unfortunately, my king is most safe here.  Not one of my ideas of a fun situation."
22,Kg8,f7g8,rn1qr1k1/ppp1b2p/3p1np1/3P4/4P3/1P3Q2/P1P2PPP/RNB2RK1 w - - 3 12,"Unfortunately, my king is most safe here.  Not one of my ideas of a fun situation."
