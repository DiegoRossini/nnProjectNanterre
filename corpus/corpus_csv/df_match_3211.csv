30,Be7,d6e7,2kr2nr/ppp1bpqp/4p3/6p1/3nN3/3P2PP/PPPB1PB1/R2QR1K1 w - - 4 16,At this point I was hoping black would take the bait on b2 so I could then play Bc3 forking the rook and queen but as I expected my opponent was wary of all of my plans.
31,Be3,d2e3,2kr2nr/ppp1bpqp/4p3/6p1/3nN3/3PB1PP/PPP2PB1/R2QR1K1 b - - 5 16,At this point I was hoping black would take the bait on b2 so I could then play Bc3 forking the rook and queen but as I expected my opponent was wary of all of my plans.

35,Bc3,d2c3,2kr2nr/ppp1bpqp/3np3/6p1/4N3/2BP2PP/PPP2PB1/R2QR1K1 b - - 9 18,Now black has adapted a somewhat passive position as I gain some counterplay. I would've definetely played bf6 and then after a few exchanges black could've cotinued the attack.
