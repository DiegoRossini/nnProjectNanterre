38,Ng6e7,g6e7,r1bq1rnk/4nppp/pp3b2/2pPpN2/2P1P3/3BBN1P/P2Q1PP1/3R1RK1 w - - 4 20,"A possible miscalculation here from Black. Vacating the space behind the bishop was a logical and almost forced move. Moving into that space now vacated, is not. I think I wrote in a different annotation somewhere that a good move too early or soon oft becomes a mistake. I'm not sure if I'm ready to give this the full blown mistake tag but I will assign it as a possible inaccuracy. What I do know is this takes care of the (mini) problems created by the failed attempt to draw an error from Black with Nf5. The position of that piece could have created problems for White in the late middle but here a potential pressure point is removed. Exchange in material, I'm calling this a slight positional win for White. Especially since, after this, White can get back to deconstructing that diagonal of Black's I was moaning about what seems like an age ago."

The knight comfortably avoids the bishop and settles into an imposing position. Black's position will disintegrate swiftly if composure isn't regained."
