1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This win prompted my opponent to seek an immediate rematch. Looking at his profile, I see why! I was the lowest rated player ever to beat him.  Let's see how...  I started by eschewing my normal policy and giving 1.e4 a rare test (outside themed tourneys) against higher rated opposition."

Black resigned immediately.  Mate can't be prevented even by advancing the g-pawn to g6, the standard method in such positions, because of the pinned f-pawn.  Advancing to g5 would slow White down slightly but after Qg6+ and Qxh6+, Rxg5+ would win.  Black can't even play any useful back-rank checks, because the Nc3 covers d1 and Qg1+ is no use without support.  I was lucky that Black made the last mistake!!"
