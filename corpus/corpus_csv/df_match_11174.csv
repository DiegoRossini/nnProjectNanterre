5,e4,e2e4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3PP3/5P2/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"I offer Black a pawn for easy rapid development. Black can decline the sacrifice, but it gives me a strong centre, so Black's best bet is to take the pawn and defend to hold onto it."

18,c5,c7c5,r1bq1rk1/pp1nbppp/4pn2/2p3B1/3P4/2NB1N2/PPPQ2PP/2KR3R w - - 0 10,"Taking back on d4 is better with the queen than with the knight, because taking with the knight misplaces it, while taking with the queen doesn't disturb my position."

Not to mention other tactical threats if he declines it."
29,Rhf1,h1f1,r1b2rk1/pp1nbp2/1q2pnpQ/6N1/8/2NB4/PPP3PP/2KR1R2 b - - 3 15,Adding pressure to the kingside.
