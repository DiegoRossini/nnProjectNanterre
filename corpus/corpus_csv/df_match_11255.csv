1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The Interservice Chess Championships is a tournament held every year in which each of the four services (Army, Navy, Air Force & Marine Corps) send six of their best players to compete in a team competition against the other branches.  It is a long, tough tournament -- grueling, some might say -- especially for a guy like me who's sitting at the rung just above the floor on the wallchart. Some people play well at the beginning and burn out towards the end, while others just get warmed up with early losses and play better as the tournament progresses.  Luckily for me, I happened to be in the latter category for the 2004 Interservice. 

Just coming off my first win in this event I was pretty psyched up, but Major Cerezo would certainly give me a major headache if I slipped up, so I knew I had to be on my toes for this game. SSgt Chris Brashers had some of the Major's games in his database and I knew he liked to play the Sicilian, so I opted for the Grand Prix Attack, an opening that seems to fit my style of play. Playing aggressively had been working for me so I thought I'd continue this trend and keep the pressure up from the git-go. 

This was the best game I played at this tournament and one I'm very proud of because I was uncharacteristically able to really see the board and come up with a plan I followed throughout the game that led to my getting another point for the Navy team."

I was extremely happy to win a game over a very strong player like Major Cerezo, but I was even happier that I was able to come up with a coherent plan that worked. Thanks for the game, Major!"
