1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"King's Pawn, Patzer Opening.

Bringing the queen out early allows your opponent to chase her around the board.  He develops his pieces while you move the same one over and over.  If black answers with Pg6, great!  You get a rook.  Or if black plays Nc6 to protect the pawn, you might shoot for the four move mate with Bc4.  Black will probably counter that, however.  It is better to play conservatively unless you know your opponent is likely to be easy prey."
