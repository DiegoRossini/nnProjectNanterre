1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

I seem to be following one bad game with one good game and vice versa!  I lost a game to a 1900+ player called Paolo playing white in the Traxler and dropped 6 rating points.  Luckily I got them back plus a little more in this game when, as with Pawnstar, the e column proved a death trap to the white king, and yet again, Glenda was the instigator.  Gameknot analysis is as follows:- http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=15111303&fb=1&rnd=0.23920012303562282"
