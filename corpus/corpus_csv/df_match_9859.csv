1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi, it's jstevens1 here yet again with another game to annotate.  I am a new member of the Sneaky Knights Connection and have completed 12 games so far and scored 7 points.  This is one of the most nailbiting games I have ever played in, although it does not quite measure up to the one against Yakky In ""In Old Matey's Shadow, Part 2"".  However, for a few moves, it did look as though I might cop Old Matey.  I will now start with my first move as black.  This is the first time on gameknot that I have played the Scandinavian Defence - I guess I took some inspiration from Chrisobee - he played that opening against me in the annotated game ""Slow King"" and beat me with it so it can't be a bad opening.

1...... d5 (the Centre Counter or Scandinavian - to prevent white from totally controlling the centre)"

White is well and truly cornered and he waves the white flag.  Wheew!  Don't I get involved in some nailbiters!"
