2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I REALLY hate the Petroff. It is a great defense for black because they can actually just trade off and keep the position pretty much equal if played correctly. In this game you will see how when one breaks from book...then tactics can shatter the Petrof drawing dream.
