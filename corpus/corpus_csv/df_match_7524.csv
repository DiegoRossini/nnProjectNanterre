1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"My opponent begins with the Queen's Pawn, which is slower for castling than the more popular King's Pawn."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"I'm familiar with Queen's Pawn openings, I play against a very good player in Costa Coffee fairly regularly who always opens with it.  My standard response is Nf6, with the hope of a King's Indian."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 2,"And here I begin, with the fianchetto of my dark Bishop."
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"And here I begin, with the fianchetto of my dark Bishop."
5,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"And here I begin, with the fianchetto of my dark Bishop."
6,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,"And here I begin, with the fianchetto of my dark Bishop."
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,"Solid development move, but gives Black options in how to progress.  I considered continuing down my preferred route by castling, but I haven't tried out the Grunfeld and wanted to keep the option there so was forced to play. . ."
8,d5,d7d5,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3p4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,which is because White's 5th move was likely to be e4 and would've prevented me from playing to d5.
9,Qb3,d1b3,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3p4/2PP4/1QN2N2/PP2PPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"I didn't like the pressure White was placing on the central squares, so felt a quick exchange of Pawns might benefit me."
10,dxc4,d5c4,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/5np1/8/2pP4/1QN2N2/PP2PPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"I didn't like the pressure White was placing on the central squares, so felt a quick exchange of Pawns might benefit me."
11,Qxc4,b3c4,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/5np1/8/2QP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"I have to question the power of this move.  I feel e4 was perfectly playable and a stronger move, imposing a stronger control on the centre."
12,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/5np1/8/2QP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ - 1 7,"I have to question the power of this move.  I feel e4 was perfectly playable and a stronger move, imposing a stronger control on the centre."
13,e3,e2e3,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/5np1/8/2QP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQ - 0 7,"I have to question the power of this move.  I feel e4 was perfectly playable and a stronger move, imposing a stronger control on the centre."
14,Nc6,b8c6,r1bq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/2n2np1/8/2QP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ - 1 8,"I think I'd have probably played Bd3 instead, I think Be2 was a little passive.  Opens the way for a short-castle but not a strong square for the light Bishop to be on."
15,Be2,f1e2,r1bq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/2n2np1/8/2QP4/2N1PN2/PP2BPPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 2 8,"I think I'd have probably played Bd3 instead, I think Be2 was a little passive.  Opens the way for a short-castle but not a strong square for the light Bishop to be on."
16,Be6,c8e6,r2q1rk1/ppp1ppbp/2n1bnp1/8/2QP4/2N1PN2/PP2BPPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 3 9,"Attacking White's Queen, forcing her on the defensive."

18,a6,a7a6,r2q1rk1/1pp1ppbp/p1n1bnp1/1Q6/3P4/2N1PN2/PP2BPPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 0 10,"Obvious, moving the Queen on her way."

29,Qb2,a3b2,r4rk1/2pqppbp/2n1bnp1/1N6/1p1P4/4PN2/PQ2BPPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 1 15,"Looking at attacking the White Queen again by exchanging Pawns on the b and a file.  Again, a lesson I learnt from the game I had against easy19, ""Put your rook on the line of the queen, whatever the pieces that intervene"" (I believe the quote came from Ion)."
