5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 3,An odd choice given that the bishop's attack has just been cut off.

Not 8. Qe7, as discussed.  8. ... Ne7 looks most conventional.  From Black's point of view, this is best because it clear the Queen-side for action, even though the bishop is pinned."
