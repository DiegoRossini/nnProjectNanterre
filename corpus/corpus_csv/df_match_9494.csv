Nf3 with a mind to castling seems preferrable; f4 may also have some promise (restoring White's claim to the center).  b3 could also be considered for its prophylactic effect on the Knight."

The Knight finds itself pinned against the weak c pawn, and White is free to castle long into the open file.  Also, removing the Night from g1 allows Nxf3, doubling and isolating the f and g pawns (and slowing your development, although with each player already having attempted a lone Knight rush, I don't think development was foremost in anyone's mind here)."

Pieces in the center normally need to be attacking, or one risks being overloaded.  a4 seems like a safer bet, since Black now has an arsenal of potent responses - c5, e5, Bc4, O-O-O."
