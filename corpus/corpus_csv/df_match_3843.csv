1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"?! The key move of the controversial Latvian Gambit. Very rarely seen at high levels, Black gives up a pawn (and usually much more) for a lead in space and development."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"?! The key move of the controversial Latvian Gambit. Very rarely seen at high levels, Black gives up a pawn (and usually much more) for a lead in space and development."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"?! The key move of the controversial Latvian Gambit. Very rarely seen at high levels, Black gives up a pawn (and usually much more) for a lead in space and development."
4,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"?! The key move of the controversial Latvian Gambit. Very rarely seen at high levels, Black gives up a pawn (and usually much more) for a lead in space and development."
5,exf5,e4f5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pP2/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"This is a less common line, looking somewhat like a King's Gambit with the colors reversed. I don't think it generally fares as well as 3.Nxe5."
6,e4,e5e4,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/5P2/4p3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,Black kicks the White Knight and aggressively establishes some space on the center. Whether he'll be able to hold it or not is another matter.
7,Nd4,f3d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/5P2/3Np3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"Standard is 4.Ne5 Nf6 5.Be2, but this is playable as well."
8,Qf6,d8f6,rnb1kbnr/pppp2pp/5q2/5P2/3Np3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,"Threatening the Knight and developing the Queen to a surprisingly safe, effective location. Black intends to make the very most of his half-open f-file."
9,c3,c2c3,rnb1kbnr/pppp2pp/5q2/5P2/3Np3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"I can't find any literature for this move. I think 5.Qh5+ is probably stronger (5...g6 6.fxg6 and now if 6...Qxg6 7.Qe5+ wins the Rook, so 6...Qxd4 7.g7+ Ke7 and White promotes on move 8, winning material and stymieing the potential Black offensive."
10,d5,d7d5,rnb1kbnr/ppp3pp/5q2/3p1P2/3Np3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"? This seems logical but I think it's actually too defensive-minded. It's intended to release Black's other Bishop, but I think advancing the d-pawn can wait while Black runs the White Knight out of town with 5...c5 6.Nb5 Qc6 7.Qh5+ Kd8. Now Black can play ...d5 and ...c4 at his leisure, driving the Knight almost off the board altogether while securing the whole center for himself and preventing White from developing either of his Bishops."
11,Qh5+,d1h5,rnb1kbnr/ppp3pp/5q2/3p1P1Q/3Np3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 1 6,White prepares to win a pawn.
12,g6,g7g6,rnb1kbnr/ppp4p/5qp1/3p1P1Q/3Np3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"6...Kd8 is probably better here. The text sacrifices quite a bit of material for open lines--much riskier, but certainly in the spirit of the Latvian."
13,fxg6,f5g6,rnb1kbnr/ppp4p/5qP1/3p3Q/3Np3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 7,If 7...Qxg6? 8.Qe5+ wins the Rook and probably the game.
14,hxg6,h7g6,rnb1kbnr/ppp5/5qp1/3p3Q/3Np3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 8,If 7...Qxg6? 8.Qe5+ wins the Rook and probably the game.
15,Qxd5,h5d5,rnb1kbnr/ppp5/5qp1/3Q4/3Np3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 8,Black sacrifices another pawn in exchange for developing with tempo.
16,Ne7,g8e7,rnb1kb1r/ppp1n3/5qp1/3Q4/3Np3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 1 9,Black sacrifices another pawn in exchange for developing with tempo.
17,Qxe4,d5e4,rnb1kb1r/ppp1n3/5qp1/8/3NQ3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 9,And another (b7) ...
18,Bf5,c8f5,rn2kb1r/ppp1n3/5qp1/5b2/3NQ3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 1 10,And another (b7) ...
19,Nxf5,d4f5,rn2kb1r/ppp1n3/5qp1/5N2/4Q3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 10,"Note that White couldn't win the Black Rook immediately with 10.Qxb7 because of ...Qe5+ 11.Be2 Be4. Now, however, Qxb7 followed by Qxa8 is a threat."
20,gxf5,g6f5,rn2kb1r/ppp1n3/5q2/5p2/4Q3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 11,"?! Black now dumps yet another pawn, as well as his queenside Rook. White has nothing developed but his Queen, but Black is running out of pieces altogether."
21,Qf3,e4f3,rn2kb1r/ppp1n3/5q2/5p2/8/2P2Q2/PP1P1PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 1 11,"White decides his three-pawn lead should be sufficient for now, and declines the Rook that Black was offering in favor of keeping his Queen nearby."
22,Nbc6,b8c6,r3kb1r/ppp1n3/2n2q2/5p2/8/2P2Q2/PP1P1PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 2 12,"Black's Knight blocks the vulnerable b-pawn and develops toward the center. With this move Black also prepares to castle long, getting his King to safety and bringing his other Rook into play. Another good-looking option was 11...Bh6, making White's developmental choices even more nightmarish by pinning his d-pawn."
23,Bb5,f1b5,r3kb1r/ppp1n3/2n2q2/1B3p2/8/2P2Q2/PP1P1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 3 12,"White prepares his own castle and momentarily pressures the Nc6. I think c4 might have been a stronger place to develop this Bishop, in order to prevent a Black Knight from coming to d5 after Black castles."
24,O-O-O,e8c8,2kr1b1r/ppp1n3/2n2q2/1B3p2/8/2P2Q2/PP1P1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 4 13,"All of Black's pieces are now in the game. His DSB needs a better square and h6 is still tempting (pinning the d-pawn), but Black also wants to leave the h-file open for pressure against White's upcoming castle."
25,d4,d2d4,2kr1b1r/ppp1n3/2n2q2/1B3p2/3P4/2P2Q2/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 0 13,White gains some much-needed play for his own QB and QN. He has the makings of a dangerous attack against the Black queenside.
26,Nxd4,c6d4,2kr1b1r/ppp1n3/5q2/1B3p2/3n4/2P2Q2/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 0 14,"?! This sacrifice doesn't seem sound at all to me, but it slims down White's queenside pawns and gives Black a big lead in space, at the cost of half-opening the c-file for a White Rook."
