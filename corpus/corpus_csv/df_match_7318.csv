1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This game is interesting in that white is virtually forced to under-promote. After being under pressure for most of the game black comes up with a saving resource.
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"This is the French Defence. I normally play the Sicilian Defence, but sometimes play this against stronger opponents. The problem with playing this against weaker players is that the exchange variation is very drawish ((2. d4 d5 3. exd)"
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/2P1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"But what is this! Normally d4 is played and I am also familiar with moves like Qe2, d3, g3, Ne2. I was rather thrown by this."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n1p3/8/2P1P3/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,Perhaps I should have just played d5
5,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n1p3/8/2P1P3/5N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 3,"This is the only move on the Gameknot world opening database, but it may be bad just to lose a tempo in playing e6 followed by e5"
6,e5,e6e5,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2P1P3/5N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"This is the only move on the Gameknot world opening database, but it may be bad just to lose a tempo in playing e6 followed by e5"
7,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,Black is a move down compared to normal lines

10,Nxe5,c6e5,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/2b1n3/2P1P3/2N5/PP1P1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,White's doubled e pawns are actually quite strong. The black knight is denied the best square of f6
