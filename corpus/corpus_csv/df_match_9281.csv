1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"We shall entitle this ""How Black Lost"" a lesson in pawns, knights, and bishops.

I am annotating this game to highlight the effect that ignoring bishop/knight imbalances can have on a game. I felt the game was played fairly solidly on Whites side and that all the advantages he gained were mainly black not pursuing a coherent strategy with respect to the structure as defined above."

6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/8/2pPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"!? This seemed odd to me, though looking at the world games it seems not too terrible a choice if you play it right. Assuming this is a good move, Black ought to be hedging development of his pawns for a closed board.

This seems dangerous to me, since you give white the ability to secure space which he can then use to grind you down over time."

9,Bxc4,f1c4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3nP3/2BP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,"Pretty standard development from here. White protects its pawns, black moves to attack whites knights because the game, from here, looks to be closed. I.E. strategy is to attack the opponents closed pieces with your open pieces to create an imbalance between your pieces that are stronger when closed and his pieces which are stronger when open.

The line that usually follows is 7. Nc3..e6. Which gives the d knight a post and makes it harder for white to open up the center of the board when black decides to trade his bishop for a knight forcing the imbalance.

That never happens."

Not only has he given up the center of the board, but he is undeveloped, and Whites pawn structure(that cascade thing which i can't remember the name of) makes his white bishop even stronger.

Blacks white bishop is already constrained and is about to be constrained even farther. As handy as it is to develop the other bishop, Black is developing this bishop into a position it can make little use of. It only has one square it can move into. Despite the black cascade, whites black bishop has many more options and a much larger sphere of influence

The game, which should have been about black hammering home a post on d5 is now about White owning the queen side of the board."
