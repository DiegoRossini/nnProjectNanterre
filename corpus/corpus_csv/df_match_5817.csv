1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Once again,i'm boored so i decided to annotate one of my recent interesting games. I'm playing with the white pieces."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,The game became a QGD
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,The game became a QGD
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,The game became a QGD
5,g3,g2g3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/6P1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,normally Black plays Nf6 instead of d5 and then d5 but i thought you can play this order too. This was one of my last Catalan games before i switched to 1.e4
6,h6,h7h6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/4p2p/3p4/2PP4/6P1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,h6? it's pretty much tempo wasting.
7,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/4p2p/3p4/2PP4/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 4,Now it became a normal looking catalan but since black played h6 i have a tempo right now.
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2pp1/4pn1p/3p4/2PP4/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 5,Now it became a normal looking catalan but since black played h6 i have a tempo right now.
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2pp1/4pn1p/3p4/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 5,Uh...i think this is the Bogo-indian. I have not prepeared for it at all. (of course white still has a tempo so technically this isn't the Bogo-indian)
10,Bb4+,f8b4,rnbqk2r/ppp2pp1/4pn1p/3p4/1bPP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 6,Uh...i think this is the Bogo-indian. I have not prepeared for it at all. (of course white still has a tempo so technically this isn't the Bogo-indian)
11,Nbd2,b1d2,rnbqk2r/ppp2pp1/4pn1p/3p4/1bPP4/5NP1/PP1NPPBP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 5 6,"going in to some kind of a semi-slav. I dunno maybe this is one of the main lines,i don't have any clue how Bogo-indian goes."
12,c6,c7c6,rnbqk2r/pp3pp1/2p1pn1p/3p4/1bPP4/5NP1/PP1NPPBP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"going in to some kind of a semi-slav. I dunno maybe this is one of the main lines,i don't have any clue how Bogo-indian goes."
13,O-O,e1g1,rnbqk2r/pp3pp1/2p1pn1p/3p4/1bPP4/5NP1/PP1NPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 7,a tiny error. Nd7 is a little better.
14,Bd7,c8d7,rn1qk2r/pp1b1pp1/2p1pn1p/3p4/1bPP4/5NP1/PP1NPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 8,a tiny error. Nd7 is a little better.
15,Qb3,d1b3,rn1qk2r/pp1b1pp1/2p1pn1p/3p4/1bPP4/1Q3NP1/PP1NPPBP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 3 8,"now we see that after Bd7,my queen attacks b7"
16,Qa5,d8a5,rn2k2r/pp1b1pp1/2p1pn1p/q2p4/1bPP4/1Q3NP1/PP1NPPBP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 4 9,if black wants to save the bishop.
17,a3,a2a3,rn2k2r/pp1b1pp1/2p1pn1p/q2p4/1bPP4/PQ3NP1/1P1NPPBP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 0 9,just putting some pressure on the bishop. Of course im not threatening to take it because the rook is hanging.
18,Na6,b8a6,r3k2r/pp1b1pp1/n1p1pn1p/q2p4/1bPP4/PQ3NP1/1P1NPPBP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 1 10,only way to get that knight out.
19,c5,c4c5,r3k2r/pp1b1pp1/n1p1pn1p/q1Pp4/1b1P4/PQ3NP1/1P1NPPBP/R1B2RK1 b kq - 0 10,Adding even more pressure on the bishop. The second idea is that even tho i gave up the battle for the d5 square i get the powerfull dark square d6 in this position.
20,Bxd2,b4d2,r3k2r/pp1b1pp1/n1p1pn1p/q1Pp4/3P4/PQ3NP1/1P1bPPBP/R1B2RK1 w kq - 0 11,I gained the bishop pair.
21,Bxd2,c1d2,r3k2r/pp1b1pp1/n1p1pn1p/q1Pp4/3P4/PQ3NP1/1P1BPPBP/R4RK1 b kq - 0 11,I suppose black didn't like the idea of having his bishop on pressure.
22,Qc7,a5c7,r3k2r/ppqb1pp1/n1p1pn1p/2Pp4/3P4/PQ3NP1/1P1BPPBP/R4RK1 w kq - 1 12,And now we see that after Qc7 in order to protect the pawn. White gets immideately more controll with tempo on the d6 square.
23,Bf4,d2f4,r3k2r/ppqb1pp1/n1p1pn1p/2Pp4/3P1B2/PQ3NP1/1P2PPBP/R4RK1 b kq - 2 12,And now we see that after Qc7 in order to protect the pawn. White gets immideately more controll with tempo on the d6 square.
24,Qc8,c7c8,r1q1k2r/pp1b1pp1/n1p1pn1p/2Pp4/3P1B2/PQ3NP1/1P2PPBP/R4RK1 w kq - 3 13,Here i simply put up the dangerous future trap of Bxh6. That's the second reason....h6 does both surrender a tempo and weaken blacks kingside. Of course white's e-pawn looks a little uncomfortable.
25,Qe3,b3e3,r1q1k2r/pp1b1pp1/n1p1pn1p/2Pp4/3P1B2/P3QNP1/1P2PPBP/R4RK1 b kq - 4 13,Here i simply put up the dangerous future trap of Bxh6. That's the second reason....h6 does both surrender a tempo and weaken blacks kingside. Of course white's e-pawn looks a little uncomfortable.
26,Nc7,a6c7,r1q1k2r/ppnb1pp1/2p1pn1p/2Pp4/3P1B2/P3QNP1/1P2PPBP/R4RK1 w kq - 5 14,the knight is better of on c7 it's as simple as that. Now it can go to b5 in the near future.
27,b4,b2b4,r1q1k2r/ppnb1pp1/2p1pn1p/2Pp4/1P1P1B2/P3QNP1/4PPBP/R4RK1 b kq - 0 14,Here i thought that since i have such a strong grip on the king-side. Why dont i get a strong grip on the queen-side as well? white's problem here is the e-pawn and the LSB.
28,a5,a7a5,r1q1k2r/1pnb1pp1/2p1pn1p/p1Pp4/1P1P1B2/P3QNP1/4PPBP/R4RK1 w kq - 0 15,i think this was the best move.
