1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Here is a short English Attack in the Sicilian, when Black adopts a true Najdorf setup with ...e5.  The action gets going quickly out of the opening with an opposite side castling situation and direct attacks against the kings.  Note:  As usual, my annotations assume some prior knowledge of chess, therefore, you won't find me annotating a move like 2...c5, or 3. d4.  My annotations are not for the rank beginner.  Thanks!"

Be3 was the main line, however, the obvious 6...Ng4 can take a swat at the bishop and force it to move again.  While this is not a threat to the existence of the English Attack, the theory does run deep, and by choosing the 6. f3 move order, I have been able to streamline my study."
