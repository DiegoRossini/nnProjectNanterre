8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,This is the Najdorf variation of the Sicilian Defence. I play it as Black too.

11,Be2,f1e2,rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,I usually play this move. It is less aggressive than many other variations.
12,e5,e7e5,rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2p1n2/4p3/3NP3/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"Black kicks the knight away and takes control of the d4-square. The downside is that the d5-square can be weak. Personally, I prefer e6, but that is just a matter of taste."
13,Nb3,d4b3,rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2p1n2/4p3/4P3/1NN5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,"This move might appear overly cautious, but it is useful in many variations not to have the king on the g1-a7-diagonal, especially if the f-pawn moves."
14,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/1p2bppp/p2p1n2/4p3/4P3/1NN5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 8,"This move might appear overly cautious, but it is useful in many variations not to have the king on the g1-a7-diagonal, especially if the f-pawn moves."
15,O-O,e1g1,rnbqk2r/1p2bppp/p2p1n2/4p3/4P3/1NN5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 3 8,"This move might appear overly cautious, but it is useful in many variations not to have the king on the g1-a7-diagonal, especially if the f-pawn moves."
16,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/1p2bppp/p2p1n2/4p3/4P3/1NN5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 4 9,"This move might appear overly cautious, but it is useful in many variations not to have the king on the g1-a7-diagonal, especially if the f-pawn moves."
17,Kh1,g1h1,rnbq1rk1/1p2bppp/p2p1n2/4p3/4P3/1NN5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1R1K b - - 5 9,"This move might appear overly cautious, but it is useful in many variations not to have the king on the g1-a7-diagonal, especially if the f-pawn moves."
18,b5,b7b5,rnbq1rk1/4bppp/p2p1n2/1p2p3/4P3/1NN5/PPP1BPPP/R1BQ1R1K w - - 0 10,"This move is typical in Najdorf (and many other Sicilian variations). It gains space on the queenside, and the idea is often to play b4 attacking the c3-knight, which protects the e4-pawn. So Black is indirectly attacking the center!"
19,a4,a2a4,rnbq1rk1/4bppp/p2p1n2/1p2p3/P3P3/1NN5/1PP1BPPP/R1BQ1R1K b - - 0 10,"With this move I am saying: ""I am not afraid of b4!"" Black cannot really win a pawn (see next move)."
20,b4,b5b4,rnbq1rk1/4bppp/p2p1n2/4p3/Pp2P3/1NN5/1PP1BPPP/R1BQ1R1K w - - 0 11,And Black goes for it.
21,Nd5,c3d5,rnbq1rk1/4bppp/p2p1n2/3Np3/Pp2P3/1N6/1PP1BPPP/R1BQ1R1K b - - 1 11,This move is already utilizing the weak d5-square. Black cannot play 11...Nxe4 bacause 12. Bf3 f5 (or if the knight moves 13. Nxe7 Qxe7 14. Bxa8 or 12...Bf5 13. Qe1 with a similar idea if the knight moves) 13. Bxe4 fxe4 14. Nxe7 Qxe7 15. Qd5+ and Qxa8 wins a rook.
22,a5,a6a5,rnbq1rk1/4bppp/3p1n2/p2Np3/Pp2P3/1N6/1PP1BPPP/R1BQ1R1K w - - 0 12,"This move was a surprise to me. I expected Nxd5 or Bb7. Apparently, Black wanted to protect b4."
23,Nxe7+,d5e7,rnbq1rk1/4Nppp/3p1n2/p3p3/Pp2P3/1N6/1PP1BPPP/R1BQ1R1K b - - 0 12,Winning the bishop pair and removing the defender of d6.
24,Qxe7,d8e7,rnb2rk1/4qppp/3p1n2/p3p3/Pp2P3/1N6/1PP1BPPP/R1BQ1R1K w - - 0 13,Developing a bishop and pinning the knight to the queen.
25,Bg5,c1g5,rnb2rk1/4qppp/3p1n2/p3p1B1/Pp2P3/1N6/1PP1BPPP/R2Q1R1K b - - 1 13,Developing a bishop and pinning the knight to the queen.
26,Bb7,c8b7,rn3rk1/1b2qppp/3p1n2/p3p1B1/Pp2P3/1N6/1PP1BPPP/R2Q1R1K w - - 2 14,Threatens to take on e4.
27,f3,f2f3,rn3rk1/1b2qppp/3p1n2/p3p1B1/Pp2P3/1N3P2/1PP1B1PP/R2Q1R1K b - - 0 14,Defending e4.
28,h6,h7h6,rn3rk1/1b2qpp1/3p1n1p/p3p1B1/Pp2P3/1N3P2/1PP1B1PP/R2Q1R1K w - - 0 15,Now Black wants to push the bishop to a less favorable square.
29,Bh4,g5h4,rn3rk1/1b2qpp1/3p1n1p/p3p3/Pp2P2B/1N3P2/1PP1B1PP/R2Q1R1K b - - 1 15,"Naturally, I want to keep the pin."
30,g5,g7g5,rn3rk1/1b2qp2/3p1n1p/p3p1p1/Pp2P2B/1N3P2/1PP1B1PP/R2Q1R1K w - - 0 16,"The pin is no longer there, but the pawn shelter in front of the king is weakened. One has to be careful with such moves."
31,Bf2,h4f2,rn3rk1/1b2qp2/3p1n1p/p3p1p1/Pp2P3/1N3P2/1PP1BBPP/R2Q1R1K b - - 1 16,I move the bishop to an open diagonal.
32,Nbd7,b8d7,r4rk1/1b1nqp2/3p1n1p/p3p1p1/Pp2P3/1N3P2/1PP1BBPP/R2Q1R1K w - - 2 17,Natural development.
33,Bb5,e2b5,r4rk1/1b1nqp2/3p1n1p/pB2p1p1/Pp2P3/1N3P2/1PP2BPP/R2Q1R1K b - - 3 17,The bishop did nothing at e2. The drawback of Black's 11th move (a5) is now obvious. He doesn't control the b5-square anymore.
34,Rac8,a8c8,2r2rk1/1b1nqp2/3p1n1p/pB2p1p1/Pp2P3/1N3P2/1PP2BPP/R2Q1R1K w - - 4 18,I don't understand this move. The a5-pawn is left without protection. Moving the other rook (17...Rfc8) would have been a good move.
