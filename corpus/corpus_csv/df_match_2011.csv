1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,The Queen pawn games are quickly replacing e4 as the 1st move of choice at top level of play.
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Queens gambit declined one of my favorites. It has the rep of being a quiet game but it does have some very flashy variations.

6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,Semi-Slav is a very solid defensive choice.

9,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,Wow Ratkop is playing like his mentor(which is me) this is exactly what I play most of the time. As I always say to my students consolidating your centre and develop your pieces is paramount.

Secondly, white makes a pawn move when there are pieces that need developing. I would have played 8. Qc2

Still white has the poorly placed knight on f1 which he will have to resolve before getting on with the attack. All that being said the game can go in either direction. Long term I like white's chances.
