1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was a training game between the team coach and I where I immediately began messing up by not opening e4. Going in, I had no plan except to use the opening DB, observe the position of the board carefully, and try not to screw up too much. Altogether, I think I played a decent game, I just found I had a tendency to overthink every move when the obvious move was the best. Several times I overlooked an advantageous position by telling myself ""But Pete is really, really good so there's got to be a better move."" and then making a wrong move. Anyhow, I will annotate using my in-game notes and comments to illustrate my thinking with occasional deviation to explore a mistake."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"And now I'm facing a pickle. The proscribed move here is e3, but Qc2 is a close second and probably because of the likelihood of Bxc3 followed by bxc3 and stacking pawns on the c file. e3 seems like the better move to me simply because I know bishops tend to be stronger later in the game and the board doesn't seem to be all that closed. It seems unlikely you'd want to trade your B for an N at this stage unless I decide to move to a3, but still the same problem with the stacked pawns. Seems silly to use a move only to force stacking my own pawns. I tend to think you'll opt for further development and so I probably should as well."

Ostensibly I can sort bay of your options for a moment with this move and still leave room for my B at d3 and the N at e2. I would expect either O-O or Bb7 next from you.

I still sort of expect you'd want to trade your DS bishop for the knight, or perhaps just maintain the pin. The pin forces me to deal with your B at every consideration, but you've also closed it in with your pawn at c5. The pawn closing it in makes it a more attractive swap, as it becomes sort of lame at b5 just for maintenance, plus b4 is a crap trade for you.
