1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"White has been on attack most of the time (except from move 15t to 20) but black defended very well and white had little occasions to make the difference and at risk, the draw is logical."

7,Nxc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4P3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,I like this position for white : it gives open lines and diagonals and many attacking possibilities which is worth the pawn late.
