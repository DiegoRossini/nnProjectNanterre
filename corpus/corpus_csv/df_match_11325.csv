1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is my match vs. Argentine GM Pablo Zarniki who came to a local university chess club and offered $10 for a game (or 3 games for $20) against a grandmaster! The tables were set up so that he could walk around the 25 or so boards to play against everyone simultaneously making a move and then moving on. So I bought a game, and even though I lost easily, the memory & lesson was well worth it so I'd like to share it."
