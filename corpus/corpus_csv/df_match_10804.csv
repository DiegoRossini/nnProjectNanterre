1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I recommend flipping the board before watching this game.  This is the second game in a series on the portuguese gambit, I hope you enjoy the game."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The scandinavian defense, a nice counterattacking way to meet 1.e4.  I normally play the sicilian, so while I play this (the scandinavian) occasionally my understanding of it is far from excellent."
3,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"2... Qxd5 is a perfectly reasonable alternative, but I hugely prefer this move, it prepares a bunch of gambits from the one in this game (the portuguese) to the icelandic with 2... Nf6 3.c4 e6.  Also it plans to retake on d5 with the knight instead of the queen.  There is a maxim about not bringing out your queen in the opening, this move follows that idea as 2... Qxd5 loses tempo to 3.Nc3."

5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"White doesn't hold onto material with 3.c4, he's willing to give it back to erect a strong center via 3... Nxd5 4.c4."
6,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3P4/3P2b1/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"This initiates the portuguese gambit, black develops with tempo.  If white blocks with a piece black will regain the pawn and have a slight development lead to counteract white's good center, an approximately equal (and usually dull) game.  If white wants to play ambitiously he's forced to play the following weakening move."

17,bxa6,b5a6,r2qkb1r/2pnpppp/P7/3n1b2/B2P4/5P2/PP4PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 9,White complies.
18,Rxa6,a8a6,3qkb1r/2pnpppp/r7/3n1b2/B2P4/5P2/PP4PP/RNBQK1NR w KQk - 0 10,"Strangely enough, white can blunder the game in this position with a normal move, after the apparently natural 10.Nc3 Nb4! when black will strike on d3 with his knight (or if white plays 11.Bb5 Rb6 12.Bc4 he'll infiltrate on the equally valuable c2 square)."

I have an obvious development advantage and a target in the IQP (isolated queen's pawn), as well as having instigated the weakening f3 from white.  I also have two open files in the a & b files.  White has an excellent bishop on a4 that pins down black's knight, and thus my queen (in order to defend the knight).  I need to use my advantage in time effectively, this means I should play pressuring moves, but it also means I should NOT trade.  I've spent a lot of time developing my pieces and if I trade one for a piece white has just developed it'll be a loss of time.  My plan is to castle quick and attack white's game.  His plan is to trade his undeveloped pieces for my strong ones.  However, he shouldn't trade his bishop for my knight on d7 yet as it pins me down."

And where else will my bishop go?  On e7 it's fine, but a little passive, and on d6 it's a target of eventual moves like Ne4."
