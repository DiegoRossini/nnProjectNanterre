2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"A rather passive move... Ng4 is not a threat just yet, because the queen can pick it off.
Maybe you were worried of something like ... d5 and Ng4? But a naturally developing move such as 4. Nf3 would be much better. 4..d5 5. exd5 Ng4 6. o-o and white has a small advantage.

Maybe h3 would be a good move to make in a few moves, if black threatened Bg4, but here it seems premature, and passive."
