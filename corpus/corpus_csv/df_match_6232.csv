1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

I have joined the Annotations Project Part 3 Mini-tournament and I am trying to avoid stepping on the mines playing the black pieces.  Yup, black is Q for 2 pieces up but the minor pieces, e.g. the knights and bishops are everywhere so it is a minefield for the BK and BQ.  Now, my buddy Thom Pham (tofuman) who is a Dentist has bravely joined this tournament.  Although he currently has a Class D rating, he has an optimum rating of 1407 so underestimate him at your peril lest he drill a terrific cavity in your rating and give you a massive toothache!  I thought I would annotate this game because he is due to be my opponent and I do not wish to incur my second loss against him so I need to learn something from it to be prepared.   Freddy, the Master Mater has used the Caro-Kann Defence to build up to the traditional Queen Sac.  The Caro-Kann is 1. ..... c6 in response to 1. e4, preparing a move like d5.  I will comment further on the action after white's 9th move.   You can follow the game move by move by referring to the Gameknot Analysis version of this game as follows:- http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=14257584&rnd=0.7276568196264748"
