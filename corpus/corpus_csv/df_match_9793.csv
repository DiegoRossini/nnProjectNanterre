1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Sycil--here are my thoughts on what I thought were turning points in our game.  Please comment if you like.

From this early position, the fascinating aspect of this game is established:  black advancing on files a-d, white advancing on e-g.  The momentum of the game seems to rotate counter-clockwise around the center."

White needs to deal with the pinned, double-attacked knight; castling out of the pin still seems attractive, providing more firepower to the hoped-for (and unrealised) kingside breakthrough.  But 10. Qf3 seems to accomplish the same and more, focussing white's queen on the king side, where I want to push, while providing an open lane for the LSB."

By expending energy on pawn moves early, white has ceded momentum, and is largely unable to shift focus to the kingside."

After the insipriation of 5.h4, white has now expended three moves on kingside pawns without yet succeeding in threatening a single of black's pieces.  With 14. g4 white threatens f5 next and an effective kingside breakthrough, but the threat is too slow-moving to maintain initiative.  Perhaps if 10. Qf3 instead of d3, white would have had the opportuity for 14. f5 and a sustained attack.  I still fail to do what I have seen done so effectively, namely the advancing of a SINGLE pawn as a thorn in the king side.  In this game, MANY pawns are shown to be cumbersome."

Was 15. Kb1 better?  Still passive, but  protects the a pawn and allows the lame LSB slightly more room."

As played, the long-awaited pawn push does little other more than open a file for black's rook and suicide white's e pawn.  Here benrous shows his beginner's tendency to remain attached to a preconceived gameplan rather than staying awake to the constant flux of the game.

Given white's poor positioning, especially the blocked-in LSB and the weak castle which requires rook and knight to stay protective of the weak c3 square, it is hard to find a better move in this position--a ""quiet"" move seems called for."
