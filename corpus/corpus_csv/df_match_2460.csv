9,Qd1,d4d1,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/8/2B1P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 5,? This loses a pawn without just compensation

15,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk2r/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/8/1bB1n3/2N5/PPP1NPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 8,I decided to castle and live without the pawn. Alas. His sacrifice will hopefully help the game.
16,Nxc3,e4c3,r1bqk2r/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/8/1bB5/2n5/PPP1NPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 9,!? Nxc3 is expected but does not gain a tempo like this move does. White does disrupt his pawn structure though.
17,bxc3,b2c3,r1bqk2r/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/8/1bB5/2P5/P1P1NPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 9,!? Nxc3 is expected but does not gain a tempo like this move does. White does disrupt his pawn structure though.
18,Be7,b4e7,r1bqk2r/pp1pbppp/2n1p3/8/2B5/2P5/P1P1NPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 1 10,Bc5 was also worth considering. Ba5 is a mistake due to 10. Ba3.
19,f4,f2f4,r1bqk2r/pp1pbppp/2n1p3/8/2B2P2/2P5/P1P1N1PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 10,"!? White opens up the king side, hoping to attack black's soon to be castled position."

21,Bd3,c4d3,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2n1p3/3p4/5P2/2PB4/P1P1N1PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 11,This may have been a waiting move but it does not seem to do much. White must be wary of the Qb6+
22,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2n1p3/3p4/5P2/2PB4/P1P1N1PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 2 12,This may have been a waiting move but it does not seem to do much. White must be wary of the Qb6+

27,Nh5,g3h5,r1bq1rk1/1p2bppp/p1n5/3ppP1N/8/2PB4/P1P3PP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 14,The idea is if 14. ... e4 15. Qg4 g6 and the position is unclear. White would not have lost a piece at that point and would have weakened black's kingside.
28,f6,f7f6,r1bq1rk1/1p2b1pp/p1n2p2/3ppP1N/8/2PB4/P1P3PP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 15,The idea is if 14. ... e4 15. Qg4 g6 and the position is unclear. White would not have lost a piece at that point and would have weakened black's kingside.
29,Qg4,d1g4,r1bq1rk1/1p2b1pp/p1n2p2/3ppP1N/6Q1/2PB4/P1P3PP/R1B2RK1 b - - 1 15,Necessary as fxg6 is a mistake due to Bxg4
30,g6,g7g6,r1bq1rk1/1p2b2p/p1n2pp1/3ppP1N/6Q1/2PB4/P1P3PP/R1B2RK1 w - - 0 16,Necessary as fxg6 is a mistake due to Bxg4

33,h4,h2h4,r1bq1rk1/1p2b2p/p1n2p2/3ppPpN/7P/2PB2Q1/P1P3P1/R1B2RK1 b - - 0 17,Seems to be the only way.
34,Kh8,g8h8,r1bq1r1k/1p2b2p/p1n2p2/3ppPpN/7P/2PB2Q1/P1P3P1/R1B2RK1 w - - 1 18,I was hoping for Qb6+ . This would have removed the black queen from the kingside. My opponent knew better though.
35,hxg5,h4g5,r1bq1r1k/1p2b2p/p1n2p2/3ppPPN/8/2PB2Q1/P1P3P1/R1B2RK1 b - - 0 18,"Finally, it is time to block the white bishop. This bishop hangs for 7 moves, before it moves away!"

37,g6,g5g6,r1bq1r1k/1p2b2p/p1n2pP1/3p1P1N/4p3/2PB2Q1/P1P3P1/R1B2RK1 b - - 0 19,"! This pawn must be addressed. If 19. ... exd3 20. g7+ Kg8 21. gxf8=Q++ Kxf8 22. Bh6+ Kf7 23. Qg7+ Ke8 24. Qg8+ Kd7 (not 24. ... Bf8 25. Qxf8+) 25. Qe6+ Kc7 26. Bf4+ Bd6 27. Qf7+ Qe7 28. Qxe7+ Nxe7 29. Bxd6+ Kxd6 30. cxd3  and black can only defend the f6 pawn with Ng8, which ties up the knight, or Ke7 followed by Ne5 to interpose white's Rae1+. This should leave black passive and down the exchange. I didn't compute this far in the Blitz game. Just now I did this in my head since I didn't have a board handy so...take the proposed line thoughtfully, and look for better moves."
38,hxg6,h7g6,r1bq1r1k/1p2b3/p1n2pp1/3p1P1N/4p3/2PB2Q1/P1P3P1/R1B2RK1 w - - 0 20,Qg7# is the threat. As is Bh6
39,Qxg6,g3g6,r1bq1r1k/1p2b3/p1n2pQ1/3p1P1N/4p3/2PB4/P1P3P1/R1B2RK1 b - - 0 20,Qg7# is the threat. As is Bh6

41,Rf4,f1f4,r1bq3k/1p2br2/p1n2pQ1/3p1P1N/4pR2/2PB4/P1P3P1/R1B3K1 b - - 2 21,?? I completely missed that the rook was hanging and looked for a checkmate! Arg! Taking the rook results in a winning position! I guess I was so focused on the king that I missed this. Black cannot even take the bishop after his rook is taken since Qg7# is threatened.
42,Rh7,f7h7,r1bq3k/1p2b2r/p1n2pQ1/3p1P1N/4pR2/2PB4/P1P3P1/R1B3K1 w - - 3 22,"This isn't exactly winning. Funny that my bishop is still hanging though. I was really considering following up with 23. Bh6 to finally crash through with 24. Bg7+. Note, 23. ... Bf8 fails to Qg8#. However, the following move caught me by surprise."
43,Rg4,f4g4,r1bq3k/1p2b2r/p1n2pQ1/3p1P1N/4p1R1/2PB4/P1P3P1/R1B3K1 b - - 4 22,"This isn't exactly winning. Funny that my bishop is still hanging though. I was really considering following up with 23.
