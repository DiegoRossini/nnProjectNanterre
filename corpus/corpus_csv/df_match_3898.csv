1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is a fast ladder match I played against wmaes, a great opponent.  There are some instructive segments to this chess match which I think bear further scrutiny, and are profitable to all, therefore without further ado..."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Not my favored response to the Sicilian, but definitely playable.  There are a number of good lines from this position which offer exciting play."
3,d3,d2d3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Not my favored response to the Sicilian, but definitely playable.  There are a number of good lines from this position which offer exciting play."
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,To give natural development for my bishop and allow for an eventual center push.
5,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/2P1P3/3P4/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"I was expecting g3, or bringing out one of the knights.  This pawn structure is one that certainly seeks to control the center, but I don't like giving potential homes to knights by creating a vacuum on both sides.  If I can get a knight to d4 (and keep him there), he will be powerful."
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/2P1P3/3P4/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,All natural development for black so far.
7,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/2P1P3/3P1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,All natural development for black so far.
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/2p5/2P1P3/3P1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 3 5,All natural development for black so far.
9,e5,e4e5,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/2p1P3/2P5/3P1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"An unexpected incursion into black territory!  I was a little taken aback by this move as it was completely unexpected.  However, I felt that I only had one response."
10,Ng4,f6g4,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p1P3/2P3n1/3P1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,"Now there is double pressure against his e pawn.  I'm curious what white was thinking to accomplish with the early assault, however, to the point, now white has two choices for defense: Qe2 or d4."
11,Qe2,d1e2,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p1P3/2P3n1/3P1N2/PP2QPPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 2 6,"This seems like a more natural play, since it brings another piece into the game and doesn't abandon the c4 pawn to itself.  Also since white is probably looking to fianchetto his bishop on g2, this protective move will offer more playable options for white.  I think the queen move was the better of the two choices."
12,d6,d7d6,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2npp3/2p1P3/2P3n1/3P1N2/PP2QPPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"And now white has to take, since it is 3 against 2."
13,exd6,e5d6,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2nPp3/2p5/2P3n1/3P1N2/PP2QPPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 7,A fairly central axiom to chess is: where possible move pieces before queens/rooks.
14,Bxd6,f8d6,r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2nbp3/2p5/2P3n1/3P1N2/PP2QPPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 8,A fairly central axiom to chess is: where possible move pieces before queens/rooks.
15,g3,g2g3,r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2nbp3/2p5/2P3n1/3P1NP1/PP2QP1P/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 8,Preparing for the Bg2 move.
16,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2nbp3/2p5/2P3n1/3P1NP1/PP2QP1P/RNB1KB1R w KQ - 1 9,"This move also surprised me.  Perhaps white saw the chance to go Bc3, giving him strong attack lines to the king?  However, I believe that white's priority should have been castling before thinking that far ahead.  Better to protect your king while you can.  Since my king is already castled, I can start probing white's defenses for weakness and go on attacks of my own.  wmaes is a very good player, so perhaps he has something up his sleeve?"
17,Bd2,c1d2,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2nbp3/2p5/2P3n1/3P1NP1/PP1BQP1P/RN2KB1R b KQ - 2 9,"This move also surprised me.  Perhaps white saw the chance to go Bc3, giving him strong attack lines to the king?

19,Nxe5,f3e5,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2nbp3/2p1N3/2P5/3P2P1/PP1BQP1P/RN2KB1R b KQ - 0 10,"I believe that this move was a mistake for the sequence that is about to unfold.  I expected Bg2, in preparation for a castle, but now things are about to get ugly."

21,Bc3,d2c3,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2p1b3/2P5/2BP2P1/PP2QP1P/RN2KB1R b KQ - 1 11,"I thought white might move up his knight, but there is a certain logic to bringing in the bishop.  However, as soon as this move was made I saw a possible way to get white to lose his castle.  My hand was forced to take on c3."
22,Bxc3+,e5c3,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2p5/2P5/2bP2P1/PP2QP1P/RN2KB1R w KQ - 0 12,"Now the power play, I am attacking white's queen, but also threatening Nc2+!  Also note, that white made this powerful position possible with the early pawn structure he chose."

26,Qf6,d8f6,r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/4pq2/2p5/2Pn4/2NP2P1/PP3P1P/R2QKB1R w KQ - 3 14,"Now for an attack of my own.  White has two real responses here, Bg2 or the path he chose, Ne4.  If Bg2, Qe5+ offers some rich possibilities for black."
27,Ne4,c3e4,r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/4pq2/2p5/2PnN3/3P2P1/PP3P1P/R2QKB1R b KQ - 4 14,Attack!  Or is it?
