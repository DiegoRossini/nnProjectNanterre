13,Bxe4,d3e4,rnb1kb1r/pp3ppp/1qpp4/8/3PB3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,"10. Qc2 - protecting the b2 pawn should Frere Lenoir wish to move somewhere else - Glenda is, together with Frere Leblanc, also eyeing up the h7 pawn.  This will induce the following weakness."

This is the first time on gameknot that I have sacrificed a piece when material has been relatively even - only a piece up here.  Even if the sac does not work I may still end up a clear pawn or two to the good which should be enough to secure an endgame victory.

Nxg6 - black tries to counter on the queenside with her pawn push to a4 - she does not know what I am going to unleash on her - although black is a piece down, you would not believe that on move 15 she was going to cop Old Matey 4 moves down the line."

Rf8 - allows a forced mate in 5 moves, I play my next move Bxh7  and I then sent my opponent a pm announcing mate in 5, providing analysis.  She played Kf7 which allowed mate on the move.  But what if she had played Kh8 - can you the jury find the mate?  Answers on a postcard.  Cheers.  Joanne"
