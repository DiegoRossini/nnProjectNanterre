11,d4,d2d4,rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/3P4/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 0 6,"It seems an innocent move, but it puts white in troubles."
12,Bf5,c8f5,rn2kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/5b2/3P4/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 1 7,"The good thing about this opening is that, even if black seems to be underdeveloped, at this point almost every move is ""good""."
13,Bd1,e2d1,rn2kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/5b2/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BBK1NR b KQkq - 2 7,"The ""original"" move by white is not good, in my opinion. The price of this uneasy bishop in d8 will create an edge for black. White can play Bd3. After the exchange, experience tells that the doubled central pawns are not such a disadvantage as they seem to be at the first glance. 
You can choose between let the c2 pawn and develop, or defend it with the king. It is not very important to lose castling rights when the queens are out of the game."
14,e6,e7e6,rn2kbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/5b2/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BBK1NR w KQkq - 0 8,"All the ways are open for black. And I prevent d5, the ""strong"" move for white."
15,Nge2,g1e2,rn2kbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/5b2/3P4/2N5/PPP1NPPP/R1BBK2R b KQkq - 1 8,Another questionable move by white. I think Nf3 is better. Maybe he was thinking about pushing the kingside pawns. But Bf4 was the good one for white.
16,Bd6,f8d6,rn2k1nr/pp3ppp/2pbp3/5b2/3P4/2N5/PPP1NPPP/R1BBK2R w KQkq - 2 9,"Now, I am occupying the strong black diagonal."
