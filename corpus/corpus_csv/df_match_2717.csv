1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is kmccrate541's characteristic move in the French Defence.  Probably White's best response to this is to transform the game into a species of Alekhine's Defence and play 3.e5.  In the sequel, Black keeps a level pegging.  More usual is to contest the centre at once by 2...d5."

5,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/3PP3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 3,"White has a huge range of options, here.  This early development of the bishop makes sense: aiming along the most accessible diagonal towards the K-side."
6,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/3PP3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 4,Good: striking at the centre whilst the d-pawn is lacking protection.
7,c3,c2c3,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/3PP3/2PB4/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 4,"A bit of a battle is now raging about d4, and indeed the centre in general."
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/2p5/3PP3/2PB4/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 5,"A bit of a battle is now raging about d4, and indeed the centre in general."
9,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/2p5/3PP3/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 5,Also worth thinking about was 5...d5.
10,d6,d7d6,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2nppn2/2p5/3PP3/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,Also worth thinking about was 5...d5.
11,dxc5,d4c5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2nppn2/2P5/4P3/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"White is happy to exchange on c5 now, as the f8-bishop can no longer recapture."
12,d5,d6d5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2Pp4/4P3/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"(?!) Probably better was simply to retake on c5.  This pawn advance has its points, but it leads after the ensuing melee into Black's first big mistake."
13,e5,e4e5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2PpP3/8/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,(!?) Also coming into consideration was 7.exd5.  After 7...Nd7 Black will get his pawn back.
14,Ng4,f6g4,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2PpP3/6n1/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 8,"(?!) Risky!  This has the same idea as ...Nd7 - hitting the e-pawn, and possibly Black hoped that something interesting might develop at f2 after ...Bc5 in the near future.  But this could have gone awry..."
15,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2PpP3/6n1/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 2 8,"Overlooking 8.Qa4! - striking at the Knight on g4, at the same time indirectly protecting the e-pawn (8...N(g)xe5  9.Nxe5, winning a Knight).   The Knight's only retreat (...h5; h3) is ...Nh6.  If, then, 8...Nh6  9.Bxh6 gxh6 leaves Black's K-side looking rather ragged.  The advanced White e-pawn, meanwhile, remains to impose a cramp on Black's game."
16,Ncxe5,c6e5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/4p3/2Ppn3/6n1/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 9,"More solid was to take with the other Knight.  Capturing this way had another implication, which soon came apparent, to Black's cost."
17,Bf4,c1f4,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/4p3/2Ppn3/5Bn1/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 1 9,Good response: developing and attacking at the same time.
18,Nxd3,e5d3,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/4p3/2Pp4/5Bn1/2Pn1N2/PP3PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 0 10,That gets rid of one of White's menacing bishops at any rate!
19,Qxd3,d1d3,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/4p3/2Pp4/5Bn1/2PQ1N2/PP3PPP/RN3RK1 b kq - 0 10,"(??) And here it is.  This capture has been in the air for several moves, and Black obviously had it in mind ever since he played 6...d5.  Had he retaken on e5 with his other knight (8...Ngxe5) this recapture would have been fine.  As it is..."
20,Bxc5,f8c5,r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/4p3/2bp4/5Bn1/2PQ1N2/PP3PPP/RN3RK1 w kq - 0 11,"(??) And here it is.  This capture has been in the air for several moves, and Black obviously had it in mind ever since he played 6...d5.  Had he retaken on e5 with his other knight (8...Ngxe5) this recapture would have been fine.  As it is..."
21,Qb5+,d3b5,r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/4p3/1Qbp4/5Bn1/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RN3RK1 b kq - 1 11,Winning the Bishop.
22,Bd7,c8d7,r2qk2r/pp1b1ppp/4p3/1Qbp4/5Bn1/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RN3RK1 w kq - 2 12,"The consequences of this is for Black much greater than the the loss of a piece for a pawn.  For the moment, Black can't castle, and his bishop is a very poor minor piece (one of the down-sides of the French Defence is the so-called 'French Bishop' - blocked in by pawns).  Black never does succeed in improving its prospects."
23,Qxc5,b5c5,r2qk2r/pp1b1ppp/4p3/2Qp4/5Bn1/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RN3RK1 b kq - 0 12,"The consequences of this is for Black much greater than the the loss of a piece for a pawn.

24,h6,h7h6,r2qk2r/pp1b1pp1/4p2p/2Qp4/5Bn1/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RN3RK1 w kq - 0 13,Not the most auspicious response to calamity.  Instead 12...b6 would have freed the Queen's Rook to move to c8.
25,Re1,f1e1,r2qk2r/pp1b1pp1/4p2p/2Qp4/5Bn1/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RN2R1K1 b kq - 1 13,(!) There's more to this than meets the eye!
26,b6,b7b6,r2qk2r/p2b1pp1/1p2p2p/2Qp4/5Bn1/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RN2R1K1 w kq - 0 14,"(?) An understandable slip, but neither side were alert to the opportunity that was now presented to White.  Essential was 13...Nf6."
27,Qd4,c5d4,r2qk2r/p2b1pp1/1p2p2p/3p4/3Q1Bn1/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RN2R1K1 b kq - 1 14,(?)  Missing 14.Qxd5!  The e-pawn is pinned.
