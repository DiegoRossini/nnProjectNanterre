7,e3,e2e3,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/3p4/3P1B2/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"To provide an escape way for my beloved dsb in h2. It's kind a waste of time. The alternative was to avoid this escape taking the Nf3 to e5. This leads to NxN, dxN, and another game. I wanted to play for this one."

11,Nbd2,b1d2,r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/2n1pn2/3p4/3P1B2/4PN1P/PPPN1PP1/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 2 6,"I don't plan c4, this is to block the black's dsb with c3."
