12,Qa5+,d8a5,rnb1kb1r/pp3ppp/2p2n2/q3N3/8/3BP3/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 7,Black is now much better.  Black has a material advantage and open diagonals for the Bs.
13,Nd2,b1d2,rnb1kb1r/pp3ppp/2p2n2/q3N3/8/3BP3/PPPN1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 7,Black is now much better.  Black has a material advantage and open diagonals for the Bs.

15,Nf3,d2f3,rnb1kb1r/pp3ppp/2p2n2/4q3/8/3BPN2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 8,White gets the N to a better square and gains a tempo.
16,Qc7,e5c7,rnb1kb1r/ppq2ppp/2p2n2/8/8/3BPN2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 9,Allowing the N to be pinned with Bg4 would be ugly.
17,O-O,e1g1,rnb1kb1r/ppq2ppp/2p2n2/8/8/3BPN2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 3 9,Allowing the N to be pinned with Bg4 would be ugly.

19,h3,h2h3,rnb1k2r/ppq2ppp/2pb1n2/8/8/3BPN1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 10,Allowing the N to be pinned with Bg4 would be ugly.
20,h6,h7h6,rnb1k2r/ppq2pp1/2pb1n1p/8/8/3BPN1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 11,I think h6 was unnecessary.  Ng5 is not much of a threat.  I think Black should 0-0 or develop with Be6.
21,Bd2,c1d2,rnb1k2r/ppq2pp1/2pb1n1p/8/8/3BPN1P/PPPB1PP1/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 1 11,It might be better to play Be6 before blocking it in with the N.
22,Nbd7,b8d7,r1b1k2r/ppqn1pp1/2pb1n1p/8/8/3BPN1P/PPPB1PP1/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 2 12,It might be better to play Be6 before blocking it in with the N.
23,Bc3,d2c3,r1b1k2r/ppqn1pp1/2pb1n1p/8/8/2BBPN1P/PPP2PP1/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 3 12,This was the best available square for the B.  The original diagonal is blocked with a pawn.
24,O-O,e8g8,r1b2rk1/ppqn1pp1/2pb1n1p/8/8/2BBPN1P/PPP2PP1/R2Q1RK1 w - - 4 13,I think a6 may also be unnecessary.  Black is now lagging behind in development.
25,Qe2,d1e2,r1b2rk1/ppqn1pp1/2pb1n1p/8/8/2BBPN1P/PPP1QPP1/R4RK1 b - - 5 13,I think a6 may also be unnecessary.  Black is now lagging behind in development.

32,gxf6,g7f6,r1b1r1k1/1pq2p2/p1pb1p1p/2n5/8/3BPN1P/PPP2PP1/R2R1QK1 w - - 0 17,"Now Black's K is somewhat exposed.  With good play the material advantage should still decide, but Black now has to be more careful."

43,Nf5,d4f5,r2r2k1/1bq2p2/p1p2p1p/1p2bN2/4Q3/P1P1P2P/1P3PP1/R2R2K1 b - - 4 22,White is not worried about the possible discovered attack on the Q because there is a check in his back pocket.
44,c5,c6c5,r2r2k1/1bq2p2/p4p1p/1pp1bN2/4Q3/P1P1P2P/1P3PP1/R2R2K1 w - - 0 23,"c5 would normally be a good move, but here it leads to a checkmate.  I think Black simply underestimated the threat to the K.  It's important to have a sense of danger."
45,Qg4+,e4g4,r2r2k1/1bq2p2/p4p1p/1pp1bN2/6Q1/P1P1P2P/1P3PP1/R2R2K1 b - - 1 23,"Black resigns because all roads lead to checkmate.  Kh8 or Kh7 fail to the immediate Qg7#.  If Kf8, Black still plays Qg7+.  After Ke8 (forced, since e7 is covered by the N), Qg8#.  The last flight square, d7, is covered by White's R."
