1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Sicilian Defence is my favorite. Because of it I play 1.d4 - don't want to switch sides.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Sicilian Defence is my favorite. Because of it I play 1.d4 - don't want to switch sides.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"There are a lot of possibilities here. I usually prefer Nc6 because want to keep pressure on d4. It is not guarantee something - just I used to play like this. For example, I also prefer Nimzo-Indian Defence or Grünfeld Defence- always keep pressure on white position."

5,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,I am very happy when people play this variation. Bb5 and c3 are more boring.
6,cxd4,c5d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,Keeping pressure.
7,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,Keeping pressure.
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,Keeping pressure.
9,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,I love this variation.
10,e5,e7e5,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,I love this variation.
11,Nf3,d4f3,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"Usually white play Ndb5. 
Take a look on position. Whites spent three moves on jumping of knight. Only problem that blacks have is what to do with 'd' pawn."
12,Bb4,f8b4,r1bqk2r/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/1b2P3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 7,Very annoying for whites. Need to do something to save e4 pawn.
13,Bd3,f1d3,r1bqk2r/pp1p1ppp/2n2n2/4p3/1b2P3/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 7,After that I already could hit on c3 and in the future put rock on c8 - pressure on c line is very powerful.
14,d5,d7d5,r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/3pp3/1b2P3/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"Basically almost all variations of Sicilian Defence for blacks is about putting pawn on d5:
1. Pawn d is no longer weak - it can be exchanged or be annoying for whites.
2. After exchanging pawn on e5 becomes very powerful - it is always a threat to move it on e4.
3. After exchanging whites have no active pawns."
15,exd5,e4d5,r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2n2n2/3Pp3/1b6/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,Pressure on c3. Need to do something.
16,Nxd5,f6d5,r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2n5/3np3/1b6/2NB1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,Pressure on c3. Need to do something.
17,Bd2,c1d2,r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2n5/3np3/1b6/2NB1N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 9,Blacks need to get something from their advantage. Doubled pawns will be enough.
18,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2n5/3np3/1b6/2NB1N2/PPPB1PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 2 10,Blacks need to get something from their advantage. Doubled pawns will be enough.
19,O-O,e1g1,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2n5/3np3/1b6/2NB1N2/PPPB1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 3 10,Blacks need to get something from their advantage. Doubled pawns will be enough.
20,Bxc3,b4c3,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2n5/3np3/8/2bB1N2/PPPB1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 11,Blacks need to get something from their advantage. Doubled pawns will be enough.
21,bxc3,b2c3,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2n5/3np3/8/2PB1N2/P1PB1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 11,Maybe whites want to keep both bishops. They are very powerful but you need to put it on active positions. Now only bishop on d3 actually attack something. But it useless without support.
22,Nf6,d5f6,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2n2n2/4p3/8/2PB1N2/P1PB1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 1 12,On d5 knight is useless - c3 pawn is weak but covered and you need to think about new threats. Now it is all about e4.
23,Bg5,d2g5,r1bq1rk1/pp3ppp/2n2n2/4p1B1/8/2PB1N2/P1P2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 2 12,Again - blacks want put pawn on e4 no matter what.
24,Re8,f8e8,r1bqr1k1/pp3ppp/2n2n2/4p1B1/8/2PB1N2/P1P2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 3 13,Again - blacks want put pawn on e4 no matter what.
25,Re1,f1e1,r1bqr1k1/pp3ppp/2n2n2/4p1B1/8/2PB1N2/P1P2PPP/R2QR1K1 b - - 4 13,Bishop on g5 is annoying and I thought it is good to exchange it. If whites put it on h4 - at least blacks get h6 for free.
26,h6,h7h6,r1bqr1k1/pp3pp1/2n2n1p/4p1B1/8/2PB1N2/P1P2PPP/R2QR1K1 w - - 0 14,Bishop on g5 is annoying and I thought it is good to exchange it. If whites put it on h4 - at least blacks get h6 for free.

28,Qxf6,d8f6,r1b1r1k1/pp3pp1/2n2q1p/4p3/8/2PB1N2/P1P2PPP/R2QR1K1 w - - 0 15,Whites afraid of Bg4.
29,h3,h2h3,r1b1r1k1/pp3pp1/2n2q1p/4p3/8/2PB1N1P/P1P2PP1/R2QR1K1 b - - 0 15,Whites afraid of Bg4.
30,Bf5,c8f5,r3r1k1/pp3pp1/2n2q1p/4pb2/8/2PB1N1P/P1P2PP1/R2QR1K1 w - - 1 16,Bishop on d3 is strong - need to do something with it. But exchange on d3 is stupid - want to achieve the goal by keeping pressure on e4.
31,Be4,d3e4,r3r1k1/pp3pp1/2n2q1p/4pb2/4B3/2P2N1P/P1P2PP1/R2QR1K1 b - - 2 16,Basically now rock is active for free - white queen on e2 is not much better than on d1.
32,Bxe4,f5e4,r3r1k1/pp3pp1/2n2q1p/4p3/4b3/2P2N1P/P1P2PP1/R2QR1K1 w - - 0 17,Basically now rock is active for free - white queen on e2 is not much better than on d1.
33,Rxe4,e1e4,r3r1k1/pp3pp1/2n2q1p/4p3/4R3/2P2N1P/P1P2PP1/R2Q2K1 b - - 0 17,Basically now rock is active for free - white queen on e2 is not much better than on d1.

35,Qe2,d1e2,3rr1k1/pp3pp1/2n2q1p/4p3/4R3/2P2N1P/P1P1QPP1/R5K1 b - - 2 18,Need to do something with blocking rock. f5 is only way to do it. Small bonus - pawn on a2 is under attack.
36,Qe6,f6e6,3rr1k1/pp3pp1/2n1q2p/4p3/4R3/2P2N1P/P1P1QPP1/R5K1 w - - 3 19,Need to do something with blocking rock. f5 is only way to do it. Small bonus - pawn on a2 is under attack.
37,Re1,a1e1,3rr1k1/pp3pp1/2n1q2p/4p3/4R3/2P2N1P/P1P1QPP1/4R1K1 b - - 4 19,Take a look at position again - whites have only pressure on e5 pawn but all their forces is not enough.
