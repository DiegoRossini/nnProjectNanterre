1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

I have taken yet another trip down memory lane, this was shortly after I joined the coaching club after the Big Slump and my opponent is a fellow member.  In this game my eyes were a little sharper!  At least I think I took full advantage of my opponent's mistakes.  In fact I was very lucky because it looked as though in the early part of the middlegame that I might lose at least a pawn.  Here we get a c3 Sicilian after I kick off with 1.e4."
