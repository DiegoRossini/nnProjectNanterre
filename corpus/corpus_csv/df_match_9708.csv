1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,As usual - good move - but make sure you have a plan based on e4
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,equal position with foothold in the centre - but white has the move
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,development with a threat
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,development with defense
5,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,"good developing move, opens up for 0-0"
6,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,likewise development - note black is still a move behind on the Kside
7,d4,d2d4,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2BPP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,"Probably too aggressive too early. Bxp wins N and p for the B,  I'd prefer you to play a specific opening understanding the moves, their sequence, and their intent. Ask yourself - is this move part of my opening plan ! If not why are you playing this. If it is part of a plan, you need to reconsider that plan, or else force some advantage in the next sequence of moves."
8,exd4,e5d4,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b5/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,This was thoughtless at best and I apologise. It is bad because 1. I give up a hold in the centre 2. it blocks the B 3. it semi-opens the e file 4. f6 becomes vulnerable to e5
9,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b3B1/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 1 5,always good to develop with a threat - it cuts down options for a response
10,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b3B1/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 2 6,"best of a bad lot !  If white exploits this advantage the black position will be messed up, and worse, if not defended accurately."
11,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b3B1/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 3 6,"e5 straight away maintains the pressure. ""Strike while the iron is hot"" ""Never look a gift horse in the mouth"" or even ""Don't give a sucker an even break"" spring to mind"
12,h6,h7h6,r1bqk2r/pppp1pp1/2n2n1p/2b3B1/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 0 7,I have the time now to defend
13,Bxf6,g5f6,r1bqk2r/pppp1pp1/2n2B1p/2b5/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 0 7,Not bad - but I think I did well to swap a dodgey N for a good B.
14,Qxf6,d8f6,r1b1k2r/pppp1pp1/2n2q1p/2b5/2BpP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 0 8,"Not out of the woods yet, but I can see more daylight"

16,d6,d7d6,r1b1k2r/ppp2pp1/2np1q1p/2b5/2BpP3/P4N2/1PP2PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 0 9,"B was fine on c4 - you need to develop your other N, and look at the vulnerability of b2 and R on a1"

In a position like this, think about moves that improve the situation, develop your N, get R on e or g file, connect Rs, resolve the constraint of d4, etc.  I presume you are preparing for e5, but even if you play e5 next after pxp, pxp, you will have an unsupported p on e5, and you don't want to play f4 to support it.  Re1 would be better"
