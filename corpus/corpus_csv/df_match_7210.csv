1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Standard king's pawn. As white, I never play this, ever."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Scandinavian. This is fun and exciting, but if white plays 2. e5, it becomes annoying to knock out the pawn."
3,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3pP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Aggressive.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3pP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,Standard development. 2. e5 e3 would also work.
5,f4,f2f4,r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3pP3/5P2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,(?) Why not d4? 3. f4 weakens the kingside.
6,e6,e7e6,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/3pP3/5P2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Pinning the knight to the king, as well as developing the kingside."

11,b4,b2b4,r2qk1nr/pppb1ppp/2n1p3/1BbpP3/1P3P2/2P5/P2P2PP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 6,"(?) d4 would have been better, as it blocks the a7-g1 diagonal, and creates a pawn chain."
