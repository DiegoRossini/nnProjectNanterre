70,Qg2,g6g2,6k1/4Q3/8/4KN2/8/8/6q1/8 w - - 18 36,"If Black plays Qg1, then White has an in-depth tactic to exploit the far placed queen 35...Qg1 36.Qe6  now if Black tries Kh7 or Kh8, then 37.Qh6  Kg8 38.Ne7  Kf7 39.Qe6  where Black gets his queen skewered after 39...Kg7 40.Qg8 , Black gets mated after 39...Ke8 40.Nd5  Kf8 (Kd8 Qd7 Kc8 Qc7#) 41.Qe7  Kg8 42.Nf6  Kh8 43.Qh7#, and Black also loses after 35...Qg1 36.Qe6  Kh 37.Qh6  Kg8 38.Ne7  Kf7 39.Qe6  39...Kf8 40.Ng6  Kg7 41.Qf6  and Black's queen will get skewered on the g-file since White can force Black to the h-file, after 41...Kh6 Nf8  Kh5 Qh8  Kg4 Qg8  (this won't work if Black's queen is on g2)
So Black is totally lost in all variations if he tries 36...Kh7 or 36...Kh8. 

Against 36...Kf8 in that variation, 37.Qh6  and if 37...Ke8, then 38.Nd6  and White has a mating attack with the queen and knight by checking every move. A sample mate is 37...Ke8 Nd6  Kd7 Qe6  Kc6 Qc8  Kb6 Qb7  Kc5 Qb5#
37...Kf7 also loses after Qh7  Kf8 Qh8  Qg8 (If Kf7 then Nd6  Ke7 Qe8#) Qf6  Qf7 Qd6  Ke8 Qb8  Kd7 Qb7  Ke8 Nd6 
37...Kg8 also loses since Ne7  Kf7 Qe6  reaches the position discussed at the top of this analysis, so after looking at all those variations, we can safely say that Qg1 loses in all variations, now let's look at Qg2."

The queen skewering tactic doesn't work with the queen on g2 since it is close enough for the king to defend in that tactic. White needs to find a different way to win here, and the way will be getting the king to the 6th rank to overload Black with mate threats. The king cannot get to the 6th rank now because of perpetual check from Black, so White needs to maneuver the queen to a square that will block queen checks. The square White needs to go to is c7, to stop Qc6  after Kf6. White's queen can take away Black's queen's squares using checks to maneuver it to c7. This attacking idea wouldn't have worked with the black queen on g1, since the queen controls too many squares from there. White had two very different winning ideas, which were based on where Black chose to move his queen on move 35."

Control of g3 allows Qb2  Kg6 Qg2  Ng3 where all of Black's checks are blocked, and Black cannot stop both mate threats of Qg7# and Qd8# 
Since checking White gives White the unstoppable mating threats, Black's only move is 38...Kh8, since White is threatening Nh6  Kh8 Nf7  Kh7 (Kg8 Qd8  Kh7 Qh8#) Ng5  and Black loses with Kh6 Qh7# or Kg8 Qh7  Kf8 Qf7#"

If Black moves queen off g-file, then Kg6  Kg8 Qe8#
