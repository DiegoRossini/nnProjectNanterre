1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Hello everybody! This is a game that i won before few days and i quite liked it! Well i started with e4.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,He played e5. He would have played the Sicilian also!
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Open the knight. I don't prefer d4 or Nc3.
4,f6,f7f6,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,That was a weak move i think as it affects king's defence and the hole kingside anyway.
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"I choosed d4, though i had also something else in my mind which i think it was stronger. 3.Ng5 fxg5 4.Qh5+ g6 5.Qxe5 Ne7 6.Qxh8! What do you think of that?"
6,Bb4+,f8b4,rnbqk1nr/pppp2pp/5p2/4p3/1b1PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,Ok a check then!
7,c3,c2c3,rnbqk1nr/pppp2pp/5p2/4p3/1b1PP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,I played c3 to keep the bishop back instead Nc3.
8,Bd6,b4d6,rnbqk1nr/pppp2pp/3b1p2/4p3/3PP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,He moved it back.
9,dxe5,d4e5,rnbqk1nr/pppp2pp/3b1p2/4P3/4P3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,I took the pawn. I could have played Bc4 instead. What do you think it'll be better?
10,fxe5,f6e5,rnbqk1nr/pppp2pp/3b4/4p3/4P3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,He took it.
11,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqk1nr/pppp2pp/3b4/4p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,Now i opened the bishop. I wanted to attack in the f7 square.
12,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqk2r/pppp2pp/3b1n2/4p3/2B1P3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 7,Logical i think.
13,Ng5,f3g5,rnbqk2r/pppp2pp/3b1n2/4p1N1/2B1P3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 7,I moved on with the knight.
14,Rf8,h8f8,rnbqkr2/pppp2pp/3b1n2/4p1N1/2B1P3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQq - 4 8,Strange move and bad i think. He should have played 0-0 i guess.
15,Nxh7,g5h7,rnbqkr2/pppp2pN/3b1n2/4p3/2B1P3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQq - 0 8,And now the plan is simple. Exchange at first the knight in order to have a clean and free road for my queen to move on h5 square.
16,Nxh7,f6h7,rnbqkr2/pppp2pn/3b4/4p3/2B1P3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQq - 0 9,He took it and that's what i wanted. Maybe he ignored the threat. But the threat was not ignored him at all!
17,Qh5+,d1h5,rnbqkr2/pppp2pn/3b4/4p2Q/2B1P3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R b KQq - 1 9,Check with the queen.
18,Ke7,e8e7,rnbq1r2/ppppk1pn/3b4/4p2Q/2B1P3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 2 10,In order to a avoid checkmate.
19,Qxh7,h5h7,rnbq1r2/ppppk1pQ/3b4/4p3/2B1P3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 0 10,I took his knight of course to clean the road.
20,Ke8,e7e8,rnbqkr2/pppp2pQ/3b4/4p3/2B1P3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 1 11,He played with the king.
