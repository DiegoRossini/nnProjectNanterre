2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Vienna Game.

4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,"Black replied with the Falkbeer variation (aka Berlin Defense). White has four main lines here. 3. f4 (Vienna Gambit), 3. Bc4 (often transposes into lines form Bishop's Opening or King's Gambit), 3. g3 (to fianchetto the bishop) or Nf3 (usually transposes to Four Knight's Game). White chose none of the above and played the passive 3. d3. This move gains no real advantage, blocking the king's bishop while opening the queen's bishop, defending an adequately defended pawn at e4, and not really gaining any ground in the center."

8,Nxd5,f6d5,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/3np3/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"White has doubled his pawns on the d-file. The farthest doubled pawn is usually the hardest to protect and often will be lost. Doubling pawns should be avoided if possible. The pawn on d5 does threaten black's knight, but that isn't much compensation for the weakness a doubled pawn brings."

10,Ne7,c6e7,r1bqkb1r/ppppnppp/8/3Pp3/8/3P4/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,Black retreated the knight as expected and now threatens the advanced doubled pawn. White breaks a couple more opening principles by moving a pawn that already moved and by not developing more pieces. He also leaves his d5 pawn hanging unprotected.

12,Nxd5,e7d5,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/3np3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,"Black gobbled the free pawn, and now white is attacking the undefended knight on d5. This move is a good one, it develops a piece to a good central square and does so with a threat. Although, it does violate one general opening principle: it's usually better to develop a knight before devolping the bishop next to that knight. However, this may be a case where breaking this rule is OK."

That would leave black with doubled pawns on the d-file. Then after white plays dxe5, those doubled pawns will have no support of adjacent pawns (they will be isolated without pawn support) and further, they would be on a half-open file, vulnerable to white's rooks. But, it's not wise to exchange when behind in material. Still, doubling and isolating those pawns is an almost certain guarantee that white can capture one, and maybe both, sometime soon, regaining his lost material. Instead, white takes a gamble bringing out the queen early, and without making any overt threats."

16,d6,d7d6,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2pp4/3np3/2BP2Q1/8/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 0 9,"Black's move strengthened his center, defending the pawn at e5, and discovering an attack against the white queen by the black bishop at c8. White is forced to move his queen again (violating the principle to not move the same piece twice - this violation is forced, white cannot lose the queen, but it calls into question the wisdom of the original 8. Qg4 move that allowed black to force this violation). White chooses h5 for this queen. Not a strong location. The queen is the most mobile piece on the board, but from the edge, her mobility is seriously decreased. She wants to live in the center. From h5, she has 7 moves that will get her killed, 3 captures (pawns) that will all get her killed, and only 3 safe moves to f3, e2, or back home to d1, none of which threaten black in any way. Which means the white queen is highly ineffective at h5 - though she does put pressure on e5, combined with the white pawn on d4, black will need to do something to avoid losing that e5 pawn."
