1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"Having begun other games with e4, b4 and d4, I thought I'd try this one.  It can lead to a King's Indian Attack, or a Reti, or transpose into something else altogether."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,...such as a Queen's Pawn opening...
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,...such as a Queen's Pawn opening...
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 3,"Tchigorin defence.  The placement of the Knight in front of the c-pawn strikes me as counter-intuitive, but if one of the world's earliest experimenters of openings thought this viable, I'm not going to argue.  I don't reckon it is an easy line, but several master games even up to the present day have gone this route."
5,g3,g2g3,r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3p4/3P4/5NP1/PPP1PP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"I could have mede it a line of Queen's Gambit by 3.c4, or played for a Colle System by 3.e3 or 3.c3 - any number of possibilities.  This looked as though it might be interesting."
6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3p4/3P4/5NP1/PPP1PP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,"Sooner or later Black will want to play ...e6.  He wants his bishop outside the pawn chain, where it would be more immediately active."
7,Bg2,f1g2,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3p4/3P4/5NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 4,"Sooner or later Black will want to play ...e6.  He wants his bishop outside the pawn chain, where it would be more immediately active."

9,O-O,e1g1,r2qkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3p1b2/3P4/5NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 4 5,Transforming the game into a type of hybrid Queen's Gambit - Catalan System.  This doesn't necessarily gambit a pawn ...
10,e6,e7e6,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/3p1b2/3P4/5NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 6,Transforming the game into a type of hybrid Queen's Gambit - Catalan System.  This doesn't necessarily gambit a pawn ...
11,c4,c2c4,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/3p1b2/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 6,Transforming the game into a type of hybrid Queen's Gambit - Catalan System.  This doesn't necessarily gambit a pawn ...
12,b6,b7b6,r2qkb1r/p1p2ppp/1pn1pn2/3p1b2/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,"(?!) The first indication that Black is unsure how to proceed.  To be honest, I don't know much about this sort of position either, but could see that this loosening of Black's position did not augur well for his future.    Instead of the text, 6...dxc4 would have been fine.  If White wanted he could have got the pawn back at once by 7.Qa4.  Also good for Black would have been 6...Be7.  My immediate thought was how to 'get in' Qa4 and Ne5 to win the Knight.  As it doesn't work, I carried on more 'normally'."
13,Nc3,b1c3,r2qkb1r/p1p2ppp/1pn1pn2/3p1b2/2PP4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 7,"Straightforward development, inviting Black again to take the c-pawn."
14,Bd6,f8d6,r2qk2r/p1p2ppp/1pnbpn2/3p1b2/2PP4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 8,"(?)  Now, you might ask yourself, what on earth could be wrong with this move?  It develops a piece - on an active square, too.  It does explain, also, the purpose behind Black's previous move: to inhibit c4-c5, which would dislodge the bishop from this posting.  The beginnings of the answer lie in White's reply, played without the slightest hesitation."
15,Bg5,c1g5,r2qk2r/p1p2ppp/1pnbpn2/3p1bB1/2PP4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 3 8,"(!) Now that is a very annoying pin, though Black probably didn't think so.  But White is already threatening 9.cxd5! (exd5 10.Nxd5).  Probably Black's best option is to drop the bishop back to e7, accepting the loss of a tempo.  Understandably he didn't want to do this.  But I was surprised by his next move."
16,Ne7,c6e7,r2qk2r/p1p1nppp/1p1bpn2/3p1bB1/2PP4/2N2NP1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 4 9,"(?!) Was this to break the pin at f6 or free the c-pawn?  White could have taken the knight at once, but a sudden evil thought crossed my mind..."
17,Nh4,f3h4,r2qk2r/p1p1nppp/1p1bpn2/3p1bB1/2PP3N/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 5 9,(!) 'Knights on the rim are dim.'  Not this spectre grim: just look at him advancing with vim!
18,Qd7,d8d7,r3k2r/p1pqnppp/1p1bpn2/3p1bB1/2PP3N/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 6 10,"Clearing the back rank for castling long, and also breaking the pin outright.  But now comes the series of exchanges that leaves Black's pawn structure shattered."
19,Nxf5,h4f5,r3k2r/p1pqnppp/1p1bpn2/3p1NB1/2PP4/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 10,(!) How should Black retake?
20,exf5,e6f5,r3k2r/p1pqnppp/1p1b1n2/3p1pB1/2PP4/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 11,"The alternative was 10...Nxf5 11.Bxf6 gxf6  12.cxd5 and if 12...exd5 13.Nxd5, threatening to pick up the f-pawn, or unmask a battery along the long light diagonal.  Even without 12...exd5, Black's centre would have come under enormous pressure."
21,Bxf6,g5f6,r3k2r/p1pqnppp/1p1b1B2/3p1p2/2PP4/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 11,Who can resist saddling his opponent with tripled pawns?
22,gxf6,g7f6,r3k2r/p1pqnp1p/1p1b1p2/3p1p2/2PP4/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 12,"Apart from this being a fairly rare sight, tripled pawns usually are as dire as they sound.  When they do occur they will very likely be isolated and therefore vulnerable and hard to defend.  But it is not all down side.  For a start, Black has two open files to play with, which is two more than White has right now.  The other is that those pawns control a heck of a lot of squares upon those adjacent files.  Far more significant is the fact that Black loses his d-pawn and remains a pawn behind."
23,cxd5,c4d5,r3k2r/p1pqnp1p/1p1b1p2/3P1p2/3P4/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 12,Also possible was 12.Nxd5 Nxd5  13.cxd5.  But I wanted to keep the Knights on.
24,h5,h7h5,r3k2r/p1pqnp2/1p1b1p2/3P1p1p/3P4/2N3P1/PP2PPBP/R2Q1RK1 w kq - 0 13,(!) Very good move!  Black seeks salvation in the more immediately available g-file and an attack upon White's castled position.  No other plan really suggests itself here.
25,Qd3,d1d3,r3k2r/p1pqnp2/1p1b1p2/3P1p1p/3P4/2NQ2P1/PP2PPBP/R4RK1 b kq - 1 13,"13.e3 was an alternative, but I had it in mind to push the pawn 2 squares when I pushed it at all.  I also had some vague ideas concerning the b5 and a6-squares."
