1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,So he starts with d4
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,I play my usual
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Still very conventional
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,and the same from me
5,g3,g2g3,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/6P1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"Slightly unusual, Nc3 is more common"
6,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/6P1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,I develop
7,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 4,So does he
8,d5,d7d5,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3p4/2PP4/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,"I prevent e4. I call this the semi-grunfeld, but I see the opening database calls it the King's Indian (E60), 3.g3, counterthrust variation."
9,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3P4/3P4/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,so he takes
10,Nxd5,f6d5,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/6p1/3n4/3P4/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,and I take back
11,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/6p1/3n4/3P4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,He develops
12,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/6p1/3n4/3P4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 2 7,I castle
13,O-O,e1g1,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/6p1/3n4/3P4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 3 7,so does he
14,c6,c7c6,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/3n4/3P4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 0 8,"So now I had to start thinking for myself. This move seemed reasonable, to blunt his Bg2. Afterwards I saw that Nb6 and Nc6 are more commonly played."
15,e4,e2e4,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/3n4/3PP3/5NP1/PP3PBP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 0 8,So he grabs the centre
16,Nc7,d5c7,rnbq1rk1/ppn1ppbp/2p3p1/8/3PP3/5NP1/PP3PBP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 1 9,"I thought that this was most consistent, but I found out later Nb6 is more usual"
17,Nc3,b1c3,rnbq1rk1/ppn1ppbp/2p3p1/8/3PP3/2N2NP1/PP3PBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 2 9,So he develops
18,Bg4,c8g4,rn1q1rk1/ppn1ppbp/2p3p1/8/3PP1b1/2N2NP1/PP3PBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 3 10,I put pressure on the centre. I am threatening to take on f3 then d4
19,Be3,c1e3,rn1q1rk1/ppn1ppbp/2p3p1/8/3PP1b1/2N1BNP1/PP3PBP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 4 10,So he protects
20,Nd7,b8d7,r2q1rk1/ppnnppbp/2p3p1/8/3PP1b1/2N1BNP1/PP3PBP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 5 11,I develop
