10,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/5n2/1N1pp3/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,(!?) Black sacrifices a pawn in an attempt to complete development as quickly as possible.
11,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/5n2/1N1Pp3/8/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"Obviously, 6...Nxd5?? Lost since 7.Qxd5 Qxd5 8.Nc7... One recommended variation is 7.N1c3!?... And White should start thinking about development."
12,Bc5,f8c5,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/5n2/1NbPp3/8/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,"Obviously, 6...Nxd5?? Lost since 7.Qxd5 Qxd5 8.Nc7... One recommended variation is 7.N1c3!?... And White should start thinking about development."
13,d6,d5d6,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/3P1n2/1Nb1p3/8/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,(?) The single-mindedness of material gain leads to the strong attack performed by Black.
14,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/3P1n2/1Nb1p3/8/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQ - 1 8,(!) A further sacrifice. 7...Ne4? Would give White the advantage after 8.e3 Nxd6 9.Qd5!...
15,Nc7,b5c7,rnbq1rk1/ppN2ppp/3P1n2/2b1p3/8/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQ - 2 8,"(?) White's tunnel vision of material gain is the wrong game plan! Nonetheless, it's important to mention that other better variations aren't satisfactory to improvement for White : 8.e3 Nc6 9.Be2 a6 with material equality and an advantage for Black. Also, 8.Be3 Bxe3 9.fxe3 Na6 10.N1c3 Bd7 11.Qd2 Bxb5 12.Nxb5 Ne4 13.Qd5 Qa5+ 14.Nc3 Nac5 with some dangerous threats from Black. ( If you like this game, look at this one - Svedchikov - Ceytlin [USSR 1977])"
16,Ne4,f6e4,rnbq1rk1/ppN2ppp/3P4/2b1p3/4n3/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQ - 3 9,(!) The initiative is clearly with Black. The checkmate threat on f2 provides this.
17,e3,e2e3,rnbq1rk1/ppN2ppp/3P4/2b1p3/4n3/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQ - 0 9,9.Be3... Wouldn't help since 9...Bxe3 10.fxe3 Qf6! And an excellent game for Black. This is shown since 11.Qc2 Qf2+ 12.Kd1 Qxe3 OR 11.Qb3 Qf2+ 12.Kd1 Rd8 OR 11.Qd3 Nf2!
18,Bb4+,c5b4,rnbq1rk1/ppN2ppp/3P4/4p3/1b2n3/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQ - 1 10,No other defence exists! Other options : 10.Nc3 Nxc3 11.bxc3 Bxc3+ 12.Bd2 Bxa1 13.Qxa1 Qxd6 14.Nxa8 Nc6 - Black regains the knight after ...Bf5 and has both positional and material advantage! : 10.Nd2 Qxd6 11.Nxa8 Rd8 -/+ : 10.Bd2 Nxd2 11.Nxd2 Qxd6 12.Nxa8 Rd8 -/+ The attack gains full flow in the last two examples.
