1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Bobby is white and decides to kick of with e4.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Reshevsky responds with the sicilian defense. it can lead to more sharp positions than 1. ... e5
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,developing
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,With Nc6 it looks like it is going to transpose into a Sicilian Schveshnikov alltho there are other variations it can transpose to. for example Kalashnikov variation.
5,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"Bobby continues to follow main line. Bb5 is also a main line i found but d4 is definately the most common,questioning the center."
6,cxd4,c5d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,giving up his c-pawn for white's d-pawn and trying to demolish white's center.
7,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,Recapture
8,g6,g7g6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,g6. a new twist if you'd like. it transposes into dragon. One of the most heavily analyzed openings because of the yugoslav attack.
9,Be3,c1e3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/8/3NP3/4B3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,with Be3 it looks like Bobby is perhaps going for the yugoslav attack.
10,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppp1p/2n2np1/8/3NP3/4B3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,developing and attacking the e-pawn
11,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppp1p/2n2np1/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 3 6,developing and protecting the e-pawn.
12,Bg7,f8g7,r1bqk2r/pp1pppbp/2n2np1/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 4 7,fianchettoing his bishop. these dragon variations often become very sharp
13,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqk2r/pp1pppbp/2n2np1/8/2BNP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 5 7,Bc4. This is known as Bobby fischer's move. Always in the sicilian he played his bishop out to c4. in schevningen he played Bc4 for example instead of Be2.
14,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp1pppbp/2n2np1/8/2BNP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 6 8,"Castles,prepearing to perhaps play d6 or play another twist."
15,Bb3,c4b3,r1bq1rk1/pp1pppbp/2n2np1/8/3NP3/1BN1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 7 8,"Bb3. Even tho he moves the bishop twice in the opening,this is a Profelactive move. He safely moves the bishop out of the c-file and out of Ne5's way."
16,Na5,c6a5,r1bq1rk1/pp1pppbp/5np1/n7/3NP3/1BN1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 8 9,Na5? aiming to get the light squared bishop. But an IM says 8. ... Ng4 is better with the point of 9. Qxg4 Nxd4 and white's yugoslav attack plan seems more or less like a dream.
17,e5,e4e5,r1bq1rk1/pp1pppbp/5np1/n3P3/3N4/1BN1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 9,"e5. ficher starts to experiment, instead of keeping the e-pawn safe and sound on e4 he pushes it and tries to be offensive."
18,Ne8,f6e8,r1bqnrk1/pp1pppbp/6p1/n3P3/3N4/1BN1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 1 10,"Only move,pushes the knight back to e8"
19,Bxf7+,b3f7,r1bqnrk1/pp1ppBbp/6p1/n3P3/3N4/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 10,Bxf7+! an interesting bishop sacrifice. Does The 14 years old genius sees perhaps a way of winning allready in the opening?
20,Kxf7,g8f7,r1bqnr2/pp1ppkbp/6p1/n3P3/3N4/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 11,10. ... Rxf7 11. Ne6 looses the queen.
