My first few moves were from the game database, because I knew if I wanted to beat someone rated much higher than me, I needed as many resources as I could possibly get.  I typically start my moves when I'm white with my pawn moving up two spaces."

I think I won this game because I started it out aggressive.  I usually play very defensively, and lately my wins have been showing because of the offensive moves."
