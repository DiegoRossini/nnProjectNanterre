1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Sometimes in chess you just get hit by a steam engine without really knowing what happened. Where did you go wrong? Where could you do better? I am still puzzled by this game - and very impressed about the way my opponent played it.
