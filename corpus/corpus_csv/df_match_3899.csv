5,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3P4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,The caro-kann exchange varation where white does not allow black to setup his poweful f7-b7 trianlge pawn structure.
6,cxd5,c6d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,The negative result of the exchange for black is that now he has a big weakness on c6 and light sqaures on the queen side.
7,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,Caro-kann Panov attack. White immedaitely attack's black's center not allowing him to develop in peace. The price white pays however is he gets saddled with an isoalted d pawn.
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,Defending the d pawn and developing the knight to it's normal position. In the caro-kann black must defend and retain d5. Under no circumstances can black just allow white to claim d5. The other square of critical importance to black is e5. If black wants to survive then he must match white strength vs strength on e5.
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/5n2/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 5,White increases his pressure on d5
10,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 3 6,Black does not play play ...e6 transposing into a Queen's Gambit decline position with a slight  lose of tempo or the relatively untested ...g6.
11,Bg5,c1g5,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 4 6,White continues his quest to undermine d5.
12,dxc4,d5c4,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/6B1/2pP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,"However, black exchanges the pawns before white can capture it and at the same time saddles white with a isolated d pawn. Take note of this because the isolated d pawn becomes the centre of attention in the future. On a side note I do not fear 7. Bxf6 exf6 8. d5 Ne5 9. Bxc4 Nxc4 10. Qa4+ Bd7 11. Qxc4 Rc8 gives black excellent chances."
13,Bxc4,f1c4,r1bqkb1r/pp2pppp/2n2n2/6B1/2BP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 0 7,"Most likely best since 8. Bxf6 exf6 9. Nf3 Bd6 10. 0-0 0-0 11. h3 Bf5 transpose into well known draw lines of the Kornchoni defence. However, if you do not like Be3 8. Bf4 is a strong alternative."
14,h6,h7h6,r1bqkb1r/pp2ppp1/2n2n1p/6B1/2BP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 0 8,"Most likely best since 8. Bxf6 exf6 9. Nf3 Bd6 10. 0-0 0-0 11. h3 Bf5 transpose into well known draw lines of the Kornchoni defence. However, if you do not like Be3 8. Bf4 is a strong alternative."
15,Be3,g5e3,r1bqkb1r/pp2ppp1/2n2n1p/8/2BP4/2N1B3/PP3PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 1 8,"Most likely best since 8. Bxf6 exf6 9. Nf3 Bd6 10. 0-0 0-0 11. h3 Bf5 transpose into well known draw lines of the Kornchoni defence. However, if you do not like Be3 8. Bf4 is a strong alternative."
16,e6,e7e6,r1bqkb1r/pp3pp1/2n1pn1p/8/2BP4/2N1B3/PP3PPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 0 9,prevents white from using the d5 square for the time being. Plus it creates a potiental outpost on d5
17,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkb1r/pp3pp1/2n1pn1p/8/2BP4/2N1BN2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 9,White threatens to gain control of the critical e5 square so black must respond to this
18,Bd6,f8d6,r1bqk2r/pp3pp1/2nbpn1p/8/2BP4/2N1BN2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 10,"preventing the immedaitely Ne5 or Bf5. One of the great features of the caro-kann is its simple way to defending. Notice how I am not overly aggressive, I am simply responding to my opponents threats (in this case threat of Ne5)."
19,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk2r/pp3pp1/2nbpn1p/8/2BP4/2N1BN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 3 10,Again nothing fancy just responding with solid noncommittal moves.
20,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp3pp1/2nbpn1p/8/2BP4/2N1BN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 4 11,Again nothing fancy just responding with solid noncommittal moves.
21,Nb5,c3b5,r1bq1rk1/pp3pp1/2nbpn1p/1N6/2BP4/4BN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 5 11,"!? This is exactly the type of overly agressive move that black is hoping for just watch how white leterally beats himself up trying to get through black's wall. My guess is that white is fighting for control of e5 by threatening to remove the DSB. However, it back fires since 12. Nxd6 Qxd6 gives black complete control of d5 and attacking chances on d4. White's best chances lay on the c file with 11. Rc1 which x-rays the weak c6 point and prevents black from developing his bishop on the power b7-g2 diagonal. A more sublte and positional apporach is 11. h3 preventing Ng4 with an attack on d4."
22,b6,b7b6,r1bq1rk1/p4pp1/1pnbpn1p/1N6/2BP4/4BN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 12,A very smart move that takes full advantage of white's tempo wasting 10. Nb5. By playing ...b6 Black adds more control of d5 and develops the LSB to a very powerful diagonal.
23,Nxd6,b5d6,r1bq1rk1/p4pp1/1pnNpn1p/8/2BP4/4BN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 12,"By this point I was feeling very secure because all of white's main threat can be easily met. For example, both Rc1 and h3 are met with Bb7 and the combination of Qd2 and Bf4 are met with..."
24,Qxd6,d8d6,r1b2rk1/p4pp1/1pnqpn1p/8/2BP4/4BN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 13,"By this point I was feeling very secure because all of white's main threat can be easily met. For example, both Rc1 and h3 are met with Bb7 and the combination of Qd2 and Bf4 are met with..."
25,Qd2,d1d2,r1b2rk1/p4pp1/1pnqpn1p/8/2BP4/4BN2/PP1Q1PPP/R4RK1 b - - 1 13,preparing to play Bf4.
26,Rd8,f8d8,r1br2k1/p4pp1/1pnqpn1p/8/2BP4/4BN2/PP1Q1PPP/R4RK1 w - - 2 14,I like this move because it put the rook on the same file as the enemy queen  and gives f8 as an escape square for the queen in the event of Bf4
27,Rac1,a1c1,r1br2k1/p4pp1/1pnqpn1p/8/2BP4/4BN2/PP1Q1PPP/2R2RK1 b - - 3 14,I looked at 14. ...Nd5 but did not like the fact that it weakens the pressure on d4. Besides it is overly agressive and not very caro-kann like!
28,Bb7,c8b7,r2r2k1/pb3pp1/1pnqpn1p/8/2BP4/4BN2/PP1Q1PPP/2R2RK1 w - - 4 15,I looked at 14. ...Nd5 but did not like the fact that it weakens the pressure on d4. Besides it is overly agressive and not very caro-kann like!
29,Bf4,e3f4,r2r2k1/pb3pp1/1pnqpn1p/8/2BP1B2/5N2/PP1Q1PPP/2R2RK1 b - - 5 15,I can no longer hold the tide on e5 so I must retreat.
