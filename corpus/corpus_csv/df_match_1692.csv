50,Qxd8,c7d8,3q2k1/pp3p2/4pp1p/2b4P/2P3P1/5N2/PP2QP2/1K6 w - - 0 26,"Time to take stock. With the exchange of a pair of major pieces the threat of a successful K-side attack has diminished. Houdini gives the position as dead equal or more precisely equal chances. Though white has 2 pawn islands to blacks 3 and a q-side pawn majority the exposed white k-side pawns makes it about level pawn wise. The imbalance of Bishop an Queen v.Knight an Queen is interesting. Capablanca's Theorem as espoused in Steve Mayer's book ""Bishop v Knight"" was that queen and knight are superior to queen and bishop in the endgame. Being that a queen and knight working smoothly together can create a greater number of threats than queen and bishop."
