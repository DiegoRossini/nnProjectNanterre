1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I don't know what this opening is called.
2,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,I don't know what this opening is called.
3,d3,d2d3,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/2P5/3P4/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Black is starting to develop his two knights.
4,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pppppppp/2n2n2/8/2P5/3P4/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,Black is starting to develop his two knights.
5,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkb1r/pppppppp/2n2n2/8/2P5/3P1N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 3,So I copy him.
6,d6,d7d6,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2np1n2/8/2P5/3P1N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"!? Hmmm.... d5 was better, and either cxd5 or c5 breaks the pawn chain. Something like Nc3, dxc4, dxc4 then Qxd1+ and it doesn't look to good for me. Luckily he played d6."
7,e4,e2e4,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2np1n2/8/2P1P3/3P1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,Trying to develop my two bishops.
8,e5,e7e5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4p3/2P1P3/3P1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Well, if he does the same, then hopefully that means I can't move d4, or can I? d4, exd4. Nxd4, Nxd4, then Qxd4, and I have an early queen. (If you want to know more about the early queen, see annotated game: Early queen effects the game)"
9,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4p3/2P1P3/2NP1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,Simple developing
10,Bg4,c8g4,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4p3/2P1P1b1/2NP1N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,"Uh-oh, but I don't leave it, because, again, I don't want to get a early queen, nor a doubled pawn, so I move..."
11,Be2,f1e2,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4p3/2P1P1b1/2NP1N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 6,...Be2 to block it. I also prepared to castle in a situation like this.
12,Bxf3,g4f3,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4p3/2P1P3/2NP1b2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"Exactly, but do you believe that a bishop is worth slightly more (B=3 and a half, N=3 and a quarter) than a knight, or do you think they are worth the same?"
13,Bxf3,e2f3,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4p3/2P1P3/2NP1B2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,Done.
14,h5,h7h5,r2qkb1r/ppp2pp1/2np1n2/4p2p/2P1P3/2NP1B2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,I think your going for Ng4.
15,h3,h2h3,r2qkb1r/ppp2pp1/2np1n2/4p2p/2P1P3/2NP1B1P/PP3PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,"h3's good, because 1. it stops the knight from moving to g4 & 2. it leaves a hole so when I castle, there's not much chance of back rank mate happening either."
16,h4,h5h4,r2qkb1r/ppp2pp1/2np1n2/4p3/2P1P2p/2NP1B1P/PP3PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,"Walking pawns, eh? !?-?!"

19,Bxg5,c1g5,r2qkb1r/ppp2p2/2np1n2/4p1B1/2P1P2p/2NP1B1P/PP3PP1/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 0 10,There we go.

22,O-O,e8g8,r2q1rk1/ppp2pb1/2np1n2/3Np1B1/2P1P2p/3P1B1P/PP3PP1/R2Q1RK1 w - - 3 12,"He wants to castle. But now the rook's moved, I can capture that black pawn on h4."
