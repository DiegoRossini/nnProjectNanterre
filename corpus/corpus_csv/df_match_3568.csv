5,d5,d4d5,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/2pP4/2P5/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,And here we are. Black sacrifices a pawn for queenside play.

7,cxb5,c4b5,rnbqkb1r/p2ppppp/5n2/1PpP4/8/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"!? I have never played against this move before. It looks quite natural to develop a piece and defend the b5 pawn, so this can't be bad. After the game my opponent told me that he normally plays the 5.b6 line."

10,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/3ppp1p/p4np1/1PpP4/8/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,I decided to continue my normal development. White can still transpose into the main line with 6.bxa6 Bxa6.
11,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/3ppp1p/p4np1/1PpP4/8/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"Played instantly by my opponent. However, it turns out that 7.d6!? is the most frequently played move in this position. I don't really know those lines with a d5-d6 push by White, so probably if I want to continue playing the Benko, I should study them."

14,Ba6,c8a6,rn1qkb1r/3ppp1p/b4np1/1NpP4/8/5N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,Now this position is also in the main line Benko: it's the same position as 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 b5 4.cxb5 a6 5.bxa6 g6 6.Nc3 Bxa6 7.Nf3. I knew that during the game so I started to play my moves fast again.
15,Nc3,b5c3,rn1qkb1r/3ppp1p/b4np1/2pP4/8/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 8,Now this position is also in the main line Benko: it's the same position as 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 b5 4.cxb5 a6 5.bxa6 g6 6.Nc3 Bxa6 7.Nf3. I knew that during the game so I started to play my moves fast again.
16,d6,d7d6,rn1qkb1r/4pp1p/b2p1np1/2pP4/8/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 9,"To control the e5 square, stop an eventual d5-d6 advance and to develop the knight on b8 to d7."
17,e4,e2e4,rn1qkb1r/4pp1p/b2p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 9,"White takes the space in the center that I give him, protects his d5 pawn and wants to exchange my active bishop for his passive bishop."
18,Bxf1,a6f1,rn1qkb1r/4pp1p/3p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQKb1R w KQkq - 0 10,I oblige because it takes away White's castling opportunity and because I can't avoid the exchange either way (going back to b7 or c8 would deactivate my bishop as well).
19,Kxf1,e1f1,rn1qkb1r/4pp1p/3p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1K1R b kq - 0 10,"! Planning to 'castle manually', move his king to g2 and then develop the h1 rook. It takes some extra time compared to simply castling in one move, but here he can't castle anymore so he has to do it this way. This manoeuver is also best according to theory and this position is still very well-known."

30,Qb4,a5b4,rr4k1/3nppbp/3p1np1/2pP4/1qN1P3/2N3P1/PP3PKP/R1BQR3 w - - 9 16,"I wanted to play either this or 15...Qa6. Both attack the knight and keep pressure on the b-pawn, but I decided to play this because it also indirectly pressures the e-pawn and lets the rook rather than the queen attack the a-pawn. However, if I had played 15...Qa6, I could continue with ...Rb4 at some point (as happened in one of the two games mentioned before) and thereby also pressure the e-pawn. That plan looks good, probably somewhat better than what I did. But I felt quite confident that I had a decent position out of the opening."
31,Qe2,d1e2,rr4k1/3nppbp/3p1np1/2pP4/1qN1P3/2N3P1/PP2QPKP/R1B1R3 b - - 10 16,"The computer says that this is a slight inaccuracy and suggests 16...Nb6 instead. But I think this is a thematic move, which plans to move the knight towards the queenside and which opens the diagonal for the dark-squared bishop so that White has to watch out that everything remains defended on his queenside. Also I think that ...Nb6 can be played anytime so it's not necessary to do it right now. Probably both moves are reasonable and it doesn't matter all that much which one I play. Note that this position occurred in the aforementioned games as well, but in those games the queen was on c7 or a6 instead of b4."
