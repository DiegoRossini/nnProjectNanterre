1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone.  This game is one of my favorites so far on GK.  Whenever I have my choice as white, I play for the Ruy Lopez exchange variation.  One of my favorite things as black is when white plays it!!  When playing as black, the best way to avoid the inevitable losing endgame is to attack.  This game demonstrates that."
