So no developing move right now, but any alternative was just a shot in the dark (Bd3 is ok, but what for? h3, so to get a square for the B after Nd5? How boring! Let's be nasty! :-)"

No point in playing it, unless I have concrete plans on the dark center square, which is not the case. My goal is to place a N on c4, so to threat Nxb6 until the R is still undefended..."
