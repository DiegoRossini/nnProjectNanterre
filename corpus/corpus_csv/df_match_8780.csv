1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was, I think, the second game between me and dmaestro.  He won the first, which arose from a debate about an annotated game.  As is my custom, I bow to his higher grade by opening with 1. d4."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,and he responds with my own favourite ...
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,but this is different.  A flexible move that could lead to any number of continuations.

This move is by no means obvious but it's probably preferable to any other moves available at the time.

This will, in turn connect Black's Rooks, though, so it's still worthwhile.  The N also builds prssure on d5 and c4, though it doesn't actually threaten either pawn as yet."

This exchange is well timed as White has to be careful about potential pins on the c-file and also about releasing Black's e-pawn, which could disrupt White's position if it advanced."
