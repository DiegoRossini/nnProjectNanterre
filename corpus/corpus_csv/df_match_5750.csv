1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I'm practicing playing e6 against the Queen's Gambit, planning to move into the Dutch without having to deal with the Staunton Gambit or the Bg5 opening."
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I'm practicing playing e6 against the Queen's Gambit, planning to move into the Dutch without having to deal with the Staunton Gambit or the Bg5 opening."
3,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"And so far, White usually is willing to transpose to a French opening."
4,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"But I don't know the French, except for the first 3 or 4 moves that I learned from a PBS show on the Spassky-Fischer match back in the early 70s (and I went to my first tournament ready to play Black with that information).
So I'm investigating the Sicilian in this position -- probably the Taimanov variation since that uses e6 instead of d6."
5,d5,d4d5,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2pP4/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,And d5 is what I've prepared for as the most difficult drawback to the plan.

I decided that I'm not so worried about Bxa6 and doubling my pawns. They won't be that easy to attack, and I'll use the b-file for my rook."

So will he use Nc3 to get the knight out and protect the pawn, or will he retreat the bishop to c4? The good thing about Nc3 for me is that my knight becomes safe from pawns. I'm looking at Bf5 to put more pressure on his c-pawn and it gives my pawn on d6 more protection. If he plays Nc3, I wonder if I can risk a6 and cut off my knight's retreat and then b5. I haven't looked at that in depth yet, but it looks like to win the pawn on b5 (attacked by the pawn on a4, a knight, and a bishop), I would get the pawn on d5. 
Lots of possibilities."

It also lets me sacrifice on h3 if that looks helpful. I have to remember that the Q is guarding the B on e7 if he plays Re1.

I recognize this as a very defensive position for both of us. I want to start playing to prevent him from getting an edge (more than expecting to find a wonderful tactic). I'll use IMPLODES+K to assess this position.
I (initiative) - I've got a little initiative if either of us do, but I don't think I have an edge.
M (material) - even
P (Pawn structure) - probably even. We both have a backward pawn to protect.
L (Lines) - even. Our bishops on f4 and f5 control some lines, and my Q is a little more useful in this regard than his. But I expect to see Rc2 eventually. Whichever of us ends up controlling the e-file gets the big advantage here. I can imagine Re8 being my next move.
O (Officers - knights & bishops) - looks even. We both have a knight and a bishop that are out of play, but I think his knight can get into the game easier than mine.
De (Development) - even
S (Space) - White's got the advantage here.
King Safety - even
 
Looks like White has a slight edge with more opportunities to improve his position than I do."

As it stands, he can't move his knight from a3 because I'm ready to play b5, but if he plays a5 first, then I've got to deal with the en passant threat.
