21,O-O,e1g1,r3kb1r/pb3ppp/1q2pn2/2pp4/8/2P1B1P1/PPQ1PPBP/RN3RK1 b kq - 3 11,"White has a weird position, with the bishop in e3. The idea was to sacrifice the pawn's central advance in order to cause some problems to black. Now, the point is white has the chance to recover the pawn via Qa4+, so currently black cannot go d4, due to cxd4, cxd4, Qa4+!, and whatever black does, white recovers the pawn. This also happens if white goes BxB. The queen must retake, leaving the black diagonal guarding d4. Those are the two reasons black can't play d4 and crush me. 
Now, it is clear that black is just preparing his castling, seen that my developement is not quick or easy. The knight needs two moves to become an useful piece, and I don't see a good future for it. On d2, it blocks the rook's action, and white wants to have a rook on d1, stopping d4 even after the castling. But that means the knight has to develop to a3... an almost useless square in this position. So I considered: 
12. Rd1, o-o. And then?
12. f3 seemed interesting. We have to take into account that black missed Ng4!, where my dsb must retire or be awfully exchanged. Based on the previous move, black is not considering it... but hey, at any moment black can change his mind and attack that way. So 12. f3 stops both knight's jumps (Ne4 is not really dangerous, but...). It also prevents black to play BxB at some point (in some lines she has to, or she will lose d4). It also prepares Bf2, and e4, a good plan for white not being squeezed and keep the pressure on c5 and avoiding d4.
All this sounds good, but now, seriously: you play to win, not to defend. 
12. b4 could be a good way to proceed. I am not really threatening anything. Ne4 can't help black, because of f3, but Rc8, that is a move surely on her agenda anyway. I don't want to help her to develop. And then? 
12. c4 may seem crazy, but look: if black moves d4, BxB, and black has to decide among QxB, cxd, cxd, Bxd4, or d4xBd3, BxRa8, d3xf2+, Rxf2, c4!. But it is doubtful the attack will compensate the material loss. But anyway: Why should black move the pawn in d5? He has no reason to do it. If I take cxd5, her knight gets into the action, so I won't do it. 

Now: look this funny line starting with an original idea: 
12. a4!?. 
It is based on the idea that I have a ""spare"" tempo. And I want to avoid to ""simply defend"". The advantage of the next a5 is that it threatens the queen, so it blocks any black's action (except a check), and gives me more power on d4. If Qd6, Rd1 becomes attractive for white, and b4 comes again into consideration. 
a5 blocks the square for the queen checks, but still BxB is ""on"" against d4. But I didn't see it at once, and analyzed the following: 

12.	a4		d4!? Just suppose. Of course black wouldn't play it, but if he does, and white overlooks the BxB line, it goes: 
13.	a5		Qa6. If Qb5, 14. Na3 becomes a developement move, giving me an edge. If Qxa5, Nc4 is a freeway to e5 or a5... But this move gives white another chance:
14.	Qb3. You'd say it is futile, since Rb8, followed by o-o, is good f"
