1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Arguably the oldest move in the book. It's a move that has been played for centuries, by all levels of opponents and even Bobby Fisher's personal favorite. ""Best by test"" as he'd say it. A move befitting for a challenge match I'd say."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I decide to play the Sicilian, my bread and butter and a countermeasure to my abysmal 1. e4 e5 play. White has a lot of options, but usually goes with the quiet Nf3 before making fireworks with a d4 push in the center. I was kind of hoping for him to play 2.c3 which is the Alapin. I was hoping for this because it's arguably one of the openings I play worst against and It'd make a good practicegame."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Interestingly enough my opponent chooses for the Smith Morra gambit, an opening which one of my old teachers in high school used to play. White sacrifices a pawn ( sometimes temporarily depending on what variation you decide to play ) in exchange for a faster development."
4,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3pP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,I was anticipating c3 to follow now as it's usually played in this position. I would probably have played some type of Scheveningen setup if that were the case with pawns on d6 and e6.
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,c3 doesn't get played. This is perfectly playable for white in my opinion even though the openingdatabases seem to disagree. It'll most likely transpose into an open sicilian.
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,We successfully transposed into an open Sicilian.
7,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,We successfully transposed into an open Sicilian.
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"This is not what I usually play, but I felt like testing it out. Usually I'd play e6 and go into a Taimanov/Kahn Sicilian where I lie in wait for counterattacking possibilities. The variation which I hoped we'd end up playing is called the Sveshnikov Sicilian, which is usually reached with the move order: 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5! I wanted to play this Sicilian since it's one of the most dynamic Sicilians out there where black creates a bunch of weaknesses in his position in exchange for dynamic counterplay and if white doesn't know what he's doing he can get caught off guard really easily. I figured it'd make for an interesting and fun match full of tactical complications."
9,Nxc6,d4c6,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2N2n2/8/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"Sadly we're not going into the Sveshnikov. I think this move is an error by white and I'm not sure why he played it. Maybe he was looking at 5.Nxc6 bxc6 6.e5, but that gets met by Qa5+ simply winning a pawn. I'd have played Nc3 instead if I were white in this position."
10,bxc6,b7c6,r1bqkb1r/p2ppppp/2p2n2/8/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Winning back my knight. dxc6 was also an option, but black loses his right to castle after the queens go off the board. The pawn on e4 is now under attack so he must play either f3, Nc3, Bd2 or a queenmove.I think Nc3 is the better one out of all those options."
11,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/p2ppppp/2p2n2/8/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"A scheveningen type of set-up. I don't think it's black's best move, but I don't think it's a mistake either. It makes the development of my dark squared bishop a little bit iffy, but gives room for my light squared bishop to come and play. I'm planning on developing the dark squared bishop with a fianchetto."
12,d6,d7d6,r1bqkb1r/p3pppp/2pp1n2/8/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"A scheveningen type of set-up. I don't think it's black's best move, but I don't think it's a mistake either.

13,Bd3,f1d3,r1bqkb1r/p3pppp/2pp1n2/8/4P3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,"The bishop is developed as planned. I start to wonder where I'm going to move my light squared bishop to. Maybe b7 would be nice after a c5 push, but I think that a c5 push is too early at this point of the game. The e6 square isn't really appetizing either as it doesn't put pressure on anything. It's something I'll have to think about during the next few moves. Right now castling should be my priority."

17,Be3,c1e3,r1bqk2r/p3ppbp/2pp1np1/8/4P3/2NBB3/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 3 9,"I found this interesting. It's not everyday that both bishops get developed on the 3th rank. I don't think it's bad, but it might miss a bit of ... ambition? It doesn't really put a lot of pressure on anything aside from the a7 pawn, but if his response to me moving my rook to b8 is Bxa7 then I don't think this game will go well for him at all. Both sides can develop very calmly here and there's no opening advantage for either side. Ng4 comes into mind, making use of my underdeveloped bishop for protection. It's not something that is worth it right now, but definitely something to consider in the future. I personally would have played Bg5. h6 would be met with Bh4. If black still wants to chase the bishop away with g5 after that then he effectively ruined his kingside pawnstructure making castling rather awkward."
18,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/p3ppbp/2pp1np1/8/4P3/2NBB3/PPP2PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 4 10,"I am not sure why Qe2 was played. If I had to take a guess then I'd say it was either played with the hopes of playing Ba6, which isn't very good since I'd just develop my bishop rather then trade it, or I could even consider Ba6 Bxa6 Qxa6 c5 after which his queen looks like a dingleberry over there, achieving nothing. The other possible reason is to shove the e4 pawn as a breaking move in the near future after he relocated his dark squared bishop, but if that was his plan then Re1 would have been slightly better in my opinion. Re1 is also the move I'd have played here if I was white."

20,Rb8,a8b8,1rbq1rk1/p3ppbp/2pp1np1/8/4P3/2NBB3/PPP1QPPP/R4RK1 w - - 6 11,"Poking him a litttle. White has multiple good ways to deal with it, but choosing a wrong one can get really troublesome rather quickly."
21,b3,b2b3,1rbq1rk1/p3ppbp/2pp1np1/8/4P3/1PNBB3/P1P1QPPP/R4RK1 b - - 0 11,Not the best response in my opinion as it weakens the a1-h8 diagonal. His knight is now unprotected and on the same diagonal as a rook. Ideas of Qa5 come to mind. I think Rb1 was the best defence here. Bxa7 was also a possibility but after 11. Bxa7 Rxb2 white has an isolated c-pawn and my rook on the second rank can put some nice pressure.
22,Ng4,f6g4,1rbq1rk1/p3ppbp/2pp2p1/8/4P1n1/1PNBB3/P1P1QPPP/R4RK1 w - - 1 12,"b3 is something I immediately try and take advantage of. There's only 1 correct move here for white, all the others lose material . This was played to put pressure on his bishop as well as making my bishop aim at c3. Note that playing Qa5 immediately wouldn't have worked because he could have just moved his knight."
23,Qd2,e2d2,1rbq1rk1/p3ppbp/2pp2p1/8/4P1n1/1PNBB3/P1PQ1PPP/R4RK1 b - - 2 12,"This move is a mistake. A move that aims to solve the issue of his knight being attacked by defending it. This however means that after Nxe3 he must reply with fxe3 creating a double pawn and a serious potential weakness. And although he's defending his knight, after Qa5 there's no way to defend it any further resulting in a loss of material. The best move for white would have been the quiet Bd2 in my opinion. It makes white's position look very meek, but it's pretty solid. If Bd2 had been played I would have played Ne5, attacking his bishop as well as just generally being a nice square for my knight. Black would have been slightly better positionally speaking."
24,Nxe3,g4e3,1rbq1rk1/p3ppbp/2pp2p1/8/4P3/1PNBn3/P1PQ1PPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 13,Qxe3 loses a piece so he must play fxe3
25,fxe3,f2e3,1rbq1rk1/p3ppbp/2pp2p1/8/4P3/1PNBP3/P1PQ2PP/R4RK1 b - - 0 13,"Doubled isolated pawns, they're usually a pain in the ass to defend. I'm not quite sure how I'm going to take advantage of this positional weakness at this point, but I'm definitely going to try."
26,Qa5,d8a5,1rb2rk1/p3ppbp/2pp2p1/q7/4P3/1PNBP3/P1PQ2PP/R4RK1 w - - 1 14,This wins material for black no matter what white plays. This move is the main reason why Bd2 was required.
