1,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/2N5/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 1,"Hi everyone!

I have been very quiet recently because I have been concentrating on trying to get my first ever victory against 1900+ opposition.  Thankfully I did manage it - in fact - my opponent, Ger's optimum rating was 1997, just 3 points away from Expertdom, so a big result.  So, how did Jo The Beginner manage to do this and regain her Class A status?  Well, Ger kicks off with 1. Nc3 which is the Dunst Opening, a favourite of Freddy, the Master Mater."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/8/2N5/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"2. ..... Nc6 - Ger has got both knights out, time to catch up with some equine development of my own!"

5,g3,g2g3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/8/2N2NP1/PPPPPP1P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,5. Nxd4 - pawn trade.  I am tempted to trade knights here but I do not want the Wicked Witch of the West to sit on d4 so I decided to respond with the line-opening e6 - gives Fou Lenoir some air.
6,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/pp1ppppp/2n2n2/2p5/8/2N2NP1/PPPPPP1P/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,5. Nxd4 - pawn trade.  I am tempted to trade knights here but I do not want the Wicked Witch of the West to sit on d4 so I decided to respond with the line-opening e6 - gives Fou Lenoir some air.

11,Bf4,c1f4,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1pn2/8/3N1B2/2N3P1/PPP1PP1P/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,6. ..... d6 - although this move closes up Fou Lenoir's line temporarily it also shuts out Ger's dsb.  I do not want a knight fork on c7 thank you very much!

14,bxc6,b7c6,r1bqkb1r/p4ppp/2pppn2/8/5B2/2N3P1/PPP1PP1P/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,7. ...... bxc6 - I am quite relieved therefore to see the back of one of those white steeds.

16,e5,e6e5,r1bqkb1r/p4ppp/2pp1n2/4p3/4PB2/2N3P1/PPP2P1P/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 9,8. ....... e5 - now looks more like a double king pawn opening.

18,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/p3bppp/2pp1n2/4p3/4P3/2N1B1P1/PPP2P1P/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 10,10. ...... Bb7 - this diagonal may be very useful for Fou Leblanc and I continue to clear the decks!
19,f3,f2f3,r1bqk2r/p3bppp/2pp1n2/4p3/4P3/2N1BPP1/PPP4P/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 10,10. ...... Bb7 - this diagonal may be very useful for Fou Leblanc and I continue to clear the decks!

Ger blocks with the Witch and I decided to trade queens as I am now a pawn up, note my d4 pawn is also a passer.  Can I win this from here?  I decided to firmly fix my eyes away from that Offer Draw button."

41,Bc4,e2c4,r4rk1/5ppp/p4n2/2bbp3/2Bp4/N4PP1/PP4KP/2BR3R b - - 3 21,"21. Bc4 - Ger plays it anyway but this is gonna trigger off a plethora of exchanges.  Firstly, I am very reluctant to give up Fou Lenoir for the knight on a3 but this will result in a nullification of a queenside pawn majority."
42,Bxa3,c5a3,r4rk1/5ppp/p4n2/3bp3/2Bp4/b4PP1/PP4KP/2BR3R w - - 0 22,22. Bxd5 - an intermezzo (in-between move) attacking my rook.  I must now play Nxd5 because if I try and get my rook out of the line of fire with Rad8 for example he can play BxPch and if KxB then PxB regaining his pawn.
