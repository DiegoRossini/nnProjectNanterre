1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Don't mind the conflicting title with the result, I think Black's pawn grab was pretty good and if he had played a little more cautious, he could have held on to the pawn with a good position. Instead he played a little passively and got himself in real trouble very fast."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,The only anti-Sicilian I consider worth playing. Ivanchuck used this line to end a non-losing streak of Kasparov's. The point of this move is to delay the central break and either exchange a pair of Bishops or force Black to develop his pieces on slightly awkward squares.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,The only anti-Sicilian I consider worth playing. Ivanchuck used this line to end a non-losing streak of Kasparov's.

6,Bd7,c8d7,rn1qkbnr/pp1bpppp/3p4/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 4,"The most solid line. 3...Nd7 is more risky but offers more winning chances for Black, provided he survives the middlegame."
7,Bxd7+,b5d7,rn1qkbnr/pp1Bpppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,Again the most solid recapture. Black wants to develop the Nb8 to c6 to control d4. Capturing with the Queen has another point in case White tries the following setup.
8,Qxd7,d8d7,rn2kbnr/pp1qpppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,Again the most solid recapture. Black wants to develop the Nb8 to c6 to control d4. Capturing with the Queen has another point in case White tries the following setup.
9,c4,c2c4,rn2kbnr/pp1qpppp/3p4/2p5/2P1P3/5N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"Aiming for an improved Maroczy bind. Since White has exchanged his light squared Bishop, he should be a little better if Black allows White to play d4."
10,Qg4,d7g4,rn2kbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/2P1P1q1/5N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 6,"A more radical approach against White's plan is 5...e5, which is solid albeit slightly passive. This Queen sortie wins a pawn but at a significant risk. White will get a lead in development, open the central lines and exert quite a bit of pressure. I'd also like to mention that Black gets adequate play in the main lines, so I think this will be my last outing with this line."
11,O-O,e1g1,rn2kbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/2P1P1q1/5N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 2 6,"The e-pawn is the pawn that must be sacrificed, since the e-file will provide good tactical chances against the uncastled King."
