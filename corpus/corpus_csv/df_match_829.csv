1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Let us begin with a Philidor Defence.  Fairly popular in the 19th Century, following the teachings of one Francois-Andre Philidor, it fell under a shadow during the 20th.  It seems to have undergone something of a revival - if a minor one - in recent decades.  It is an opening, I think, for the careful, solid player: patient, playing the cards close to the chest.  Not an opening I have ever played as Black!"

5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"In my view this is the best move White can make here, though 3.Bc4 is not a bad alternative. White at once threatens to win a pawn, and may not be averse to exchanging Queens into the bargain."
6,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/3PP1b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,"(?) The Gameknot Engine calls this a mistake.  The pin is not particularly effective, as we'll soon see.  This was the move the Duke of Brunswick and Count Isouard played in their encounter with the great Paul Morphy, at the Opera in 1859.  Though Black was heavily defeated, this line continued to be played now and then in top flight chess for maybe 40 years subsequently.  It is hard to imagine why!"
7,dxe5,d4e5,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4P3/4P1b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"Already we see the the limitations of the pin.  If now 4...dxe5, then 5.Qxd8ch Kxd8  6.Nxe5 wins a pawn and threatens a knight-fork at f7.  So what should Black play?"
8,Nc6,b8c6,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4P3/4P1b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"Black plays a gambit line, which says a lot about his fighting qualities!  The move the Duke and the Count played is the more usual: 4...Bxf3 5.Qxf3 dxe5 6.Bc4 Nf6 7.Qb3 ... this repeated attack against f7 has the effect of inducing the Black Queen forward a square, where it  slows down Black's development."
9,exd6,e5d6,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2nP4/8/4P1b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"For the cost of a pawn, Black has gained a bit of time to develop his game."
10,Bxd6,f8d6,r2qk1nr/ppp2ppp/2nb4/8/4P1b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"For the cost of a pawn, Black has gained a bit of time to develop his game."
11,Be2,f1e2,r2qk1nr/ppp2ppp/2nb4/8/4P1b1/5N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"Possibly too circumspect a development, and maybe tends to justify Black's third move.  The GK engine suggests 6.h3 instead, driving the bishop back to e6 or d7 and the White can develop her King's bishop to a more active posting.  It is not clear what White's response ought to be after 6.h3, Bh5, though.  Possibly 7.Bb5."
12,Bxf3,g4f3,r2qk1nr/ppp2ppp/2nb4/8/4P3/5b2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"Not the best.  If Black wanted to exchange B for N, he might as well have done at move 4.  Better was 6...Qe7, striking the unprotected e-pawn, and then castling Queen's side."
13,Bxf3,e2f3,r2qk1nr/ppp2ppp/2nb4/8/4P3/5B2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,"Not quite so effective, now, as the e-pawn is protected."

15,O-O,e1g1,r3k1nr/ppp1qppp/2nb4/8/4P3/5B2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 2 8,"Castling on opposite sides.  This can lead to an exciting race between attacks!  Black has an immediate threat ...Bxh2ch, unmasking the rook's attack against the Queen."

17,Bd2,c1d2,2kr2nr/ppp1qppp/2nb4/8/4P3/5B2/PPPB1PPP/RN1Q1RK1 b - - 4 9,"Averts the danger, though subjecting herself to a sort of 'self pin'.  Whilst the Queen remains on d1, the Bishop dare not move (...Bxh2ch, remember).  A better option might have been to shift the Queen off d1 right now, allowing the bishop to develop more actively, and preparing the way for a rook to move to d1 to challenge Black's tenure of the file."
18,Be5,d6e5,2kr2nr/ppp1qppp/2n5/4b3/4P3/5B2/PPPB1PPP/RN1Q1RK1 w - - 5 10,"Another threat!  Black is certainly carrying the fight to his higher ranked opponent!  It is fairly easily averted, but annoying for all that.  The play 9...Qe5 looks promising as it threatens mate, and ...Qxb2.  But it doesn't quite work like that: 9...Qe5?!10.g3 Qxb2?? 11.Bc3 Qb6 12.Bxg7 ... Oops.  An alternative to the text move was 9...Bf4."
19,Qc1,d1c1,2kr2nr/ppp1qppp/2n5/4b3/4P3/5B2/PPPB1PPP/RNQ2RK1 b - - 6 10,"Rather an awkward defence, but White wanted the c3-square for her knight, so didn't play the more 'obvious' c3.  It is also possible White has an eye on the squares f4 or g5.  The other upside to this move is that the bishop is no longer constrained by the pin on the d-file."
20,h6,h7h6,2kr2nr/ppp1qpp1/2n4p/4b3/4P3/5B2/PPPB1PPP/RNQ2RK1 w - - 0 11,"Black could have played 10...Nf6 safely enough, and if White did play 11.Bg5, then 11...h6 would have forced a decision upon her whether or not to take.  But the move is useful to begin pawn operations against the castled King.  Developing the Knight ought to have taken precedence, though."

22,Bxc3,e5c3,2kr2nr/ppp1qpp1/2n4p/8/4P3/2b2B2/PPP2PPP/RNQ2RK1 w - - 0 12,"...But Black did not have to play this!  Up to here the game was evenly poised, but now the scales tip, just a little, in White's favour. Instead, Black could have developed his Knight to f6, and let White, if she chose, exchange on her time."
23,Nxc3,b1c3,2kr2nr/ppp1qpp1/2n4p/8/4P3/2N2B2/PPP2PPP/R1Q2RK1 b - - 0 12,"In the interests of attack against the castle King.  But Black probably ought to have completed his development first: 12...Nf6, and then  start thinking about attack."

25,Bg4+,f3g4,2kr2nr/ppp1qp2/2n4p/6p1/4P1B1/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1Q2RK1 b - - 1 13,"The bishop was potentially a target on f3.  With this move, she places Black's f-pawn under restraint."
26,Kb8,c8b8,1k1r2nr/ppp1qp2/2n4p/6p1/4P1B1/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1Q2RK1 w - - 2 14,Challenging for the open file.
