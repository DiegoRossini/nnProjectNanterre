1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was a ladder game where I was challenged by a player with a considerably higher rating. From my perspective the result was a good one but I'm still not sure if I should have carried on the game for a little longer.

We start with my favored English opening. I decided to go for this as I know it better than most openings"
