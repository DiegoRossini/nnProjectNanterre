1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This is my same old boring opening for white e4.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Stillgar plays my ideal response of c5.  A very aggressive move challenging the middle of the board.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,I continue my boring opening attacking the middle of the board.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,Stillgar attacks right back continuing to be aggressive.
5,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,This is my way of being exciting while still doing my boring opening.  I keep saying my boring opening because I have not strayed from it for years.  I am challenging the middle of the board but really just offering trades and to keep the offensive.
6,cxd4,c5d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,In my mind by stillgar taking the d4 pawn he is excepting my trades.
7,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,Here I take the pawn thinking he is going to take my knight then I will bring my queen out.
8,Qa5+,d8a5,r1b1kbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/q7/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"Instead stillgar continues to be aggressive bringing out his queen on the 4th move putting me in check.  In every book I have read(which is not many)  they all say not to bring the queen out to early.  In my experience this has been true because the queen gets bounced around while the other player brings more pieces out.  That in mind,  I have not played too many high ranking players and stillgar probably sees something I don't."
9,Nc3,b1c3,r1b1kbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/q7/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,I try to not let this check and him bringing out his queen phase me and continue my boring opening.
10,Nxd4,c6d4,r1b1kbnr/pp1ppppp/8/q7/3nP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,Stillgar continues to be very aggressive.  He decides to take the knight which is fine by me because I get to get out of my boring opening moves.
11,Qxd4,d1d4,r1b1kbnr/pp1ppppp/8/q7/3QP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 6,I of course take the knight with my queen giving me the advantage for a brief moment.  I continue to play safe waiting till I get more pieces out till I attack.
12,e5,e7e5,r1b1kbnr/pp1p1ppp/8/q3p3/3QP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 0 7,Although I am forced to move my queen I am still alright.  I have to big pieces out and am challenging the middle of the board.  I just have to be careful of the knight and make sure to pick a good spot for my queen.
13,Qd5,d4d5,r1b1kbnr/pp1p1ppp/8/q2Qp3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 1 7,I choose to make a move and be aggressive in order to keep the offensive on my side challenging his queen.  Also trading queens would hopefully help me not allowing stillgar to utilize such a crucial piece.  This would also free up my knight for the moment if he takes my queen.
14,Bb4,f8b4,r1b1k1nr/pp1p1ppp/8/q2Qp3/1b2P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 2 8,Stillgar is smart and no doubt sees what i am doing so takes the offensive back by threatening my knight while protecting his queen and now challenging my queen.  This doesn't allow me to sit and wait for him to take my queen advancing my pawn.
15,Qxa5,d5a5,r1b1k1nr/pp1p1ppp/8/Q3p3/1b2P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 8,I decide then to trade queens because this will keep me on the offensive for the moment.
16,Bxa5,b4a5,r1b1k1nr/pp1p1ppp/8/b3p3/4P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 0 9,At this point we are developed equally so I decide to continue to develop.
17,Bc4,f1c4,r1b1k1nr/pp1p1ppp/8/b3p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 1 9,I bring out the Bc4 a aggressive move in my mind.  Continuing to challenge the middle of the board.
18,Bxc3+,a5c3,r1b1k1nr/pp1p1ppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/2b5/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 0 10,This move I expected because stillgar has been aggressive the whole game.  Although I don't like doubling up my pawns I do like it's rewards.
19,bxc3,b2c3,r1b1k1nr/pp1p1ppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/2P5/P1P2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 0 10,My only move is to take the bishop with my pawn which frees up the b row for an attack.
20,Nf6,g8f6,r1b1k2r/pp1p1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/2P5/P1P2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 1 11,Right away stillgar has taken the offensive attacking the e4 pawn.
