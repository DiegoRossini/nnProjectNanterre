4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/5P2/3P4/PPP1P1PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Excellent! impedes 4.Be3 and short castling. This is what happens when you don't think about the consequences of your opening flaws.
5,e4,e2e4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/4PP2/3P4/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,Excellent! impedes 4.Be3 and short castling. This is what happens when you don't think about the consequences of your opening flaws.

8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n1pn2/2b5/4PP2/3P1N2/PPP3PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 3 5,"So why not to go for 5.d4 then? No idea, I could have saved a time and keep on wasting moves. Not that these are losing ones, but do not help in the development. See that now black can go castling and start exerting some pressure on ""e"" column, while WK is still far away from finding a safe place."

I even knew about the threatened pawn in e4, and yet still did move B to c4. It was a real fast move, not thinking, I guess I was not really 100% focus on the game."

If played well, that extra pawn should not bring any trouble. And yet, I can activate my rook and start a mild attack if allowed. Let's see how this develops."

But this starts getting similar to those Greco positions from the XVII century (well, not that similar, since e6 is really blocking my bishop's attack. Let's give it a try then."
