1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,A blitz game I memorized. (played on gameknot)
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,2...d5 would have been favourable for white in view of 3.cxd5 Nxd5 4.e4.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,2...d5 would have been favourable for white in view of 3.cxd5 Nxd5 4.e4.
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,2...d5 would have been favourable for white in view of 3.cxd5 Nxd5 4.e4.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,One of the key elements of the Nimzo-Indian is the bishop on b4.
6,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,One of the key elements of the Nimzo-Indian is the bishop on b4.
7,e3,e2e3,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"And now one of the most straightforward replies is the Rubinstein Variation (4.e3), in which White ignores Black's 'threats' and simply gets on with the process of developing his remaining pieces."
8,c5,c7c5,rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/1bPP4/2N1P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,Basically one of the three main options for Black here. The other two are 4...b6 and 4...O-O.
9,Nge2,g1e2,rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/4pn2/2p5/1bPP4/2N1P3/PP2NPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,This is a very common move in the Nimzo-Indian. Another possibility is 5.Bd3 with for instance the so called Hï¿½bner Variation 5...Nc6 6.Nf3 Bxc3  7.bxc3 d6 8.O-O etc.
10,Ne4,f6e4,rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/1bPPn3/2N1P3/PP2NPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,5...cxd4 is more common here. The text-move caught me a bit off guard.
11,a3,a2a3,rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/1bPPn3/P1N1P3/1P2NPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"? 6.Qc2 is usually played now, with the most likely continuation 6...cxd4 7.exd4 d5 8.a3"
12,Ba5,b4a5,rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/4p3/b1p5/2PPn3/P1N1P3/1P2NPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,"I expected the exchange, but actually 6...Qf6 is a nice alternative and can already be played here, though 7.f3 Nxc3 8.Nxc3 Bxc3 leads to an even position."
13,Qc2,d1c2,rnbqk2r/pp1p1ppp/4p3/b1p5/2PPn3/P1N1P3/1PQ1NPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 2 7,Developing my queen and attacking the knight on e4.
14,d5,d7d5,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/4p3/b1pp4/2PPn3/P1N1P3/1PQ1NPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 0 8,Defends the knight and gains more control in the centre.
15,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/4p3/b1pP4/3Pn3/P1N1P3/1PQ1NPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 8,Taking one of blacks central pawns.
16,exd5,e6d5,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/8/b1pp4/3Pn3/P1N1P3/1PQ1NPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 0 9,"Maybe 8...Nxc3 should have been tried, 9.Nxc3 cxd4 10.Qa5  Nd7 11.exd4 and then 11...exd5"
17,dxc5,d4c5,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/8/b1Pp4/4n3/P1N1P3/1PQ1NPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 9,"It seems odd to take 'away form the centre', but of course I win a pawn and leave Black with an isolated pawn on d5 ."
18,Qf6,d8f6,rnb1k2r/pp3ppp/5q2/b1Pp4/4n3/P1N1P3/1PQ1NPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 1 10,This queen move increases pressure on c3 and threatens the f2 pawn.
19,b4,b2b4,rnb1k2r/pp3ppp/5q2/b1Pp4/1P2n3/P1N1P3/2Q1NPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 10,"!? To be honest, I played this move instantly, focusing too much on c3 and only then did I see the f2 threat! Instead 10.f3 was forced of course."
20,Qxf2+,f6f2,rnb1k2r/pp3ppp/8/b1Pp4/1P2n3/P1N1P3/2Q1NqPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 0 11,That's what can happen in a blitz game late at night :)
21,Kd1,e1d1,rnb1k2r/pp3ppp/8/b1Pp4/1P2n3/P1N1P3/2Q1NqPP/R1BK1B1R b kq - 1 11,"?? Now black played instantly and blunders, 11...Nxc3  was almost forced."
22,Bc7,a5c7,rnb1k2r/ppb2ppp/8/2Pp4/1P2n3/P1N1P3/2Q1NqPP/R1BK1B1R w kq - 2 12,"?? Now black played instantly and blunders, 11...Nxc3  was almost forced."
23,Nxe4,c3e4,rnb1k2r/ppb2ppp/8/2Pp4/1P2N3/P3P3/2Q1NqPP/R1BK1B1R b kq - 0 12,But again I miss the strongest continuation: 12.Nxd5! which wins for white here. (attacking both the knight and bishop) 12...Bf5 13.Nxc7  Ke7 14.Nd5  (14.Nxa8? is not so good: 14...Rd8  15.Bd2 Qxe3) 14...Kf8 15.Ndc3 and white comes out a a bishop and a pawn ahead.
24,dxe4,d5e4,rnb1k2r/ppb2ppp/8/2P5/1P2p3/P3P3/2Q1NqPP/R1BK1B1R w kq - 0 13,At least I'm winning a pawn again and now the black king is in an ugly position.
25,Qxe4+,c2e4,rnb1k2r/ppb2ppp/8/2P5/1P2Q3/P3P3/4NqPP/R1BK1B1R b kq - 0 13,At least I'm winning a pawn again and now the black king is in an ugly position.
