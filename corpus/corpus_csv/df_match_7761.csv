1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Queen's pawn opening, something I play against regularly at the coffee shop.  Generally slower than King's pawn, making white make extra moves before being able to castle.  I respond with my usual, expecting the game to move into Queen's Indian opening lines."

3,Qd3,d1d3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/3Q4/PPP1PPPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 2 2,"Hmmm, I expected either c4, or Nf3.  After some research, I'm told this is the Siberian Attack.  Although d3 is a great square for the queen, I think this is way too early to be placing it there.  It gives black a great chance to plan to attack it.  At the time of the move, I decided against looking into it and so went with my gut instinct.  I felt I would be able to marginalise white's queen and gain the upper hand from here."
