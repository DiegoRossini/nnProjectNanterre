1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is my traditional opening, the King's Pawn Game (B00)."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"I've rarely experienced this opener before, which is Alekhine's Defense (B02). I knew though that against someone this strong, this would be expected."
3,e5,e4e5,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/4P3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Normally, I'd protect my pawn, but with being against a master, and getting better at chess lately, I felt that the Alekhine's Defense Mokele Mbembe (Buecker) Variation (B02) was a good idea. Stalhandske told me that this was a good move."
4,Nd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/3nP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,Black continues the Alekhine's Defense (B02).
5,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/3nP3/2P5/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,I continue the Alekhine's Defense (B02) by attacking the knight again.
6,Nb6,d5b6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/1n6/4P3/2P5/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,The Alekhine's Defense Steiner Variation (B02) continues.
7,c5,c4c5,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/1n6/2P1P3/8/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"I respond with the Alekhine's Defense (B02) two pawns' (Lasker's) Attack. Again, black tells me this is a good move, which I am glad to hear, for I'm usually good with openings."
8,Nd5,b6d5,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/2PnP3/8/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,Black plays the Alekhine's Defense (B02) two pawns' attack Mikenas Variation.
9,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/2PnP3/2B5/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 5,I continue Alekhine.
10,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4p3/2PnP3/2B5/8/PP1P1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,Black continues Alekhine.
11,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4p3/2PnP3/2BP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 6,"Alekhine's Defense is now over, along with the book openings. Quite impressive though that both sides, namely white, was able to stay with the book for 5 moves. Now the game continues without the book,"
12,b6,b7b6,rnbqkb1r/p1pp1ppp/1p2p3/2PnP3/2BP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 7,"If I do not play cxb6, black will probably play b5 next and attack my Bishop..."
13,cxb6,c5b6,rnbqkb1r/p1pp1ppp/1P2p3/3nP3/2BP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 7,...so I decide to attack and trade.
14,axb6,a7b6,rnbqkb1r/2pp1ppp/1p2p3/3nP3/2BP4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 8,This would of continued Alekhine's Defense if played on move 6.
15,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/2pp1ppp/1p2p3/3nP3/2BP4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 8,This would of continued Alekhine's Defense if played on move 6.
16,Nxc3,d5c3,rnbqkb1r/2pp1ppp/1p2p3/4P3/2BP4/2n5/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 9,"Wasn't completely expecting fair trade, but I'll except. Knights can be powerful pieces, but in this case it doesn't really matter for each side because it's a fair trade and neither Knight is a threat."
17,bxc3,b2c3,rnbqkb1r/2pp1ppp/1p2p3/4P3/2BP4/2P5/P4PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 9,My Bishop gets attacked.

19,Bb5+,c4b5,rnbqkb1r/2p2ppp/1p2p3/1B1pP3/3P4/2P5/P4PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 10,"I play check, which may not be the best move, but not the worse."
20,c6,c7c6,rnbqkb1r/5ppp/1pp1p3/1B1pP3/3P4/2P5/P4PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 11,"I expected this move. I basically gave white a free move, and now I must protect my Bishop to."
21,Bd3,b5d3,rnbqkb1r/5ppp/1pp1p3/3pP3/3P4/2PB4/P4PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 11,"I think black may be planning more trade, but could also be trying to control center."
22,c5,c6c5,rnbqkb1r/5ppp/1p2p3/2ppP3/3P4/2PB4/P4PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 12,"I think black may be planning more trade, but could also be trying to control center."
23,Bb2,c1b2,rnbqkb1r/5ppp/1p2p3/2ppP3/3P4/2PB4/PB3PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 1 12,"I played the opening of this game quite well, but finally I made an inaccuracy, which wasn't a bad move, but computer analysis says that Nf3 would of been better, which yes it would of, for it would of got my knight out there."
