The options here for black are: 1) Doubled major pieces (q+r) on h file. But this does not work as the white king can escape via g1. 2) Sacrifice of queen on h2, followed by rook check on h file. This does not work as white king can escape via g1. Its clear that g1 needs to be addressed before black's plans can succeed. There are 2 solutions to this. 1) Make white block g1 himself. This is the plan I choose with 27.. e2. or 2) Use the dark square bishop on d4 to attack this square. The problem with idea 2 is the black pawn blocking the diagonal e3-g1, and maybe the white knight that can play to c2 preventing black's plan.  Of course the knight would be overstretched in this scenario, meaning instead black could double on the g file. I think its important at move 24 to be able to visualise all these options as black. And also the classic idea of white r on g1, black p on e2, followed by ..Qxh2+, Kxh2 Rh6 mate"
