What I liked in particular is the creative way in which I managed to bring all my forces into play combined in a an attack over the a8-h1 diagonal."

The best reponse for black seems to be 11...,Bb7, when white has to respond with d4-d5. After that black  can undermine white's pawn formation with c7-c6, and is probably better.

I was hoping for d5, a pawn structure I am familiar with. 
After that I would have played g6 + Nf6-g8-e7 + Bc8 to prepare for f7-f5. With the pawn structure closed (after d5) the game tends to be slow and include a lot of manoeuvring. However I think black has an advantage after d5, if he can push f7-f5 through."

I dont think white  can play f4 + fxe5 because black will gain a strong outpost on e5 for his knight.
However white could perhaps play f4-f5, in the hope of storming blacks king.
In that case black must seek counterplay through the centre of on the queens side of the board."

For example,  white now has difficulty playing f2-f4.
Not good is 20.f4, exf4; 21.gxf4?, Nxe4 and white is on trouble over the big diagonal.
But After 20.f4, exf4; 21.Bxf4 black gains a strong point on e5, an active play against the e4 pawn."
