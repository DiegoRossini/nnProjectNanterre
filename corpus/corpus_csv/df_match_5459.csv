1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I respond to White's opening move with the Alekhine Defence.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,I respond to White's opening move with the Alekhine Defence.
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 2,"Another option for White is 2.e5, but of course this move is perfectly sound as well."
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p1n2/8/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"A good move to pre-empt a future e5 for White, as my own knight can no longer access the d5 square if he was forced to move. Nc6 is also playable.,"
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/3p1n2/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"Given the chance, White occupies the centre with both her pawns, and later on Black will have to find a way to undermine this centre."
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2np1n2/8/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"Both sides bring out their knights, and from my point of view d5 won't be too comfortable for Black [Nb4 would make the knight a big target, Ne5 weakens my pawn structure after White exchanges and Nb8 is undevelopment]"
7,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2np1n2/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,"Both sides bring out their knights, and from my point of view d5 won't be too comfortable for Black [Nb4 would make the knight a big target, Ne5 weakens my pawn structure after White exchanges and Nb8 is undevelopment]"
8,Bg4,c8g4,r2qkb1r/ppp1pppp/2np1n2/8/3PP1b1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 3 5,"Black blunts the effects of d5 for now, since the knight can now go to e5..."
9,Be2,f1e2,r2qkb1r/ppp1pppp/2np1n2/8/3PP1b1/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 4 5,...but White breaks that pin easily
10,e6,e7e6,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2nppn2/8/3PP1b1/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,Black goes for another tactic - now if White were to move his pawn to d5...
11,d5,d4d5,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2nppn2/3P4/4P1b1/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"...I can retreat the my knight to e7. 6...Ne5 7.Nxe5 Bxe2 8.Qxe2 dxe5 can be played without loss of material, but I preferred the look of Nd7."
12,Ne7,c6e7,r2qkb1r/ppp1nppp/3ppn2/3P4/4P1b1/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 7,"Since the queen no longer covers f6, White threatens to double up pawns kingside. To be honest, that probably wasn't too much of a big deal for Black, but all the same I didn't want the doubled pawns at the time..."
13,Bg5,c1g5,r2qkb1r/ppp1nppp/3ppn2/3P2B1/4P1b1/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 2 7,"Since the queen no longer covers f6, White threatens to double up pawns kingside. To be honest, that probably wasn't too much of a big deal for Black, but all the same I didn't want the doubled pawns at the time..."
14,Ng6,e7g6,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/3ppnn1/3P2B1/4P1b1/2N2N2/PPP1BPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 3 8,"?? Black thinks that the knight is better on this square than e7, but fails to realise how important the knight had been on e7. A much better plan would be a6, then Qd7, then 0-0-0 assuming White doubles up my pawns."
15,Bb5+,e2b5,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/3ppnn1/1B1P2B1/4P1b1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 4 8,"! Since the knight doesn't control c6, the pawn can't block this bishop. Therefore, the king must move!"
16,Ke7,e8e7,r2q1b1r/ppp1kppp/3ppnn1/1B1P2B1/4P1b1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 5 9,"Queen centralisation, and now White can once again double up my pawns with Bxf6+ if she wanted to. [or is it he? There's a picture of an anime girl on xukapy's profile but the name 'Hikaru' can be a name for either sex... sorry, I'm rambling but I'll assume 'she' :)]"
17,Qd4,d1d4,r2q1b1r/ppp1kppp/3ppnn1/1B1P2B1/3QP1b1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R b KQ - 6 9,"Queen centralisation, and now White can once again double up my pawns with Bxf6+ if she wanted to. [or is it he? There's a picture of an anime girl on xukapy's profile but the name 'Hikaru' can be a name for either sex... sorry, I'm rambling but I'll assume 'she' :)]"
18,Bxf3,g4f3,r2q1b1r/ppp1kppp/3ppnn1/1B1P2B1/3QP3/2N2b2/PPP2PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 10,"Since my king can no longer castle, Black looks to get all the material - especially the queens - off the board so that my uncastled king isn't so much of a big deal. As an added bonus, White's pawns get doubled up."
19,gxf3,g2f3,r2q1b1r/ppp1kppp/3ppnn1/1B1P2B1/3QP3/2N2P2/PPP2P1P/R3K2R b KQ - 0 10,"White would have known that as well, I'm sure, but another reason why she might not have played Bxf6+ is that the bishop's power outweighs the power of my pinned knight."
20,Ne5,g6e5,r2q1b1r/ppp1kppp/3ppn2/1B1Pn1B1/3QP3/2N2P2/PPP2P1P/R3K2R w KQ - 1 11,"!? Black blocks the queen's scope to f6, centralises his knight and threatens a game-winning queen fork with Nxf3+ - not a bad multi-purpose move. Unfortunately it's not an outpost due to the pawns on the f file."
21,Be2,b5e2,r2q1b1r/ppp1kppp/3ppn2/3Pn1B1/3QP3/2N2P2/PPP1BP1P/R3K2R b KQ - 2 11,"I was expecting White to move his queen to protect f3, but I hadn't seen this move, which was better."
22,c5,c7c5,r2q1b1r/pp2kppp/3ppn2/2pPn1B1/3QP3/2N2P2/PPP1BP1P/R3K2R w KQ c6 0 12,"With White having a considerably strong presence on the kingside and especially in the centre, Black looks to get an advantage queenside, and this pawn thrust looked Win-Win to me. Should White capture en passant, her centre gets broken down and if not, Black earns queenside space with tempo."
23,Qe3,d4e3,r2q1b1r/pp2kppp/3ppn2/2pPn1B1/4P3/2N1QP2/PPP1BP1P/R3K2R b KQ - 1 12,Black earns queenside space with tempo... and now what can Black do?
24,Ke8,e7e8,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/3ppn2/2pPn1B1/4P3/2N1QP2/PPP1BP1P/R3K2R w KQ - 2 13,"Respond to White's threat, that's what! White threatens the powerful 13.f4! followed by 14.e5, which would win material. If White were to play 13.f4 now then the game might continue; 13...Ned7 14.e5 h6! 15.Bh4 Nxd5 and Black actually ends up one pawn to the better (which is why the absolute pin on the king had to be broken) so White would have to accept the exchange [and the decrease in the pressure he exerts] with 15.exf6 hxg5"
