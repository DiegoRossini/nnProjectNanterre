1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"In this game i was playing someone rated a lot higher than me in a club match.
I like to try out this opening occasionally as it's surprising how many people actually take before they look.
I win around 50% of games when I play this one.
This is one of my all time favourites
(it's also my first time annotating!)"
