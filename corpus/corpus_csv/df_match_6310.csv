He could have played Re6, but my d5 pawn, which I established in the 2nd move, now prevents him from doing that without losing the rook. He could also move his Queen to protect (Qe7, but my bishop and my rook both attack that square.) Finally, his best move would have been be7 other than the move he took. He would have exchanged bishop for bishop, rook for Queen. Not ideal but...............Also, I have bxf5 available, splitting the Queen and rook. That would have screwed everything up anyways."

It occured to me that I could have done this earlier, before playing bxf5, but I wanted to make sure to keep him on the run, and not give him a free move. Pinning the rook and having his Queen trapped would have been great, but I needed to keep my advantage. My queen, both bishops, and a rook are now bearing down on the unprotected King. His options with the King are g7, g8. g8 is not favorable, because bxe6 then splits it and the Queen, while capturing a free rook. My choice here would be kg7.


Now he could also move Rg6, but that would mean abandoning his Queen, and it's a little early for heroics."
