1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,The good old English Opening - non-committal and devious.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Along with 1...c5 and 1...Nf6, one of the more popular responses.  There are several other playable lines..."
3,g3,g2g3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/6P1/PP1PPP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Thematic and good.  Slightly more usual is 2.Nc3, but this type of opening is rather forgiving of deviations in move order."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2P5/6P1/PP1PPP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"Playable, but the strike at f2 is rather too easily blocked by e2-e3, a move White is planning anyway.  Afterwards, the bishop might become a target, though it transpires that Black has something to say about that..."
5,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2P5/6P1/PP1PPPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 3,"Playable, but the strike at f2 is rather too easily blocked by e2-e3, a move White is planning anyway.  Afterwards, the bishop might become a target, though it transpires that Black has something to say about that..."
6,Bc5,f8c5,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/2b1p3/2P5/6P1/PP1PPPBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 3 4,"Playable, but the strike at f2 is rather too easily blocked by e2-e3, a move White is planning anyway.  Afterwards, the bishop might become a target, though it transpires that Black has something to say about that..."
7,a3,a2a3,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/5n2/2b1p3/2P5/P5P1/1P1PPPBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 4,"Thematic (much as it is on the Black side of a Sicilian, which opening this resembles with colours reversed), planning a Q-side expansion, striking at the c4-bishop.  The move could have waited until after 4.e3, but it seems fine here."
8,a5,a7a5,rnbqk2r/1ppp1ppp/5n2/p1b1p3/2P5/P5P1/1P1PPPBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,"Strategically well motivated , allowing Black to maintain the bishop at c5 for quite a while longer.  However probably more active for Black are moves like 4...0-0 or 4...d5."
9,e3,e2e3,rnbqk2r/1ppp1ppp/5n2/p1b1p3/2P5/P3P1P1/1P1P1PBP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,"Apparently to support a pawn advance to d5 or possibly b5.  Maybe priority ought to be given to development, but it's hard to criticise the move overmuch."
10,c6,c7c6,rnbqk2r/1p1p1ppp/2p2n2/p1b1p3/2P5/P3P1P1/1P1P1PBP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,"Apparently to support a pawn advance to d5 or possibly b5.  Maybe priority ought to be given to development, but it's hard to criticise the move overmuch."
11,Ne2,g1e2,rnbqk2r/1p1p1ppp/2p2n2/p1b1p3/2P5/P3P1P1/1P1PNPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"Fine, but 6.d4 was also good."
12,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/1p1p1ppp/2p2n2/p1b1p3/2P5/P3P1P1/1P1PNPBP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 2 7,"Also part of Black's programme.  But having played ...c6 last turn, maybe 6...d5 was indicated here, freeing up the Q-side, and getting in his strike at the centre ahead of White."
13,d4,d2d4,rnbq1rk1/1p1p1ppp/2p2n2/p1b1p3/2PP4/P3P1P1/1P2NPBP/RNBQK2R b KQ - 0 7,"Thematic.  After exchanges Black will have to retire the bishop from the a7-g1 diagonal, losing time."
14,exd4,e5d4,rnbq1rk1/1p1p1ppp/2p2n2/p1b5/2Pp4/P3P1P1/1P2NPBP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 0 8,"(?) In openings of this type, development is often slow, but Black begins seriously to neglect his Q-side pieces.  He had no reason to fear a bishop landing on g5, as then he could hit it with ...h6 (10.Bg5 h6 11.Bh4?? g5)."
15,exd4,e3d4,rnbq1rk1/1p1p1ppp/2p2n2/p1b5/2PP4/P5P1/1P2NPBP/RNBQK2R b KQ - 0 8,"(?) In openings of this type, development is often slow, but Black begins seriously to neglect his Q-side pieces.

21,b3,b2b3,rnbq1rk1/1p2bpp1/2pp1n1p/p7/2PP4/PPN3P1/4NPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 11,"Supporting the c-pawn, and preparing to occupy the long dark diagonal with a bishop.  All the same, Black could now have developed a bishop usefully at f5.  11.Qd3 or 11.Qc2 would have prevented this, for what it's worth..."
22,Nh7,f6h7,rnbq1rk1/1p2bppn/2pp3p/p7/2PP4/PPN3P1/4NPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 12,"(?) Very strange.  The sequel shows the reason for the move, but if Black wants to attack White's K, his available resources look very slender.  11...Bf5 looks fine."

His bishops are aimed at the K-side, and this pawn threatens to advance to open the f-file.  But White's resiources for attack seem to be the greater.  Meanwhile, Black has weakened himself very seriously on the light squares about his King - a consequence not lost on White!  Instead, 12...Bf5 was still playable, with a reasonable game."
25,Re1,f1e1,rnbq1rk1/1p2b1pn/2pp3p/p4p2/2PP4/PPN3P1/1B2NPBP/R2QR1K1 b - - 1 13,"Centralizing and building up for an attack.  13.Nf4 at once, threatening to continue to g6 was an alternative..."

Looks good: let's see what might have happened.  [A] 16...Rxe1  17.Rxe1 Bxd4 18.Nb5! Bxb2 19.Qxb2 Qd7 (...Qf8 20.Re8!) 20.Nxd6; or [B] 16...Bxd4 17.Nd5! Bxb2 {or 17...cxd5 18.Bxd5  ( -)} 18.Qxb2, threatening mate on g7 and the win of Black's Q by 19.Rxe8  Qxe8 20.Nhf6  Nxf6 21.Nxf6  etc.  Black's best chance seems to be [C] 16...Bh8.  Now the sac on d5 doesn't look so promising.  Maybe White has to build up further by 17.d5 , opening the dark-square diagonal towards the BK.  A possible continuation is 17...Be5!? 18.Na4 Bd7 (trying to develop) 19.c5 and Black's centre is just barely holding .... for now."
