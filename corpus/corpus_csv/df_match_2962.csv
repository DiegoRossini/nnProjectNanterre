1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

After the events of the last few days, boy I am sooo glad to get back to some normality.  Homework.  This HW is for my Mentor, Drhpatron who I have had some fairly good games with even though I lost the lot.  This game starts off OK and then goes south for me after an injudicious knight trade and that familiar dread disease, passivitis sets in.  David then injects a paralysis into my position so that I finally run out of moves that avoid further damage to my position.  Much to my horror, David then erects a mating net around Henry of which he cannot escape.  He is then hunted down and ruthlessly but elegantly executed as my buddy Gerhard (Chicoboy) stated!"
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,2. f4 - David decided to give me the Sicilian so I start the Grand Prix Attack.  I wonder if it will lead into the Master Mater's (Easy19's) annotation project?  We shall see.
