1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"In this game we both make some errors in the opening, but the real lesson is to be learned in the quickness with which Black's attack on the kingside develops."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The Bishops Opening is coming back in popularity, in fact, a recent book by GM John Emms features this system tied in with a quick f4 push."

4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 3,"Probably the most sound response, hitting the e4 pawn and intending to clear the kingside for quick castling."
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,"I played this move without really thinking, and since I dont have any books with this opening, I was really on my own here.  Now I see in the database that there are 1360 games with this move.  I didnt calculate any variations by White!"

7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B1n3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,White definitely has a lead in development here!  I was starting to remember why I don't play 1...e5.
8,Nf6,e4f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/2B5/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,"5. Nxe5 and White is better.  This has to be a mistake as Black gets center control and catches up in development.  White will have no compensation for the pawn.  In fact, White never really recovers after this move."

11,Bb3,c4b3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3pp3/8/1BNP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"Developing normally, with a central space advantage.  White's compensation is already drying up."

I had to have seen this continuation before playing 12...h5, as any bishop retreat leaves the h-pawn en prise and helps White put a knight on f5.  If 13...Bxf3 14.
