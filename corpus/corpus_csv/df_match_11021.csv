1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This is a game between me (tomwhufc) and my good friend maarten. The opening is the sicilian in wich black blocks the centre with a kind of stonewall formation.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,At this point I was planning on using the Grand Prix attack ( 2...d6 3. f4 Nc6 4. Nf3 .) As you will see black has other plans.
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,At this point I was planning on using the Grand Prix attack ( 2...d6 3. f4 Nc6 4. Nf3 .) As you will see black has other plans.
4,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/8/2p1p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"This move clamps the d4 square. This seems at first sight to be a very strong move challenging for the centre. However there is now a possible outpost for my knight on d5, uncontested by any pawns on adjacent files."
5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/8/2p1p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 3,"This develops a piece, prepares to castle kingside and attacks the centre aswell as the f7 pawn."
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/5n2/2p1p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 2 4,Also develops a piece and prepares to castle kingside.
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/5n2/2p1p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 4,"This develops a piece, prepares castling kingside and attacks the pawn on e5. This is a decent move but better would have been the flexible 4.Ne2"
8,d6,d7d6,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3p1n2/2p1p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,This solidifies  the pawns on c5 and e5. It creates a backwards pawn although black doesn't have any other choice.
9,h3,h2h3,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/3p1n2/2p1p3/2B1P3/2N2N1P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,This move may seem premature to some people although it is a crucial move because it  hinders the development of blacks lightsquared bishop.
10,h6,h7h6,rnbqkb1r/pp3pp1/3p1n1p/2p1p3/2B1P3/2N2N1P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,I feel black could have delayed this move as the development of my dark squared bishop was impossible at the time.
11,d3,d2d3,rnbqkb1r/pp3pp1/3p1n1p/2p1p3/2B1P3/2NP1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"This opens space for my bishop to be developed. As you can see Blacks central pawns do not complement the dark squared bishop as far as development is concerned, this is because they are  on the dark squares blocking decent development. I knew this would happen after he played his pawns to c5,d6 and e5. This also explains why I played 5.h3 which also hindered the dark squared bishops development. At this point Black effectively has two bad bishops. My (white's) position however is much better. My lightsquared bishop is outside my pawn chained and developed. Both my knights are in play, I am about to castle kingside and move my dark squared bishop to e3. I have the a small edge."
12,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pp3pp1/2np1n1p/2p1p3/2B1P3/2NP1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 7,This develops a piece and threatend ... Nd4 wich would have given him a very powerful piece in my territory.
13,Ne2,c3e2,r1bqkb1r/pp3pp1/2np1n1p/2p1p3/2B1P3/3P1N1P/PPP1NPP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 7,! This may seem a  backwards move but I planned to play c3 attacking d4 stopping the threat of ...Nd4. It also was meant to prepare d4 and if the worst came to the worst I could shift it to g3.
14,Na5,c6a5,r1bqkb1r/pp3pp1/3p1n1p/n1p1p3/2B1P3/3P1N1P/PPP1NPP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 3 8,I think this was a good logical move. It threatens the bishop that hinders blacks lightsquared bishop's development. It attakcs the defender.
15,Nd2,f3d2,r1bqkb1r/pp3pp1/3p1n1p/n1p1p3/2B1P3/3P3P/PPPNNPP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 4 8,This is another backwards move? It disobeys the opening principle of never moving apiece twice in the opening. But the alternatives were not to my liking. I could have played 8.Bb3 Nxb3 9.axb3. This would have left me with a powerful semi-open file but would have left me with doubled pawns.  I do not favour positions wich leave me with damaged pawn structure. Another option was to ignore the threat and castle kingside. Of course that would be a bad move bcause after 8. 0-0 Nxc4 dxc4 my position would be worse of than if i had played 8.Bb3 because I would have had doubled pawns without the semi-open file! This kind of justifies my decision to play 8.Nd2 even though  8.Bb3 is strategically better it is not to my style.
16,Nxc4,a5c4,r1bqkb1r/pp3pp1/3p1n1p/2p1p3/2n1P3/3P3P/PPPNNPP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,I was surprised by this move because I thought  ...Be6 was better.
17,Nxc4,d2c4,r1bqkb1r/pp3pp1/3p1n1p/2p1p3/2N1P3/3P3P/PPP1NPP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 9,I was surprised by this move because I thought  ...Be6 was better.
18,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/pp2bpp1/3p1n1p/2p1p3/2N1P3/3P3P/PPP1NPP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 10,I was surprised by this move because I thought  ...Be6 was better.
19,Be3,c1e3,r1bqk2r/pp2bpp1/3p1n1p/2p1p3/2N1P3/3PB2P/PPP1NPP1/R2QK2R b KQkq - 2 10,I strengthen my hold on the d4 square.
20,b5,b7b5,r1bqk2r/p3bpp1/3p1n1p/1pp1p3/2N1P3/3PB2P/PPP1NPP1/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 11,This is a rather common move in the sicilian and as in this case is normally decent.
21,Nd2,c4d2,r1bqk2r/p3bpp1/3p1n1p/1pp1p3/4P3/3PB2P/PPPNNPP1/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 11,I retreated again but this time the move is not so bad because my darksquared bishop has already been developed.
22,Qa5,d8a5,r1b1k2r/p3bpp1/3p1n1p/qpp1p3/4P3/3PB2P/PPPNNPP1/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 12,?! I am not certain why maarten played this move. It pins my knight but puts his queen in danger of attack from my minor pieces and pawns.
23,c3,c2c3,r1b1k2r/p3bpp1/3p1n1p/qpp1p3/4P3/2PPB2P/PP1NNPP1/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 12,I lift the pin on the knight and prepare d4
