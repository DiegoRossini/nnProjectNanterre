The fxg lines are weak against the uncastled black king, as they give black some breathing space opening the h file for his rook. Black needs to play very accurately for the next few moves to wriggle out of white's mating threats. The subtlety of Bb3 is to permit black to win the bishop on white's terms.. ie. not dc (opening the d file for an annoying check by the black queen on d4) but ..c4, ..cb, and after ab white can whip his rook into the attack via a4."
