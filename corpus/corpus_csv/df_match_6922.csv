1,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I don't understand why my opponent doesn't launch his pawn to e4 with a classical king pawn opening, but all the better for me."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I send out my king pawn- though d5 would have been a better choice.
3,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B5/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,"With fast development of his bishop my opponent puts pressure on the weak f7 pawn, though there is not significant pressure as of the moment."
4,Nh6,g8h6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/7n/4p3/2B5/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 3,"None the less, I protect the f7 pawn and develop my knight"
5,h3,h2h3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/7n/4p3/2B5/4P2P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 3,Wasted move. Nothing to benefit from it.
6,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/7n/4p3/1bB5/4P2P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 4,I develop my bishop and deny him the right to move his d-pawn in preperation to take out his e-pawn and in the process of pinning his d-pawn I prevent development of his black bishop.
7,a3,a2a3,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/7n/4p3/1bB5/P3P2P/1PPP1PP1/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 4,A simple reply to the situation.
8,Bc5,b4c5,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/7n/2b1p3/2B5/P3P2P/1PPP1PP1/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 5,I didn't mind moving my bishop away and breaking the pin- the important thing to me was getting my bishop out before I blocked its development with the d-pawn.
9,b4,b2b4,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/7n/2b1p3/1PB5/P3P2P/2PP1PP1/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,Now my opponent is after my bishop and I'm running out of places to put it where it will do good for me. It would have been better to have my bishop on e7 from the beginning instead of fooling with it while letting him create a pawn structure.
10,d5,d7d5,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/7n/2bpp3/1PB5/P3P2P/2PP1PP1/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,I offer the chance to trade bishops in return.
11,Bb3,c4b3,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/7n/2bpp3/1P6/PB2P2P/2PP1PP1/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 6,He retreats his bishop.
12,Bd6,c5d6,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/3b3n/3pp3/1P6/PB2P2P/2PP1PP1/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 7,I do the same with mine and add protection to my e-pawn.
13,c4,c2c4,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/3b3n/3pp3/1PP5/PB2P2P/3P1PP1/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 7,Now my opponent is out to destroy my d-pawn...
14,c6,c7c6,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/2pb3n/3pp3/1PP5/PB2P2P/3P1PP1/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 8,...and I defend it.
15,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/2pb3n/3Pp3/1P6/PB2P2P/3P1PP1/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 8,Now we exchange pawns...
16,cxd5,c6d5,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/3b3n/3pp3/1P6/PB2P2P/3P1PP1/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 9,...and I end up with a pawn controlling the center.
17,Bxd5,b3d5,rnbqk2r/pp3ppp/3b3n/3Bp3/1P6/P3P2P/3P1PP1/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 9,Sadly it lacked protection and he snatched it up.
18,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2nb3n/3Bp3/1P6/P3P2P/3P1PP1/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 10,I offer a trade; if he declines then I further protect my e-pawn.
19,Qf3,d1f3,r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2nb3n/3Bp3/1P6/P3PQ1P/3P1PP1/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 2 10,"Now he adds pressure to the a8-h1 diagonal, but also puts the f7 pawn under significant pressure, waiting for me to blunder and move my knight."
20,Bd7,c8d7,r2qk2r/pp1b1ppp/2nb3n/3Bp3/1P6/P3PQ1P/3P1PP1/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 3 11,"Undeterred, I add protection to my knight to prevent: 11.Bxc6 bxc6 [or 11... Kf8 and accept the loss of a knight, a pawn, and the right to castle] 12. Qxc6 leading to a rook-fork and once again, the loss of the right to castle."
