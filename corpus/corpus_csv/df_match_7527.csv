1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Opens up with the standard king's pawn. From here there are a lot of options, avoiding many of the slow build-ups that other opening moves favour."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The Sicilian, my only response to e4.  I feel a direct challenge to the centre gives White too much advantage, whereas the unbalanced nature of c5 allows Black to attempt to force some of the moves to go his way."
3,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"I've always felt that f4 should not be played until after Nc3, due to the possibility of Black playing d5.  This time, I decided not to play the d5 Pawn, and instead. . ."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,Developed my Knight.
5,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/2p5/4PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 3,I believe this is the Sicilian Grand Prix attack.
6,g6,g7g6,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/2p5/4PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Rather than a direct challenge at the centre, I begin to look at a fianchetto to attempt to gain some control."
7,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppp1p/2n3p1/2p5/2B1PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 4,Attacks my weak f7 Pawn and takes more control over the centre.
8,Bg7,f8g7,r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/2p5/2B1PP2/2N5/PPPP2PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 2 5,"I question the soundness of this move.  I'd have moved e5 personally, since I believe h4 was the beginning of me gaining a lead in this match.  It weakens the King's defence considerably."
9,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqk1nr/pp1pppbp/2n3p1/2p5/2B1PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 5,"I question the soundness of this move.  I'd have moved e5 personally, since I believe h4 was the beginning of me gaining a lead in this match.  It weakens the King's defence considerably."

11,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk1nr/pp1p1pbp/2n1p1p1/2p5/2B1PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 6,"I question the soundness of this move.  I'd have moved e5 personally, since I believe h4 was the beginning of me gaining a lead in this match.  It weakens the King's defence considerably."
12,Nge7,g8e7,r1bqk2r/pp1pnpbp/2n1p1p1/2p5/2B1PP2/2N2N2/PPPP2PP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 7,"I question the soundness of this move.  I'd have moved e5 personally, since I believe h4 was the beginning of me gaining a lead in this match.  It weakens the King's defence considerably."
13,h4,h2h4,r1bqk2r/pp1pnpbp/2n1p1p1/2p5/2B1PP1P/2N2N2/PPPP2P1/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 7,"I question the soundness of this move.  I'd have moved e5 personally, since I believe h4 was the beginning of me gaining a lead in this match.  It weakens the King's defence considerably."

15,exd5,e4d5,r1bqk2r/pp2npbp/2n1p1p1/2pP4/2B2P1P/2N2N2/PPPP2P1/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,"Although I hoped he would fall for this and take the Pawn, I hadn't thought that he would.  I had expected the Bishop to retreat to e2 instead."

17,Be2,c4e2,r1bqk2r/pp2npbp/2n3p1/2pp4/5P1P/2N2N2/PPPPB1P1/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 9,Too late.

Or I could've ignored the Pawn and gone through with something like 11.h5 Ng3 12.hxg6 Nxf113.gxh7+ Kxh7 14.Bxf1.  Wasn't sure which line I preferred yet, but White had other ideas anyway."

I see what he was looking at, gaining the open e-file for his Queen, but it basically allowed me to pin his Knight.  I'd have looked at 13.Ne5 Nxf4 14.Bxf4 Nxe5 15.Bf3 Nxf3+ 16.Qxf3 Bd4+.  Not much better, but I think White was running out of options by now."

I can't see a winning move for White, but how about Ne2?  Removes the pin, but after 14...Bxf3 15.gxf3 Nd4 16.Bg2 Nxe2+ 17.Qxe2 Bd4+ it's not a great deal better."
