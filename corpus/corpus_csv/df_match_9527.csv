1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Your opponent is white... your Black.. This is a random game that you have just lost and i'll take you through it... ok your opponent has started with a normal everyday move and it gives you plenty to move towards.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,normal counter move... your starting to open up F8 is ready to move and the queen but you don't wanna move the queen yet...
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,its a gd move from your opponent. He's starting to attack
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,I don't agree with that move. 1) Its leaving your queen open 2)Your taking a defence against attack (not gd) 3) F8 has now been blocked for an advance. You could have pulled a knight out which would off protected your pawn and went for an attack
5,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 3,gd... starting to attack but... that guy is 1 move ahead of you
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 4,gd... starting to attack but... that guy is 1 move ahead of you
