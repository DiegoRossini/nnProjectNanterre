1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Been awhile since I did one of these...and this one seems like a great game to do it on. The tactics in here are immense and I do believe one of my best efforts on GK. Funny how some games and positions you just see everything...and others you are like my grandmother lost in the gorcery store in search of the broccoli. Well this one I saw pretty dang good. So this is a setup tourney dealing with the c3 or Alapin variation of the sicillian defense.

The Re1 of course hits the undefended knight on e4 ( hence the trap that was laid ) and of course it looks like a damn Big Mac right in the center. This shows why jumping on a pawn and not getting your king to safety is a bad thing. I mean didn't we learn those rules back from Reinfeld?

22,Nd6,e4d6,r1bqkb1r/pp5p/3np1p1/2p1p3/2B5/1QP5/PP3PPP/RNB1R1K1 w kq - 2 12,Of course 12.Rxe5 is there...but always remember development and tempo. So far I have not alot going on...but neither does he. So let's get our pieces out. Nd2 sets up for Nf3 and then I am hitting the e5 pawn twice and also have the threat of Bg5 hitting the queen.
