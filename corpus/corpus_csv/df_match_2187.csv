2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Kramnik is right about one thing: unless your mind is like a computer, analyzing long variations in Blitz is useless in the sense that blitz is inherently inaccurate to begin with, and thinking time during play limited. But I privately bet that Kramnik has analyzed at least some of his own Blitz games he's lost, just to see where he went wrong - provided it wasn't immediately apparent. It's so much fun to watch those great players play!"

I played in my first tournament of over-the-board chess for 'National Chess day', and ended up playing someone who had a fide rating close to 2200... the tournament wasn't fide official, but his rating was and he is very well known in my area. Anyways, well into a complicated midgame I had at least a draw with winning chances had I seen a certain bishop move, but in that game too I got too focused on one part of the board. This is something I'll work on. I believe it's why many at that level get up from the board and walk around; they're not all thinking on combinations I'd bet. I'd bet they're doing it to clear their mind and when they sit back down, they see the board how it is since they have to notice the move that was made. Oh, I may annotate that game here; I think it would be fun for some of you to analyze!"
