1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was a game i recently played on playchess.com
It is a good example of how being aggressive pays off in otb chess, much more than correspondance chess.
Please leave comments using the new facility to do so. I haven't analysed very thoroughly, as this was more a game of instinct than calculated moves"

6,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2pp4/3P4/5N1P/PPP1PPP1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Another quiet move, better would be something like Nc3 or Bf4."

8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp3ppp/4pn2/2pp4/3P4/P4N1P/1PP1PPP1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"Developing towards the centre still, starting to gain a nice advantage"

12,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/2pp4/3P1B2/P4N1P/1PP1PPP1/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 5 7,Continuing development towards the centre.

If white takes the knight then: 12. Nxd4 Qxd4 13. Kc1 Qxf4, leaves me a piece up and coasting to an easy win"
