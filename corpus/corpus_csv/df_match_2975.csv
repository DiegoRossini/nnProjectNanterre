4,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,This is reminiscent of the Benoni.
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,Now we've transposed to a standard open Sicilian.
6,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,The Kan Variation (of the Sicilian). It's probably worth mentioning that my Sicilian play is really not very good ;-)

9,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p3p3/8/3NP3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,"White keeps his options open--he still may play c2-c4 and set up a Marcoczy Bind on d5, or else play f2-f4 with a big kingside assault."
10,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk1nr/1p1pbppp/p3p3/8/3NP3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 6,5...Bc5 is more common.

13,Nxc6,d4c6,r1bqk1nr/1p1pbppp/p1N1p3/8/4P3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,Paving the way for a pawn wedge at e5.
14,dxc6,d7c6,r1bqk1nr/1p2bppp/p1p1p3/8/4P3/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,This pawn may prove troublesome for Black to remove now.
15,e5,e4e5,r1bqk1nr/1p2bppp/p1p1p3/4P3/8/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,This pawn may prove troublesome for Black to remove now.
16,Bg5,e7g5,r1bqk1nr/1p3ppp/p1p1p3/4P1b1/8/2NB4/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 9,? The computer dislikes this and I'm inclined to agree. This Bishop no longer has any prospects from this side of the board--it ought to just retreat to e7.
17,f4,f2f4,r1bqk1nr/1p3ppp/p1p1p3/4P1b1/5P2/2NB4/PPP3PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 9,? The computer dislikes this and I'm inclined to agree. This Bishop no longer has any prospects from this side of the board--it ought to just retreat to e7.

The GK computer came up with a better move here, taking advantage of Black's out-of-position Bishop: 10.Ne4! This threatens 11.Nd6+ and there's nothing at all that Black can do to stop it, or to drive White's Knight away anytime soon."
20,g6,g7g6,r1bqk1nr/1p3p1p/p1p1p1pb/4P3/5PP1/2NB4/PPP4P/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 11,Creating a bolthole for the Bishop. I actually like the more aggressive 10...Qh4+! 11.Kf1 g6 here.
21,g5,g4g5,r1bqk1nr/1p3p1p/p1p1p1pb/4P1P1/5P2/2NB4/PPP4P/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 11,White continues development and prepares to castle queenside.

26,Nd5,e7d5,r1bqk2r/1p3pbp/p1p1p1p1/3nP1P1/5P2/2NBB3/PPPQ3P/R3K2R w KQkq - 5 14,"White's dark-square Bishop is 'bad', but not bad enough that he wants to trade it away. Especially in contrast to the Black Bishops, which are both miserable."

29,Qxc3,d2c3,r1bqk2r/1p3pbp/p1p1p1p1/4P1P1/5P2/2QB4/PPP2B1P/R3K2R b KQkq - 0 15,"The computer dislikes this. Admittedly, it is castling into a bit of a firestorm, but White has a lot of work to do to prove that he has an attack. I think this is fine."

Because of the potential for discovered attacks against the BQ, White now has his choice of free pawns to grab--b5 or g6. Besides that, this pawn push creates even more weak dark squares that Black is powerless to defend."

I considered it (and Bxb5), but ultimately decided to go with the text move because White's position is so superior--the extra pawn doesn't make much difference, but it's going to take several tempi to open the h file. Beginning the process now, while there's still a big threat on the table, seemed like a good way to get in a 'free' move."
