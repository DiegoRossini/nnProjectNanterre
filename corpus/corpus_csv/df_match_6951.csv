1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

This is a Traxler Tournament Game.  I played my buddy Steve as black and lost that long game, sigh.  But here I was white and I ended up with a Low Draw having 2 rooks against the Wicked Witch of the West.  It can be interesting to see how the rooks when they work together can be a tough outfit and the queen can be a menace with her checking powers (Steve's Witch certainly was a menace here).  Anyhow, as it was a mini-tourney with forced moves up to 4. ...... Bc5 I will start the action on move 5."
