4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"Interesting. I was hoping that it would end quickly just like Legall's famous game, but my hopes were futile."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,A bit of a poor move by Black. I already have two knights developed and Black should instead focus on a move like 3. ... Nf6 or 3. ... Nc6.
6,h6,h7h6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/3p3p/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,A bit of a poor move by Black. I already have two knights developed and Black should instead focus on a move like 3. ... Nf6 or 3. ... Nc6.
7,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2pp1/3p3p/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"Sure, Black's pawn on h6 was helping to stop my knight coming to g5, but I sensed that I had an advantage here."
8,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp3pp1/2pp3p/4p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"Sure, Black's pawn on h6 was helping to stop my knight coming to g5, but I sensed that I had an advantage here."
9,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp3pp1/2pp3p/4p3/2BPP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"This is an alright move, as I wanted to open up the position. 5. d3 might have been better."
10,exd4,e5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp3pp1/2pp3p/8/2BpP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,I decide to recapture using the queen instead of the knight. Black is very open to attack and so has to be careful.
11,Qxd4,d1d4,rnbqkbnr/pp3pp1/2pp3p/8/2BQP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 0 6,I decide to recapture using the queen instead of the knight. Black is very open to attack and so has to be careful.
12,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk1nr/pp2bpp1/2pp3p/8/2BQP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 1 7,A mistake. I can now capture the pawn on g7.
13,e5,e4e5,rnbqk1nr/pp2bpp1/2pp3p/4P3/2BQ4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 0 7,"Unfortunately, I didn't see it. Instead, I block the possibility. After 7. Qxg7, Black can only defend the rook with 7. ... Bf6, after which I can play Qxf7#."
14,c5,c6c5,rnbqk1nr/pp2bpp1/3p3p/2p1P3/2BQ4/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 0 8,Now Black is in serious trouble.
