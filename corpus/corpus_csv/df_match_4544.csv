It is a positional trap, because the temptation is to play  3...d4?! 4 ne2 (threatening d4) and now 4...d3 5. ng3 is great for white (he has the strong knight on g3 but still has his key e4 pawn, whereas black has the awkward pawn on c6) or worse still 4...c5 5. c3 and black won't be able to hold on to those central pawns because of the Qa4+ check. Either way white gets a strong centre and easier development. The correct move for white is either dxe4, which leads to normal Caro-Kann stuff, or the game continuation which is more interesting!"

I played this against a WIM in a tournament once, and eventually got beaten with a tactic. I tried 7. d4 this time as Be4 is no real threat and maybe I can be more flexible in responding to black's attempts to develop. I was expecting something like 7...h5 or 7...nf6 here, because black's main problem is developing the kingside.

I considered  ncd7, rook somewhere, then nxf8 to take away black's castling rights...but decided that black might be safer with the king in the centre (I have no pawn break really, whereas he has h5 to release his rook). I wasn't sure how best to exploit the positional advantage I have, so decided upon Bf5. It makes the rook uncomfortable (although I'm not sure whether it's forced to move immediately or not), develops an important piece while b2 is still protected and gives me another defender on the kingside, which could open up at any time with h5."

I considered the sequence 14. b4 followed by nc5 and a4 to get things rolling. I think it would have been ok, but I would constantly have to calculate what happens after ...h5, to see whether I would have to spend time defending myself. My concern was that black would develop (kicking my knight out first) and then have rook and queen on an open file (after a5), which would force me to castle short and then h5 would be strong. I decided to wait with qe2, which protects b2 (allowing the knight to move) and discourages any weakening of the central pawns. With the king so tied up in the centre there may be some sacrificial opportunities. Note that in the absence of the queen, the back rank mate is possible in some (rather weird) lines."

Of course if 15...h6 then Bxg6 fxg6 and black has a long-term weakness in front of an uncastled king. It should be a quick game after that. I don't know what the computer says (yet) but f6 is probably a necessary move.

I figured that if Nf3 then Be4 and I will have to defend for a while with one knight out of the game. If nd3 then Bxd3 and I still have a good game, but again I'll spend time getting the other knight back in the game and black's kingside is relatively unharmed. The game continuation gives me a few weaknesses to work with, and so I calculated both pawn advances and noticed that there was an interesting positional way to play against the B on f8."

19...gxh5 20. rxh5 rxh5 (forced) 21. qxh5+ and then ...g6 22. qh7+  kf8 leads to a strong position. I think I can probably win by bringing the knight in with 23. nc5 If he takes it with the bishop, then Bd6 will be too strong a weakness. I can also bring the rook to the h-file and up to h7 in true Fischer style! Note that Qb7 is never enough of a threat for him as I have b3 to hold the attack off for a while.
19...gxh5 20. rxh5 rxh5 21. qxh5+ kf8 and I'm doing very well indeed. I don't know how best to continue (probably g6) but there are lots of mating ideas in this and it's hard to bring the pieces back to the defense of the kingside quickly.
