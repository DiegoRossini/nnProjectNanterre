1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I prefer facing e4 to d4.  I have never studied the Siciliian lines; I sometimes play the Caro Cann, but my favorite response is the French defense."
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I think this move is probably good, since black in this position wants to play d5."
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"I think this move is probably good, since black in this position wants to play d5."
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"After this simplification, the position appears equal and white has many possible continuations to consider."

7,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,The board begins to take on the characteristics of a closed game.
8,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/1b1P4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"I am pretty sure this is OK, but maybe just c6 would've been more solid."
9,Bd2,c1d2,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/1b1P4/2N5/PPPB1PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 2 5,"I think this move is a bit passive for white, although it is obviously OK."
10,c6,c7c6,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/2p5/3p4/1b1P4/2N5/PPPB1PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"I think c6 in this position is better than c5, because of nxc6, but maybe there was something else good."
11,Qe2+,d1e2,rnbqk1nr/pp3ppp/2p5/3p4/1b1P4/2N5/PPPBQPPP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 1 6,"I don't like this move for white, but maybe the idea is to prepare O-O-O."
12,Be6,c8e6,rn1qk1nr/pp3ppp/2p1b3/3p4/1b1P4/2N5/PPPBQPPP/R3KBNR w KQkq - 2 7,I think this is better than ne7.
13,a3,a2a3,rn1qk1nr/pp3ppp/2p1b3/3p4/1b1P4/P1N5/1PPBQPPP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 0 7,"A normal move, but maybe bd6 or be7, and black is now better."
14,Bd6,b4d6,rn1qk1nr/pp3ppp/2pbb3/3p4/3P4/P1N5/1PPBQPPP/R3KBNR w KQkq - 1 8,"This move looked threatening at first, because of the weakness on e6.  But I think the attack can be parried, and here I prepare to do so."
15,Nf3,g1f3,rn1qk1nr/pp3ppp/2pbb3/3p4/3P4/P1N2N2/1PPBQPPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 2 8,"This move looked threatening at first, because of the weakness on e6.  But I think the attack can be parried, and here I prepare to do so."

19,Nxe6,g5e6,r3k1nr/pp1n1ppp/2pbNq2/3p4/3P4/P1N5/1PPBQPPP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 0 10,"Although the weakness on e6 persists, I think black is getting a very comfortable position.  White's d-pawn is obviously going to be under fire, and his bishop on f1 is blocked from natural development by the queen.  Maybe f4 would have inhibited e5, and white has to be concerned about f4.  White's priority might be to inhibit e5.  But first, of course, white has to prop up d4."

A glance at the position reveals that white has the bishop pair, which could be considered an advantage.  On the other hand, I have an idea about keeping the board closed, winning f2 (which at present can't be played because of qxe6), getting knights on e4 and c4, and playing e5."
