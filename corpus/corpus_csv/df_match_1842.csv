1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!  At Leslie's request, I am annotating an unrated game in which Les has been playing with his mentor, Etienne.  Etienne, who is in my group, is also being mentored by David Patron.  Anyhow, the opening starts off with wild and woolly opening.  Unfortunately for Les it does not work out, but I am sure we will all learn from what happened after the pseudo-sacrifice on f7.  We start off with a double king pawn opening which is 1. e4 e5."
