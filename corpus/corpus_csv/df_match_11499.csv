1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Ah, so here I am, playing a game I predicted that I'd lose against acrewboy02. At only -5.7 for a loss, I kinda decided ""Ah what the hell! It'll be fun."" And it was; We chatted the entire game and I'd like to think that I did reasonably well, but awesome knightplay on his part (And one hell of a pawn) cost me the game. I look forward to playing him again soon! Rawrs!!
Standard opening for me."
