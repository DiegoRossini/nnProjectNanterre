1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I was White in this game where I pawnstormed my opponent.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"This is the most logical response, but symmetry is usually favorable to the side with the tempo. The Sicilian Defense (1...c5) is the best way to try for an advantage as Black."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,The most logical move. I develop a kingside piece while attacking a pawn in the centre.
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"This is the Ruy Lopez, or Spanish Opening. I develop my bishop to the most active square."
5,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,"This is the Ruy Lopez, or Spanish Opening. I develop my bishop to the most active square."
6,Nd4,c6d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/1B2p3/3nP3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,"Supposedly this is advantageous to White, but this move avoids the well analyzed main lines of the Ruy Lopez. Instead, Black accepts doubled pawns and a kingside pawn minority, in order to leave my bishop on an unimportant diagonal, and Black will usually have more experience in this opening than a normal Ruy-Lopez Player."
7,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/1B2p3/3NP3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,"Now there are a lot of imbalances in the position. I am ahead in development and have a kingside pawn majority, but Black may be able to gain tempo chasing my bishop. There are a few common plan choices here. One is to ignore my bishop and play O-O and c3, taking advantage of Black's weak pawn by trying to trade it for a flank pawn, strengthening my pawn centre. A more passive, but safer plan is to play c4 and Qe2, which greatly increases my control of the light squares and makes Black's development more difficult. The plan I chose was the only one I thought would bring me an advantage."

9,f4,f2f4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/1B6/3pPP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"My plan was to take advantage of my kingside pawn majority, and storm Black's kingside before he has a chance to finish developing. Although my plan probably could've been more promising if I'd played c4 first, keeping my bishop on the a4-e8 diagonal."
10,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/1Bb5/3pPP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 6,It's hard for Black to find active moves in this position. I thought Nf6 was his best try.
11,Qf3,d1f3,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/8/1Bb5/3pPP2/5Q2/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 2 6,"Since my knight no longer needs f3, it is free for my queen."
12,a6,a7a6,r1bqk1nr/1ppp1ppp/p7/1Bb5/3pPP2/5Q2/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 7,Black questions my oddly placed bishop.
13,Be2,b5e2,r1bqk1nr/1ppp1ppp/p7/2b5/3pPP2/5Q2/PPPPB1PP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 1 7,"If I'd played c4 earlier, I wouldn't have to retreat like this."
14,d6,d7d6,r1bqk1nr/1pp2ppp/p2p4/2b5/3pPP2/5Q2/PPPPB1PP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 8,I stop annoying d3  threats if I castle.
15,d3,d2d3,r1bqk1nr/1pp2ppp/p2p4/2b5/3pPP2/3P1Q2/PPP1B1PP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 8,I stop annoying d3  threats if I castle.
16,c6,c7c6,r1bqk1nr/1p3ppp/p1pp4/2b5/3pPP2/3P1Q2/PPP1B1PP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 9,"Black is playing passively, while I already have plans of storming the kingside."
17,O-O,e1g1,r1bqk1nr/1p3ppp/p1pp4/2b5/3pPP2/3P1Q2/PPP1B1PP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 1 9,Intending a g4 boost.

21,g4,g2g4,r1bq1rk1/1p3ppp/p1pp1n2/2b5/3pPPP1/3P1Q1P/PPP1B3/RNB2RK1 b - - 0 11,Black can't do much in this position. A common result of playing the opening too passively.
