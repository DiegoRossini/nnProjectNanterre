3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Even today, this is considered the best move after 1 P-Q4 is answered by 1... P-Q4. In his classic book ""Ideas About The Chess Openings,"" Dr. Reuben Fine called it ""essential from a theoretical point of view."""
4,dxc4,d5c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2pP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"The best way to get freedom for Black's pieces. If the gambit is declined, Black finds himself in a very cramped state, especially with the Orthodox Defense. The drawback is the disunity of the Pawn structure and the danger of White being able to seize the center with the thrust P-K4."

10,Bd7,c8d7,rn1qkbnr/p2bpppp/2p5/1p6/P1pP4/4PN2/1P3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,"Very conservative, and blocks the QN. I would prefer 5... B-N5, pinning the White KN."
11,Ne5,f3e5,rn1qkbnr/p2bpppp/2p5/1p2N3/P1pP4/4P3/1P3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 6,"Taking advantage by centralizing the Knight, which cannot be driven [6... P-KB3? 7 Q-R5 ch P-N3 8 NxNP PxN 9 QxR winning the Exchange.]"
