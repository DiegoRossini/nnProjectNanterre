It seems a normal move, and it is playable, but you must know about what are you giving up: the possibility to play c5 at some point, unless the knight goes away, and it won't be easy..."

5,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3p4/3P1B2/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 3 3,"Passive, and completely useless, since no threat for white to have a piece there for a couple of moves. Even doing so, it is not dangerous for black. BUT I understand that those were things I couldn't see were I was a beginner (and I still am, for sure!)."

7,Nbd2,b1d2,r1bqkbnr/1pp1pppp/p1n5/3p4/3P1B2/5N2/PPPNPPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"This seems passive, but white is just following a good scheme, don't blocking the c pawn in sight of c4. (White is not going for this, but black can't know at the moment)."
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/1pp1pppp/p1n2n2/3p4/3P1B2/5N2/PPPNPPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,"This kind of passive developement by white aims to a game that can ""explode"" very easily if black omits some ""surprise moves"". It is defendable, for sure, but with great care."
9,e3,e2e3,r1bqkb1r/1pp1pppp/p1n2n2/3p4/3P1B2/4PN2/PPPN1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"This kind of passive developement by white aims to a game that can ""explode"" very easily if black omits some ""surprise moves"". It is defendable, for sure, but with great care."
10,e6,e7e6,r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1n1pn2/3p4/3P1B2/4PN2/PPPN1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"This is a mistake, as it is doesn't seem to be. Black already gave up the c5 advance, and now gives up the square f5 to his lsb. The possibility to play Bf5 by black is assured, for the moment, by the a3 pawn, that avoids Bb4 by white. So, Bf5 could have been at least coherent with a3. I understand that black wants to shield himself, but this strategy seldom works, and you have to be very, very good to play for that."
11,Ne5,f3e5,r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p1n1pn2/3pN3/3P1B2/4P3/PPPN1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"Inviting an exchange, since black thinks that allowing NxN by white would debilitate his pawns, so he has to defend with Bd7, and this allows white to play NxB, something you would normally avoid. But this is not the case: Bd2 was a good move, since the white bishop is caged in (unless black wants to try a queenside pawnstorm), so it is less important than the well placed white knight."
12,Nxe5,c6e5,r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p3pn2/3pn3/3P1B2/4P3/PPPN1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"this seems harmless, but see:"
13,dxe5,d4e5,r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p3pn2/3pP3/5B2/4P3/PPPN1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"If white exchanges the knight, the pawn wall in the center would be a headache for both players, but white's queenside will reveal all its weakness, since the dsb is caged kinside. No, white doesn't have to wait for that: it is very important now white takes the initiative in a rather surprising way:"

16,Nxd2,e4d2,r1bqkb1r/1pp2ppp/p3p3/3pP3/5BQ1/4P3/PPPn1PPP/R3KB1R w KQkq - 0 9,"This makes black happy: his knight found its fate, but with the honour of having put the white king on an exposed center. And he is completely right: white is probably doomed here, but... let's my opponent to demostrate it."

Of course, I expected c5 (finally!), with the idea of c4, but I can defend with c4 first... a tricky position. As you can see, in two moves the firework started."
