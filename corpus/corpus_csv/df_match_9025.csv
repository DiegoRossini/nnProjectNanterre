1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,The Trompowsky Attack!  Unusual but perfectly okay.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,The Trompowsky Attack!  Unusual but perfectly okay.
3,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/6B1/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 2 2,The Trompowsky Attack!  Unusual but perfectly okay.
4,h6,h7h6,rnbqkb1r/ppppppp1/5n1p/6B1/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"?!  Not as good as the normal responses: Ne4, e6, or d5.  Still, this forces white to decide what to do with the bishop."
5,Bh4,g5h4,rnbqkb1r/ppppppp1/5n1p/8/3P3B/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"I decide to develop my kingside aggressively.  Perhaps Bg7, d6, and Bf5 are in the cards for me, leading to an interesting kingside presence and then most likely Nd7 and a queenside castle."
6,g5,g7g5,rnbqkb1r/pppppp2/5n1p/6p1/3P3B/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"I decide to develop my kingside aggressively.  Perhaps Bg7, d6, and Bf5 are in the cards for me, leading to an interesting kingside presence and then most likely Nd7 and a queenside castle."
7,Bg3,h4g3,rnbqkb1r/pppppp2/5n1p/6p1/3P4/6B1/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,?!  Wasting time to go after the bishop when I know I should be playing either Bg7 or d6 (or even d5).
8,Ne4,f6e4,rnbqkb1r/pppppp2/7p/6p1/3Pn3/6B1/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 2 5,?!  Wasting time to go after the bishop when I know I should be playing either Bg7 or d6 (or even d5).
9,Be5,g3e5,rnbqkb1r/pppppp2/7p/4B1p1/3Pn3/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 3 5,Also not a very strong move; sure it threatens the rook but white should be developing his pieces.
10,f6,f7f6,rnbqkb1r/ppppp3/5p1p/4B1p1/3Pn3/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,?!  This isn't a very good move; it exposes black's kingside significantly.  Better was Nf6 or Rg8.
11,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/ppppp3/5p1p/4B1p1/3Pn3/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,"Such an innocuous move, when the only thing I had considered at this point was 6. Bg3 Nxg3 where white has a disrupted pawn structure and black can begin development."
12,fxe5,f6e5,rnbqkb1r/ppppp3/7p/4p1p1/3Pn3/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,??  Loses immediately.  A stupid capture that shows my blindness.  Why?
13,Qh5#,d1h5,rnbqkb1r/ppppp3/7p/4p1pQ/3Pn3/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN2KBNR b KQkq - 1 7,"Augh!  It's like Fool's Mate, and I fell for it!  Merry Christmas, NN."
