1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Dmaestro decides to setup a defensive bastion behind the Pric defence. I have not
2,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I was fully expecting 1. ...c5 or 1. ...e5 but not this because this is too slow and allows white to build his ideal center.
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,!? this is not very common for a good reason. Best are 2. ...Nf6 or 2. ...g6

6,c6,c7c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1npppp/2pp4/8/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,Despite black's lack of commitment in the center he is doing very well. His pawn structure is flexible rady to meet every threat from white in the center. Black lack of development is a small issue but he still has time to resolve that problem. In short the game is roughly equal.
