12,exd4,e5d4,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1Bb5/3pP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 0 7,I thought it was best to take otherwise I would lose the exchange.
13,cxd4,c3d4,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/1Bb5/3PP3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 0 7,Moved my bishop to safety.

16,Nd5,f6d5,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/1bn5/1B1nP3/3P4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 1 9,White pushes pawn to a4 and at this point each side was about equal.

18,h6,h7h6,r1bq1rk1/pppp1pp1/1bn4p/1B1nP3/P2P4/5N2/1P3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 0 10,Blunder number 1.  I thought h6 helped block certain threats I was anticipating.  However....on the other side of the board white had other ideas...
19,Bxc6,b5c6,r1bq1rk1/pppp1pp1/1bB4p/3nP3/P2P4/5N2/1P3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 0 10,I'm not sure if I used the right pawn to take here.  My thoughts at the time were that it keeps the pawns grouped together and opens up my bishop.  However the weakness is that I have no center pawns and white has two.
20,dxc6,d7c6,r1bq1rk1/ppp2pp1/1bp4p/3nP3/P2P4/5N2/1P3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 0 11,I'm not sure if I used the right pawn to take here.  My thoughts at the time were that it keeps the pawns grouped together and opens up my bishop.  However the weakness is that I have no center pawns and white has two.
21,a5,a4a5,r1bq1rk1/ppp2pp1/1bp4p/P2nP3/3P4/5N2/1P3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b - - 0 11,This is why my earlier move h6 was a blunder.  Instead I should have pushed my a7 pawn to a5 to protect my bishop that has now become trapped!
22,Bxa5,b6a5,r1bq1rk1/ppp2pp1/2p4p/b2nP3/3P4/5N2/1P3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w - - 0 12,"Here, I see an opportunity to attack the pawn and bring my queen in to the game."

28,Bf5,c8f5,r4rk1/ppp3p1/2p2q1p/R2nNb2/3P4/8/1P3PPP/1NBQ1RK1 w - - 2 15,"I attack an unprotected knight and develop my bishop.  I think a much better move would have been to attack the rook on a5, following up with attacking whites central pawn - I was planning to do this after developing the bishop but white had something else in mind and I lost the opportunity."
29,Nc3,b1c3,r4rk1/ppp3p1/2p2q1p/R2nNb2/3P4/2N5/1P3PPP/2BQ1RK1 b - - 3 15,I'm down in material and an exchange of knights would worsen my situation from this position.
30,Ne7,d5e7,r4rk1/ppp1n1p1/2p2q1p/R3Nb2/3P4/2N5/1P3PPP/2BQ1RK1 w - - 4 16,I think a better move would have been to attack the rook and central pawn by pushing my pawns up.
31,Qb3+,d1b3,r4rk1/ppp1n1p1/2p2q1p/R3Nb2/3P4/1QN5/1P3PPP/2B2RK1 b - - 5 16,"Check - another issue with losing my central pawn!  Additionally, if I attacked the Rook earlier with my b7 pawn I would have prevented the queen fork!  I didn't attack the rook because I thought it could too easily get out of trouble, and pushing the pawn up one square seemed insignificant at the time.  Whilst I was keeping at eye out for whites queen I was expecting it to come across to my kings side...not the other way!"
32,Kh7,g8h7,r4r2/ppp1n1pk/2p2q1p/R3Nb2/3P4/1QN5/1P3PPP/2B2RK1 w - - 6 17,Now I have lost my b7 pawn I no longer have a good opportunity to attack whites central pawn.

35,Re1,f1e1,r1r5/pQp1n1pk/2p2q1p/R3Nb2/3P4/2N5/1P3PPP/2B1R1K1 b - - 2 18,Here I moved the Knight to g6 hoping white may exchange.  My strategy was to get my Queen on g6 and then my Bishop on h3 threatening white King.
