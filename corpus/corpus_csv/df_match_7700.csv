1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Here is an interesting game between freddy and I.  Through White's 15th move, the moves were predetermined.  I was playing against freddy in another game and began discussing another one of my games that had just ended (http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=12254551&fb=1&rnd=0.7325155933749681).  I mentioned that I had blundered a piece in a game and that I eventually resigned as the game became ""hopeless.""  Freddy asked if I would like to replay that game from the point where I first blundered, only he would take Black (I was Black in the original game) and I would take White (essentially Freddy is spotting me a Knight).  I accepted for two reasons--I knew the game would be a learning experience and for a brief time, I had a material lead over freddy.  [freddy gets credit for naming this game]"
