24,e5,e6e5,r1bq1rk1/1p3ppp/p4n2/4p3/3b4/PB6/1PP1NPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 0 13,I should have retreated my bishop because I might need him later in the game since it is an open game.

30,Raxd8,a8d8,3r1rk1/1p3ppp/pb3n2/4p1B1/6b1/PBP5/1P2NPPP/R4RK1 w - - 0 16,In hindsight I should have taken back with the bishop because he can take my knight and double up my pawns on the kingside
31,Ng3,e2g3,3r1rk1/1p3ppp/pb3n2/4p1B1/6b1/PBP3N1/1P3PPP/R4RK1 b - - 1 16,first he must find a safe square for his knight.

36,Kg7,g8g7,3r1r2/1p3pk1/pb3p1p/4p3/4N1b1/PBP5/1P3PPP/R4RK1 w - - 2 19,I try defending both pawns with my king.
