1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,At the time I was experimenting with the Queens pawn game so I started with d4 as opposed to my usual e4.
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,The common response d5 followed.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,I really enjoy the queen's gambit and it's positional perks.
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"Black responds with e6, which I think is a little weaker than c6 based on my experience."
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,As opposed to the usual Nc3 I developed the other knight first. My general strategy for this game was to attack the king-side strongly ready to strike with force if black decides to castle short.
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,Black brings his knight up adding defense on the attacked d5 square while eyeing the e4 as a possible resting spot.
7,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 3 4,Advancing aggressively to the king-side with the bishop. Pinning pieces is always nice.
8,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 4 5,"Black brakes the pin getting ready to castle short, which I liked since that is where I'm applying the most pressure so I knew it was going to be a fun game."
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 5 5,I developed the other knight attacking the center.
10,c6,c7c6,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/2p1pn2/3p2B1/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Black further defends his d-pawn with c6, which I think was kind of an unnecessary move at this point as the pawn was already defended by the knight and the queen. Was black possibly thinking of Qa5 to attack queen-side and pin my knight? This move also blocks his knight from coming to c6 so it really is a rather defensive move."
11,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/2p1pn2/3P2B1/3P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"I attack the center now just for the sake of being aggressive and opening the center I guess, but I'm not really proud of this move. Black's last move made sure that he could establish a solid center structure by taking with the c-pawn. So basically I attacked his strong point allowing him to open up the queen-side. Does anyone have any thoughts on what you had played here and why?"
12,exd5,e6d5,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/2p2n2/3p2B1/3P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"I was surprised to see black didn't utilize his c-pawn here, but instead took with the e-pawn giving me the advantage in central pawns. This move makes way for his bishop possibly coming to g4 getting ready to pin the knight or f5 to attack my queen-side."
13,e3,e2e3,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/2p2n2/3p2B1/3P4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,To open way for the bishop and the queen. The bishop is getting ready to go to d3 so I could maybe play Qc2 later. I decided not to worry about the possible Bg4 as black couldn't really capitalize on the pin.
14,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/2p2n2/3p2B1/3P4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 1 8,Black castles so my strategy to attack king-side stays the same . Anticipating Nd7 or Bf5.
15,Bd3,f1d3,rnbq1rk1/pp2bppp/2p2n2/3p2B1/3P4/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 2 8,Developing the bishop as planned.
16,b5,b7b5,rnbq1rk1/p3bppp/2p2n2/1p1p2B1/3P4/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 9,Black decides to push his queen-side pawns early in the game. I'm not worried about him kicking my knight with b4 because I want it to get to king-side anyway. So I can still focus on the attack.
17,Ne5,f3e5,rnbq1rk1/p3bppp/2p2n2/1p1pN1B1/3P4/2NBP3/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 1 9,"Found a nice place for my knight because white hadn't played Nd7 yet. Attacks the c6-pawn forcing Black's knight to defend it for now. Bring knights to the center, amirite?"
18,b4,b5b4,rnbq1rk1/p3bppp/2p2n2/3pN1B1/1p1P4/2NBP3/PP3PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 10,Black advances with the b-pawn kicking the knight. Only one sensible square to go.
19,Ne2,c3e2,rnbq1rk1/p3bppp/2p2n2/3pN1B1/1p1P4/3BP3/PP2NPPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 1 10,Reinforcements for the king-side. Black blocks his queen and bishop from checking so I don't really have to worry about my kings safety yet. Optimal position for an aggressive attack.
20,h6,h7h6,rnbq1rk1/p3bpp1/2p2n1p/3pN1B1/1p1P4/3BP3/PP2NPPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 11,"Black moves his h-pawn out of danger of the possible Qc2 and harasses my bishop, so the bishop has to move...f4 or h4? Which one would you choose? Or would you rather like to take out Black's knight on f6?"
