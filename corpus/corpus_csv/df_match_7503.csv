1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Already something a little unusual: the Trompowski Attack.  This can lead to some very weird and tactical positions (I've played it once on GK myself, and had the Black pieces on one other occasion)."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"Already something a little unusual: the Trompowski Attack.  This can lead to some very weird and tactical positions (I've played it once on GK myself, and had the Black pieces on one other occasion)."
3,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/6B1/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 2 2,"Already something a little unusual: the Trompowski Attack.  This can lead to some very weird and tactical positions (I've played it once on GK myself, and had the Black pieces on one other occasion)."
4,Ne4,f6e4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/6B1/3Pn3/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 3 3,Not the most popular choice (3.Bf4) but playable and interesting.
5,Bh4,g5h4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/8/8/3Pn2B/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 4 3,Not the most popular choice (3.Bf4) but playable and interesting.
6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3Pn2B/8/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Among other possibilities 3...g5 leads to unusual and interesting positions.  It is quite playable, as is the game continuation."
7,e3,e2e3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3Pn2B/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"(!?) OK, but more usual is 4.f3, driving off the knight."
8,c5,c7c5,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/3Pn2B/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"Also good here was 4...g5, seeking to exploit White omission of 4.f3.  Whether Black gets much of an advantage thereby is moot."
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/3Pn2B/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,Clearly going after the b-pawn.  How should White respond?
10,Qb6,d8b6,rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/1q6/2pp4/3Pn2B/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,Clearly going after the b-pawn.  How should White respond?
11,Na3,b1a3,rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/1q6/2pp4/3Pn2B/N3PN2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 3 6,"(!?) Inviting the capture, and intending to derive some advantage from the knight's further move to b5.  An alternative was 6.b3, but White's choice is much more interesting."
12,Qxb2,b6b2,rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/3Pn2B/N3PN2/PqP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"Boldly carrying forward his own scheme.  Now, not for nothing is the b2-pawn called a poisoned pawn (as in the Poisoned Pawn Variation in the Najdorf Sicilian).  I don't know how many games I've won when an opponent has snatched my b-pawn ('...and welcomes little fishes in/ with gently smiling jaws').  However, here White has no way to round up Black's Queen.  What alternative compensation can he seek?"
13,Nb5,a3b5,rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/8/1Npp4/3Pn2B/4PN2/PqP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 7,"Threatens 8.Nc7+, but the move also has the effect of cutting off, for the time being, the Black queen's retreat to safety."
14,Qb4+,b2b4,rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/8/1Npp4/1q1Pn2B/4PN2/P1P2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 8,(!) Best to haul one's bunns outta there at once.  The check gives Black a tempo to bring the Queen to a5 betimes.
15,c3,c2c3,rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/8/1Npp4/1q1Pn2B/2P1PN2/P4PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,(?!) Now White gets into a spot of bother.  Better was 8.Nd2.
16,Nxc3,e4c3,rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/8/1Npp4/1q1P3B/2n1PN2/P4PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 9,"(!?) Looks obvious and plausible, but this leads to surprising complications.  Simpler was 8...Qa5, whereat Black makes off with his booty."
17,Nxc3,b5c3,rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/1q1P3B/2N1PN2/P4PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 9,"Forgoing the threats aimed at c7.  An alternative was 9.a3 and Black has no useful discovered check.  If then 9.a3 Qa5? 10.Qd2, White gets the edge on account of the pin at c3.  So Black would probably have to bury the queen once more deep in White's Q-side: 9.a3 Qb2 (threatening 10...Nxb5 as well as 10...Nxd1) 10.Qc1 Qxc1+ 11.Rxc1 Nxb5 with an even (and much less interesting) game."
18,Qxc3+,b4c3,rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/3P3B/2q1PN2/P4PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 10,"Two extra pawns ahead for the moment, Black has the advantage. But..."
19,Nd2,f3d2,rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/3P3B/2q1P3/P2N1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 10,"Two extra pawns ahead for the moment, Black has the advantage. But..."
20,cxd4,c5d4,rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/8/3p4/3p3B/2q1P3/P2N1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 11,"(?!) Overlooking White's reply.  Instead, 10...c4 might have been worth a look, seeking to exploit his Q-side majority."
21,Rc1,a1c1,rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/8/3p4/3p3B/2q1P3/P2N1PPP/2RQKB1R b Kkq - 1 11,(!) Skewering the Queen against the loose c8-bishop.  What can Black do about it?
22,Qa5,c3a5,rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/8/q2p4/3p3B/4P3/P2N1PPP/2RQKB1R w Kkq - 2 12,"(!?) Now Black loses a bishop, and White emerges with a big edge.  As it transpires, Black did have an effective and tactical way of containing the damage, but it's not at all easy to find: The spectacular 11...Bg4!! retains for Black a slight edge: 12.Bb5+! Kd8 13.Rxc3 Bxd1 14.Rc5 dxe3 15.Rxd5+ Kc8 16.Kxd1 exd2 17.Kxd2... Black still would have had his two-pawn plus, but White's active position would have made up for at least some of that material differential."
23,Rxc8+,c1c8,rnR1kb1r/pp2pppp/8/q2p4/3p3B/4P3/P2N1PPP/3QKB1R b Kkq - 0 12,(!) Good follow up.
24,Kd7,e8d7,rnR2b1r/pp1kpppp/8/q2p4/3p3B/4P3/P2N1PPP/3QKB1R w K - 1 13,(!) Good follow up.
25,Qg4+,d1g4,rnR2b1r/pp1kpppp/8/q2p4/3p2QB/4P3/P2N1PPP/4KB1R b K - 2 13,(!) Good follow up.
26,e6,e7e6,rnR2b1r/pp1k1ppp/4p3/q2p4/3p2QB/4P3/P2N1PPP/4KB1R w K - 0 14,"Consolidating his ill-gotten gains.  But White could have played 14.Rd8+ and Black would have had seriously to think about 14...Qxd8 so strong would White's attack have been (14...Kc7 15.Qe4+; 14...Kc6 15.e4!).  Still, the text move is sensible enough."
27,Rc2,c8c2,rn3b1r/pp1k1ppp/4p3/q2p4/3p2QB/4P3/P1RN1PPP/4KB1R b K - 1 14,"Consolidating his ill-gotten gains.  But White could have played 14.Rd8+ and Black would have had seriously to think about 14...Qxd8 so strong would White's attack have been (14...Kc7 15.Qe4+; 14...Kc6 15.e4!).  Still, the text move is sensible enough."
28,dxe3,d4e3,rn3b1r/pp1k1ppp/4p3/q2p4/6QB/4p3/P1RN1PPP/4KB1R w K - 0 15,"Developing with ideas of counterattack.  However, as 16.Qxg7 was probably very good for White, maybe 15...Nc6 was the better option."
29,fxe3,f2e3,rn3b1r/pp1k1ppp/4p3/q2p4/6QB/4P3/P1RN2PP/4KB1R b K - 0 15,"Developing with ideas of counterattack.  However, as 16.Qxg7 was probably very good for White, maybe 15...Nc6 was the better option."
