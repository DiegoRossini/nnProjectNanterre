18,Nxe4,f6e4,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/2p5/3P4/2P1nP2/1QP5/P5PP/R1B1KBNR w KQ - 0 10,The natural recapture centralizes the Knight beautifully.

22,Nxg3,e4g3,rnb2rk1/pp3ppp/2p5/3P4/2P2P1q/1QPB2n1/P6P/R1B1K1NR w KQ - 0 12,"Threatening 12... NxR dis ch. The trapped Rook cannot flee, so von Scheve tries..."
23,Nf3,g1f3,rnb2rk1/pp3ppp/2p5/3P4/2P2P1q/1QPB1Nn1/P6P/R1B1K2R b KQ - 1 12,"...this move, hoping to drive the Q."
24,Qh5,h4h5,rnb2rk1/pp3ppp/2p5/3P3q/2P2P2/1QPB1Nn1/P6P/R1B1K2R w KQ - 2 13,Tarrasch retains the initiative by attacking the unguarded Knight.
