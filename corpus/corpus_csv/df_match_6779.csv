5,b3,b2b3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/1P6/P1PP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"A horrible move. The correct move is 3 N-KB3, preventing once and for all Q-R5ch."
6,Qh4+,d8h4,rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp1q/1P6/P1PP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,Goetz takes immediate advantage.
7,g3,g2g3,rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp1q/1P4P1/P1PP3P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"White has no good moves. K-K2 offers possibilities of fleeing to the Q-side [K-Q3 and K-B3], but White wouldn't last long with that move either. His King would be at the mercy of Black's pieces."
8,fxg3,f4g3,rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4P2q/1P4p1/P1PP3P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,Threatening a nasty discovered check. If White tries PxP Goetz will simply take the unprotected KR.
9,h3,h2h3,rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4P2q/1P4pP/P1PP4/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,As good or bad as anything else.

11,Ke2,e1e2,rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4P2q/1P5P/P1PPK1p1/RNBQ1BNR b kq - 1 6,Forced.

14,gxh1=N#,g2h1n,rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4q3/1P5P/P1PP1K2/RNBQ1BNn w kq - 0 8,"Calling for a second chess set, as he wishes to borrow a Black Knight, and also calling, ""Checkmate!"" Well done, Mr. Goetz."
