14,Qxe4,e7e4,rnb1kb1r/ppp3pp/5p2/3p4/4q3/5N2/PPP1QPPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 8,I didn't expect black to be so willing to trade queens when he is behind in material. Developing the knight with an attack against black's queen almost forces the queen back (white gains a tempo) or to exchange queens - either of which favors white.
