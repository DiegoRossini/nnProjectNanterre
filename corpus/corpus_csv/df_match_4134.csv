1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Here I present my very first tournament annotation. I hope you enjoy it.
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I have never played anyone who has a responce ...e6? But it seems quite normal, since lots of people play e5."
3,d3,d2d3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,This move blocks white's LSB but supports the e4 pawn. Normal.
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/4P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,I usally play e5 after this move. Black is pushing some pressure onto white's e-pawn.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/4P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"The e4 pawn is attacked twice, and defended twice, and after ...dxe4, dxe4 Nxe4, Nxe4 and white would win. So Nf6 might not have been the best move to play."
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/4P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"The e4 pawn is attacked twice, and defended twice, and after ...dxe4, dxe4 Nxe4, Nxe4 and white would win. So Nf6 might not have been the best move to play."
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 4,"!? I personally wouldn't play this move, I would play Bg5. But since black has just covered the e5 square, d4 stops Nxe5 after e5. So I agree with both sides, and think this is just a normal move."
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/3p4/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 4 5,"!? I personally wouldn't play this move, I would play Bg5. But since black has just covered the e5 square, d4 stops Nxe5 after e5. So I agree with both sides, and think this is just a normal move."
9,d4,d3d4,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/3p4/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"!? I personally wouldn't play this move, I would play Bg5. But since black has just covered the e5 square, d4 stops Nxe5 after e5. So I agree with both sides, and think this is just a normal move."
10,Ng4,f6g4,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/3p4/3PP1n1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,White might play h3 (which is what I normally do) and chase the knight away.
11,exd5,e4d5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/3P4/3P2n1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"!? I don't think this is the right time to play this move. If white is lucky, and if black plays Bd7, then that would be the right time to capture."
12,exd5,e6d5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/3p4/3P2n1/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,Now the e-file is clear.
13,Qe2+,d1e2,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n5/3p4/3P2n1/2N2N2/PPP1QPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 1 7,"? This move blocks his LSB and if black plays Qe7 (which is not very likely, after Qe7, Nxd5 wins a pawn), then both queens are pinned!"
14,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/2n5/3p4/3P2n1/2N2N2/PPP1QPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 2 8,This is the correct way the answer the check. Next move might be O-O.
15,Ne5,f3e5,r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/2n5/3pN3/3P2n1/2N5/PPP1QPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 3 8,"? This is another knight fork. Black has to capture with one of his knights, and the queen puts threat on the g4-knight. But black can play Nxd4, and that threatens the white queen, and the fork on c2, and if Qd2/Qd3, black would win by playing Nxe5!"
16,Nxd4,c6d4,r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/8/3pN3/3n2n1/2N5/PPP1QPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 0 9,"!! Now black has multiple threats. Id Nxg4, tgeb Bxe2 and black wins. If Qxg4, Nxc2+, Kd1, Nxa1 wins. But if Qd3, Nxe5 wins a pawn (since after Qxd4, Nc6 and black ends up a pawn ahead."
17,Qd3,e2d3,r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/8/3pN3/3n2n1/2NQ4/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 1 9,"At the moment this is the best thing that white could do defending black's threat. White is only a pawn down, but this may cause problems in the endgame."
18,Nxe5,g4e5,r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/8/3pn3/3n4/2NQ4/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 0 10,"The black knight does not need to move, as Bd6 is ok."
19,Qxd4,d3d4,r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/8/3pn3/3Q4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 10,"The black knight does not need to move, as Bd6 is ok."
20,Bf6,e7f6,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/5b2/3pn3/3Q4/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 1 11,"!! White's queen needs to move despratley. Bb5+ c6, Be2 Nf3+ check wins due to a discovered atack! If cxf3, Bxd4 wins!"
21,Qxd5,d4d5,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/5b2/3Qn3/8/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 11,"! Black did not notice this move, and now the position is equal, nobody is winning at the moment. This move earns back a pawn, because Nxd4 fails to Nf3, cxf3, Bxd4 winning a queen for a knight."
22,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/5b2/3Qn3/8/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ - 1 12,"!? Black could take with Qxd4 easily, but O-O shelters the king. As the queen is protected, I think this move is not a blunder."
23,Be2,f1e2,r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/5b2/3Qn3/8/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 2 12,"!? Getting ready to castle, eh? Why not take with Qxd8? Should white play Qxd8 here or not?"
24,Be6,c8e6,r2q1rk1/ppp2ppp/4bb2/3Qn3/8/2N5/PPP1BPPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 3 13,"? Carless, white can now play Qxb7, winning a pawn. Even though black's two bishops are standing guard, black will lose a pawn, but after Qxb8, Rb8, Qe4, black wins a tempo while white wins a pawn, and white clears the b-file."
