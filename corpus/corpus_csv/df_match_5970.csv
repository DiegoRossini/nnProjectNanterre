1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,I think I told someone on our team to avoid the four knights defence. It is boring and almost always leads to a draw. However if you have to play it here is an instructive way to defeat it as black. The key is to 1. avoid symetry 2. gain space and create open lines that your pieces can move along. 3. Be patient and wait for your opponent to make a mistake.

However as it turns out I missed something pretty big!

12,Bxc3,b4c3,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/1B2p3/4P3/2bP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,! a great move that removes a key defender of e4 and takes away any ideas of Nd5 plus it supports my idea of play f7-f5 in the future. Because white will have to defend e4 with the rook which will not be easy to do
