2,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,The GK database refers to this as the Anglo-Dutch defence
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"Knight development, reinforcing the control over d5"

7,d4,d2d4,rn1qkbnr/pbppp1pp/1p6/5p2/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"Since Black, in the last four moves, has decided against grabbing the centre, White is more than happy to do so himself"

10,Bxf3,b7f3,rn1qkb1r/p1ppp1pp/1p3n2/5p2/2PP4/2N2bP1/PP2PP1P/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"?! This doubles the pawns and blocks the h1-a8 diagonal...but the problem is, a) White can unblock the diagonal all too easily and b) exchanging a fianchettoed bishop for a knight may not have been the best course of action"
11,exf3,e2f3,rn1qkb1r/p1ppp1pp/1p3n2/5p2/2PP4/2N2PP1/PP3P1P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,the promised pawn to d5... but I remember thinking at this point that I was already not liking Black's position
