1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

I am playing in Master Chrisobee's MT Love Conquers all and I found myself in a game where I grabbed a pawn and walked into a knight fork, losing my knight for two pawns.  However, I got a lot of play for that deficit thanks to my KR and Glenda.  I somehow managed to regain my piece with interest and Jo and I ended up in a K & P ending with me increasing that two pawn advantage into a 4 pawn advantage.  Jo tried to play for a stalemate but I was having none of it.  I carefully calculated at the end that I had a forced mate in 8 and announced it to my opponent who then resigned on the grounds of Unavoidable Mate.  Here is how it all happened.  Here is the Gameknot Analysis version of this game which started off as a Petrov's Defense.  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=16936623&rnd=0.6334171524199531"
