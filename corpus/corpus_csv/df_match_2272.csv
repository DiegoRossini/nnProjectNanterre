1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I open with Queens pawn d4.
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,He opens with e6
3,e3,e2e3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"I play e3  to back up d4.I also do this to start my control of middle and develope my pieces.Also i have been studying about pawn chains.I am trying to learn how to do this in conjunction with my ""face pieces"""
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3P4/4P3/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,He plays d5 blocking my d4 pawn we are trying to develope middle.
5,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3P1P2/4P3/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"I bring out f4 this way i have e5 covered with ""crossfire"" from d4 and f4.I also have c5 and g5 covered."
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3P1P2/4P3/PPP3PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,He plays Nf6.With this move  i think he will bring out his other knight on his next move.I see that my g4 and e4 are probably in danger.If he makes it to these squares i believe it could be diasterous for me.But on the otherhand such a move would probably be bad for him because he is to far from backup
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3P1P2/2N1P3/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 4,"I play Nc3.With this move i develope more and cover e4,b5,and a4.This move also helps me take more control  of my left."
8,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/3P1P2/2N1P3/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 3 5,"He moves Be7.I think moving on out to Bb4,Bc5 or Bd6 would have been better for him."
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/3P1P2/2N1PN2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 4 5,I bring my other cowboy into play.I believe with this move i am way ahead of him on developement
10,Bd7,c8d7,rn1qk2r/pppbbppp/4pn2/3p4/3P1P2/2N1PN2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 5 6,He moves to Bd7.I believe he does this hoping to attack me on left with his Bishops
11,Qd3,d1d3,rn1qk2r/pppbbppp/4pn2/3p4/3P1P2/2NQPN2/PPP3PP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 6 6,I bring my Lady to dance.I think i need to work on bringing her out later in games after i have developed my other face pieces.But later this early move pays off
12,Nc6,b8c6,r2qk2r/pppbbppp/2n1pn2/3p4/3P1P2/2NQPN2/PPP3PP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 7 7,He now brings in his other cowboy.
13,Bd2,c1d2,r2qk2r/pppbbppp/2n1pn2/3p4/3P1P2/2NQPN2/PPPB2PP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 8 7,He castles here.
14,O-O,e8g8,r2q1rk1/pppbbppp/2n1pn2/3p4/3P1P2/2NQPN2/PPPB2PP/R3KB1R w KQ - 9 8,He castles here.
15,Ng5,f3g5,r2q1rk1/pppbbppp/2n1pn2/3p2N1/3P1P2/2NQP3/PPPB2PP/R3KB1R b KQ - 10 8,I move Ng5 i feel there is a weak spot here.
16,Ng4,f6g4,r2q1rk1/pppbbppp/2n1p3/3p2N1/3P1Pn1/2NQP3/PPPB2PP/R3KB1R w KQ - 11 9,He moves Ng4.If you look here i should have moved to Qxh7 this would have been the checkmate i needed.I think he is attacking my right.I focus on his knight this could have been a fatal mistake for me.
17,O-O-O,e1c1,r2q1rk1/pppbbppp/2n1p3/3p2N1/3P1Pn1/2NQP3/PPPB2PP/2KR1B1R b - - 12 9,I castle here.If he had moved from g7 to g6 it would have changed the game.
18,Nb4,c6b4,r2q1rk1/pppbbppp/4p3/3p2N1/1n1P1Pn1/2NQP3/PPPB2PP/2KR1B1R w - - 13 10,He comes on down with his cowboy Nb4.
