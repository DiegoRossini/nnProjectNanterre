Black also has to beware of White's sacrificial opportunities with Nc3-d5 or Bxb5 or Nxb5.  When White's Q moved to f3, this inhibited ...b5 because of the potential for revealed attacks on the Ra8 and the ris of moving Black's B onto b7 if unprotected, hence 8...Qc7, which I always play automatically against Qf3 in this and similar lines."

I was ready to resign on resumption.  Imagine my surprise when White beat me to it and resigned!  Play might continue along one of these lines: (18. Rxd3 e5 19. fxe5 (19. Nc3 exd4 20. Qxd4 bxc3 
21. Rxc3 Qd7 22. Rg1 Rg8 23. Rxc8  Bxc8 24. f5 Rxg4 25. Bh3 Rxg1  26. Qxg1) 19. .. fxe5 ( 19. .. Qxc2  20. Nxc2) 20. Nc3 {anything to block the mating attack on c2} exd4 21. Qxd4 O-O 22. Rd2 bxc3 23. bxc3 Qxc3 24. Qxc3 Rxc3 {when Black should be able to make his extra piece count})"
