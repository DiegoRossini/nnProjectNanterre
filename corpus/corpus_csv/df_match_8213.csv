1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"at one point, i thought i'd probably lose this game. then i thought it was a draw. i went on to win, but only because of a couple of mistakes. i thought i'd put this up, see if anyone has suggestions for my opening moves, which were particularly bad."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"i don't see this much, i'm used to Nc6 or Nf6 here. so, from here on out, i'm completely winging it. openings may be my biggest problem at the moment..."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"i don't see this much, i'm used to Nc6 or Nf6 here. so, from here on out, i'm completely winging it. openings may be my biggest problem at the moment..."

5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"i was dismayed to see this -- from the rating, i thought my opponent was probably a weaker player than me, so i wanted to lead the game to open, tactical lines."
6,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/3p1p2/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"i was dismayed to see this -- from the rating, i thought my opponent was probably a weaker player than me, so i wanted to lead the game to open, tactical lines."
7,Be3,c1e3,rnbqkbnr/ppp3pp/3p1p2/4p3/3PP3/4BN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"i have no clue if this move was a good idea or a terrible one for me, but i suspect there was a much better continuation somewhere in there. maybe h3 first?"
8,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkbnr/ppp3pp/3p1p2/4p3/3PP1b1/4BN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,"this pin is really annoying. it's not like i didn't see it coming... i allowed it, thinking he'd be forced to take soon. lunacy!"
9,Bc4,f1c4,rn1qkbnr/ppp3pp/3p1p2/4p3/2BPP1b1/4BN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 3 5,hoping to take advantage of that open diagonal by not letting black castle.
10,Nc6,b8c6,r2qkbnr/ppp3pp/2np1p2/4p3/2BPP1b1/4BN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 4 6,"moving the piece twice. probably a bad decision. i thought i was saving the pawn and/or preventing my g-pawn from doubling on the f-file, but i think there are other ways forward."
11,Bb5,c4b5,r2qkbnr/ppp3pp/2np1p2/1B2p3/3PP1b1/4BN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 5 6,"moving the piece twice. probably a bad decision. i thought i was saving the pawn and/or preventing my g-pawn from doubling on the f-file, but i think there are other ways forward."

13,h3,h2h3,r2qkbnr/1pp3pp/p1np1p2/1B2p3/3PP1b1/4BN1P/PPP2PP1/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 0 7,"i think it's better for me if both bishops are off the board. if his pawns are locked on dark squares, his remaining bishop starts to look silly and his light squares should be weak, potentially available for my knights."
14,Bh5,g4h5,r2qkbnr/1pp3pp/p1np1p2/1B2p2b/3PP3/4BN1P/PPP2PP1/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 1 8,we both try to keep the pins.
15,Ba4,b5a4,r2qkbnr/1pp3pp/p1np1p2/4p2b/B2PP3/4BN1P/PPP2PP1/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 2 8,we both try to keep the pins.
16,b5,b7b5,r2qkbnr/2p3pp/p1np1p2/1p2p2b/B2PP3/4BN1P/PPP2PP1/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 9,"naturally, i'd seen this. i thought my bishop should settle on d5 or e6 to some annoying effect. still, around here, i was starting to feel like black had an advantage."
17,Bb3,a4b3,r2qkbnr/2p3pp/p1np1p2/1p2p2b/3PP3/1B2BN1P/PPP2PP1/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 1 9,the bishop can't be trapped yet. seems like wishful thinking.
18,a5,a6a5,r2qkbnr/2p3pp/2np1p2/pp2p2b/3PP3/1B2BN1P/PPP2PP1/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 10,the bishop can't be trapped yet. seems like wishful thinking.

20,Nge7,g8e7,r2qkb1r/2p1n1pp/2np1p2/pp1Bp2b/3PP3/4BN1P/PPP2PP1/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 2 11,weakens the kingside. i was basically hoping to trade off the light-squared bishops with this move.

23,Bxc6+,d5c6,r2qkb1r/2p1n1pp/2Bp1pb1/pp2p3/3PP1P1/4BN1P/PPP2P2/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 0 12,"this was the idea. threaten the piece, make it awkward, lock the pawns a little before protecting my e4 pawn. still, i think black should be giving me a really hard time after moving the knight somewhere safe with the plan of pushing the c-pawn. i think with correct play, black should have an advantage here. his king looks potentially much safer than mine if the center opens."
24,Nxc6,e7c6,r2qkb1r/2p3pp/2np1pb1/pp2p3/3PP1P1/4BN1P/PPP2P2/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 13,"this was the idea. threaten the piece, make it awkward, lock the pawns a little before protecting my e4 pawn. still, i think black should be giving me a really hard time after moving the knight somewhere safe with the plan of pushing the c-pawn. i think with correct play, black should have an advantage here. his king looks potentially much safer than mine if the center opens."

27,c3,c2c3,r2qkb1r/2p3pp/3p1pb1/pp1Pp3/1n2P1P1/2P1BN1P/PP3P2/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 0 14,only square. looks awkward there.

30,b4,b5b4,r2qkb1r/2p3pp/n2p1pb1/p2Pp3/1p2P1P1/2P1BN1P/PP1N1P2/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 16,"i decided i wasn't too worried about that c-pawn being taken just yet. still, this could have wound up awkward for me. i figured that after recapturing with the b-pawn, my center would be a little stronger. i'm not so sure my thinking was correct on this one, though."
31,Nh4,f3h4,r2qkb1r/2p3pp/n2p1pb1/p2Pp3/1p2P1PN/2P1B2P/PP1N1P2/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 16,"i decided i wasn't too worried about that c-pawn being taken just yet. still, this could have wound up awkward for me. i figured that after recapturing with the b-pawn, my center would be a little stronger. i'm not so sure my thinking was correct on this one, though."
