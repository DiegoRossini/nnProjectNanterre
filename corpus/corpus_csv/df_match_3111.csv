Here he thought a while, but still doesn't see the obvious checkmate in one if he doesn't give up a piece, or give up the queen exchange. My next move will be Nxa7 checkmate, which actually occurs because black overlooks it. Playing back through this game slowly, one can see several dubious choices black made; none seemed horribly wrong, but together, they caused this losing position. I don't want to analyze what black should have done in those past moves, for he had several better moves to pick from, and my play as white wasn't necessarily completely accurate either. But here, is there something better for black than Qxe1? I'd say... no. bryanofbay, when you've learned to form a more cohesive plan, and understand positional play a bit better, your game will greatly improve."
