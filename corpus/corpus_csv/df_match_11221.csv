5,Bd2,c1d2,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPPBPPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"white is moving major pieces out, a good strategy, but I must continue to build my house for the king"
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3P4/5N2/PPPBPPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,this move is an example of that strategy

12,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bqk2r/pppn1pbp/4pnp1/1B1p4/3P4/2N1PN2/PPPB1PPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 4 7,I block with my knight

14,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pppn1pbp/4pnp1/1B1p2N1/3P4/2N1P3/PPPB1PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 6 8,I castle

16,b6,b7b6,r1bq1rk1/p1pn1pbp/1p2pnp1/1B1p2N1/3P4/2N1PQ2/PPPB1PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 9,Ibegin to lay a trap for the queen

18,Re8,f8e8,r1bqr1k1/p1pn1pbp/1p2pnp1/1B1p2N1/3P4/2N1P2Q/PPPB1PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 2 10,I continue my opening development
