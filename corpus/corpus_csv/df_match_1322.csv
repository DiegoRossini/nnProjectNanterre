9,Nh4,f3h4,rnbqkb1r/ppp3pp/3ppn2/5p2/3P1B1N/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"? Not because ""N on the rim is grim"" (I hate that rhyme!), but because the WQ can't go to h5 and check. If so, this N assures g6 can't be played to stop the check, on behalf of Nxg6, being a7 pinned to the R. But not now, since the Nf6 is there."

No matter if it goes Qh5, since Qe8 can follow, stopping Ng6+. But white (take into account, learners!) seems to have a shocking way to end the game."
