2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"As Black, I've been thinking of trying the Pirc Defence, but this move works good as well."

4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"Black doesn't have too much responses to White's second move, but White has a lot of responses to Black's second move."
5,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,The Two Knight's Defence.

8,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 6 5,"So far, both sides aquired symmetry. Nothing new here..."

14,Be6,c8e6,r2qk2r/ppp2ppp/3pbn2/2b1p1N1/2BnP3/2NP3P/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 3 8,"At the same time, I had to protect f7 at costs that include castling, which I don't mind giving up."

20,O-O-O,e8c8,2kr3r/ppp1qppp/3p1n2/2bPp1N1/2Bn4/3PB2P/PPP2PP1/R2QK2R w KQ - 1 11,"A risky move, although I don't think that the Kingside is any safer at this point."
21,c3,c2c3,2kr3r/ppp1qppp/3p1n2/2bPp1N1/2Bn4/2PPB2P/PP3PP1/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 11,"My only move, 11...Nf5."

25,Nxe4,g5e4,2kr3r/ppp1qppp/3p4/2bP4/2BnN3/2P1B2P/PP3PP1/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 13,That's reasonable... only for then.
