1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"This blitz was played on a lazy night, and it is not a ""great"" or ""very interesting"" game... we both made a lot of mistakes, and specially a lot of overlooks. I annotate it because I wanted to share some thoughts with my opponent, but I was disconnected. The annotation is mainly for us, but feel free to read and comment. I'm sure more experienced players will find funny my comments, the way I got ""completely lost"" in the middle of the game, and my opponent wasn't daring enough to take full advantage of it. Some nice positions for strategic (more than tactic) analysis can be found in it."
