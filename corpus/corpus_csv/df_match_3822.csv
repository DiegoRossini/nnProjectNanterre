1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi all! This is the second game in this team match (the first can be found here: http://gameknot.com/annotation.pl/kings-gambit-i-accept?gm=45099 ). I open with the English, and after a lot of quiet posturing early on, some convoluted action starts happening in the center, eventually culminating in a frenzy of activity ranging all across the board. I come out of it ahead in material, but my opponent has surprising resources left to him and my pieces are scattered all over."
