1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"Relatively little was known about this type of endgame at the time this game was played, and despite a few inaccuracies in the play, Botvinnik first whole endgame has now been ""tablebased"", it is not always a simple matter to divine the underlying point behind many of the computer's moves. Broadly, we can point out the following rules of thumb:
1. One of White's main weapons in such endings is the ""cross-check"", i.e . answering a check by  interposing his queen, so as himself to give check, and so force an exchange of queens. This idea lies behind several of the other principles of such endings. 
2. Whilst there are no hard and fast rules as to which positions are won and which are not, it is true to say that the stronger side generally has most winning chances with a centre pawn or bishop's pawn, fewer chances with a knight's pawn, and fewest of all with a rook's pawn. The tablebase confirms that the present position should be a draw with best play. 
3. The stronger side's queen usually takes up a post in the centre of the board, where its influence is at its greatest, and the chance of crosschecks is maximized.
4. The stronger side should usually try to place his own king on the same or adjacent rank or file as the enemy  king. This maximizes the chance of cross-checks. 
5. With a knight's pawn as here, the defender's king should generally head for the corner diagonally opposite to the pawn's queening square (in other words, the a1-corner in this position). This, too, is motivated by the defender's desire to reduce the chances of cross-checks.

Armed with these basic principles, we will see how Botvinnik handled the ending. It should be noted that he had the benefit of adjournment analysis, of course; and since this was an Olympiad, it can be assumed that his teammates will have contributed. In my opinion, none of this diminishes the value of Botvinnik's achievement in this game."

3. The stronger side's queen usually takes up a post in the centre of the board, where its influence is at its greatest, and the chance of crosschecks is maximized.

Broadly, we can point out the following rules of thumb:
1. One of White's main weapons in such endings is the ""cross-check"", i.e . answering a check by  interposing his queen, so as himself to give check, and so force an exchange of queens. This idea lies behind several of the other principles of such endings. 
2. Whilst there are no hard and fast rules as to which positions are won and which are not, it is true to say that the stronger side generally has most winning chances with a centre pawn or bishop's pawn, fewer chances with a knight's pawn, and fewest of all with a rook's pawn. The tablebase confirms that the present position should be a draw with best play. 
3. The stronger side's queen usually takes up a post in the centre of the board, where its influence is at its greatest, and the chance of crosschecks is maximized.
4. The stronger side should usually try to place his own king on the same or adjacent rank or file as the enemy  king. This maximizes the chance of cross-checks. 
5. With a knight's pawn as here, the defender's king should generally head for the corner diagonally opposite to the pawn's queening square (in other words, the a1-corner in this position). This, too, is motivated by the defender's desire to reduce the chances of cross-checks.

Armed with these basic principles, we will see how Botvinnik handled the ending. It should be noted that he had the benefit of adjournment analysis, of course; and since this was an Olympiad, it can be assumed that his teammates will have contributed. In my opinion, none of this diminishes the value of Botvinnik's achievement in this game."

1. One of White's main weapons in such endings is the ""cross-check"", i.e . answering a check by  interposing his queen, so as himself to give check, and so force an exchange of queens. This idea lies behind several of the other principles of such endings. 
2.

The tablebase confirms that the present position should be a draw with best play. 
3. The stronger side's queen usually takes up a post in the centre of the board, where its influence is at its greatest, and the chance of crosschecks is maximized.
4. The stronger side should usually try to place his own king on the same or adjacent rank or file as the enemy  king. This maximizes the chance of cross-checks. 
5. With a knight's pawn as here, the defender's king should generally head for the corner diagonally opposite to the pawn's queening square (in other words, the a1-corner in this position). This, too, is motivated by the defender's desire to reduce the chances of cross-checks.

1. One of White's main weapons in such endings is the ""cross-check"", i.e . answering a check by  interposing his queen, so as himself to give check, and so force an exchange of queens. This idea lies behind several of the other principles of such endings. 
2. Whilst there are no hard and fast rules as to which positions are won and which are not, it is true to say that the stronger side generally has most winning chances with a centre pawn or bishop's pawn, fewer chances with a knight's pawn, and fewest of all with a rook's pawn. The tablebase confirms that the present position should be a draw with best play. 
3. The stronger side's queen usually takes up a post in the centre of the board, where its influence is at its greatest, and the chance of crosschecks is maximized.
4. The stronger side should usually try to place his own king on the same or adjacent rank or file as the enemy  king. This maximizes the chance of cross-checks. 
5. With a knight's pawn as here, the defender's king should generally head for the corner diagonally opposite to the pawn's queening square (in other words, the a1-corner in this position). This, too, is motivated by the defender's desire to reduce the chances of cross-checks.

Armed with these basic principles, we will see how Botvinnik handled the ending. It should be noted that he had the benefit of adjournment analysis, of course; and since this was an Olympiad, it can be assumed that his teammates will have contributed. In my opinion, none of this diminishes the value of Botvinnik's achievement in this game."

(However, this does not mean it is a draw - White will, of course, advance his g-pawn again inside the so moves allowance)."

It is clear that Minev did not understand the point about where his king was best placed, a forgivable error for his time, but one which makes Botvinnik's task easier.
