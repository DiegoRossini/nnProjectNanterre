1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"You would think that 1750  players would be above missing or walking into basic tactics wouldn't you?  But not jstevens1, oh no.  In this game I played to the level of my OTB rating - 1200!  In fact from some 1200 players I have seen better!  So, Jo, time to get back to basics!  The game starts off with Ion playing d4 and me trying to set up some flank action with the Modern Defence which is the response g6."

Rf7 - the only way to avoid losing material outright is to block the check on d5 with the rook - although the rook is pinned the Witch cannot take the b pawn as in moving the witch would release the rook from the pin and so the witch would be no more.

Rxd5 - I play the move but then decided to throw in the sponge because Glenda will fall next move and my rook will have to take on d1.  The recapture will leave Ion an R & P up.  I would resign against someone 300 points lower than me never mind higher with this kind of deficit.  A sorry tale.
