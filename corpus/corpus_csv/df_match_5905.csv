1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I usually check the opponent's games and see what he plays before playing my first move. I guess there still are a few defenses I'm not comfortable playing against but don't expect me to reveal them here.
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"But the KID isn't one of them. Although it's been played by just about every world champion, I still don't have much faith in it. I've played it myself in a few games here, but it was more of an experiment than a serious attempt. It's not that I think the opening is bad, I just don't like the positions that Black gets out of it, in many lines he just seems to be hanging by a thread. White, on the other hand..."

7,e4,e2e4,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"The classical line, which is also the most popular currently. A few decades ago the g3 systems and the Saemisch were very much in favor of the chess elite but playing so protracted has proved unnecessary against this defense. Beside, from this position, White and Black still have many ways to play and different setups."

11,Be2,f1e2,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 3 6,"White's idea is to simple complete development, while holding the center, for now and wait to see what Black does next."
12,e5,e7e5,rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/3p1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 7,"I think it's because of this move that I don't like the KID very much for Black. I mean, what's the point of developing the Bishop at g7 if you're just going to hem it in as early as move six behind your own pawns? That being said, this move is objectively considered best and almost forced in order to secure a stable situation in the center and complete development."
13,O-O,e1g1,rnbq1rk1/ppp2pbp/3p1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 1 7,"Playing 7. d5 was popular a long time before I was born but isn't anymore. After 7...a5, Black can intertwine his pieces in the center and secure a steady, promising game. Since 7...exd4 isn't much of a threat because after 8. Nxd4 Re8 9. f3!, White is just better."
14,Nc6,b8c6,r1bq1rk1/ppp2pbp/2np1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 2 8,"The point of this Knight sortie is very deep. Black forces White to close the center, when he can slowly maneuver the pieces and start K-side operations. Notice that the Knight is better placed on e7, where it doesn't interfere with the Bc8 and from where it supports f5 and can later come to g6. This is just basic stuff about the KID, so if you know this already, feel free to skip the opening moves."
15,d5,d4d5,r1bq1rk1/ppp2pbp/2np1np1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 8,"The other alternative is 8. Be3, but the whole thing just looks needlessly messy. Besides, hitting a Knight with a pawn is always good fun."
16,Ne7,c6e7,r1bq1rk1/ppp1npbp/3p1np1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 9,"OK, here we are. This is the main position of the Classical line. Variations aren't as important here as are ideas and knowing what to do. For example, Black's Bc8 is a very important piece, even if it doesn't look like it now. The same is true about White's Bc1. Let me just lay out some of the basic plans for both sides. White wants to use his better foothold in the center to squeeze Black's Q-side and win material there. Pushing either of the three pawns there, either separate or combined is a good way to achieve this. The c5 break is particularly appealing. Black on the other hand has already burned all his bridges and just wants to mate White. He'll start pushing his K-side pawns and try to land a piece sacrifice somewhere and bring his Queen in for the kill. Both sides try to mix defense and attack into their play and some of games that have been played with this lines by the great chess champions are very instructive."
17,b4,b2b4,r1bq1rk1/ppp1npbp/3p1np1/3Pp3/1PP1P3/2N2N2/P3BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 0 9,This is called the Bayonet attack. The older main line starts with 9. Ne1 and still many lines break off from there.
18,Nh5,f6h5,r1bq1rk1/ppp1npbp/3p2p1/3Pp2n/1PP1P3/2N2N2/P3BPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 10,"A typical maneuver for Black. Clearing the way for the f5 break and possibly bringing the to f4, where after a subsequent capture, his Bg7 might just live to see the light of day."

20,a5,a7a5,r1bq1rk1/1pp1npbp/3p2p1/p2Pp2n/1PP1P3/2N2N2/P3BPPP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 0 11,"A secondary variation. 10...f5 is the usual move. The idea of a5 is to make use of the early pawn advanced and remove one target from the Q-side, while bring his Rook into play. However this seems wrong in principle since opening lines on the Q-side can only favor me in the long term."
