7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"Here, a pin on my king is countered with my own pin on his queen, note the two pinned knights."

I had no idea what my opponent was planning at this point. For one thing, he was going for my c3 knight. But I didn't think he would ever regain the material from the lost queen."
14,Nxd5,f6d5,rnbq1rk1/pp3ppp/4p3/2pn2B1/1b1P4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 8,"That was unexpected. The obvious choice would be to recapture with the e pawn.

15,Bxd8,g5d8,rnbB1rk1/pp3ppp/4p3/2pn4/1b1P4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 8,"The expected course of action. The bishop will recapture the pawn after I recapture, forking the king and rook, and then my opponent will go ahead and take it."

20,Rxd8,f8d8,rnbr2k1/pp3ppp/4p3/2p5/3P4/2b1P3/P2N1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 11,Another unexpected course of action. My opponent seemed more intent on pinning the queen rather than winning the rook exchange.
21,Rc1,a1c1,rnbr2k1/pp3ppp/4p3/2p5/3P4/2b1P3/P2N1PPP/2RQKB1R b K - 1 11,...So I save the rook and counter threaten his bishop. I also try to take advantage of the potential hole in the c file.
22,cxd4,c5d4,rnbr2k1/pp3ppp/4p3/8/3p4/2b1P3/P2N1PPP/2RQKB1R w K - 0 12,My opponent has successfully removed my central pawn blockade and has now posed a reasonable threat (Bxf2+) if I should ever move my knight.
23,exd4,e3d4,rnbr2k1/pp3ppp/4p3/8/3P4/2b5/P2N1PPP/2RQKB1R b K - 0 12,My opponent has successfully removed my central pawn blockade and has now posed a reasonable threat (Bxf2+) if I should ever move my knight.
24,Bxd4,c3d4,rnbr2k1/pp3ppp/4p3/8/3b4/8/P2N1PPP/2RQKB1R w K - 0 13,My opponent has successfully removed my central pawn blockade and has now posed a reasonable threat (Bxf2+) if I should ever move my knight.
25,Bb5,f1b5,rnbr2k1/pp3ppp/4p3/1B6/3b4/8/P2N1PPP/2RQK2R b K - 1 13,"By playing Bb5 I had hoped to hinder the development of the black knight, maybe prompt an exchange of bishops. If my opponent had played a6, I would have countered with Qa4. After Bxf2+, Kxf2, Rxd2+, Ke3, my queen would have a better shot at the 8th rank for the win. If, then, he played Rd8, my rooks would be easier to develop. My opponent, however, exchanges the knight to take advantage of the open position with his two bishops."
26,Nc6,b8c6,r1br2k1/pp3ppp/2n1p3/1B6/3b4/8/P2N1PPP/2RQK2R w K - 2 14,"By playing Bb5 I had hoped to hinder the development of the black knight, maybe prompt an exchange of bishops.

27,Bxc6,b5c6,r1br2k1/pp3ppp/2B1p3/8/3b4/8/P2N1PPP/2RQK2R b K - 0 14,"I trade off, since trading away pieces is good when ahead on material. I decide to castle instead of taking the pawn, since the latter could lead to Bb7, which skewers my rook and gives away my g pawn."
28,bxc6,b7c6,r1br2k1/p4ppp/2p1p3/8/3b4/8/P2N1PPP/2RQK2R w K - 0 15,"I trade off, since trading away pieces is good when ahead on material. I decide to castle instead of taking the pawn, since the latter could lead to Bb7, which skewers my rook and gives away my g pawn."

30,Ba6,c8a6,r2r2k1/p4ppp/b1p1p3/8/3b4/8/P2N1PPP/2RQ1RK1 w - - 2 16,"If I had not castled by the time my opponent played this move, I would not have been able to do so without losing my rook."
31,Re1,f1e1,r2r2k1/p4ppp/b1p1p3/8/3b4/8/P2N1PPP/2RQR1K1 b - - 3 16,The only way to save my rook.
32,Bb6,d4b6,r2r2k1/p4ppp/bbp1p3/8/8/8/P2N1PPP/2RQR1K1 w - - 4 17,Now my opponent pins my knight and moves his bishop to a safer position. Now it will be tricky to get my queen out of the pin and at the same time protect my knight.
33,Qc2,d1c2,r2r2k1/p4ppp/bbp1p3/8/8/8/P1QN1PPP/2R1R1K1 b - - 5 17,"My knight is pinned yet again, while simultaneously being attacked by two pieces."

35,Rcd1,c1d1,r2r2k1/p4ppp/b1p1p3/b7/8/8/P1QN1PPP/3RR1K1 b - - 7 18,"Red1 would have led to Be2, causing me to undo the move and consequently lose my knight."
36,Rab8,a8b8,1r1r2k1/p4ppp/b1p1p3/b7/8/8/P1QN1PPP/3RR1K1 w - - 8 19,My opponent mounts another threat by seizing the open file. It would have been possible to fork that a rook with his light square bishop if his other rook left the 8th rank for whatever reason.
37,Re3,e1e3,1r1r2k1/p4ppp/b1p1p3/b7/8/4R3/P1QN1PPP/3R2K1 b - - 9 19,"I release the pin. I also contemplated Re5, but that would only cause problems after Bd3. I hope to send the rook later to b3 to defend against the black rook on b8."
38,Bb6,a5b6,1r1r2k1/p4ppp/bbp1p3/8/8/4R3/P1QN1PPP/3R2K1 w - - 10 20,"My opponent's most likely intention is to double up the rooks, but this move actually buys me a little time."
39,Rb3,e3b3,1r1r2k1/p4ppp/bbp1p3/8/8/1R6/P1QN1PPP/3R2K1 b - - 11 20,"My opponent's most likely intention is to double up the rooks, but this move actually buys me a little time."
40,Rd5,d8d5,1r4k1/p4ppp/bbp1p3/3r4/8/1R6/P1QN1PPP/3R2K1 w - - 12 21,"My opponent's most likely intention is to double up the rooks, but this move actually buys me a little time."
41,Nf3,d2f3,1r4k1/p4ppp/bbp1p3/3r4/8/1R3N2/P1Q2PPP/3R2K1 b - - 13 21,"I had believed the time was right to move my knight. I opt to exchange the rooks, taking material off the board. I had decided that Bc4 wasn't much of a threat."
