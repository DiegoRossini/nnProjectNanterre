If black can get white to play Be2 or Bd3 before he plays dxc4, he will have gained a tempo."

15,b4,b2b4,r1bqk2r/1p3ppp/p1n1pn2/2bp4/1PP5/P1N1PN2/5PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,"Whites heeds Aron Nimzovitch's injunction, ' Never play to win a pawn while you development is yet unfinished' and avoids 9. cxd5 exd5 10.

The setups have to subtle but vital differences, however, both of which are in blacks favour. The first is that black waited to play 11. dxc4 until after white's king bishop moved, and this strategic delay gained a tempo for black.The second difference is that the black queen is better placed on e7 than whites queen on d2. Black's queen is safe, while the white queen is exposed on the open-d file. Are these small advantages enough to win. Maybe- maybe only if your name is Rubinstein!"
