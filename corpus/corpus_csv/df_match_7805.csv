1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"My final game in the Annotation Project and my last chance to crow :-)  Although I outgraded scalawag, I could hardly take winning for granted as I have blown several games against lower rated opposition recently, especially in this tournament (take a bow thebishop1000 and graderguy).  Anyway, at the time of writing, this win takes me to 4th place, leapfrogging yoshark, with whom I shared the points earlier, and ahead of fellow inveterate commentators, nuntar and dmaestro, over both of whom I was fortunate enough to do the double.  Congratulations to Freddy and Joanne for heading the pack and Steve for pushing into 3rd place."
