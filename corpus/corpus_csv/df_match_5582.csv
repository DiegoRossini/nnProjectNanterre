1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Never a bad choice.
2,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"A reply that would later be attached to the name of the great Latvian, Aron Niemzowitsch. Here Wake uses it merely to direct the game out of the usual channels."
3,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pppppppp/2n5/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Placing the Pawn here in spite of Black's opening move.
4,d5,d7d5,r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Preventing P-Q5 driving the Knight.
5,e5,e4e5,r1bqkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3pP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"Seizing the black squares, but leaving his KP advanced and exposed."
6,Bf5,c8f5,r2qkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3pPb2/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,Counterattack along the white squares.
7,Ne2,g1e2,r2qkbnr/ppp1pppp/2n5/3pPb2/3P4/8/PPP1NPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,"To guard the base QP, but N-KB3 would be a better choice. If then 4... B-N5, 5 B-K3 develops and safeguards the QP. 4 N-KB3 would also allow the development of the KB and a quick K-side castle."
8,Nb4,c6b4,r2qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3pPb2/1n1P4/8/PPP1NPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 3 5,"Taking advantage of White's tangled development. If White had played 4 N-KB3, he would be in a position to block the diagonal of the B with an eventual B-Q3."
9,Na3,b1a3,r2qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3pPb2/1n1P4/N7/PPP1NPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 4 5,Virtually forced.

11,c3,c2c3,r2qkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2ppPb2/1n1P4/N1P5/PP2NPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"IF White had played 4 N-KB3, this move would be strong, as the Black Knight would be forced to retreat. With the KB controlling Q3, Black's best move would be 6... N-QR3, guarding the QBP and preparing R-B1. However..."
12,Nd3+,b4d3,r2qkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2ppPb2/3P4/N1Pn4/PP2NPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,"...because of White's mistake on move 4, Black wins at once with this move. After 7 K-Q2, Black wins the Exchange with 7... NxKBP forking Q and R."
