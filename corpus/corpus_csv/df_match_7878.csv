At other times, we say, ""He wants it, so I want to deny him it.""  Here it was something between these alternatives: He spent some time fortifying the square with a pawn, I would like that move to have been wasted or come along a line he was not intending.  I actually do not know that he felt ill at ease with cxd5, but I do get to retain a certain control of the game flow with this play."

6,Qxd5,d8d5,rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3q4/3P4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"I really expected cxd5, but this does confirm that he preferred the solid pawn structure of the declined exchange to the potentially isolated queen pawn granting play of cxd5.  White would like to force the IQP without incurring one as well which precludes the offer of e4 after cxd5.  I suspect this move could have even been motivated by an examination of my public annotations and recent games which reveal the use of Bg2."

One reason to play the bishop move first is that it can appear at a quick glance to be nothing more than a harassment of the Black rook.  If Black takes the bait, white gains time, and his attack gets rolling.  The reason to play the knight move first is to blockade Black's f pawn preventing an escape avenue for the black king."
