2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"good move, controls the center, and opens lines for your bishop and queen"
3,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B5/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,simple developing move
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B5/4P3/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 3,"good, the ""rule"" is to develop knights before bishops, and it helps control the center"
5,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/2B5/2N1P3/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 3 3,development
6,f6,f7f6,r1bqkbnr/pppp2pp/2n2p2/4p3/2B5/2N1P3/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 4,"first move I have a problem with, moving your pawn to f6 weakens the h5-e8 diagonal against your king, and does not promote the development of the rest of your army"

10,Nge7,g8e7,r1bqk2r/ppppn1pp/2n2p2/2b1p3/2B5/4PN2/PPPPNPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 4 6,"good developing move, pawn to d5 was also good (attacking the bishop and controlling the center at the same time while opening the diagonal for your light squared bishop"

12,Nf5,e7f5,r1bqk2r/pppp2pp/2n2p2/2b1pn2/2B5/1P2PN2/P1PPNPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 1 7,"same rule, don't move the same piece twice in the opening if you can avoid it, 6...d5 was certainly better, followed by castling.  Also ask yourself what is my piece doing there?  What are you trying to accomplish?  You need the rest of your army developed before you even consider trying to attack"
