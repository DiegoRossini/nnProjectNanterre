For example, a motif in this position might be the looseness of the black c6 knight and it's alignment to the king. If this was a serious motif to consider, a possible white goal would be to see if that might be exploitable.)Also, pay close attention to the opponent's move 2.What are ALL the forcing moves I have? Forcing moves include -Checkcaptures -Checks -Captures -Attacks. These are all candidate moves that need to be looked at first, since they are the most important. There may be a lot of these moves, but if they are bad, you can easily eliminate most in a few seconds, and you will not miss anything due to lack of consideration. To find these moves, look at all you pieces in order from Q,R,B,N,Pawn. King is only in sharp endgames. 3.What are now the logical candidate moves I can select based on my work in step 1? You are now thinking about how you can directly find a way to ""think"" before finding candidates. By now, you have mixed the Computer's thinking process and the Human's logical process, incorporating both of their strengths.  4.Look at all the moves, and eliminate all that are obviously bad. To avoid blunders *After each considered move, look at all of your opponent's forcing moves, and quickly see if they are winning or cause you major problems. 5.Calculate the remaining moves(The process will be desribed in my Previous Calculation article.) Evaluate the position most likely to happen after each move by best play, and decide which evaluation you think is best; Play that move. Let's try and use it for this game."

The reason black played this was because the white player was rated so much higher, and he wanted a draw. This removes all the learning possiblities that could have happened by continuing play, and a win could have been possible for black."
