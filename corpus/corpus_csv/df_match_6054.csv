1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"If 2. ... exd4 then 3. Qxd4 and White has good control of the center with his queen and pawn. Black can play 3. ... Nc6 to attack the queen, but, it can retreat to e3 and the two players can start to develop pieces after that. White's queen will be quite exposed, though, and Black has a development tempo."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"If 2. ... exd4 then 3. Qxd4 and White has good control of the center with his queen and pawn. Black can play 3. ...

4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"This move is a transposition into the Nimzowitsch Defence, and serves a dual purpose. Black protects the pawn on e5 while attacking White's pawn on d4. White either has to protect it, take the pawn, or come up with something else."
5,d5,d4d5,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/3Pp3/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"Note that White also has the calmer possibility 3. dxe5 Nxe5 4. Nf3 which should promise a slight edge after 4 ... Bb4+ 5. c3, or 4 ... Qf6 5. Nc3 or 5. Be2. Usually, in this position, White plays 3. c3, the Danish Gambit."
6,Nb8,c6b8,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/3Pp3/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"A mistake by Black. He should have played 3. ... Ne7, but, he was afraid of blocking the advance of his queen and dark-squared bishop. White has a good advantage."
7,Qf3,d1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/3Pp3/4P3/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 2 4,"Black is hoping for White to trade off queens. After 5. Qxf6 Nxf6 Black makes up for the loss of development made with the earlier knight move, and also attacks the pawn on e4. However, White is not so keen to do so."
8,Qf6,d8f6,rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/5q2/3Pp3/4P3/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 3 5,"Black is hoping for White to trade off queens. After 5. Qxf6 Nxf6 Black makes up for the loss of development made with the earlier knight move, and also attacks the pawn on e4. However, White is not so keen to do so."
9,Bc4,f1c4,rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/5q2/3Pp3/2B1P3/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 4 5,Note that Black could have captured the queen on f3 but didn't like that idea. After 5. ... Qxf3 6. Nxf3 White has two pieces developed against Black's zero.
10,Bc5,f8c5,rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/5q2/2bPp3/2B1P3/5Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 5 6,Note that Black could have captured the queen on f3 but didn't like that idea. After 5. ... Qxf3 6. Nxf3 White has two pieces developed against Black's zero.
11,Be3,c1e3,rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/5q2/2bPp3/2B1P3/4BQ2/PPP2PPP/RN2K1NR b KQkq - 6 6,"Black is eager to trade off, but after 7. Qxe3 White is leading in development. Note that his bishop is serving a good purpose on c4, helping the pawn on e4 defend the pawn on d5, and can't be attacked very easily. Unfortunately for White, it doesn't threaten much."
12,Bxe3,c5e3,rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/5q2/3Pp3/2B1P3/4bQ2/PPP2PPP/RN2K1NR w KQkq - 0 7,"Black is eager to trade off, but after 7. Qxe3 White is leading in development. Note that his bishop is serving a good purpose on c4, helping the pawn on e4 defend the pawn on d5, and can't be attacked very easily. Unfortunately for White, it doesn't threaten much."
13,Qxe3,f3e3,rnb1k1nr/pppp1ppp/5q2/3Pp3/2B1P3/4Q3/PPP2PPP/RN2K1NR b KQkq - 0 7,An interesting move by Black. White has a relatively good bishop on c4 and can now check Black's king if he so wishes to.
14,d6,d7d6,rnb1k1nr/ppp2ppp/3p1q2/3Pp3/2B1P3/4Q3/PPP2PPP/RN2K1NR w KQkq - 0 8,An interesting move by Black. White has a relatively good bishop on c4 and can now check Black's king if he so wishes to.
15,f3,f2f3,rnb1k1nr/ppp2ppp/3p1q2/3Pp3/2B1P3/4QP2/PPP3PP/RN2K1NR b KQkq - 0 8,"A good move by White. This stops any future attacks by the Black queen, though 8. Nf3 would have been better, as it develops a piece. White needn't worry, though, as Black doesn't have a dark-squared bishop to back up his queen."
16,c6,c7c6,rnb1k1nr/pp3ppp/2pp1q2/3Pp3/2B1P3/4QP2/PPP3PP/RN2K1NR w KQkq - 0 9,"Another interesting move by Black. There is no great need for White to capture the pawn, although it would give the bishop good opportunities to attack the Black king later on. Note that, if Black takes the d5 pawn with his own, White can take with the bishop and will gain plenty of room to maneuver."
17,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1k1nr/pp3ppp/2pp1q2/3Pp3/2B1P3/2N1QP2/PPP3PP/R3K1NR b KQkq - 1 9,"White's lack of action has resulted in an intimidating pawn structure for Black. However, White has a trick up his sleeve."
18,b5,b7b5,rnb1k1nr/p4ppp/2pp1q2/1p1Pp3/2B1P3/2N1QP2/PPP3PP/R3K1NR w KQkq - 0 10,"White's lack of action has resulted in an intimidating pawn structure for Black. However, White has a trick up his sleeve."

20,bxc4,b5c4,rnb1k1nr/p4ppp/2Pp1q2/4p3/2p1P3/2N1QP2/PPP3PP/R3K1NR w KQkq - 0 11,"White's plan is revealed. Although blocked by Black's bishop, he now has a pawn one square away from promotion, and threatens to capture the knight on b8. However, Black can easily defend."
21,c7,c6c7,rnb1k1nr/p1P2ppp/3p1q2/4p3/2p1P3/2N1QP2/PPP3PP/R3K1NR b KQkq - 0 11,"White's plan is revealed. Although blocked by Black's bishop, he now has a pawn one square away from promotion, and threatens to capture the knight on b8. However, Black can easily defend."
22,Na6,b8a6,r1b1k1nr/p1P2ppp/n2p1q2/4p3/2p1P3/2N1QP2/PPP3PP/R3K1NR w KQkq - 1 12,"Clever. White protects the pawn while simultaneously attacking Black's queen. The knight is protected by the pawn on e4, and none of Black's pawns can attack the knight."
23,Nd5,c3d5,r1b1k1nr/p1P2ppp/n2p1q2/3Np3/2p1P3/4QP2/PPP3PP/R3K1NR b KQkq - 2 12,"Clever. White protects the pawn while simultaneously attacking Black's queen. The knight is protected by the pawn on e4, and none of Black's pawns can attack the knight."

What attack White might have had with the queen is now lost, and his pawn on c7 will be gobbled up by the Black queen. White's bishop sacrifice earlier was in vain. But all is not lost, as White has one very intimidating move possible."
31,Qxf6,g5f6,r1b1k2r/p1Pq1p1p/n2p1Qp1/4p3/2p1P3/5P2/PPP3PP/2KR2NR b kq - 0 16,"Black castles.

Though this game was played over the internet, it's not hard to imagine Black's face showing fear of a counterattack as the rook rumbles down into his territory."
34,Qxc7,d7c7,r1b2rk1/p1q2p1p/n2R1Qp1/4p3/2p1P3/5P2/PPP3PP/2K3NR w - - 0 18,"White now loses his first pawn in the game. Things are looking good for Black, but his extra bishop is useless along the c8-h3 diagonal as White has a strong pawn chain guarding half of it. Black's knight and two rooks are doing little at the moment, whereas White's rook on d6 is menacing Black's neighbourhood. Black's king should be feeling a little stressed what with White's queen so close, even if it threatens nothing at the moment, while the White king is relaxing comfortably on the first rank."
