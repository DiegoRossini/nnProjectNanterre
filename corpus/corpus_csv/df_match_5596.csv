1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"In this game I was 12 minutes late, as I couldn't find the venue and then had problems parking. I was playing for Penyffordd against Formby, at The Conservative Club, Wallasey. Typical of damn Tories!
In this game, I seem to be cruising to an easy win, but, perhaps suffering from what Alexander Kotov describes as ""Dizziness due to success"", my concentration lapses and I missed a clever tactic which would have given him a slightly better ending. Thankfully he misses it too. See if you can find it!
Anywya, he opens with Nf3, The Reti. I invite a transposition to either the Sicilian Defence, with 2. e4 or an English with 2. c4"

The Gruenfeld is a sharper opening than the King's Indian Defence and the extra tempo is more use to White."

If he had played c4, I would have been tempted to exchange, as after N(g8) to either f6 or e7 he can play Ng5. Also I didn't really fancy the sharp lines of the Benoni or Benko Gambit reversed after 7. c4 d5."

The Bd6 is my bad bishop, blocked in by pawns, I don't mind exchanging it! Now my Be3, that is another question, I am going to hang on to that. I could have doubled his pawns with Be3xNc4 here, but it would have been a huge mistake to give up my good bishop, just to double his pawns."

The advantages of having it on g6 is that White no longer has the queen check on h5 and in some variations I may be able to play my knight to h4. The disadvantage is that in some variations I would like to play g7-g5 to force the hand of his Bishop on f4. On balance g6 is better.
