1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,A bad move; Black voluntarily blocks his d-pawn to defend his e-pawn.  This makes it hard for him to develop freely (the white sq bishop will have to come to b7 after ...b6 - more lost time).  ...Nc6 is a natural and good move.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,A bad move; Black voluntarily blocks his d-pawn to defend his e-pawn.  This makes it hard for him to develop freely (the white sq bishop will have to come to b7 after ...b6 - more lost time).  ...Nc6 is a natural and good move.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,A bad move; Black voluntarily blocks his d-pawn to defend his e-pawn.  This makes it hard for him to develop freely (the white sq bishop will have to come to b7 after ...b6 - more lost time).  ...Nc6 is a natural and good move.
4,Bd6,f8d6,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/3b4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,A bad move; Black voluntarily blocks his d-pawn to defend his e-pawn.  This makes it hard for him to develop freely (the white sq bishop will have to come to b7 after ...b6 - more lost time).  ...Nc6 is a natural and good move.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqk1nr/pppp1ppp/3b4/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 3,"Ok; but given Black's lacklustre start, 3.c3, aiming to play d4 with a massive centre looks more ambitious."
6,c6,c7c6,rnbqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/2pb4/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Stops the white knight coming to d5, but at the cost of now blocking the c6 sq for his b8 knight.  Not a great start by Black.  Better would be ...Nc6, hoping for the best."
7,d3,d2d3,rnbqk1nr/pp1p1ppp/2pb4/4p3/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"A better bet would be 4.d4! Then, if ...exd4 5.Qxd4 (attacking the misplaced bishop on d6) and, if Black protects with 5...Qf6, 6. e5 forks bishop and queen."
8,h6,h7h6,rnbqk1nr/pp1p1pp1/2pb3p/4p3/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Because White is not challenging the centre (4. d3), Black is allowed to get away with a whole series of inconsequential pawn moves intended to hinder White but at the cost of lots of tempi (moves)."
9,Be2,f1e2,rnbqk1nr/pp1p1pp1/2pb3p/4p3/4P3/2NP1N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,"Realising his earlier error, Black redirects the bishop - abandonning the e5 pawn to its fate (having played d3, White need not worry about ...Qe7 after 6. Nxe5, since his e4-pawn is protected).  Now, if he can get in ...d6, Black may stand ok."
10,Bb4,d6b4,rnbqk1nr/pp1p1pp1/2p4p/4p3/1b2P3/2NP1N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 6,"Realising his earlier error, Black redirects the bishop - abandonning the e5 pawn to its fate (having played d3, White need not worry about ...Qe7 after 6.

11,Bd2,c1d2,rnbqk1nr/pp1p1pp1/2p4p/4p3/1b2P3/2NP1N2/PPPBBPPP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 3 6,"Again, perfectly alright but just Nxe5 is simpler. If Black had replied ...Qa5 (seemingly attacking both the knight on e5 and threatening to take twice on c3) White has the nice interposing move 7. Nc4! attacking the Black Queen.   6. 0-0 would also have been more enterprising, not fearing the doubled pawns after ...Bxc3  7.bxc3 when White could play d4 supported by the new pawn at c3."
12,b5,b7b5,rnbqk1nr/p2p1pp1/2p4p/1p2p3/1b2P3/2NP1N2/PPPBBPPP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"Another curious pawn move.  Hard to see what it's aimed at.  Again, the pawn at e5 is still undefended..."

Or, why not open up further with 19. d5!? (revealing an attack on the Qf6 from the b2 bishop and simultaneously attacking the bishop on e6).  After 19 ...Qxb2,  20. dxe6 and it's nearly over - so vulnerable is B's king."

This bad move weakens the white squares around White's king when Black's white-sq bishop is still on the board - hardly ever a good plan.  It also ties W's queen to the defence of the f3 knight (no longer pawn-protected and threatened by B's Qf6).
