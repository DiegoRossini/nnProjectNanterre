7,Bg3,f4g3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1p2p/5p2/3p2p1/3P4/5NB1/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"It doesn't make for a sac because the e pawn still blocks the Q, basically."
8,g4,g5g4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1p2p/5p2/3p4/3P2p1/5NB1/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"The normal h5 would be answered by h3, but black went for the hiper-aggressive choice, that is not the best one."
9,Nh4,f3h4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1p2p/5p2/3p4/3P2pN/6B1/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"Now my N is safe, and ready to go g6 if black dares to move his h pawn."
10,h5,h7h5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1p3/5p2/3p3p/3P2pN/6B1/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"He did, solidifying his outpost in g4, but ""giving"" me g6 in the process, which is an almost fatal mistake."
11,Qd3,d1d3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1p3/5p2/3p3p/3P2pN/3Q2B1/PPP1PPPP/RN2KB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"Despite its weird position, the Q is aiming to g6, with lethal effect on black's position. Moreover, it prevents f5 by black."
12,Kd7,e8d7,rnbq1bnr/pppkp3/5p2/3p3p/3P2pN/3Q2B1/PPP1PPPP/RN2KB1R w KQ - 2 7,"Well, that's funny and tricky. Of course black had Rh6, preventing Qg6+, and standing for Ng6 - not so dangerous. But this - a ""bad"" move, makes me think a lot: I can easily find myself overrisking and falling into blunders..."
13,Nc3,b1c3,rnbq1bnr/pppkp3/5p2/3p3p/3P2pN/2NQ2B1/PPP1PPPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 3 7,"Developing - threatening d5, thinking in a future Nb5. Not a good plan, but Ng6 seemed pretty pointless, now. It was not, because after Rh6, Nf4 would have been very interesting, pressing e6."
14,e6,e7e6,rnbq1bnr/pppk4/4pp2/3p3p/3P2pN/2NQ2B1/PPP1PPPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 0 8,"Covering f5, too. Too bad."
15,e4,e2e4,rnbq1bnr/pppk4/4pp2/3p3p/3PP1pN/2NQ2B1/PPP2PPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 0 8,Let's try to open the position! My superior developement will then prevail.
16,dxe4,d5e4,rnbq1bnr/pppk4/4pp2/7p/3Pp1pN/2NQ2B1/PPP2PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 0 9,Hard decision: Q or R to take on e4?
17,Nxe4,c3e4,rnbq1bnr/pppk4/4pp2/7p/3PN1pN/3Q2B1/PPP2PPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 0 9,"Well, Nc5+, BxN, dxB+, etc, is the worst thing that can happen to me... so this can't be bad."
18,f5,f6f5,rnbq1bnr/pppk4/4p3/5p1p/3PN1pN/3Q2B1/PPP2PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 0 10,"I expected the exchange, regretting I didn't take before the Ng6 - NxBf8 - train, which would have left me with good control of black's squares from g3 - e5..."

21,Ng6,h4g6,rnbqkbnr/ppp5/4p1N1/2N2p1p/3P2p1/3Q2B1/PPP2PPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 3 11,"Late, but I decided I had to caugh this train."

24,Ne7,g8e7,rnbqkb2/ppp1n3/4p1Nr/2N2p1p/3P2pB/3Q4/PPP2PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 6 13,"Too bad, I can't risk anymore (RxN is possible), so I have to solve the issue the best way for me. Which is it?"
25,Nxf8,g6f8,rnbqkN2/ppp1n3/4p2r/2N2p1p/3P2pB/3Q4/PPP2PPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 0 13,"The N would be pinned to the Q, and I have control of the black squares."
