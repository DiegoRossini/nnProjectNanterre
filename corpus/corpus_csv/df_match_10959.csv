1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,My standard.
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,? This plays seems suspect to as my opponent just gave the middle to me without a fight.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,? This plays seems suspect to as my opponent just gave the middle to me without a fight.
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/4p1p1/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,? This plays seems suspect to as my opponent just gave the middle to me without a fight.
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/4p1p1/8/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,Gaining more material in the center.
6,b6,b7b6,rnbqkbnr/p1pp1p1p/1p2p1p1/8/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"?! I do not understand this move. It accomplishes almost nothing, at least the way I see it."
7,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/p1pp1p1p/1p2p1p1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,"This is a nice defense I like to set up if given the chance. It is a nice way of controlling the center with plenty of back up, and leaves room for the bishops to get into the fight."
8,Qf6,d8f6,rnb1kbnr/p1pp1p1p/1p2pqp1/8/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,"Not a great move as the queen can't do much from that position and is quickly forced away to where it is even more useless. This, to me, is the deciding move of the game."
9,Bg5,c1g5,rnb1kbnr/p1pp1p1p/1p2pqp1/6B1/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 3 5,Forced to where it is completely useless.
10,Qg7,f6g7,rnb1kbnr/p1pp1pqp/1p2p1p1/6B1/3PP3/2N2N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 4 6,Forced to where it is completely useless.
11,Nb5,c3b5,rnb1kbnr/p1pp1pqp/1p2p1p1/1N4B1/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 5 6,Now my opponent has two fronts to worry about. With my knight about to grab a rook my opponent has a very critical decision to make.
12,h6,h7h6,rnb1kbnr/p1pp1pq1/1p2p1pp/1N4B1/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"Worst possible move to make. With my knight one move away from nabbing the rook and the black king pinned, 6...f6 would save the game and force the bishop away. Or, if I chose to grab the rook, my opponent would gain my bishop."
13,Nxc7#,b5c7,rnb1kbnr/p1Np1pq1/1p2p1pp/6B1/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,Thats all folks. I'm sure there's some brillant statement I'm supposed to make but I really don't have much. A series of bad moves ment an early shower for my opponent.
