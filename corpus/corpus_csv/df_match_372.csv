1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I am annotating this on behalf of my good friend Jeremy (Teardrop34).
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,So it starts conventionally enough.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,So it starts conventionally enough.
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,With possibilities of the Gruenfeld or the King's Indian.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,With possibilities of the Gruenfeld or the King's Indian.
6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,So it is a Gruenfeld...
7,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3p4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,So it is a Gruenfeld...
8,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3p4/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,This is The Russian Variation - a well respected variation. It was possible to go back into the exchange variation with 5. cxd5 Nxd5 6. e4 Nxc3 7. bxc3 c5 8. Rb1 O-O 9. Be2. I tend to think both are good answers to the Gruenfeld.
9,Qb3,d1b3,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/5np1/3p4/2PP4/1QN2N2/PP2PPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 3 5,This is The Russian Variation - a well respected variation.

10,dxc4,d5c4,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/5np1/8/2pP4/1QN2N2/PP2PPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQkq - 0 6,This exchange is normal - black gives up the centre and hopes to then counter-attack it.
11,Qxc4,b3c4,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/5np1/8/2QP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 0 6,This exchange is normal - black gives up the centre and hopes to then counter-attack it.
12,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/5np1/8/2QP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ - 1 7,All standard so far.
13,e4,e2e4,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/5np1/8/2QPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQ - 0 7,All standard so far.
14,a6,a7a6,rnbq1rk1/1pp1ppbp/p4np1/8/2QPP3/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQ - 0 8,"I think it looks strange, because it gives up the d5 square but in this position, e5 is the most commonly played move, not Be2 (which looks very natural to me). e5 often leads to the famous queen sacrifice line Be6 9. exf6	Bxc4 10. fxg7 Kxg7 11.	Bxc4	where white has given up a pawn and queen for two bishops and a knight. The verdict is out on this position - but it is considered roughly equal. This is now the Alekhine (Hungarian) variation of the Russian Gruenfeld!"
15,Be2,f1e2,rnbq1rk1/1pp1ppbp/p4np1/8/2QPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 1 8,"I think it looks strange, because it gives up the d5 square but in this position, e5 is the most commonly played move, not Be2 (which looks very natural to me). e5 often leads to the famous queen sacrifice line Be6 9. exf6	Bxc4 10. fxg7 Kxg7 11.

16,b5,b7b5,rnbq1rk1/2p1ppbp/p4np1/1p6/2QPP3/2N2N2/PP2BPPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 0 9,The queen retreat to b3 is far more common than to d3.
17,Qd3,c4d3,rnbq1rk1/2p1ppbp/p4np1/1p6/3PP3/2NQ1N2/PP2BPPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 1 9,The queen retreat to b3 is far more common than to d3.

19,d5,d4d5,rn1q1rk1/1bp1ppbp/p4np1/1p1P4/4P3/2NQ1N2/PP2BPPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 0 10,The Gameknot Post Game Computer Analysis (PGCA) gives this as white's first mistake and I tend to agree. (and so does Fritz!)

21,O-O,e1g1,rn1q1rk1/1b2ppbp/p1p2np1/1p1P4/4P3/2NQ1N2/PP2BPPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 1 11,Fritz seems to think it was time for white to bail out with d5xc6.

23,Rd1,f1d1,rn1q1rk1/1b2ppbp/p4np1/1p1p4/4P3/2NQ1N2/PP2BPPP/R1BR2K1 b - - 1 12,Fritz here likes e4-e5 as well as Rd1.

29,Qb3,d3b3,r2q1rk1/1b2ppbp/p5p1/1p1P4/1n6/1Q3N2/PP2BPPP/R1BR2K1 b - - 2 15,Fritz thinks this is the best square for the queen.
