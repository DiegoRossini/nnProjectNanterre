Black looks for pawn play on the Q-side, coupled with action down the e-file, or along the long dark diagonal.  White's usual plan is to storm through the centre and K-side.  The battles are apt to be sharp, and bloody."

13,Bd3,f1d3,rnbqkb1r/pp3p1p/3p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2NB4/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 1 7,This move became popular in the 1960s after White victories in the games Ojanen-Keres and Penrose-Tal.  GM Mischa Tal was World Champion when he lost his game to the English master Jonathan Penrose.
14,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2NB4/PP3PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 2 8,Continuing in the manner of Master Penrose...

16,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2NB4/PP2NPPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 4 9,"The games quoted above went 9.0-0, but this move seems a very good alternative.  Sooner or later White will want to play f2-f4, and he doesn't want to be outflanked by a knight or a bishop coming in at g4."

19,O-O,e1g1,rnbqr1k1/pp3pbp/3p1np1/2pP4/4P3/2NB3P/PP2NPP1/R1BQ1RK1 b - - 2 10,(!?) Unexpected.  Black wants the e-pawn and offers the pawn to divert the bishop's attention from it.

For one thing, 12.a3 - to hold back the b-pawn - would have been met by ...a5, when suddenly Black has got his thematic pawn roller well under way.  The second reason is that now Black's Queen side pawns are broken up and weakened.  Black will have to hope his centre operations are worth these concessions."

Ordinarily one might choose to move the other knight to threaten the rook, but that would have left the e2-knight still to move, after Rf1-e1.  Besides, the b5-Knight is having an inhibilting effect on Black's Q-side, it seemed to me (pressure on d6 and c7, for starters, but also the possibility of Nb5-a3xc4)."
28,Rh4,e4h4,rnbq2k1/p4pbp/3p2p1/1N1P4/2p4r/2N4P/PP3PP1/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 2 15,Interesting!  What might this portend?  Of course White has to consider the possibility of ...Bxh3 and a K-side attack by Black.
29,Re1,f1e1,rnbq2k1/p4pbp/3p2p1/1N1P4/2p4r/2N4P/PP3PP1/R1BQR1K1 b - - 3 15,Seizing the e-file.  It is often said that the best counter to a flank action is a counter-action in the centre.  But Black hadn't yet declared himself...
30,Bxh3,c8h3,rn1q2k1/p4pbp/3p2p1/1N1P4/2p4r/2N4b/PP3PP1/R1BQR1K1 w - - 0 16,(!?) Now he does!  Considering that White has just the one piece on the K-side - the rook at e1 - this at first sight looks promising.  But what follows is the first forcing line of the game.  White had reason to believe he could survive this attack.
31,gxh3,g2h3,rn1q2k1/p4pbp/3p2p1/1N1P4/2p4r/2N4P/PP3P2/R1BQR1K1 b - - 0 16,"Black has two pawns for the piece, but the problem he faces is that White controls most of the K-side. If Black can establish his Bishop safely at e5, maybe he could achieve something of interest, but first he has to find a decent square for his rook."
