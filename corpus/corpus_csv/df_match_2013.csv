1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was a fascinating game. After a complex middle game - which the post-match computer analysis (pmca) says Black makes a couple of mistake. It comes down to a queen v 2 rooks ending. The computer thinks I made a mistake, but my opponent says it was drawn anyway. Is he right? And if he is right, were his two ""mistakes"" really mistakes, if he was holding the position anyway. Is the pmca right, or is my opponent right? Please study and tell me your views, dear reader."

6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"He opts for the Grünfeld Defence, (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%BCnfeld_Defence) rather than the King's Indian Defence with Bg7 instead of d7-d5"
7,cxd5,c4d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3P4/3P4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"I continue with the exchange variation, the most popular reply. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%BCnfeld_Defence#Exchange_Variation:_4.cxd5_Nxd5_5.e4"
8,Nxd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/6p1/3n4/3P4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,So he takes back

12,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/2P5/P4PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 7,"He continues with development. White can develop his pieces in a number of ways in the Exchange Variation. For decades, theory held that the correct method of development was with Bc4 and Ne2, often followed by 0-0 and f4–f5, playing for a central breakthrough or kingside attack. It was generally thought that an early Nf3 was weak in the Exchange Variation because it allowed Black too much pressure on the centre with ...Bg4. In the late 1970s, however, Karpov, Kasparov and others found different methods to play the Exchange Variation with White, often involving an early Rb1 to remove the rook from the sensitive a1–h8 diagonal, as well as attempting to hinder the development of Black's queenside."
13,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 7,"With this move, I am planning on playing Rb1 next move."

19,d5,d4d5,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2n3p1/2pP4/4P3/2P2N2/P3BPPP/1RBQK2R b K - 0 10,"And I hit the knight, going into very complicated variations! Black can take the pawn on c3 with his Bishop with check, but after Bc1-d2 Black has to part with his powerful black squared bishop, as his knight on c6 is hanging. After Bxc3+ 11. Bd2 Bxd2+ 12. Qxd2 white has full compensation for the sacrifices pawn, so black doesn't normally accept the offered pawn."
