1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was an unrated game,  where I deliberately let my opponent have an extra queen early on. I do manage to gradually get back into the game, and reach an ending where I have three connected extra pawn, two of them passed pawns, which more or less balance out her extra rook. But then I misplay it horribly, and I get mated!"
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,So we start conventionally enough.
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,I develop my knight.
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 3,So does she!
5,Qh5,d1h5,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p2Q/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 3 3,and I give away my queen!
6,Nxh5,f6h5,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4p2n/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 0 4,She takes.
7,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/8/4p2n/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 1 4,I develop.
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p2n/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 2 5,So does she.
9,d3,d2d3,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p2n/2B1P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 0 5,I open a line for my other bishop.
10,Bb4,f8b4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p2n/1bB1P3/2NP4/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 1 6,I'm not happy here. I was afraid she would swap her bishop of my knight.
11,Nge2,g1e2,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p2n/1bB1P3/2NP4/PPP1NPPP/R1B1K2R b KQkq - 2 6,So I make sure that at least my pawns are not doubled.
12,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p2n/1bB1P3/2NP4/PPP1NPPP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 3 7,She castles
13,O-O,e1g1,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p2n/1bB1P3/2NP4/PPP1NPPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 4 7,"So do I. I think her best move now is to exchange on c3. When materially ahead, exchange pieces, but not pawns, as a general rule of thumb."
14,d6,d7d6,r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p2n/1bB1P3/2NP4/PPP1NPPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 0 8,But she develops instead.
15,Nd5,c3d5,r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2np4/3Np2n/1bB1P3/3P4/PPP1NPPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 1 8,So I move my knight.
16,a6,a7a6,r1bq1rk1/1pp2ppp/p1np4/3Np2n/1bB1P3/3P4/PPP1NPPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 0 9,I'm not quite sure of the reason for this move.

18,Bc5,b4c5,r1bq1rk1/1pp2ppp/p1np4/2bNp2n/2B1P3/2PP4/PP2NPPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 1 10,She retreats
19,b4,b2b4,r1bq1rk1/1pp2ppp/p1np4/2bNp2n/1PB1P3/2PP4/P3NPPP/R1B2RK1 b - - 0 10,I hit it again.
20,Bb6,c5b6,r1bq1rk1/1pp2ppp/pbnp4/3Np2n/1PB1P3/2PP4/P3NPPP/R1B2RK1 w - - 1 11,She retreats again.
