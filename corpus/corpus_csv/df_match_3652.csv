1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"(!?)  Very unusual (compared with 3.Bb5, 3.Bc4, 3.Nc3, 3.d4), but the move is not bad.  It can lead into the king's Indian Attack, with the bishop developing at e2 or (more likely) g2."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"(!?)  Very unusual (compared with 3.Bb5, 3.Bc4, 3.Nc3, 3.d4), but the move is not bad.  It can lead into the king's Indian Attack, with the bishop developing at e2 or (more likely) g2."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"(!?)  Very unusual (compared with 3.Bb5, 3.Bc4, 3.Nc3, 3.d4), but the move is not bad.  It can lead into the king's Indian Attack, with the bishop developing at e2 or (more likely) g2."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"(!?)  Very unusual (compared with 3.Bb5, 3.Bc4, 3.Nc3, 3.d4), but the move is not bad.  It can lead into the king's Indian Attack, with the bishop developing at e2 or (more likely) g2."
5,d3,d2d3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"(!?)  Very unusual (compared with 3.Bb5, 3.Bc4, 3.Nc3, 3.d4), but the move is not bad.  It can lead into the king's Indian Attack, with the bishop developing at e2 or (more likely) g2."
6,d6,d7d6,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/4P3/3P1N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,A cagey response.  Black doesn't want to over-commit in the face of White's idiosyncratic choice of opening.
7,d4,d3d4,r1bqkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,(?) Now this really is bizarre.  In effect Whate has sacrificed a tempo in a Scotch Game/Philidor Defence type of game.
8,Bg4,c8g4,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/3PP1b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,A handy pin.  What will white make of it?
9,h3,h2h3,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/3PP1b1/5N1P/PPP2PP1/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"(?) Often it is a good idea to smack the bishop about after it sets up a pin like like, forcing Black to decide (if she hasn't already) to take or not on f3.  But here it will lose a pawn.  The right move was 5.d5, keeping the game more or less level."
10,Bxf3,g4f3,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/3PP3/5b1P/PPP2PP1/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,(!) Wins the pawn at d4.
11,Qxf3,d1f3,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2np4/4p3/3PP3/5Q1P/PPP2PP1/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"Best, to preserve the shape of the K-side pawns.  But it will cost White a tempo at least.  The d-pawn is, of course, a goner whatever White did."
12,Nxd4,c6d4,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/3nP3/5Q1P/PPP2PP1/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"Again, preferable to capturing with the pawn..."
13,Qd3,f3d3,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/3nP3/3Q3P/PPP2PP1/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 1 7,"Blocks the light-square bishop (LSB), but going back to d1 was not enticing, and on c3 she would have blocked the knight... or the c-pawn..."
14,Nf6,g8f6,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/3nP3/3Q3P/PPP2PP1/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 2 8,"(?!) An obvious move to make, to drive away the enemy knight, but it hampers his own Knight's development.  The Gameknot Engine (GKE) likes 8.Be3, the threat being to exchange on d4 and recover the pawn.  Black can defend easily enough (...Nc6 or ...c5) but White would have, within constraints,  a fairly easy development."
15,c3,c2c3,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/3nP3/2PQ3P/PP3PP1/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 8,"(?!) An obvious move to make, to drive away the enemy knight, but it hampers his own Knight's development.

16,Nc6,d4c6,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4p3/4P3/2PQ3P/PP3PP1/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 1 9,"(?) A desirable break, but played much too early.  Black should lose a pawn, here, bring material back to even..."

21,Bxf6,g5f6,r2qk2r/ppp1bppp/2n2B2/3pp3/4P3/2PQ3P/PP2BPP1/RN2K2R b KQkq - 0 11,"(??)  The miscalculation, I suspect, really happened a move earlier.  Now Black loses a piece."

24,Rxd8,a8d8,3rk2r/ppp1bppp/2n2B2/4p3/4p3/2P4P/PP2BPP1/RN2K2R w KQk - 0 13,"Developing and attacking the lead e-pawn.  Very well.  Black has two pawns for the Bishop, and a considerable centre that she probably ought to preserve by ...f5.  Still, White must have the advantage here, once he unravels his pieces a bit."
25,Bxe7,f6e7,3rk2r/ppp1Bppp/2n5/4p3/4p3/2P4P/PP2BPP1/RN2K2R b KQk - 0 13,"Developing and attacking the lead e-pawn.  Very well.

26,Nxe7,c6e7,3rk2r/ppp1nppp/8/4p3/4p3/2P4P/PP2BPP1/RN2K2R w KQk - 0 14,"Developing and attacking the lead e-pawn.  Very well.

27,Nd2,b1d2,3rk2r/ppp1nppp/8/4p3/4p3/2P4P/PP1NBPP1/R3K2R b KQk - 1 14,"Developing and attacking the lead e-pawn.  Very well.

28,O-O,e8g8,3r1rk1/ppp1nppp/8/4p3/4p3/2P4P/PP1NBPP1/R3K2R w KQ - 2 15,(?)  It is quite understandable that Bolack wanted to mobilise quickly and hope thereby to put up some sort of fight.  A rating differential of 100 ELO can be for some players a powerful motivator!  But she would in my view have done better to have tried ...f5 here with a view to creating some problems for White with the imposing central pawn phalanx.
29,Nxe4,d2e4,3r1rk1/ppp1nppp/8/4p3/4N3/2P4P/PP2BPP1/R3K2R b KQ - 0 15,Keeping the White Knight out of c5.
30,b6,b7b6,3r1rk1/p1p1nppp/1p6/4p3/4N3/2P4P/PP2BPP1/R3K2R w KQ - 0 16,Keeping the White Knight out of c5.
31,O-O,e1g1,3r1rk1/p1p1nppp/1p6/4p3/4N3/2P4P/PP2BPP1/R4RK1 b - - 1 16,(!?) See next move by Black...

34,Kh8,g8h8,3r1r1k/p1p1n1pp/1p6/4pp2/2B1N3/2P4P/PP3PP1/R4RK1 w - - 2 18,"(?!) The GKE calls thsi a mistake, indicating 17...Nd5 (though after 18.Ng5 Rfe8  19.Rfe1 e4  20.Nf3! Kf7  21.Red1 exf3  22.Bxd5ch Kf6  23.Bxf3 c5  24.Rxd8 Rxd8  25.Re1 Rd2  26.Re2 Rxe2  27.Bxe2  the ending ought to be a comfortable win for White, with his Bishop extra).  But probably the real error was a move earlier, when 16...h6 (instead of ...f5) would have prevented all this.  But who knew?"
35,Ng5,e4g5,3r1r1k/p1p1n1pp/1p6/4ppN1/2B5/2P4P/PP3PP1/R4RK1 b - - 3 18,"(!)  With forks at e6 and f7 threatened.  ""Was there a cure? 'The higher the fewer!' the learned doctor said."" (Spike Milligan - 'Maveric Prowles').  What cure there is will still cost Black something."
