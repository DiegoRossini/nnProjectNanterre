1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"My opponent opens with what I consider to be the strongest opening move.  The King's Pawn avoids many of the slower manoeuvrings of other openings, allowing White to concentrate on fast attacking play."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I respond with the Sicilian.  It creates an unbalanced board, allowing Black to attempt to call some of the shots early on in the game."
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,White preserves the option of an open or closed Sicilian.  Black must now be cautious.
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/4P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Black is looking to counter White’s expected fianchetto with one of his own after 4.g3 b5.
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,Black is looking to counter White’s expected fianchetto with one of his own after 4.g3 b5.
6,a6,a7a6,rnbqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p3p3/2p5/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,Black is looking to counter White’s expected fianchetto with one of his own after 4.g3 b5.
7,a3,a2a3,rnbqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/p3p3/2p5/4P3/P1N2N2/1PPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"I think 4.g3 was the better move here, not really sure what the aim of White's was.  I suspect it was a passive move, waiting to see what Black's intentions were.  But I think this move tosses away the advantage White has by virtue of the colour of his pieces."
8,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/1p3ppp/p3p3/2pp4/4P3/P1N2N2/1PPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Black responds with d5,  showing a real willingness to contest over the central squares."
