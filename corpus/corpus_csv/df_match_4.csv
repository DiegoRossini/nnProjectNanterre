1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"In the first round I was black against  Paweł Pityński, 1485, the tournament organiser, who I had beaten when I played in the same tournament in April. Playing black I developed an attack on his king, which was wandering round the king-side. I forced him to sacrifice a pawn and the exchange. But he got back into it. He had a winning position, but we both became short of time and we reached an opposite coloured bishops ending which probably was drawn. So I wanted to win this one."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Incidentally this was reconstructed after the game. I think I have done it accurately, but it is possible that the move order is not correct."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Queen's Gambit.
4,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Slav Defence.
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,The usual move.
6,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p1b2/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,But this is slightly unusual.
7,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p1b2/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 4,The most common reply.
8,e6,e7e6,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3p1b2/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,And so is this.
9,Bf4,c1f4,rn1qkbnr/pp3ppp/2p1p3/3p1b2/2PP1B2/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"So I also decided to develop my queen-side bishop outside the pawn chain. Looking at the opening database now, I see that Qb3 is more commonly played, and scores better. That is on its way..."
10,Nf6,g8f6,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p1b2/2PP1B2/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,His knight comes out.
11,e3,e2e3,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/3p1b2/2PP1B2/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,So that if he takes on c4 I can recapture immediately with my bishop.
12,Bd6,f8d6,rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/2pbpn2/3p1b2/2PP1B2/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,He develops Bf8.
13,Bxd6,f4d6,rn1qk2r/pp3ppp/2pBpn2/3p1b2/2PP4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"I am happy to exchange my ""bad"" bishop on the same coloured squares as my central pawns."
