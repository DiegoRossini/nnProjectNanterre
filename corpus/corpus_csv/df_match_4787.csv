1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Here i am again boring you with another of my games but here we go any way
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,to play a different opening to my usual d5 i played the often played e6
3,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,he gets straight into control of the centre
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,but he can't hog it all- white has to share the centre
5,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"now this is a position i usually want to avoid because often from such positions, i feel at a loss how to get at the king apart from when it castles"
6,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"but i still can break this formation by the strength of pushing my pawn to c5, threatening to involve my bishop into the game!"
7,c3,c2c3,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,not uncommon but if i were white i would have tried to avoid that
8,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/3pP3/3p4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,so i play the obvoius
9,cxd4,c3d4,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"now, though it is a similar position to before, whites defences are much weaker and i have opened up my line of attck for my bishop!"
10,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/3pP3/3P4/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,push right into the developing of pieces
11,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/3pP3/3P4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 6,so does he
12,Bd7,c8d7,r2qkbnr/pp1b1ppp/2n1p3/3pP3/3P4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 3 7,a subtle hint that my knight is likely to advance further
13,Bb5,f1b5,r2qkbnr/pp1b1ppp/2n1p3/1B1pP3/3P4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 4 7,"not exactly pinning my knight in a dangerous way, in fact it can be an exscuse to move the knight"
14,Nxe5,c6e5,r2qkbnr/pp1b1ppp/4p3/1B1pn3/3P4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,which i take obvious advantage of!
15,dxe5,d4e5,r2qkbnr/pp1b1ppp/4p3/1B1pP3/8/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,"if i were him, i would have done BXd7+"
16,Bxb5,d7b5,r2qkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/1b1pP3/8/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 9,but here i get a point ahead
17,Nc3,b1c3,r2qkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/1b1pP3/8/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 9,he keeps developing
18,Bb4,f8b4,r2qk1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/1b1pP3/1b6/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 10,"but i like where my white-squared bishop is placed, so play the pinning move"
19,Nd4,f3d4,r2qk1nr/pp3ppp/4p3/1b1pP3/1b1N4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 10,i'm not certain why white would play that?
20,Bd7,b5d7,r2qk1nr/pp1b1ppp/4p3/3pP3/1b1N4/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 4 11,but i still pull my bishop to safety just in case
