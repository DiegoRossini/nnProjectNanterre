1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!  Another tight middle game battle turns in my favour.  This time, Glenda, whose magic powers are sometimes as good as Mildred Hubble's in Jill Murphy's The Worst Witch manages to get into the enemy camp and turn a couple of enemy pawns into sludge before she exchanges herself for the Wicked Witch of the West.  I then manage to simplify further until Bob voluntarily enters a K & P ending.  What did I say about these endings when you are a pawn or more down in material?  Just don't go there......"
