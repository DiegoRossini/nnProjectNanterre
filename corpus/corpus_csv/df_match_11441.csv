1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is the first time we have played, so I didn't know what to expect. I like the Center Counter against an unknown opponent, as it is safe and easy to play. The drawback is that it doesn't fight for a win like the Sicilian, but I am content with my endgame skills. If I can win a pawn I will trade down and try to outplay my opponent in the endgame."

3,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3pP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,It is most common to trade pawns on d5 since white can play 3. Nc3 to gain a tempo on the queen. The text can transpose to a French Advanced pawn structure.
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3pP3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,And so we have it. The difference between this and the normal Advanced Variation of the French is that black has not played ...Nf6 yet here. Normally white would wait for the e5 thrust until the knight has developed.
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3pP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,And so we have it. The difference between this and the normal Advanced Variation of the French is that black has not played ...Nf6 yet here. Normally white would wait for the e5 thrust until the knight has developed.
6,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,The standard response to put pressure on the white center.
7,Bb5+,f1b5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/1BppP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 4,"I am tempted to quote Fischer here, ""Patzer sees check, patzer gives check."" I see no real purpose for this move."
8,Bd7,c8d7,rn1qkbnr/pp1b1ppp/4p3/1BppP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 5,Offering to trade my bad bishop for white's good bishop.
9,Bxd7+,b5d7,rn1qkbnr/pp1B1ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,And white obliges.
10,Qxd7,d8d7,rn2kbnr/pp1q1ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,This recapture allows the b8 knight to develop to c6 and pressure d4.
11,Nf3,g1f3,rn2kbnr/pp1q1ppp/4p3/2ppP3/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"A good developing move that prepares castling, although c3 may be more common in this position."
12,cxd4,c5d4,rn2kbnr/pp1q1ppp/4p3/3pP3/3p4/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"Probably premature, but then I am just an intermediate hacker, so mistakes are expected :)"
13,Nxd4,f3d4,rn2kbnr/pp1q1ppp/4p3/3pP3/3N4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,"Offering another trade, that if accepted, keeps me ahead in development."
14,Nc6,b8c6,r3kbnr/pp1q1ppp/2n1p3/3pP3/3N4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 8,"Offering another trade, that if accepted, keeps me ahead in development."
15,O-O,e1g1,r3kbnr/pp1q1ppp/2n1p3/3pP3/3N4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 2 8,"White castles, which can never be bad. OK, maybe it can be, but it usually isn't."
16,Bc5,f8c5,r3k1nr/pp1q1ppp/2n1p3/2bpP3/3N4/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 3 9,"Threatening to win the knight, but white has a myriad of good responses."
17,Nxc6,d4c6,r3k1nr/pp1q1ppp/2N1p3/2bpP3/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 9,But this one allows me to stay ahead in development.
18,Qxc6,d7c6,r3k1nr/pp3ppp/2q1p3/2bpP3/8/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 10,"I was torn between wanting to capture towards the center with ...bxc6 and the text move, but I decided not to isolate the a pawn. Stronger players could tell you whether my choice was correct or not :)"
19,Qg4,d1g4,r3k1nr/pp3ppp/2q1p3/2bpP3/6Q1/8/PPP2PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 1 10,"A brazen attempt to win the g pawn, but I haven't castled yet, and there is no good way to protect it. I considered sacrificing it with:
10...Ne7
11. Qxg7 O-O-O
but then the f pawn falls too, and I didn't want to play a 2 pawn gambit."
20,g6,g7g6,r3k1nr/pp3p1p/2q1p1p1/2bpP3/6Q1/8/PPP2PPP/RNB2RK1 w kq - 0 11,So I play the ugly ...g6.
21,c3,c2c3,r3k1nr/pp3p1p/2q1p1p1/2bpP3/6Q1/2P5/PP3PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 0 11,"This move baffled me. I expected white to make a play to invade my kingside on the dark squares, but c3 seems to be simply a waste of time. Not to mention it takes the c3 square away from the b1 knight."
22,Ne7,g8e7,r3k2r/pp2np1p/2q1p1p1/2bpP3/6Q1/2P5/PP3PPP/RNB2RK1 w kq - 1 12,"It is imperative that I get my king to safety by castling, and even though the pawn cover is compromised, the kingside is still better than the queenside. At some future point I can get the c5 bishop to f8 and then g7 to help defend the dark squares around my king."
23,b4,b2b4,r3k2r/pp2np1p/2q1p1p1/2bpP3/1P4Q1/2P5/P4PPP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 0 12,And now the point of c3 becomes clear. White is attempting to keep my bishop from getting to the kingside by getting it off the a3-f8 diagonal.
