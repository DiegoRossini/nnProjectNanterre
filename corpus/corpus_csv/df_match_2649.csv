The friend I was staying with in Dayton was playing in  the 2-day schedule anyway so it wasn't that hard of a decision. This first  round on Saturday morning was only G/90, while all the others were 30/90,  SD/1 d/5."

I wanted to see what he would play against this, see if I could rattle his cage at all. I always knew I would transpose into the mainline sicilian with d4 and Nd4, sometimes this can be a good  system to play if you want to delay and see what sicilian system your  opponent may be aiming for, you can always play g3, Bg2 and play a closed  sicilian if you don't like their variation."
