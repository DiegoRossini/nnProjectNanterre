1,g3,g2g3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/6P1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Reti was one of the founding members of the ""Hypermodern"" approach to chess (and in particular, opening theory). Delayed control of the center by setting up flank attacks is the foundation of this theory."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/6P1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"A ""Classical"" response, staking a claim in the center."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/5NP1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Unusual and provacative. Reti is enticing Alekhine to push his e pawn.
4,e4,e5e4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4p3/5NP1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,Alekhine obliges.
5,Nd4,f3d4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3Np3/6P1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"This knight is now roaming the board unsupported (not entirely unusual in the ""hypermodern"" train of thought)."
6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3Np3/6P1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"Black supports e4 and now apparently owns the middle of the board. He must be careful of over-reaching, however, as white was obviously planning to conduct flank attacks anyway."
7,d3,d2d3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3Np3/3P2P1/PPP1PP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,! An attempt to undermine black's strong central pawns.
8,exd3,e4d3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3N4/3p2P1/PPP1PP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"?! Alekhine gives up his advanced e pawn, and control of the middle. I guess the ""Classical"" theme wasn't for him either......"
9,Qxd3,d1d3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3p4/3N4/3Q2P1/PPP1PP1P/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"Apparently, Reti didn't want to open up the e file by playing 5. exd."

12,Bb4+,f8b4,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/1b1N4/3Q2P1/PPP1PPBP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 3 7,"? In post mortem, Alekhine admitted this move was a mistake. In analysis, he preferred 6...c5. With this move and whites response, black basically trades a ""better"" bishop for a ""good"" one."
13,Bd2,c1d2,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/1b1N4/3Q2P1/PPPBPPBP/RN2K2R b KQkq - 4 7,"! Reti gets agressive. By mixing it up in this fashion, Reti declares that he will be the one to control the flow of this game. Even Alekhine gave this move a ""!""."
14,Bxd2+,b4d2,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/3N4/3Q2P1/PPPbPPBP/RN2K2R w KQkq - 0 8,"! Reti gets agressive. By mixing it up in this fashion, Reti declares that he will be the one to control the flow of this game. Even Alekhine gave this move a ""!""."

21,Qc4,d3c4,r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/5n2/3P4/1nQN4/6P1/PP1NPPBP/R3K2R b KQ - 2 11,This knight now anchors it's comrade on d4.

I'm reminded of the old saying ""When given the choice of which rook to move, spend extra time analysing every possible ensuing continuation. Evaluate the strength of every piece. Figure out which rook will do the most good on the open file. Then move the other one:)"""
28,Bg4,c8g4,r2qr1k1/pp3ppp/2p2n2/3n4/2QN2b1/1N4P1/PP2PPBP/R2R2K1 w - - 4 15,"Strong developing move, which prevents white from moving his e pawn."
