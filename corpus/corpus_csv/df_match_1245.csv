5,e4,e2e4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/5n2/4p3/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"A conservative approach. Good. Any other move was good, c5, or exd4..."
6,d6,d7d6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"Still more conservative, but wrong. Black will end up very cramped. And white can play dxe, and if dxe, QxQ+. Not fatal, but small mistakes like this one help games to be more interesting! :-))"
