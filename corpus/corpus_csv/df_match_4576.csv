1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"My third loss out of three ""walking the walk"" club games.  My assessment is that bad moves at 12, 16, and 19 cost me the game.  Sixteen I can live with, though hopefully will not repeat.  But 12 and 19 were careless.  Hopefully I will learn from these mistakes and use these lessons to strengthen my game."

I had considered moving the bishop back but stubbornly thought of how that would represent a wasted move (given that I could have gone to d2 or e3 at move 10).  It did not occur to me that black would play g5 here.

Dark square bishop will likely be captured next move.  I'm looking at g1 and g3 as potentially good places to put my rooks (though the rook on the d-file is happy enough for now).  For the moment, despite being down in material, I believe I have a slight mobility advantage.  To free up his N & lsb, I expect black's rook will move to c8 (or poss Q to c7 or d7).  So any mobility advantage will vanish very soon."
