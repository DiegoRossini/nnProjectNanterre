He would first construct an unbreakable center with pawns on d3 and c3 in order to keep his opponent at arms length. Then he would gradually build up a direct attack on the king side, often by advancing g2-g4 and bring his knight all the way over from b1 to g3."

The answer: Nimzowitish once said that chess mastery was revealed by making a pawn move on the wing with your mind on the center. With the prophylactic 9. h3 white prevents the pin that would otherwise undermine the defense of the d4-pawn after 9. d4 Bg4!

Black gives up control of d5 in order to gain a lions share of the c -file especially c5 and c4. If white is not careful a black knight on c4 is the barer of doom and gloom. Therefore, white must play to prevent that from happening."

From here it can get quite mind boggling the options that are available to black. For example, a popular alternative to ...Qc7 is 11. ...Nd7 12. Nbd2 and now a) 12. ...cxd4 13. cxd4 Nc6 14. Nb3 a5 15. Be3 a4 16. Nbd2 is similar to the game structure. b) 12. ...exd4 13. cxd4 Nc6 14. d5 Nce5 15. a4! Rb8 16. Nxe5 Nxe5 17. axb5 axb5 18. f4 Ng6 19. Nf3+/-"

Should he open the c-file by exchanging pawns with 12. ...cxd4 or maintain the tension between the d4 and c5 pawns, which allows white if he wishes to play d4-d5, closing the queen side?"

Nf1 with cxd4 14. cxd4 exd4 15. Nxd4 d5 16. e5 Ne4 17. f3 Bc5 18. fxe4 dxe4  with complications that seem to favor black. But what about 13. ...c4? the answer is 13. ...c4 14. b4! Nc6 15. d5 Nb8 16. a4 black's queen side pawns are under stress. The other main reason why white plays b3 is to play Bb2 in the event that black does play 13. ...cxd4 14. cxd4 Nc6 15. Bb2 supporting the d4-pawn
26,Bf8,e7f8,r1b1rbk1/2q2ppp/p2p1n2/npp1p3/3PP3/1PP2N1P/P1BN1PP1/R1BQR1K1 w - - 1 14,"not a good move for black This idea behind 13. ...Bf8 comes from the idea to stop the white knight manoeuvre Nbd2, Nf1 and Ng3. This passive move allows white to build up a dominating position on both sides of the board. The right idea is to maneuver this bishop via d8 to b6 and focus on his development on the queen side."

On the queen side white has established a characteristic ""attacking"" pawn structure. The black knight on a5 has no single good safe square. It is therefore easy to conclude that white is better. But by how much? The blocked lines in the center and on the queen side are also impeding the white pieces. So I would assess the position as objectively only slightly better for white, but the kind that is horrible to defend against."
