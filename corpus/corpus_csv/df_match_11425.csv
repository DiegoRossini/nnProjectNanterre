Believe GM Anand played this in a not to recent game."

4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p2Q/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 2 3,The best reply.
5,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p2Q/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 3 3,Lets aim at f7 and see if things develope.
6,Nh6,g8h6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n4n/4p2Q/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 4 4,"No, No, No, this is not the way to defend f7. Best is Qe7 or g6 is fine now as the e5 pawn is guarded by the c6 Knight. A knight on the brim is grim."
7,d3,d2d3,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n4n/4p2Q/2B1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 0 4,Preparing to remove the guard of f7.
8,Bd6,f8d6,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2nb3n/4p2Q/2B1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 1 5,"NO, not this for several reasons.  First, it overlooks the opponents last threat.
Second, g6 is the right move now as it cancels the threat at f7 and the bishop does guard the h6 knight.  Third, placing a bishop on d6 prior to the d pawn moving makes it hard to develope the queen's bishop.  Fourthly, moving the bishop to d6 only adds further protection to the e pawn and does not develope the bishop in a good way/place. The e pawn is guarded enough by the knight."

You could of castled, or moved Qf6,Qe7,g6. These all loose a piece but not the game immediately."
