1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Here is my favorite game from the Southern Mississippi Open. Ever had a game where your opponent makes the moves you hope he will? It happened to me in this game, and I got the chance to go on a king hunt that was really exhilirating (at least for this class 'C' patzer:) My opponent gets his king stuck in the center and advancing, and I'm able to really make him squirm. I hope you enjoy:) As usual, I play my favorite 1. d4."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"Along with 1...d5, the most popular response to 1. d4."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 2,I'm heading towards Queen's Gambit territory (which I am very comfortable with). I've grown to like to play Nf3 first before c4 to protect my d pawn should the gambit c pawn be taken.
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,Hmmm....perhaps my opponent is trying to steer into some line of the QGD.
5,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"Here is the first instance of black playing what I was hoping for. I block with bishop, he takes, I take with my Nb1 and if he castles,  I have the opportunity for a big center."
6,Bb4+,f8b4,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,"Here is the first instance of black playing what I was hoping for. I block with bishop, he takes, I take with my Nb1 and if he castles,  I have the opportunity for a big center."
7,Bd2,c1d2,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/5N2/PP1BPPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,Black plays as I was hoping for:)
8,Bxd2+,b4d2,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/5N2/PP1bPPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,Black plays as I was hoping for:)
9,Nbxd2,b1d2,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/5N2/PP1NPPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,? I was so hoping he would do that. I now have the chance to pounce in the center big time. Much better for black was 5...d5.
10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/5N2/PP1NPPPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 1 6,? I was so hoping he would do that. I now have the chance to pounce in the center big time. Much better for black was 5...d5.
11,e4,e2e4,rnbq1rk1/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PPP3/5N2/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 6,As planned. Now if black plays d5 I can push e5 and put his Nf6 on a much more passive square.
12,d5,d7d5,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/2PPP3/5N2/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 7,"It's weird.....I think it and he does it. Sometimes the stars just align, I guess. At this point, I feel that I will be able to establish a solid threat on his castled position after Qc2 and Bd3."
13,e5,e4e5,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3pP3/2PP4/5N2/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 7,"Once again, black moves to the square I was hoping for. 7...Nh5 may have held more promise though. If I chase the knight by 8. g4, the knight can move to f4 safely and I may have had defensive issues on my kingside. I'm not sure I would have played g4 in that case, but I certainly would have considered it. As for the actual position, I'm feeling pretty good. I can now safely push c5 and start turning the screws on preventing black's development."
14,Nfd7,f6d7,rnbq1rk1/pppn1ppp/4p3/3pP3/2PP4/5N2/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 1 8,"Once again, black moves to the square I was hoping for. 7...Nh5 may have held more promise though.

15,c5,c4c5,rnbq1rk1/pppn1ppp/4p3/2PpP3/3P4/5N2/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 8,Good idea - black sees the need to open things up and threatens control of the f file.
16,f6,f7f6,rnbq1rk1/pppn2pp/4pp2/2PpP3/3P4/5N2/PP1N1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 9,Good idea - black sees the need to open things up and threatens control of the f file.
17,b4,b2b4,rnbq1rk1/pppn2pp/4pp2/2PpP3/1P1P4/5N2/P2N1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 9,"I liked this move, as it protects the c pawn which will be hanging after action on e5."
18,c6,c7c6,rnbq1rk1/pp1n2pp/2p1pp2/2PpP3/1P1P4/5N2/P2N1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 10,"? I didn't like this move for black. In post mortem, my opponent suggested that c6 was necessary in furtherance of b6. I suggested that if it was his intent to play b6, he should have just gone ahead and played it immediately, as the text restricts his Nb8 and just wastes time. It is interesting to note now that the reader should keep his eyes on black's Nb8."
19,Qc2,d1c2,rnbq1rk1/pp1n2pp/2p1pp2/2PpP3/1P1P4/5N2/P1QN1PPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 1 10,"Ok, I'm still with my plan to load up on the b1/h7 diagonal. I'm hoping for black to go ahead and open up the f file (and not shutting down my diagonal)."
20,fxe5,f6e5,rnbq1rk1/pp1n2pp/2p1p3/2Ppp3/1P1P4/5N2/P1QN1PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 0 11,I'm thinking at this moment that maybe I should be sending subliminal thoughts to my opponent about his pin number and credit card numbers:) I can safely retake the e pawn and my diagonal is viable.
21,dxe5,d4e5,rnbq1rk1/pp1n2pp/2p1p3/2PpP3/1P6/5N2/P1QN1PPP/R3KB1R b KQ - 0 11,"I did spend a little time with this one. I seriously considered 11. Nxe, but that would allow black to untangle his pieces some after NxN. Plus, my Nf3 is contemplating a move to g5."
22,b6,b7b6,rnbq1rk1/p2n2pp/1pp1p3/2PpP3/1P6/5N2/P1QN1PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 0 12,"Black proceeds with his idea of b6 to start chipping away at my pawns, but it is a late attempt. I think Na6-c7, Ba6, or Qe8 or Qe7 were better attempts to develop."
23,Bd3,f1d3,rnbq1rk1/p2n2pp/1pp1p3/2PpP3/1P6/3B1N2/P1QN1PPP/R3K2R b KQ - 1 12,White is right on schedule and throwing a threat at h7.
24,Ba6,c8a6,rn1q1rk1/p2n2pp/bpp1p3/2PpP3/1P6/3B1N2/P1QN1PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 2 13,"? Once again, black shows up late for dinner. While belatedly developing a piece, black drops a pawn."
25,Bxh7+,d3h7,rn1q1rk1/p2n2pB/bpp1p3/2PpP3/1P6/5N2/P1QN1PPP/R3K2R b KQ - 0 13,13...Kf7 drops the g pawn after 14. Qg6 .
26,Kh8,g8h8,rn1q1r1k/p2n2pB/bpp1p3/2PpP3/1P6/5N2/P1QN1PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 1 14,13...Kf7 drops the g pawn after 14. Qg6 .
