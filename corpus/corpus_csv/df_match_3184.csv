1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Mike Stoddart had been undefeated in the Wirral League up to this point
2,b6,b7b6,rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/1p6/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"A slightly unusual reply, although you will find it in one of my other annotations."
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/1p6/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,So I grab the centre
4,Bb7,c8b7,rn1qkbnr/pbpppppp/1p6/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,He hits my e pawn
5,Bd3,f1d3,rn1qkbnr/pbpppppp/1p6/8/3PP3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 3,"I protect it, hoping for 3....f5 (see previous annotation)"
6,e6,e7e6,rn1qkbnr/pbpp1ppp/1p2p3/8/3PP3/3B4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 4,He doesn't fall for that!
7,Be3,c1e3,rn1qkbnr/pbpp1ppp/1p2p3/8/3PP3/3BB3/PPP2PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 1 4,I continue to develop
8,Bb4+,f8b4,rn1qk1nr/pbpp1ppp/1p2p3/8/1b1PP3/3BB3/PPP2PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 2 5,"This is a dreaful waste of time. It is not in either opening database on Gameknot, and for good reason. It more or less forces c3 which is a move that white wants to play anyway."
9,c3,c2c3,rn1qk1nr/pbpp1ppp/1p2p3/8/1b1PP3/2PBB3/PP3PPP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,So I play the natural
10,Be7,b4e7,rn1qk1nr/pbppbppp/1p2p3/8/3PP3/2PBB3/PP3PPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 1 6,He retreats
11,Nd2,b1d2,rn1qk1nr/pbppbppp/1p2p3/8/3PP3/2PBB3/PP1N1PPP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 2 6,I develop
12,Nf6,g8f6,rn1qk2r/pbppbppp/1p2pn2/8/3PP3/2PBB3/PP1N1PPP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 3 7,He develops
13,g4,g2g4,rn1qk2r/pbppbppp/1p2pn2/8/3PP1P1/2PBB3/PP1N1P1P/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 0 7,"I hit him with an aggressive thrust, hoping to drive his knight back. He avoids this, but at the cost of blocking in his Bb7"
14,d5,d7d5,rn1qk2r/pbp1bppp/1p2pn2/3p4/3PP1P1/2PBB3/PP1N1P1P/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 0 8,"This gives his knight a square on e4, but at an enormous cost - blocking in his best placed piece on b7."
15,e5,e4e5,rn1qk2r/pbp1bppp/1p2pn2/3pP3/3P2P1/2PBB3/PP1N1P1P/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 0 8,So I push on
16,Ne4,f6e4,rn1qk2r/pbp1bppp/1p2p3/3pP3/3Pn1P1/2PBB3/PP1N1P1P/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 1 9,"and he jumps in. N(f)-d7 is probably best, but still worse for black."
17,Qc2,d1c2,rn1qk2r/pbp1bppp/1p2p3/3pP3/3Pn1P1/2PBB3/PPQN1P1P/R3K1NR b KQkq - 2 9,"I thought after making that move, that I could have improved with Nf1 threatening f3 and if he replies Ng5 I have h4 and his knight has nowhere safe to go. However later I realised that f3 can be met with Bh4+ and then Ng5 and I can't play h4. If I try to play Qc2 and 0-0-0 first, he can still play Bh4 at some point to frustrate my plans, or play c5 followed by exchanging on d5. So I don't think Nf1 is any good and what i played is probably best. I am threatening to exchange on e4 and win a pawn, so he exchanges first."
18,Nxd2,e4d2,rn1qk2r/pbp1bppp/1p2p3/3pP3/3P2P1/2PBB3/PPQn1P1P/R3K1NR w KQkq - 0 10,He takes
19,Bxd2,e3d2,rn1qk2r/pbp1bppp/1p2p3/3pP3/3P2P1/2PB4/PPQB1P1P/R3K1NR b KQkq - 0 10,I take
20,Bg5,e7g5,rn1qk2r/pbp2ppp/1p2p3/3pP1b1/3P2P1/2PB4/PPQB1P1P/R3K1NR w KQkq - 1 11,"He seeks exchanges, as his position is cramped."
