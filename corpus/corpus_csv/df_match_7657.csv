1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

I have had my share of heartache against the Experts - indeed there have been cases where I have got into an endgame or late middlegame with an Expert, in fact, let's throw in the Master Mater as well where I have had at least some drawing chances and then I make a critical wrong decision and blow it big time.  Here are some of those names where I have tasted this kind of heartache on at least one occasion.  Easy19, Ionadowman, Therealjimfriar, Marinvucusik, Chrisobee, Leo_London and Dynamic_Dv.  This time, however, I manage to hold my nerve and the position and gain a 5.8 point reward.  This latest Expert Draw, my 6th has ended a 5 match losing run against Dynamic_Dv.  It gives me a real ray of hope against the abovementioned players.  Anyhow, on with the game.  I depart again from my usual Ruy Lopez and have a go at The Three Knights Opening.  I kick off with 1. e4."

49,Ne2,c3e2,8/p1p2pk1/6p1/5b2/2Bb3p/1P3P1P/P2KN1P1/8 b - - 2 25,"25. Ne2 - this move seems passive but I see it as a precaution.  Note that infiltration routes of the BK via f4 - g3 on the kingside and d4 on the queenside are now blocked off as it is illegal for a king to walk into a check!  Note that the knight is untouchable by the black dsb and it is extremely difficult for the knight to be assailed by the white dsb.  During my coffee break at work this morning, as I stir my cup,  I put the question to the black lsb next move and also one to my opponent as I feel confident that I can keep it out - do you want a draw Dave?  In my lunch hour Dave logs on, although I feel confident that I have kept hime out, Dave is an expert and he might see something I haven't.  That proved not to be the case.  Dave accepted my draw offer.  At least I have managed to get into an endgame with an Expert and not make the wrong decision this time.  To this opponent I lost 5 games on the bounce so it is nice to end that losing run.  So, to the Experts listed in my intro note and Master Freddy it gives me a real ray of hope of ending a losing run with them.  I now play Dave as black and hope I can do OK this time.  Ah well, bye for now - Joanne"
