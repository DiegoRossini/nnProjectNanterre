11,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqkb1r/1p2pppp/p2p1n2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,All pretty standard/book play thus far.
12,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/6B1/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,All pretty standard/book play thus far.
13,f4,f2f4,rnbqkb1r/1p3ppp/p2ppn2/6B1/3NPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"White is getting a little aggressive here, threatening to do some action on the center."
14,Qb6,d8b6,rnb1kb1r/1p3ppp/pq1ppn2/6B1/3NPP2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,"Good response from Black, threatening b2 and getting some good counterplay on the center."
15,e5,e4e5,rnb1kb1r/1p3ppp/pq1ppn2/4P1B1/3N1P2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,"Threatening his knight, forcing the next play.  Qd2 is a more book play.  The other downside of this play is that it leaves a lone center pawn with no other pawns to lend support.  Lone center pawns can prove troublesome to protect, and can sometimes cost the game down the line."
16,dxe5,d6e5,rnb1kb1r/1p3ppp/pq2pn2/4p1B1/3N1P2/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 9,"Now comes a moment of decision for Black.  There are a few options worth considering, getting the knight to safety, but the Queen has the best play.  White will also now have some burden in attempting to protect the e pawn."
17,fxe5,f4e5,rnb1kb1r/1p3ppp/pq2pn2/4P1B1/3N4/2N5/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 9,"Now comes a moment of decision for Black.  There are a few options worth considering, getting the knight to safety, but the Queen has the best play.  White will also now have some burden in attempting to protect the e pawn."
18,Qxb2,b6b2,rnb1kb1r/1p3ppp/p3pn2/4P1B1/3N4/2N5/PqP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 10,"Notice that the rook is not really threatened, but the even if exf6, Black can do some unpleasant things with some check combos.  Black also gains a 1 pawn advantage."
19,Bd2,g5d2,rnb1kb1r/1p3ppp/p3pn2/4P3/3N4/2N5/PqPB2PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 10,"I think that Na4 is a better response, forcing the Queen to the a3 square, but this move protects the knight and prepares for White to shoo away the Black queen."
20,Nd5,f6d5,rnb1kb1r/1p3ppp/p3p3/3nP3/3N4/2N5/PqPB2PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 11,Moving the knight to safety and threatening a piece capture.  White has a few interesting options in response.
21,Rb1,a1b1,rnb1kb1r/1p3ppp/p3p3/3nP3/3N4/2N5/PqPB2PP/1R1QKB1R b Kkq - 3 11,"This move will force action on Black's queen.  A more interesting play is 11. Nxd5.  If Black doesn't retake with exd5, and does something like Qxd4, Nc7+ wins."
22,Nxc3,d5c3,rnb1kb1r/1p3ppp/p3p3/4P3/3N4/2n5/PqPB2PP/1R1QKB1R w Kkq - 0 12,"An interesting exchange play that, if seen through, will rob white of castling.  However, a retake is pretty much forced by this play, since if 12. Bxc3, Qxc3+ wins a piece outright."
23,Rxb2,b1b2,rnb1kb1r/1p3ppp/p3p3/4P3/3N4/2n5/PRPB2PP/3QKB1R b Kkq - 0 12,"White has a fractured queenside pawn structure and has lost castle, but is only down 1 pawn, so still a competitive game."
24,Nxd1,c3d1,rnb1kb1r/1p3ppp/p3p3/4P3/3N4/8/PRPB2PP/3nKB1R w Kkq - 0 13,"White has a fractured queenside pawn structure and has lost castle, but is only down 1 pawn, so still a competitive game."
25,Kxd1,e1d1,rnb1kb1r/1p3ppp/p3p3/4P3/3N4/8/PRPB2PP/3K1B1R b kq - 0 13,"White has a fractured queenside pawn structure and has lost castle, but is only down 1 pawn, so still a competitive game."
26,Ba3,f8a3,rnb1k2r/1p3ppp/p3p3/4P3/3N4/b7/PRPB2PP/3K1B1R w kq - 1 14,"An interesting move by Black.  The original goal was to get the bishop out to the c5 square, but White could simply move the knight to b4 and cause the bishop to have to move again.  The anticipated move by White of Rb3 would block that path and allow the bishop to go to where it would do the most good, c5."
27,Rb3,b2b3,rnb1k2r/1p3ppp/p3p3/4P3/3N4/bR6/P1PB2PP/3K1B1R b kq - 2 14,Plan achieved.

30,O-O,e8g8,rnb2rk1/1p3ppp/p3p3/2b1P3/3N4/1R2B3/P1P3PP/3K1B1R w - - 5 16,"Good placement for bishop.  When in doubt of where to place a bishop, centralize.  Another possible good spot would be c4, as it would prevent Black from moving the f pawn."
31,Bd3,f1d3,rnb2rk1/1p3ppp/p3p3/2b1P3/3N4/1R1BB3/P1P3PP/3K3R b - - 6 16,"Good placement for bishop.  When in doubt of where to place a bishop, centralize.  Another possible good spot would be c4, as it would prevent Black from moving the f pawn."
32,Nd7,b8d7,r1b2rk1/1p1n1ppp/p3p3/2b1P3/3N4/1R1BB3/P1P3PP/3K3R w - - 7 17,Continuing on with the development of Black's pieces.
33,Be4,d3e4,r1b2rk1/1p1n1ppp/p3p3/2b1P3/3NB3/1R2B3/P1P3PP/3K3R b - - 8 17,"Nice way to add some pressure on the b pawn.  This move gave Black some positional choices to make.  Also it centralizes the LSB on the main diagonal, so it can affect the maximum amount of squares.  I actually anticipated White moving a bishop to protect the e pawn."
