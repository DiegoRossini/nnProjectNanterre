1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,In this game I was happy with my patient build up of an attack in a closed position. However I was looking for to an interesting ending when my opponent blundered. Enjoy.

However the Bishop really needs to move as it has no prospects on g2 where it is blocked by black's center and cuts of the half-open g file
