1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi all! I think this is an interesting game. White (me!) ends up with a far favourable endgame, with a pair of connected passed pawns on the sixth rank. However, disaster strikes, and a badly planned sacrifice leaves me with a two-pawn deficit and a lost endgame. But then, a clever resource by, yes, me again leads to a drawn endgame position. And so...as usual, I open with my queen pawn."

Black offers White the chance to grab a big pawn centre in the sharp Exchange Variation4.cxd5 Nxd5 5.e4 Nxc3 6.bxc3, but then puts heavy pressure on this centre. If White can hold on to this powerful centre, however, he can expect to hold a middlegame advantage. It is also possible to bypass this sharp line with 4.Nf3, the Three Knights Variation, or 4.Bf4, but, being myself, I decide to go for the sharp lines with all guns blazing!"

However, I must say that I am optimistic. In preparation for a team match, in which I knew that I was going to meet my arch-rival A.B. (no, not jelly939, my OTHER arch-rival!). A.B.'s favourite opening for Black against the queen pawn is the Gruenfeld, so I carried out extensive research on the Gruenfeld Exchange Variation in order to beat him, as it were, at his own game! I was relying on A.B.'s laziness in researching openings to give me a win in that game. Thankfully, laziness did its part, and I won in about 16 moves. So, the long and short of that long story is, that now I am happy about playing the sharp Gruenfeld Exchange Variation as White."

13,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/6p1/8/2BPP3/2P5/P4PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 2 7,"The logic behind this move, which apparently does nothing to shore up White's centre? It is really quite simple. White's centre, in particular the d-pawn, is going to need as much protection as possible. Putting White's knight on f3 is not going to work: it can then be pinned, and its defence negated. So, it must go to e2. And, therefore, the light-squared bishop must be developed first, in order to not be blocked in by the knight on e2. 7.Bc4 is the main line way of doing this."
