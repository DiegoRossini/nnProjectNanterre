I cant good explain why I did."
6,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp2pp/4pn2/5p2/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"very common move(chess database)
You get a strong row of pawns(the pawn at f6 is defended better) and you have a better defending against the pawns who stand at d4 and c4.
And it is the preparation for my attack in move 5.
Until this move it is the Dutch defense(it was also the theme of the minitournament, so it is very logical)"
7,d5,d4d5,rnbqkb1r/pppp2pp/4pn2/3P1p2/2P5/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"Now he does something very uncommon. Until the previous move it is played nearly 500 times on GK, but nobody has played this move!! NOBODY out of nearly 500!!
Maybe he wanted delete my pawn at e6, that was defending my pawn et f5?? Maybe he wanted to clean the board a little?? Maybe he did something?? Maybe it was a very smart move, maybe it was a blunder. I dont know exactly, to be honest. But it is curious, that nobody out of 500 did this, and he did."
