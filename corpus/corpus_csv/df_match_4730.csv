I can solve this very easy by taking the bishop with the knight.
BUT here comes my idea: if I take the bishop, he might see what's coming: checkmate and ruin my plans.
So I prepared a bate for him: my rook. If I give him my rook he won't hesitate to take it, and then checkmate! So I moved the king!"
