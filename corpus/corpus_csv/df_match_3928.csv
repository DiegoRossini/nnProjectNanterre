1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,The most common opening that has an uncountable amount of variations.
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"As I increase in rank, I find the Scandinavian more often for some reason."
3,exd5,e4d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3P4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"I take, what other choices do I have?"
4,Qxd5,d8d5,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"So far, so good."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3q4/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"After this move, I can tell that Black is power hungry because of his next move."
6,Qe6+,d5e6,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/4q3/8/8/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,?! Two problems; 1.I am perfectly safe with 4.Be2; and 2. 3...Qa5 would prevent much development issues.
7,Be2,f1e2,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/4q3/8/8/2N5/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 3 4,"Well, I had other moves, but this was probably better for development."
8,Qf6,e6f6,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/5q2/8/8/2N5/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 4 5,"Okay, never mind. Black did NOT play the Scandinavian correctly. I call this the ""corrupt-able one piece power""."
9,Nd5,c3d5,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/5q2/3N4/8/8/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 5 5,"Black is already getting into trouble after the difficult-to-play 4...Qf6, blocking in his snoozing back rank pieces. Black must carefully select his next move, as one move protects and the other move loses severely."
10,Qc6,f6c6,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/2q5/3N4/8/8/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 6 6,An undeniable error! 5...Qd6 was significantly better.
11,Bb5,e2b5,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/2q5/1B1N4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 7 6,! Loses the Queen and Black has three deadly options. #1. 6...Kd7 or Kd8 7.Bxc3+bxc3 8.Nc3. #2. 6...Be7?? 7.Bxc6 getting the Rook no matter what. #3. Qxb5 Nxc7+ garnering the Queen. Black is officially losing.
12,Qxb5,c6b5,rnb1kbnr/ppp1pppp/8/1q1N4/8/8/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 7,Smart choice to do this move.
13,Nxc7+,d5c7,rnb1kbnr/ppN1pppp/8/1q6/8/8/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 0 7,two forced options that expose the King (slightly exposed if 7...Kd8).
14,Kd8,e8d8,rnbk1bnr/ppN1pppp/8/1q6/8/8/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQ - 1 8,Expected.
15,Nxb5,c7b5,rnbk1bnr/pp2pppp/8/1N6/8/8/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQ - 0 8,"With seven points up, I decide to not retreat the Knight yet, but continue with the advantage I created."
16,g6,g7g6,rnbk1bnr/pp2pp1p/6p1/1N6/8/8/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQ - 0 9,"With seven points up, I decide to not retreat the Knight yet, but continue with the advantage I created."
17,d4,d2d4,rnbk1bnr/pp2pp1p/6p1/1N6/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQ - 0 9,Helps develope the Bishop.
18,Na6,b8a6,r1bk1bnr/pp2pp1p/n5p1/1N6/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQ - 1 10,"Is it just me, or does Black want to guarantee weak pieces?"
19,Nf3,g1f3,r1bk1bnr/pp2pp1p/n5p1/1N6/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 2 10,I continue development.
20,Bg7,f8g7,r1bk2nr/pp2ppbp/n5p1/1N6/3P4/5N2/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R w KQ - 3 11,Why didn't he do 8...e6 instead of 8...g6?
21,Ne5,f3e5,r1bk2nr/pp2ppbp/n5p1/1N2N3/3P4/8/PPP2PPP/R1BQK2R b KQ - 4 11,I don't necessarily like this move. Perhaps Castling Kingside was better.
