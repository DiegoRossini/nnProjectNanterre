1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

I think I will leave the title for you readers to try and suss out, I can't and I need your help!  Anyhow, this was my 50th game against the Master Mater and I hate to say it but I played loads better against him in my first game and that was when I had a Class C rating!  Here I made the mistake of using the analyse board feature but not analysing it far enough!  Anyhow, on with the game where I kick off with e4."
