5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,With this move White plans to look for development room and tempo if Black retreats the knight.  The exchange is however acceptable.

It's open and well-developed for the time-being, but the King's pawn could be a sticking point, and the QRP might prove weak.  The Queen's pawn, meanwhile, appears protected, but can be assaulted."
