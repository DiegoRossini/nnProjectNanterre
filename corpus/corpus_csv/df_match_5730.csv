1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"A common move for white. My usual opening. I also like c4, d4 and g3."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"A common move for black. As black, I prefer e6."
3,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"My favorite opening. I like this opening, but lately I've been unlucky with it. I think I will try d4 and c4, which I've heard are better moves than e4 and f4 (Because of black playing e5 then d5). Lately every game I play goes 1.e4 e5,2.f4 exf4,3.Nf3 g5,4.Bc4 g4,5.Ne5 Qh4,
6.Kf1 Nh6,7.d4 d6,8.Nd3. What am I doing wrong?"
4,exf4,e5f4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"For those who don't know, my goal was to sacrifice a pawn to get a good attack on f7 (eventually) and to get a good center now that the pawn on e5 is gone. In most games, white will regain the pawn and will keep a good position. In other games, white will not regain the pawn, but will have a huge advance in development. Common moves for white now are Nf3, Bc4 and d4."
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,This move keeps pressure on the center and stops the black Queen from going to h4.
6,g5,g7g5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/6p1/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"The most common move at this point. Black will try a quick attack on the king in some games, and in others, the goal was to defend f4 I hear h4 is good for white, but I don't see it."
7,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/6p1/2B1Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"Continuing development. Usually my next move would be d4, but not in this game."
8,g4,g5g4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/8/2B1Ppp1/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"I have several options here. I like Ne5, but I went with something new this time."
9,O-O,e1g1,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/8/2B1Ppp1/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 5,White is sacrificing a knight for a huge advance in development.
10,gxf3,g4f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/8/2B1Pp2/5p2/PPPP2PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 6,"If black doesn't take, my development would be great compared to black."
11,Qxf3,d1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1p1p/8/8/2B1Pp2/5Q2/PPPP2PP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 0 6,"I have a bishop, Queen and rook all charging at f7. Black's goal is to defend without giving any pieces away."
12,Qf6,d8f6,rnb1kbnr/pppp1p1p/5q2/8/2B1Pp2/5Q2/PPPP2PP/RNB2RK1 w kq - 1 7,Qxf4 would ruin the entire point of the attack.
13,d3,d2d3,rnb1kbnr/pppp1p1p/5q2/8/2B1Pp2/3P1Q2/PPP3PP/RNB2RK1 b kq - 0 7,Developing the bishop.
14,Nc6,b8c6,r1b1kbnr/pppp1p1p/2n2q2/8/2B1Pp2/3P1Q2/PPP3PP/RNB2RK1 w kq - 1 8,Developing the knight.
15,Bxf4,c1f4,r1b1kbnr/pppp1p1p/2n2q2/8/2B1PB2/3P1Q2/PPP3PP/RN3RK1 b kq - 0 8,My attack is still strong. I still have to think about attacking and trading as few pieces possible.
16,Nd4,c6d4,r1b1kbnr/pppp1p1p/5q2/8/2BnPB2/3P1Q2/PPP3PP/RN3RK1 w kq - 1 9,"2 most common moves are Qf2 and Qh5 for white. Qf2 is much more defensive, the opposite that I need to be know."
17,Qh5,f3h5,r1b1kbnr/pppp1p1p/5q2/7Q/2BnPB2/3P4/PPP3PP/RN3RK1 b kq - 2 9,"Black has to be careful, my attack is getting stronger (Can you believe that I'm going to lose in 3 moves.)."
18,Ne6,d4e6,r1b1kbnr/pppp1p1p/4nq2/7Q/2B1PB2/3P4/PPP3PP/RN3RK1 w kq - 3 10,Black needs to defend. This was probobly the best move.
19,Be5,f4e5,r1b1kbnr/pppp1p1p/4nq2/4B2Q/2B1P3/3P4/PPP3PP/RN3RK1 b kq - 4 10,The winning move for me. I either win the Queen or rook.
20,Bc5+,f8c5,r1b1k1nr/pppp1p1p/4nq2/2b1B2Q/2B1P3/3P4/PPP3PP/RN3RK1 w kq - 5 11,"If I would have played slower, I would have noticed d4, which wins. I would have also noticed that the white rook wasn't defended."
