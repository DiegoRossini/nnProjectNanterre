 was of course not ""Who is zooming whom??"". Being that it has no relative bearing here at Gameknot, I took the editors discretion and called this game



  a representation of the theme which the game overall expressed!!"

By doing so gains equality with the tempo White is blessed with initially is the theory..... Masters, this is your invitation to shed some light please??!!"
