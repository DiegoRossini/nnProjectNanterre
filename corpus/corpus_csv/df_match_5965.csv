1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This first move is fine, opening up line for the Bishop and Queen, and staking a claim to the e5 and c5 squares."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"and Black replies with the same, another sound move."
3,c3,c2c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3P4/2P5/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"This is quite playable, although not as aggressive as c4."
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/2P5/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,another sound developing move by Black.
5,Nd2,b1d2,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/2P5/PP1NPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 3,"After putting the pawn on c3, this is now the best square for the White Queen's Knight."
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3p4/3P4/2P5/PP1NPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 3 4,"Although this is a sound developing move by Black, it does somewhat block the Black c pawn. I would prefer g6, c5 or e6 here for Black."
7,c4,c3c4,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3p4/2PP4/8/PP1NPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,This move does not fit well with White's second and third moves. If White wanted the pawn on c4 she should have put it there on her second move. It also leaves the White d pawn unprotected.
8,Nxd4,c6d4,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/2Pn4/8/PP1NPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,Which Black duly takes.
9,Nb3,d2b3,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/3p4/2Pn4/1N6/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 5,"I'm not convinced this is best move either. Instead of Nb3 I would play e3 attacking the Knight on d4. After the Knight moves, White can play N(g1) to f3 and start to develop her King side pieces with a view to playing O-O and getting her King to safety."
10,Nc6,d4c6,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/3p4/2P5/1N6/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 6,Black retreats the Knight although NxN(b3) was a reasonable alternative.
11,c5,c4c5,r1bqkb1r/ppp1pppp/2n2n2/2Pp4/8/1N6/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,"At the irsk of repeating myself, e3 was better."
12,e5,e7e5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/2Ppp3/8/1N6/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,"Black now has quite a dominating centre, with pawns on d5 and e5 controlling c4, d4, e4 and f4 squares. If I were Black I would be very happy with this position!"
13,e3,e2e3,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/2Ppp3/8/1N2P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 7,White finally gets round to making a move to develop the King side!
14,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/2n2n2/2Ppp3/8/1N2P3/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 8,"It is the right idea to strike at the Black centre, but this is a bit premature. It is better to develop some pieces first, say Bb5 followed by Ne2 and O-O then play f4."
15,f4,f2f4,r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/2n2n2/2Ppp3/5P2/1N2P3/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 8,"It is the right idea to strike at the Black centre, but this is a bit premature. It is better to develop some pieces first, say Bb5 followed by Ne2 and O-O then play f4."
16,e4,e5e4,r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/2n2n2/2Pp4/4pP2/1N2P3/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 9,"This advance weakens Black's proud centre! Black no longer controls d4 and if I were White I would be thinking in terms of Ng1-e2-d4, perhaps combined with Bb5 to put pressure on Black Knight on c6."
17,Qc2,d1c2,r1bqk2r/ppp1bppp/2n2n2/2Pp4/4pP2/1N2P3/PPQ3PP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 1 9,"White comes up with another plan, playing the Nb3 to d4. However first the pawn on c5 needs protecting from the Black Bishop on e7."
18,Bf5,c8f5,r2qk2r/ppp1bppp/2n2n2/2Pp1b2/4pP2/1N2P3/PPQ3PP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 2 10,Another sound developing move by Black.
19,Nd4,b3d4,r2qk2r/ppp1bppp/2n2n2/2Pp1b2/3NpP2/4P3/PPQ3PP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 3 10,"I'm not so happy about this plan though, as after the exchange of Knights on d4, the Black pawn on e5 is passed, that is to say there are no pawns preventing it from marching forward and queening. Although in the middle game this would not be possible, it would be a great asset to Black in and ending. Also White has to watch for Black playing e4-e3 and simultaneously attacking White's Queen on c2 with the Black Bishop on f5. I would say it would be better to play the Knight on g1 to e2 and then if Black exchanges Knights on d4 to recapture with a Knight."
20,Nxd4,c6d4,r2qk2r/ppp1bppp/5n2/2Pp1b2/3npP2/4P3/PPQ3PP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 0 11,"Black has now completed the development of the minor pieces and castled, while White has exchanged the only minor piece she developed. Still, the the centre closed, and no open files to operate on, White has still a reasonable position, except being a pawn down."
21,exd4,e3d4,r2qk2r/ppp1bppp/5n2/2Pp1b2/3PpP2/8/PPQ3PP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 0 11,"Black has now completed the development of the minor pieces and castled, while White has exchanged the only minor piece she developed. Still, the the centre closed, and no open files to operate on, White has still a reasonable position, except being a pawn down."
22,O-O,e8g8,r2q1rk1/ppp1bppp/5n2/2Pp1b2/3PpP2/8/PPQ3PP/R1B1KBNR w KQ - 1 12,"Black has now completed the development of the minor pieces and castled, while White has exchanged the only minor piece she developed. Still, the the centre closed, and no open files to operate on, White has still a reasonable position, except being a pawn down."
23,Bd2,c1d2,r2q1rk1/ppp1bppp/5n2/2Pp1b2/3PpP2/8/PPQB2PP/R3KBNR b KQ - 2 12,A sensible developing move.
