1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!  Here is a Ruy Lopez game between me and my buddy Rob Jacobs.  This game goes some way to demonstrate that even a one or two pawn advantage may not guarantee you victory in a Q & P ending - this applied to me because although I was a clear pawn up in the final position, that Wicked Witch of the West was perpetually buzzing around Henry.  So, Bob kicks off with 1.e4."
