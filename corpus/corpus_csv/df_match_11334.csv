1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I liked this game because it showed just how vulnerable a stong looking king side can be if the opponent has just the right attack available.

3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,The King's Knight openning - black chosing to defend the pawn rather than make a threat on the White pawn with his King's Knight.

7,h3,h2h3,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N1P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,"An unual choice of move.  White is looking to prevent potential problems involving the Knight being pinned to the Queen.  

However his move achieves little more than blocking a potential threat which Black can easily shift to somewhere else.  It would seem that White has lost a tempo which Black can capitalise on."
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/5N1P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 5,"Another unusual move.
White is preparing to pawn storm the Black minor pieces on the Queen side.  However the attack will take so long to materialise that Black can prepare escape routes for both of the threatened pieces.
White has lost another temp which Black can use to continue developing."

This allows (helps?) the pieces threaten the King side which is the side White is likely to castle being as there will be no Queen side pawns to hide behind."

However the knight is well guarded and can move without losing material and the Black King can be quickly whisked away from danger by castling.

White's bishop would also be vulnerable to a sudden pawn surge as a4 will not be available to receive a retreat."
