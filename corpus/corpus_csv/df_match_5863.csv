1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Annotation updated November 15, 2010. This was a non rated game for tutoring purposes, between myself, Scott Miller (faithfulltrav) and my new friend (starforce49). So I want to start by letting you know a little about where I am coming from when I tutor chess, my favorite game. First I want to say, there are varying ideologies and styles of play. I for one am a fairly aggressive, very calculating player. I am a much stronger tactical player than I am strategic. For the difference, imagine a general in a war. He may say to his men ""OK, there are 10,000 of us. I want 9,000 men to lay in wait at the top of this hill. The other 1,000 of you go make like you are attacking the enemy town down below. When they come out after you, flee to the cave at the bottom of the hill. Then the 9,000 at the top attack them by bow and arrow. That is strategy. It is an overall plan. Then the general may say, ""When you engage in hand to hand combat, use the long swords, as you can strike from a greater distance. Keep your daggers ready though."" That is a tactic, not a strategy. Strategies give general direction, tactics are more specific. So tactics are the processes used to apply the strategy. A more strategic player may look at one of my comments and say, ""This guys is leading you wrong."" It's not that I'm leading you wrong, but that I can only lead based on my own style. A strategic player will lead differently than a tactical player. A passive player will give different advise from an aggressive player. That's not to say anything bad about passive chess players, as I've met passive players who I could not beat. I had a friend in college named Pablo. He'd sit back, making very passive moves. He'd set up a very solid position you can't break through and if you slip up, then all of a sudden he'd get aggressive! So when taking advise, (from me or anyone else) take it all in from as many sources as possible, then make a rational decision for yourself, based on your own style and abilities, what is for you."

We had 7 days per move, so there really is very little reason for quick rushed moves. I'd suggest analyzing very in depth to see what is attacked and defended, before making each move.

A one piece advantage is usually more than enuf to win."
