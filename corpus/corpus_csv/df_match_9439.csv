1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone, this is the game immediately after my ignominious defeat against The Dentist called ""The Dentist has his Day"".  Well, The Dentist was threatening another kingside pawn storm and I had to act fast.  I did gamble a bit and played a move that could be easily rebuffed by a player at my level, but 300 points south of me, well that could be another matter ........"

Qe6 - this move takes us out of the database, my previous move attacked the Wicked Witch of the West so she had to move somewhere.  I do not feel this check is very good.  I block the check with Be2 and black plays his queen to f7, evading a pawn fork on d5."
