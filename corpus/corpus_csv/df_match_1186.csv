1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"(This is Game 2 of the rematch series Kasparov was having against IBM's Deep[er] Blue. All six games took place in May 1997.) Here, Deep Blue opens with e4. Now, before I go any further, I'd again like to repeat that I am a mere inferior advanced player, purely interested in Grandmaster annotations to better myself in the long run. I plan on doing these alongside my blitz and standard annotations, but in these ones especially, I am looking to compare my own thoughts of the position to what others make of the position. I am not stating that my opinions are correct- these are masters, and they would crush me any day. :P"
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Kasparov plays e5. I can't remember who said this, but apparently some spectators were surprised, as he usually is a fan of the Sicilian, but he had certain intentions for this day."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Nf3. This is getting closer to the camp of what I'd play as a White player, planning..."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,Black plays Nc6. Fearless as always.
5,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,"Bb5 - we enter the Ruy Lopez. This is one of my favorite White openings, heralded as one of the best openings to get to play with as the White pieces. It's well known for the early castling and has one of the best chances to develop early for attacking sooner."
6,a6,a7a6,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,"Black plays a6. Very common, and forces the bishop to move. White still has several options."
7,Ba4,b5a4,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"More popular is the variation where White doesn't capture Nc6. If the knight is taken, Black suffers an early Queenside scatter, but at the cost of the typically stronger bishop for White to have."
8,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 5,"Also main line. This develops Black, and is a fast reminder to White that he's left the e4 pawn hanging for the time being."
9,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 3 5,"But it doesn't usually stop White from castling anyway, because there's a certain gambit if Nxe4, starting with Re1. That would mark the beginning of the Tarrasch Defense, where the knight retreats to c5 (usually), and then White plays Bxc6, scattering the Black's queenside further, and making Rxe5+ a possible move. It turns into a very violent and open game, definitely not something I'd opt for as Black."
10,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/1pppbppp/p1n2n2/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 4 6,"Normally, Black instead plays this, the Closed variation to the Ruy. For good reason- the general, overall wide consensus of the Chess community back in 1997 was that when it comes down to Open games, tactics (trading, targetting pieces) tends to be where a computer is stronger, as opposed to Closed games, where strategy (no contact unless needed, more about winning control of squares rather than pieces), tends to be where people would evaluate positions stronger than computers back then. Kasparov himself was famous for inventing this approach, and he was very confident at the time that it was going to work to his advantage. Unfortunately, it doesn't quite work that way for him."
11,Re1,f1e1,r1bqk2r/1pppbppp/p1n2n2/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq - 5 6,"White plays Re1 to guard the e4 pawn. Better than d3 (because White wants to play d4), and Nc3, the worst reply IMO, because of Black's next move..."
12,b5,b7b5,r1bqk2r/2ppbppp/p1n2n2/1p2p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq - 0 7,"If Nc3 was played now, White would have too many pieces on this side of the board that this pawn could harass without issue."
13,Bb3,a4b3,r1bqk2r/2ppbppp/p1n2n2/1p2p3/4P3/1B3N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq - 1 7,"So the bishop retreats here, targetting f7. It's safe for now."
14,d6,d7d6,r1bqk2r/2p1bppp/p1np1n2/1p2p3/4P3/1B3N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq - 0 8,"This is known as the Leonhardt Variation on GameKnot. As Kasparov was hoping, this was a good choice for a convoluted opening, because I think he was playing the best overall moves as Black from here. It involves a lot of re-arranging of pieces, transforming into a difficult knot in the center for White to untangle... d6 offers more strength to e5 after White clearly wants d4, and opens the light bishop into the game."
15,c3,c2c3,r1bqk2r/2p1bppp/p1np1n2/1p2p3/4P3/1BP2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq - 0 8,"And for White, I also think Deep Blue was also choosing better moves. After d6, d4 now would be totally premature. c3 offers an additional defender to the d4 square, and gives c2 as a hiding place to the bishop in case of a5 or Na5."
16,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/2p1bppp/p1np1n2/1p2p3/4P3/1BP2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQR1K1 w - - 1 9,Black castles now before delaying it starts getting in the way of his plans.
17,h3,h2h3,r1bq1rk1/2p1bppp/p1np1n2/1p2p3/4P3/1BP2N1P/PP1P1PP1/RNBQR1K1 b - - 0 9,"Black instead could have played Bg4, an aggressive move to pin the knight. It's not an option anymore, but I'm sure that wasn't a concern to Kasparov."
18,h6,h7h6,r1bq1rk1/2p1bpp1/p1np1n1p/1p2p3/4P3/1BP2N1P/PP1P1PP1/RNBQR1K1 w - - 0 10,"h6 - preventing Ng5 from White, who plans to trade the bishop-knight pair for Black's f7-rook. It would leave Black's king exposed on f7, but no real good way to attack it immediately with only the White Queen after the light bishop sacrifice. Still, this is a very passive response from Black, trying not to give Deep Blue any clear, fast entry into his domain."
19,d4,d2d4,r1bq1rk1/2p1bpp1/p1np1n1p/1p2p3/3PP3/1BP2N1P/PP3PP1/RNBQR1K1 b - - 0 10,"And then, White plays d4. Nothing much else to say, it gives White more space to do things, but Black is still very solid, no matter how you slice this. I don't think d3 would be any better- it was time to move this pawn."
20,Re8,f8e8,r1bqr1k1/2p1bpp1/p1np1n1p/1p2p3/3PP3/1BP2N1P/PP3PP1/RNBQR1K1 w - - 1 11,"Planning to defend e5 if White captures, no longer needing to worry about f7 falling after Ng5. Black could maybe entertain Bb7, to pressure e4, or perhaps Rb8, planning b4, but I think this is better."
