Not many people play 4...Bxc3 any more, but it was fashionable some 50-60 years ago. It seems to prematurely commit black to a plan that may not work out. The plus is that it doubles a pawn, but really that's not much of a weakness for white and may even be a strength, since he gets a big central pawn mass to control the center squares."
