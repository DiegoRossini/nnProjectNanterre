8,d6,d7d6,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"So far a conventional King's Indian Defence, Sämisch Variation."
9,f3,f2f3,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2P2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"So far a conventional King's Indian Defence, Sämisch Variation."
10,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk2r/ppp1ppbp/2np1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2P2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,"Playable, but simply 0-0 is better."
11,Be3,c1e3,r1bqk2r/ppp1ppbp/2np1np1/8/2PPP3/2N1BP2/PP4PP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 2 6,So I continue with the normal development.
12,e5,e7e5,r1bqk2r/ppp2pbp/2np1np1/4p3/2PPP3/2N1BP2/PP4PP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,He hits at the centre.
13,d5,d4d5,r1bqk2r/ppp2pbp/2np1np1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N1BP2/PP4PP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 7,I take extra space.
14,Ne7,c6e7,r1bqk2r/ppp1npbp/3p1np1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2N1BP2/PP4PP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 1 8,"I think the pawn sacrifice, Nd4 is much better. If white takes twice in d4, in return for the pawn, black gets rid of white's powerful black squared bishop. Chances would be even."
15,Bd3,f1d3,r1bqk2r/ppp1npbp/3p1np1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2NBBP2/PP4PP/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 2 8,White continues developing.
16,c6,c7c6,r1bqk2r/pp2npbp/2pp1np1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2NBBP2/PP4PP/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 0 9,I think this is a slight inaccuracy too. Simply 0-0 looks better. Now black has to watch out for white playing d5xc6 and leaving balck with a weak d6 pawn.
17,Qd2,d1d2,r1bqk2r/pp2npbp/2pp1np1/3Pp3/2P1P3/2NBBP2/PP1Q2PP/R3K1NR b KQkq - 1 9,White maybe prepared 0-0-0 and/or Be3-h6.
18,h6,h7h6,r1bqk2r/pp2npb1/2pp1npp/3Pp3/2P1P3/2NBBP2/PP1Q2PP/R3K1NR w KQkq - 0 10,Black prevents Be3-h6 but at the cost of meaning that he can't play 0-0 without losing his h6 pawn. 0-0 looks better.
19,Nge2,g1e2,r1bqk2r/pp2npb1/2pp1npp/3Pp3/2P1P3/2NBBP2/PP1QN1PP/R3K2R b KQkq - 1 10,So I continue to develop.
20,a6,a7a6,r1bqk2r/1p2npb1/p1pp1npp/3Pp3/2P1P3/2NBBP2/PP1QN1PP/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 11,Maybe preparing b7-b5 at some stage.
21,g4,g2g4,r1bqk2r/1p2npb1/p1pp1npp/3Pp3/2P1P1P1/2NBBP2/PP1QN2P/R3K2R b KQkq - 0 11,I am preparing an attack on the King side. I am intending leaving my king in the centre.
22,c5,c6c5,r1bqk2r/1p2npb1/p2p1npp/2pPp3/2P1P1P1/2NBBP2/PP1QN2P/R3K2R w KQkq - 0 12,"This closes up the centre, and prevents me from playing d5xc6. But it comes at a cost. By playing c7-c6-c5 he has wasted a move, and made it harder to open up the queen side."
23,Ng3,e2g3,r1bqk2r/1p2npb1/p2p1npp/2pPp3/2P1P1P1/2NBBPN1/PP1Q3P/R3K2R b KQkq - 1 12,"Now that I have advanced my g pawn, I can put my knight behind it, as part of the general build up on the king side."
24,Rb8,a8b8,1rbqk2r/1p2npb1/p2p1npp/2pPp3/2P1P1P1/2NBBPN1/PP1Q3P/R3K2R w KQk - 2 13,He seems to be preparing b7-b5 again.
25,Kf2,e1f2,1rbqk2r/1p2npb1/p2p1npp/2pPp3/2P1P1P1/2NBBPN1/PP1Q1K1P/R6R b k - 3 13,"I connect my rooks, so that they can join the action in whichever side they are needed."
26,Bd7,c8d7,1r1qk2r/1p1bnpb1/p2p1npp/2pPp3/2P1P1P1/2NBBPN1/PP1Q1K1P/R6R w k - 4 14,He is threatening b7-b5 now
27,a4,a2a4,1r1qk2r/1p1bnpb1/p2p1npp/2pPp3/P1P1P1P1/2NBBPN1/1P1Q1K1P/R6R b k - 0 14,So I stop it.
28,b6,b7b6,1r1qk2r/3bnpb1/pp1p1npp/2pPp3/P1P1P1P1/2NBBPN1/1P1Q1K1P/R6R w k - 0 15,"And he prevents a4-a5, and leaving him a weak square on b6. Now a4-a5 can be answered by b6-b5!"
