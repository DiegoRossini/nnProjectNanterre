1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I am annotating this game for noosh9057 who learned to move the pieces a couple of weeks ago... Making it public so he can see the whole history as we progress.

e4 is the most usual opening move for white. After e4 both your queen and your bishop can move out from the back rank. Getting the pieces out will be one of your main goals during the opening. They cannot do much good while they are in the back rank.

Another feature of e4 is that it gives you presence in the center. Presence in the center is desirable because most pieces have are stronger here. A knight in the center can move to 8 squares, while one in the corner can only move to 2. A bishop in the center can move to 15 squares, while one on the back rank can move to 7. Because of this, if one player controls the center he has an advantage. If you have more legal moves, it is more likely that one of them can give you an advantage."

3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Nf3 is a very good move here. You develop the knight, moving it from the back rank to a good position near the center. At the same time you threaten to take my pawn on e5. I must now address that threat or lose a pawn, which limits my options."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"I respond with Nc6, developing my own knight to an equally good position and defending the e5 pawn."
5,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 3,"Your choice is to develop the knight to Nc3. This develops the second knight and protects the e4 pawn. This makes it harder for me to make any tactics against that pawn, and secures your position in the center."
6,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/4P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 4 4,"I respond by developing my bishop to c4. This bishop now threatens the f2 pawn, just next to the king. If I take it with the bishop, you will be checked. As you can just retake with the king it is not dangerous yet. However, you must watch that square carefully. If I ever attack it with a second piece, you must do something."
7,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqk1nr/pppp1ppp/2n5/2b1p3/2B1P3/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 5 4,"You respond by bringing your bishop to c4, threatening the f7 square in the same fashion.

Actually I made a blunder in the last move and you could have won a pawn. 4. Nxe5 Nxe5 5. d4 - and the white d-pawn attacks both my Knight and my Bishop. I can only save one of them, which means white gets his knight back (bishops and knights are about the same value). But white do keep the extra pawn his knight grabbed.

When one piece attacks two other more valuable or underprotected pieces in the this pawn does, it is called a fork. The fork is a very important idea in chess tactics.

All pieces, even the king can fork other pieces. It is a good exercise to put different pieces on the board and try to create forks. If you can consistently spot forking opportunities (both your own, and those of your opponent) you have reached an important first step in mastering tactics. Especially tricky to spot, both for you and the opponent, are knight forks. This is because of the way the knight moves. If you have a chess board, you can put the knight on each square, one by one, and tap all the squares it can move to. If you do this for a few minutes every day until you instantly ""see"" where the knight can move, it will enable you to spot knight forks much more easily."

A fianchetto uses the bishops long range to threaten the centre from afar. This is the other main way of gaining center influence besides having pawn presence in the center.
12,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/2b1p3/2B1P3/1PN2N2/P1PP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w - - 1 7,"I continue my plan of castling. A lot of tactics and combinations include checking. Whenever somebody puts my king in check, I must resolve that check before I can do anything else. Used skillfully my opponent can get ""free moves"" that way. Having my king safely castled I will avoid those for the time being."

14,Bg4,c8g4,r2q1rk1/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/2b1p3/2B1P1b1/1PN2N2/PBPP1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 3 8,"I develop my other bishop by moving it to e4. This pins your knight, another important tactic. If you move your knight my bishop can take your valueable queen. This means that your knight is stuck and vulnerable until the pin is resolved. This is a soft pin. A hard pin occurs if moving the piece will bring the king in check."
15,a3,a2a3,r2q1rk1/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/2b1p3/2B1P1b1/PPN2N2/1BPP1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 8,"You push the a pawn to a3. The pawn is protected by the bishop on b2 and rook on a1. It prevents me from moving my knight to the a4 square. Altough my knight could be a nuisance there, it is not a big enough threat to warrant such a permament change in the pawn structure.
As the start of an attack on the queen side, the move has more merit, though. You have developed all your pieces, and it is time to have an offensive plan for the middle game. You have a lot of forces on the queen side, and an attack here makes sense. If you push the b pawn next move, that will attack my bishop with support from your a-pawn, forcing the bishop to move."
16,a5,a7a5,r2q1rk1/1pp2ppp/2np1n2/p1b1p3/2B1P1b1/PPN2N2/1BPP1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 9,"I push my a pawn to a5, responding to your threat of b4."
17,b4,b3b4,r2q1rk1/1pp2ppp/2np1n2/p1b1p3/1PB1P1b1/P1N2N2/1BPP1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 0 9,"You do b4 in spite of my a5 move, sacrificing a pawn. After axb4 axb4, Bxb4 you are a pawn down. Usually it is a good idea to make sure that you control the square that you move new pieces to. This means that you must have more pieces that can take on it than your opponent.
Sometimes sacrifices are a good thing, if they give other compensation. Of other compensations the strongest are initatives or good attacks. The so called gambits openings sacrifice a piece for initiatives. The usual statement is that three tempos of development is worth one pawn."

The e4 pawn is only attacked by one of my pieces, while it is now protected twice. This means that you move free up the knight on c3 from guarding the e5 pawn, and the knight is now ready to move.
On the downside the knight on c3 is now only protected by the bishop on b2. As the knight is attacked by my bishop, your b2 bishop must keep guarding the knight unil the knight moves or gets alternative protection.
If the intention of your move was to free up the knight so it can continue your advance on the queen side, it does make sense.
Your move makes no direct threat that I have to respond to, which makes it a bit passive. That give me the chance to study your position for weaknesses, trying to discover any weaknesses I can exploit."
