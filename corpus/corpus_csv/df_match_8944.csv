1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I like to vary my openings. Being placed in a group of five, so four games with each colour, I played 1. d4 twice and 1. e4 twice."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,Black chooses the Gruenfeld Defence. I don't think I've ever played against it before.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Black chooses the Gruenfeld Defence. I don't think I've ever played against it before.
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Black chooses the Gruenfeld Defence. I don't think I've ever played against it before.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,Black chooses the Gruenfeld Defence. I don't think I've ever played against it before.
6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3p4/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,Black chooses the Gruenfeld Defence. I don't think I've ever played against it before.
7,Bf4,c1f4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/5np1/3p4/2PP1B2/2N5/PP2PPPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 1 4,"After doing a little cursory research, this appealed to me more than the complexities of 4. cxd5. (As of 31/12/08) Wikipedia describes this move as ""a safer continuation"" for ""less adventurous players""."
8,c6,c7c6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/2p2np1/3p4/2PP1B2/2N5/PP2PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,Less common -- and perhaps also less adventurous -- than 4... Bg7 5. e3 c5.
9,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/2p2np1/3p4/2PP1B2/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,"Faced with an unknown position, I make sensible developing moves. We seem to be in some sort of Slav Defence now, in which Nf3 is often played early on."
10,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/2p2np1/3p4/2PP1B2/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,"More standard development. This moves offers Black the chance to gain a tempo with dxc4, although then his pawn on c6 is no longer supporting the centre."
11,e3,e2e3,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/2p2np1/3p4/2PP1B2/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"More standard development. This moves offers Black the chance to gain a tempo with dxc4, although then his pawn on c6 is no longer supporting the centre."
12,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2p2np1/3p4/2PP1B2/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 1 7,"More standard development. This moves offers Black the chance to gain a tempo with dxc4, although then his pawn on c6 is no longer supporting the centre."

17,Be5,f4e5,rnbqr1k1/pp2ppbp/2p3p1/3pB2n/2PP4/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 6 9,"A zwischenzug; White accepts doubled pawns but gets Black to block his fianchettoed bishop. This was played in Euwe-Alekhine, 1935 World Championship, although that was after 4... Nh5."
18,f6,f7f6,rnbqr1k1/pp2p1bp/2p2pp1/3pB2n/2PP4/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 0 10,"An aggressive strike, perhaps premature with Black's development lagging."

Black must recapture with the pawn, so he will have an isolated queen's pawn (isolani), but it will also be a passed pawn. While White tries to attack this pawn, Black will be trying to promote it. Is its weakness greater than its strength?"

33,Bb3,c4b3,rn1q2k1/pp5p/4b1p1/3pr3/8/1BN5/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 3 17,A pre-emptive retreat that prevents the possibility of a double attack on the bishop and another piece later on.
