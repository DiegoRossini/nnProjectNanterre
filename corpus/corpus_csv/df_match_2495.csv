1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I've decided to annotate this game for a number of reasons. Firstly it's between it's against an opponent 100 points north of my rating. It's from a Kings Gambit tournament and after the game ended, he was top of the ranking  with 11 points and I was joint next to bottom with 2. This is a fairly short game (22 moves) and the analysis suggests a total of only one inaccuracy, two mistakes and a single blunder which suggests to me that the game was fairly close overall

I wanted to try this tournament as even though most opponents are higher ranked than me I though it would be interesting and that has certainly proved to be the case."

7,Ke2,e1e2,rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3PPp1q/8/PPP1K1PP/RNBQ1BNR b kq - 2 4,frees the diagonal for the lsb to threaten to skewer the white queen with Bg4 though it can easily be parried

9,exd5,e4d5,rnb1kbnr/ppp2ppp/8/3P4/3P1p1q/8/PPP1K1PP/RNBQ1BNR b kq - 0 5,This seems a high risk approach to me as if I can castle quickly I can get a rook on the e file to threaten the white king

I had my eye on something like Ne4 followed by Qf2 which looks dangerous to me though I couldn't quite figure out how dangerous.

The computer calls this an inaccuracy preferring  8. Kd2 Qf2+ 9. Qe2+ Qxe2+"
