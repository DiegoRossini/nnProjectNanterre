1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

This is a game between Freddy the Master Mater and my buddy Steve.  Steve played the same defense against me - The Robatsch - see the game Hidden Traps.  In this game Freddy does a pawn push to h6, this tactic of his is becoming very familiar.  He has done it to me in several of our games in order to break up my kingside pawn structure.  Now, if you have a castled position with a fianchettoed bishop for goodness sake try and avoid letting it be exchanged off.  If it has to be exchanged then it may not be so bad if it is for your opponent's same colour bishop but even there should an enemy pawn get to f6 or h6 this may spell death for you if the queens are on the board.  If you exchange it for a knight as Steve did here it is even worse because an enemy queen and dsb are a lethal combo.  This is what I call playing with fire."

She is gonna be really evil here!  I think f5 is black's best hope here, although Steve's castled position is gonna be really draughty!"
