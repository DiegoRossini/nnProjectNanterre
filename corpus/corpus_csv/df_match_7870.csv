1,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/5P2/8/PPPPP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"The Bird opening. Advocates of this move are usually Dutch players that like to employ the same setup as White. A leading Dutch exponent, GM Malaniuk, was asked why he didn't play 1.f4 as White given his excellent results as Black in the defense. He replied: ""The extra move would hurt me""."

I regularly beat the city veteran champion with a similar approach. I either gambit or simply lose a pawn in the opening.
