1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I usally do the king's pawn but I wanted to do something diffrent.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,!? I have never faced this before.
3,dxc5,d4c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2P5/8/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,So I try to accept it unsure what is going to happen next.
4,Qa5+,d8a5,rnb1kbnr/pp1ppppp/8/q1P5/8/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,I see. An opening trap. But the queen is out early.
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1kbnr/pp1ppppp/8/q1P5/8/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 3,Maybe a little too early.
6,Qxc5,a5c5,rnb1kbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2q5/8/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,I didn't think of this first but it seems Ok.
7,Qd5,d1d5,rnb1kbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2qQ4/8/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1B1KBNR b KQkq - 1 4,I didn't think of this first but it seems Ok.
8,d6,d7d6,rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2qQ4/8/2N5/PPP1PPPP/R1B1KBNR w KQkq - 0 5,?! Strange.
9,Be3,c1e3,rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2qQ4/8/2N1B3/PPP1PPPP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 1 5,"Attacking the queen, again."
10,Qxd5,c5d5,rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/3q4/8/2N1B3/PPP1PPPP/R3KBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"Black does an exchange of queens very early. Once again, mabye a little too early."
11,Nxd5,c3d5,rnb1kbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/3N4/8/4B3/PPP1PPPP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 0 6,THreatening a fork on c7.
12,Nf6,g8f6,rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/3N4/8/4B3/PPP1PPPP/R3KBNR w KQkq - 1 7,Black falls into the trap. Barley noticed that was going to happen.
13,Nc7+,d5c7,rnb1kb1r/ppN1pppp/3p1n2/8/8/4B3/PPP1PPPP/R3KBNR b KQkq - 2 7,Any person would've noticed this fork so it is surprising that my opponent did not.
14,Kd8,e8d8,rnbk1b1r/ppN1pppp/3p1n2/8/8/4B3/PPP1PPPP/R3KBNR w KQ - 3 8,I won't be able to get my knight out now.

16,Nd5,f6d5,Nnbk1b1r/pp2pppp/3p4/3n4/8/4B3/PPP1PPPP/R3KBNR w KQ - 1 9,Just as I expected.
17,Bxa7,e3a7,Nnbk1b1r/Bp2pppp/3p4/3n4/8/8/PPP1PPPP/R3KBNR b KQ - 0 9,Black didn't notice that.
18,Nb4,d5b4,Nnbk1b1r/Bp2pppp/3p4/8/1n6/8/PPP1PPPP/R3KBNR w KQ - 1 10,It's the Nifty Nxc2+ he's aiming at now. He thinks he can pay me back after the Nc7+ and Nxa8. But I'm not falling for it.
19,O-O-O,e1c1,Nnbk1b1r/Bp2pppp/3p4/8/1n6/8/PPP1PPPP/2KR1BNR b - - 2 10,"Now O-O-O might seem plain, but it creates a pin on the d-file."
20,Nb8c6,b8c6,N1bk1b1r/Bp2pppp/2np4/8/1n6/8/PPP1PPPP/2KR1BNR w - - 3 11,"Now black is starting to think, but not after my next bit."

22,Nxa2+,b4a2,N1bk1b1r/1p2pppp/2np4/2B5/8/8/nPP1PPPP/2KR1BNR w - - 0 12,Yes for sure.
