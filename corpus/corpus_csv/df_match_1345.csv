10,Bd6,f8d6,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2nbpn2/3p4/3P1B2/5N1P/PPPNPPP1/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,"The normal reply. Black can't play the natural NxN because of the fork on the next move (dxe5). BUT, having ""lost a tempo"" with h3 instead of e2, black can now answer Nh5, threatening the B in return, which can hide on h2, allowing black to escape the fork."

But fxB would have opened the f file for his rook, so it was not really so good. These are the well-known ups and down of this scheme."

I'm aware the whole line is not really good for white, but black is not doing the more aggressive moves. Black should aim to play f6, kicking my N, but it implies moves like Ne4 (NxN, dxN), etc. In playing this, I'm aware I'm blinding my dsb, and I will have to take care of it later."

29,exd5,e4d5,r2q1rk1/pp1bn1pp/3bpp2/3P4/2pP1P2/2P2QPP/PP1N3B/R3KB1R b KQ - 0 15,"I though that this kind of forces black to take with the e pawn. This would leave me tempo to o-o-o, and with Bg2 I held a pressure on d5 that would have been a good holder for black."
30,Nxd5,e7d5,r2q1rk1/pp1b2pp/3bpp2/3n4/2pP1P2/2P2QPP/PP1N3B/R3KB1R w KQ - 0 16,"Black went for this instead, and it is not so bad because of the c pawn, but because it solves at once my developement problems. Nevertheless, black has a pretty obvious plan behind it that I didn't see at the moment."
31,Bxc4,f1c4,r2q1rk1/pp1b2pp/3bpp2/3n4/2BP1P2/2P2QPP/PP1N3B/R3K2R b KQ - 0 16,"Taking with the N seemed good, because it threats the Nd6, but that would have been very ""naive"", since the threat was easily met by black, while I won't have put in action my last minor piece. This position is good for me also because it kind of pins the e6 pawn (my saying is ""developement for developement's sake is ok but not good"". In this case, the B goes to a good square, not to - say - e2. It must be said that this same bishop, on g2, was very well placed too, but 1) I will castle queenside, so Bxb7 was not a good threat for me to make, and 2) hey, this is aiming where the BK is! You wont't prefer the other side of the board as a target! :-). Of course, since I am a bad player (specially on blitz!) I didn't see next black's move."
