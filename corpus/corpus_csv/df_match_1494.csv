1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,My typical response to e4 players. My coach tell me it most popular as well. My goal is to gain advantage over the d4 square with the sacrifice of white aggressive development. Also I don't tend to like to play copycat game (1. e4 e5 ...) but rather pick my own style of play.
