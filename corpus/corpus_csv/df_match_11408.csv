If white is playing without an early d4 against the Sicilian, and they want an advantage, they should go for a system involving Nge2,g3,Bg2 and a later f4. Nf3 impedes the move f4, but the game should stil be equal."

Black can try for an advantage by playing e5,Nge7,0-0,h6,Be6 and f5. In contrast, white has to work for active play. The move f4 is blocked and wont be available for a while, and he is in no position to go for an initiaive on the queenside. As a result of this analysis, I prefer blacks position."

I think that h6 may be better. Then followed by f5 to try and gain space in the centre and kingside. The immediate f5 can be answered by Bc4  and then Ng5 which is a little awkward for black. Hg first prevents the Ng5 and after Bc4  the king can go to h7.
