11,a3,a2a3,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/1b1NP3/P1N5/1PP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"I think that White is better if they take my knight on c6, causing me to double up some pawns, as this play allows me to double and isolate his c pawns completely, which could cause some trouble later on."
12,Bxc3+,b4c3,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n2n2/8/3NP3/P1b5/1PP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,Now White has a tougher defensive posture on his queenside.

14,Nxe4,f6e4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3Nn3/P1P5/2P2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,Because now the defender is removed...

17,Bd3,f1d3,r1bq1rk1/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3Nn3/P1PB1Q2/2P2PPP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 3 9,"I considered d5 to see if White would let me post my knight up the board, but opted for this play to trade my knight for a bishop.  Long term I think d5 was a better play, but I don't think I lose much by doing this trade.  If possible I'd rather not have an open board and face off against two bishops."

If he leaves his Queen where it is, c5 is an obvious follow up and grants a tempo move.  I might have considered Qd2 or possibly even Qa4 instead, however."
