1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"King's Pawn opening, my main opening even though as of recent I had played 1. d4, just to get a sense for closed and positional middlegames."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Standard response, second only to the Sicilian (1...c5). Black stakes claim to central squares in a symmetrical fashion. All kinds of games, from dynamic to drawish, can arise from this position."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Most common moves, 2. Nf3 attacks e5 and 2...Nc6 defends the pawn."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"Most common moves, 2. Nf3 attacks e5 and 2...Nc6 defends the pawn."
5,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,"The Ruy Lopez. White develops his bishop to b5 as to challenge Black's control of e5 and d4. White can't quite win a pawn after 4. Bxc6, 4...dxc6, 5.Nxe5, since 5...Qd4 forks the knight and pawn, and wins back the material with a more favorable position."
6,a6,a7a6,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,"Most popular move, black seeks to rid the bishop immediately."
7,Ba4,b5a4,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,Chasing my bishop again.

12,d6,d7d6,r1bqkb1r/2p2ppp/p1np1n2/1p2p3/4P3/1B3N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,"Securing e5, but leaving weaknesses on c6, e6, and especially d5"
13,Nc3,b1c3,r1bqkb1r/2p2ppp/p1np1n2/1p2p3/4P3/1BN2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 7,"?! I was kind of running on a tired auto-pilot here, and instead of playing sensible moves like 7. Re1 or 7. c3, I went for this move. It's not really bad, just unusual, and I am unfamiliar with this line. However I will try to make the best of the position"
14,Be7,f8e7,r1bqk2r/2p1bppp/p1np1n2/1p2p3/4P3/1BN2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 8,Trying to exchange the bishop and win the bishop pair.

17,Nxe7,d5e7,r1bqk2r/2p1Nppp/p2p1n2/np2p3/4P3/1B3N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 0 9,"Attacking in the center, usually pushing d4 in an e4 opening successfully is a sign of slight advantage."

However my somewhat weird 7. Nc3 required my opponent to think a bit, which left me a slight time advantage at this point. Seeing as I like to look for imbalances (I'm a Silman kind of guy), I decide to play off that imbalance."

Noticing this, I spent a minute calculating an interesting pawn sacrifice that might not necessarily leave me with excellent compensation, but would require my opponent to make calculated, defensive moves, which is what I needed having the time advantage."
