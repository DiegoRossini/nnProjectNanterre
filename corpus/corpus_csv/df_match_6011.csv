1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Good first move by Paul controls the center,the pawn is looking at the d5 square and the f5 square with keen interest."
2,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5p2/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I played 1..f5 to unsettle Paul straight away out of his comfort zone.
3,exf5,e4f5,rnbqkbnr/ppppp1pp/8/5P2/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"2.exf5 is the norm here,after all a free pawn cannot be turned down can it?"
4,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppppp1pp/5n2/5P2/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,"2...Nf6 well it looks to the e4 square and holds a watchful eye on the d5 square,and the g4 square.a knight is like a shuttle craft a little slow at getting here and there, but can be a good menace to the opponent."
5,d3,d2d3,rnbqkb1r/ppppp1pp/5n2/5P2/8/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"If my opening knowledge serves me right i would of played 3.Be2 not the move played.3.Be2 allows some control of the g4 square,also with the support of the queen on d1 could land with a check on h5 at some point the knight on f6 takes the bishop then the queen takes back with check again.( 3.d3 is still not bad after all it opens up the diagonal for the c1 bishop and the pawn controls e4 square and the important c5 square."
6,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1p1pp/5n2/3p1P2/8/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,3..d5 i like this direct approach the pawn controls e4 square and whites important c4 square.
7,Be2,f1e2,rnbqkb1r/ppp1p1pp/5n2/3p1P2/8/3P4/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 4,"4.Be2 a move behind see note previous,here the more forceful 4.g4 be brave and take the bull by the horns and come out of safe zone.+it holds on to the f4 pawn a while longer."
8,Bxf5,c8f5,rn1qkb1r/ppp1p1pp/5n2/3p1b2/8/3P4/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 5,the pawn is reclaimed and equality achieved and with this move black up's the preasure on whites e4 square.
9,Nf3,g1f3,rn1qkb1r/ppp1p1pp/5n2/3p1b2/8/3P1N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,A good solid move by Paul looks to the e5 square and g4 square and d4 + h4 brilliant developing move which is what needs to be achieved in chess.
10,Nc6,b8c6,r2qkb1r/ppp1p1pp/2n2n2/3p1b2/8/3P1N2/PPP1BPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 6,"i could of played 5..e6 here to free my f7 bishop from where it could land on c5 hitting the f2 square supporting the d4 square for if i wanted to push d5 or drop a knight on d5putting the question to the knight on f3 and the bishop on e2.however i like 5...Nc6 a good solid developing move supports d5,e5,b4,a5 and if later i wanted to push e5 then a Friend indeed the knight would be."
11,Nc3,b1c3,r2qkb1r/ppp1p1pp/2n2n2/3p1b2/8/2NP1N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 3 6,i would of castled here 6.0-0 just my preference nothing wrong with 6.Nc3 a good developing move again falls in with the knights b4 bishop rule.

13,Nb5,c3b5,r2qkb1r/ppp1p1pp/2n2n2/1N3b2/3p4/3P1N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,"I would of gone for trade offs, eg 7.Ne4-Nxe4 8.dxe4-Bxe4 9.O-O-Qd6 10.Re1-Bg6 with equality."
14,e5,e7e5,r2qkb1r/ppp3pp/2n2n2/1N2pb2/3p4/3P1N2/PPP1BPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,See how useful my Nc6 move was!!!! the knight supports the center pawn push.
