1,b3,b2b3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"When I started to play this game I was mired in a dismal losing streak mostly of my own making. At times not paying proper attention in the opening, at other times losing my focus while transversing the labyrinths of the middle game. Chess demands that you stay alert and play with purpose or the gods of cassia will pick you up by the scruff of your neck and will shake all the confidence and hubris out of you. Again I open with the Nimzo-Larsen Attack. An opening I am currently learning in my quest to build an opening repertoire. I tend to annotate more from of a strategical and psychological point of view rarther than use variations. I also of course annotate from my point of view. I'm sure that my opponent would have his own side of things."

And I noticed my mistake just after I made my move, funny how often that happens to me. Now black can play B*g2 forcing me to move my rook, then he can play Q-h3 with a strong attack. I should have played e4, driving his bishop back and then played N-c4. I can get so wrapped up in a certain variation that I don't look at other possibilities. In short I can become so fixated on one variation that it produces an inhibiting effect on all my other thoughts. This happens in my life as well. I'm thinking at the time, 'oh no, I've done it again'. I was already in a bad losing streak and saw it continueing with this move."
