1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Once more as White I choose to open with the King's Pawn.  This will be the last of these for awhile, since I have recently switched to the English Open in my games at the coffee shop due to there being less lines for me to memorise.  However, I still believe King's Pawn to be the most beneficial opening move for White, allowing you to avoid many types of slow manoeuvring games."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Black responds with the Sicilian, my favourite response to White's e4 opening."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Both natural development moves, allowing each player to stake a claim on the centre of the board."

5,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2n5/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 3,"White moves into the Rossolimo Variation of the Sicilian.  The aim of this is to allow for early castling while still building a strong central pawn structure, something White is often denied in the Sicilian.  When masters play, Bb5 is considered a move aimed at drawing the match but when Black is not prepared or unaware of the theory it can allow for White to gain a considerable advantage."
6,Qc7,d8c7,r1b1kbnr/ppqppppp/2n5/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 4,"Considered to be ""in book"", I personally don't like it.  I think either e6 or d6 is the preferred move for Black here, attempting to gain an advantage in the centre."
7,O-O,e1g1,r1b1kbnr/ppqppppp/2n5/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 5 4,"Early castle followed by Black leaving the ""book"" moves for the  Rossolimo (which called for a6 here). e5 is well defended and gives Black a double threat on the unoccupied d4 square - I've always been told that control of the centre is essential for winning a chess match so Black is looking good."

By moving here, Black hangs his pawn at e5, which White can take and check the Black King.  The furthest I went into the line was to move 23 (17.Qxe5+ Ne6 18.Bb4 Qc7 19.Qf5 Qf4 20.Qxf4 Nxf4 21.Nxf7 Be6 22.Bxe6 Nxe6 23.Nxh8 a5), which puts Black down by a Rook and two Pawns.

At the time I was unaware it was forced mate from here, but it certainly felt good.
