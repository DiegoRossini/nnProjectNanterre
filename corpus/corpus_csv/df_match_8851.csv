1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This game was no easy win for me!  The middlegame got very complicated and I very nearly got Glenda trapped.  Luckily I managed to force a queen trade later on which gradually turned the tide in my favour.  Finally we ended up in a K & P ending where even though I was a pawn up I had to avoid one last trick from Bob - I pull out a hidden talent from my sleeve, the joblock!  This finally forced Bob's resignation on the grounds of ruinous loss of material."
