1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I am Black.
I like this game because it was one of the fastest games ever."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"The Benoni Defense is referred to as a defense because White still has the first-move initiative, but the Benoni is rather a counterattack, I challenge White's pawn immidiately."
3,dxc5,d4c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2P5/8/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Not the best move. Here, White gives up a centre pawn for a pawn a file away from the centre.
The most agressive alternative is 2.d5, the safest is 2.c3, and the most drawish moves are 2.e3 or the better 2.Nf3."
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2P5/8/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"I am going to win back my pawn and have an extra central pawn. After Bxc5 and Nc6, I will have good control of the dark central squares and I can use my extra central pawn by playing Ne7 then d5, resulting in a sharp dynamic battle favoring Black."
5,b4,b2b4,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2P5/1P6/8/P1P1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"A bad move. White tries to hold onto his extra pawn here, but I quickly exploit him."
6,a5,a7a5,rnbqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/4p3/p1P5/1P6/8/P1P1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,I strike the defender of the c5 pawn.
7,c3,c2c3,rnbqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/4p3/p1P5/1P6/2P5/P3PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"Taking the pawn is better because after I take back with the rook and get the c5 pawn, I will only have a small advantage."
8,axb4,a5b4,rnbqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/4p3/2P5/1p6/2P5/P3PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"5. cxb4?? A losing blunder. It was White's last chance to give back the pawn and accept a disadvantage, but now his greediness will lose the game."
9,cxb4,c3b4,rnbqkbnr/1p1p1ppp/4p3/2P5/1P6/8/P3PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"5. cxb4?? A losing blunder. It was White's last chance to give back the pawn and accept a disadvantage, but now his greediness will lose the game."
10,Qf6,d8f6,rnb1kbnr/1p1p1ppp/4pq2/2P5/1P6/8/P3PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,"White resigned.
He cannot defend the rook, and must sacrifice a minor piece to avoid losing it. White did not want to play on down a piece with overextended queenside pawns and lacking in development."
