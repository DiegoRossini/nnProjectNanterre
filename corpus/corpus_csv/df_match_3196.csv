9,Bf3,e4f3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/8/3P4/5B2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 2 5,Takes away a good spot for his knight. I don't think this is a good move.
10,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/5b2/3P4/5B2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 3 6,Getting my bishop out into the fray before moving the knight to d7.
11,Ne2,g1e2,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/5b2/3P4/5B2/PPP1NPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 4 6,"development, although i think f3 would of been a more appropriate spot for the Knight than the Bishop."
12,e6,e7e6,rn1qkb1r/pp3ppp/2p1pn2/5b2/3P4/5B2/PPP1NPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"Again, i think this is passive and that the Knight would be better at c3."

14,Nbd7,b8d7,r2qkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/5b2/3P4/5B2/PPPNNPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 8,"My original idea was to advance the c pawn. In hindsight, i'd probably of simply developed my bishop."
15,c3,c2c3,r2qkb1r/pp1n1ppp/2p1pn2/5b2/3P4/2P2B2/PP1NNPPP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,"My original idea was to advance the c pawn. In hindsight, i'd probably of simply developed my bishop."

20,Qc7,d8c7,2r1k2r/ppqn1ppp/2pbpn2/5b2/2NP4/2P2B2/PP2NPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w k - 5 11,I figure if he wants the bishop bad enough he can initiate the trade.
21,Nxd6+,c4d6,2r1k2r/ppqn1ppp/2pNpn2/5b2/3P4/2P2B2/PP2NPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b k - 0 11,"And he did. Personally i don't mind the exchange, despite losing the bishop pair."
22,Qxd6,c7d6,2r1k2r/pp1n1ppp/2pqpn2/5b2/3P4/2P2B2/PP2NPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w k - 0 12,Solid move... gets his other bishop into the fray.

25,h4,h2h4,2r1k2r/pp1nqppp/2p1pn2/5b2/3P1B1P/2P2B2/PP2NPP1/R2Q1RK1 b k - 0 13,"Interesting move. It looks like an attempt at a king side pawn storm, although this move messes with the integrity of his castle."

27,Bg3,f4g3,2r1k2r/pp1nqppp/2p1p3/3n1b2/3P3P/2P2BB1/PP2NPP1/R2Q1RK1 b k - 2 14,Protects the h pawn and moves away from the Knight's scope.
28,Nd7f6,d7f6,2r1k2r/pp2qppp/2p1pn2/3n1b2/3P3P/2P2BB1/PP2NPP1/R2Q1RK1 w k - 3 15,Connecting the knights. My intention is to get those knights advanced up the board. Right now i'm looking at the e4 square.

I didn't want my queen right in front of the king on an open file and a potential pile up on my knight. However, after Qa4+ i am down a pawn."
32,cxd5,c6d5,2r1k2r/pp2qppp/4p3/3p1b2/3Pn2P/2P2BB1/PP3PP1/R2Q1RK1 w k - 0 17,"So a quick reflection on this move. I'm wondering if it was a mistake to take with the c pawn instead of the e pawn.

34,Qd7,e7d7,2r1k2r/pp1q1ppp/4p3/3p1b2/Q2Pn2P/2P2BB1/PP3PP1/R4RK1 w k - 2 18,"So while i'm down a pawn, i believe i am compensated by removing his bishop pair and further degrading the integrity of his castle."
