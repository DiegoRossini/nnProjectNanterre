1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"In this game I get a good position, but I let it slide, but I think my opponent played very well - well above his rating!"

3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"and so it this, preparing Nb1-c3"
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,He prepares to put his bishop on g7

6,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"He plays the King's Indian Defence, c7-c5 or d7-d5 are usual here too"
7,e4,e2e4,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,So I seize the centre.
8,d6,d7d6,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"He prevents e4-e5, although Bobby Fischer showed that 0-0 was quite playable"
9,f3,f2f3,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2P2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"This is the Sämisch Variation, It is named after Friedrich Sämisch, who developed the system in the 1920s."
10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N2P2/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR w KQ - 1 6,This is usual
11,Be3,c1e3,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N1BP2/PP4PP/R2QKBNR b KQ - 2 6,As is this

14,a6,a7a6,r1bq1rk1/1pp1ppbp/p1np1np1/8/2PPP3/2N1BP2/PP2N1PP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 0 8,"This is most common in this position, prehaps preparing b7-b5 should white play 0-0-0"
15,Qd2,d1d2,r1bq1rk1/1pp1ppbp/p1np1np1/8/2PPP3/2N1BP2/PP1QN1PP/R3KB1R b KQ - 1 8,I develop my queen
16,Rb8,a8b8,1rbq1rk1/1pp1ppbp/p1np1np1/8/2PPP3/2N1BP2/PP1QN1PP/R3KB1R w KQ - 2 9,"and he further prepares b7-b5. This is the Panno Variation of the Sämisch. Black prepares to respond appropriately depending on White's choice of plan. If White plays 0-0-0 and goes for a kingside attack, then 7...a6 prepares ...b7–b5 with a counterattack against White's castled position. If instead White plays more cautiously, then Black challenges White's centre with ...e5."
