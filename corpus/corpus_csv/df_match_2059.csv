1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"I am playing with Black against a stronger player. As usual, I play the Sicilian Defence."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I am playing with Black against a stronger player. As usual, I play the Sicilian Defence."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,White avoids the main lines. This is a move that is still quite common.
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,White avoids the main lines. This is a move that is still quite common.
5,Bb5+,f1b5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 3,White avoids the main lines. This is a move that is still quite common.
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2np4/1Bp5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 4,Other possible moves are 3...Bd7 and 3...Nd7.
7,Bxc6+,b5c6,r1bqkbnr/pp2pppp/2Bp4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,White gives up the bishop pair and Black is left with doubled pawns.
8,bxc6,b7c6,r1bqkbnr/p3pppp/2pp4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,I am happy to play this position. The doubled pawns are not that bad.
9,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkbnr/p3pppp/2pp4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 5,A simple developing move. This is not played as often as 5...e5 or 5...Bg4. I think the next move shows why.
10,Nf6,g8f6,r1bqkb1r/p3pppp/2pp1n2/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 6,A simple developing move. This is not played as often as 5...e5 or 5...Bg4. I think the next move shows why.
11,e5,e4e5,r1bqkb1r/p3pppp/2pp1n2/2p1P3/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 6,"White hits the knight and tries to induce dxe5, which leaves Black with isolated doubled pawns."
12,Nd5,f6d5,r1bqkb1r/p3pppp/2pp4/2pnP3/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 7,I rather move the knight than break my pawn structure.
13,Re1,f1e1,r1bqkb1r/p3pppp/2pp4/2pnP3/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 b kq - 2 7,Moving the rook to a better square and renewing the threat of forcing isolated doubled pawns (exd6 and Black cannot recapture with the e-pawn). My position is quite awkward.
14,g6,g7g6,r1bqkb1r/p3pp1p/2pp2p1/2pnP3/8/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQR1K1 w kq - 0 8,I decide to fianchetto the dark-squared bishop.
15,h3,h2h3,r1bqkb1r/p3pp1p/2pp2p1/2pnP3/8/5N1P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQR1K1 b kq - 0 8,I do not understand this move. 8. exd6 seems better for White.
16,Be6,c8e6,r2qkb1r/p3pp1p/2ppb1p1/2pnP3/8/5N1P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQR1K1 w kq - 1 9,Now I can recapture with the e-pawn again.
17,d3,d2d3,r2qkb1r/p3pp1p/2ppb1p1/2pnP3/8/3P1N1P/PPP2PP1/RNBQR1K1 b kq - 0 9,Opening the diagonal for the bishop.
18,Bg7,f8g7,r2qk2r/p3ppbp/2ppb1p1/2pnP3/8/3P1N1P/PPP2PP1/RNBQR1K1 w kq - 1 10,Developing the other bishop.
19,Nbd2,b1d2,r2qk2r/p3ppbp/2ppb1p1/2pnP3/8/3P1N1P/PPPN1PP1/R1BQR1K1 b kq - 2 10,Developing the knight first.
20,O-O,e8g8,r2q1rk1/p3ppbp/2ppb1p1/2pnP3/8/3P1N1P/PPPN1PP1/R1BQR1K1 w - - 3 11,The king gets away from the e-file.
21,Nc4,d2c4,r2q1rk1/p3ppbp/2ppb1p1/2pnP3/2N5/3P1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQR1K1 b - - 4 11,"The knight is well-placed here. However, 11. Ne4 was also possible, because I cannot capture the e5-pawn without losing the c-pawn and then probably another pawn."
22,Rb8,a8b8,1r1q1rk1/p3ppbp/2ppb1p1/2pnP3/2N5/3P1N1P/PPP2PP1/R1BQR1K1 w - - 5 12,"My rook moves to the half-open file. The b-pawn is protected now, but the situation may change later."
23,Bd2,c1d2,1r1q1rk1/p3ppbp/2ppb1p1/2pnP3/2N5/3P1N1P/PPPB1PP1/R2QR1K1 b - - 6 12,Develops the bishop.
24,Nb4,d5b4,1r1q1rk1/p3ppbp/2ppb1p1/2p1P3/1nN5/3P1N1P/PPPB1PP1/R2QR1K1 w - - 7 13,"I want to play d5, so the knight must move away. 12. Nb6 is also possible."
