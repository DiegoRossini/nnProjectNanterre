1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I feel like a King pawn game.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I typically prefer the Spanish over the Italian due to better performance when playing as white.

4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,I typically prefer the Spanish over the Italian due to better performance when playing as white.

6,a6,a7a6,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 4,"Black plays for the open Ruy Lopez, a common alternative is [5...Be7]. I find this move to have a sense of adventure and it fits into my mood for the game."
7,Ba4,b5a4,r1bqkbnr/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 4,"Black plays for the open Ruy Lopez, a common alternative is [5...Be7]. I find this move to have a sense of adventure and it fits into my mood for the game."

9,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1n2n2/4p3/B3P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 3 5,"Black plays for the open Ruy Lopez, a common alternative is [5...Be7]. I find this move to have a sense of adventure and it fits into my mood for the game."

11,d4,d2d4,r1bqkb1r/1ppp1ppp/p1n5/4p3/B2Pn3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 6,"Probably a suggested book move, but I think [6.c3] may also be played."
12,b5,b7b5,r1bqkb1r/2pp1ppp/p1n5/1p2p3/B2Pn3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,A typical book move.
13,Bb3,a4b3,r1bqkb1r/2pp1ppp/p1n5/1p2p3/3Pn3/1B3N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 7,book
14,d5,d7d5,r1bqkb1r/2p2ppp/p1n5/1p1pp3/3Pn3/1B3N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,"Book, but hanging the knight."
15,Nxe5,f3e5,r1bqkb1r/2p2ppp/p1n5/1p1pN3/3Pn3/1B6/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,"The last book move per Hiarcs 9. I could have captured with the pawn, but I liked the placement of a knight here. An exchange could have occurred due to the unprotected knight on c6, which would have been interesting, but not necessarily giving white any great positional advantage. There was also the chance of [8...Na5], which was actually played, which costs the bishop advantage for white, but leaves the knight posted in a forward position looking at c6."
16,Na5,c6a5,r1bqkb1r/2p2ppp/p7/np1pN3/3Pn3/1B6/PPP2PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 9,Going for the bishop advantage.
17,f3,f2f3,r1bqkb1r/2p2ppp/p7/np1pN3/3Pn3/1B3P2/PPP3PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 9,"Adding something to the equation. It does not prevent the NxB exchange, but it does add another factor into the mix."
18,Nxb3,a5b3,r1bqkb1r/2p2ppp/p7/1p1pN3/3Pn3/1n3P2/PPP3PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 10,The alternative [10.cxb3] is not as good because it does not bring another piece into the game as the text move does.
19,axb3,a2b3,r1bqkb1r/2p2ppp/p7/1p1pN3/3Pn3/1P3P2/1PP3PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 10,The alternative [10.cxb3] is not as good because it does not bring another piece into the game as the text move does.
20,Ng5,e4g5,r1bqkb1r/2p2ppp/p7/1p1pN1n1/3P4/1P3P2/1PP3PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 11,"I have to admit that this move baffled me. It seemed that [10...Nf6] was better because the knight is posted in a solid defensive position. The text move seems to suggest perhaps a future sacrifice at f3, but I did not see how this could be made to work within the next few moves so I felt at ease."
21,Nc6,e5c6,r1bqkb1r/2p2ppp/p1N5/1p1p2n1/3P4/1P3P2/1PP3PP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 2 11,"The text move attacks the queen primarily, but also opens a line for the rook on the e file. Yes, its an unsecured move, but it can be maintained with the proper application of attacking moves."
22,Qf6,d8f6,r1b1kb1r/2p2ppp/p1N2q2/1p1p2n1/3P4/1P3P2/1PP3PP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 3 12,"Keeping the queen safe while attacking the knight, but perhaps [11...Qd6] was better?"
23,Re1+,f1e1,r1b1kb1r/2p2ppp/p1N2q2/1p1p2n1/3P4/1P3P2/1PP3PP/RNBQR1K1 b kq - 4 12,"Besides the obvious check, this move keeps the knight safe for the moment while developing a piece into a more useful position."
24,Be6,c8e6,r3kb1r/2p2ppp/p1N1bq2/1p1p2n1/3P4/1P3P2/1PP3PP/RNBQR1K1 w kq - 5 13,Better than [12...Be7 ??] which simply loses a piece. But now the knight at c6 is safe from the queen.
25,Nc3,b1c3,r3kb1r/2p2ppp/p1N1bq2/1p1p2n1/3P4/1PN2P2/1PP3PP/R1BQR1K1 b kq - 6 13,Bringing another piece into the game with a promise of attack at b5.
26,Kd7,e8d7,r4b1r/2pk1ppp/p1N1bq2/1p1p2n1/3P4/1PN2P2/1PP3PP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 7 14,A reaction to try and shift focus from (Nxb5) since now the other knight is threatened.
27,Ne5+,c6e5,r4b1r/2pk1ppp/p3bq2/1p1pN1n1/3P4/1PN2P2/1PP3PP/R1BQR1K1 b - - 8 14,"But I have a strong reply (forcing move) - which cuts the king off from c6, which means the plan of Nxb6 is still a go."
28,Kc8,d7c8,r1k2b1r/2p2ppp/p3bq2/1p1pN1n1/3P4/1PN2P2/1PP3PP/R1BQR1K1 w - - 9 15,Better than [14...Kd6] incurring a check while losing a pawn.
