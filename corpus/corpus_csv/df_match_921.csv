10,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p2B1/1b1P4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 2 6,"!? The book move is 5...Be7. This move is somewhat rare. From a positional view this is dubious because black has to either allow white to play a3 and b4 with tempo, which are helpful moves in the QGD exchange, or he has to trade away the two bishops without doubled c pawns as compensation. However black can have tricks with ... Ne4 if I'm not careful."
