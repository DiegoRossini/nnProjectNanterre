1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This was a 5-minute blitz game, played offline at my home. I can play so badly sometimes--yes, I am Black in this one."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Philidor Defense. It's solid but passive and rarely played at the highest levels. I would never play this on GameKnot.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Philidor Defense. It's solid but passive and rarely played at the highest levels. I would never play this on GameKnot.
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,Philidor Defense. It's solid but passive and rarely played at the highest levels. I would never play this on GameKnot.
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"The most common move, and probably best move."
6,Nd7,b8d7,r1bqkbnr/pppn1ppp/3p4/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,I considered channeling the Allies who lost to Morphy at the Opera House (3...Bg4) but thought better of it. If only I thought better later. This move is called the Hanham variation.
7,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqkbnr/pppn1ppp/3p4/4p3/2BPP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 4,"I know there's some Philidor system with this move, but I sure didn't do it right!"
8,g6,g7g6,r1bqkbnr/pppn1p1p/3p2p1/4p3/2BPP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"I know there's some Philidor system with this move, but I sure didn't do it right!"
9,dxe5,d4e5,r1bqkbnr/pppn1p1p/3p2p1/4P3/2B1P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"I think this is the losing move, although I don't think Black's position is any good after 5...dxe5 either. It's just not salvageable now."
10,Nxe5,d7e5,r1bqkbnr/ppp2p1p/3p2p1/4n3/2B1P3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"I think this is the losing move, although I don't think Black's position is any good after 5...dxe5 either. It's just not salvageable now."
11,Nxe5,f3e5,r1bqkbnr/ppp2p1p/3p2p1/4N3/2B1P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"Obviously, if 7...Kxf7 then 8. Qxd8"
12,dxe5,d6e5,r1bqkbnr/ppp2p1p/6p1/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,"Obviously, if 7...Kxf7 then 8. Qxd8"
13,Bxf7+,c4f7,r1bqkbnr/ppp2B1p/6p1/4p3/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,"Obviously, if 7...Kxf7 then 8. Qxd8"
14,Ke7,e8e7,r1bq1bnr/ppp1kB1p/6p1/4p3/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQ - 1 8,"Obviously, if 7...Kxf7 then 8. Qxd8"

16,Nf6,g8f6,r1bq1b1r/ppp1kB1p/5np1/4p1B1/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R w KQ - 3 9,Interposing! That will work. Right? RIGHT?
17,Bxf6+,g5f6,r1bq1b1r/ppp1kB1p/5Bp1/4p3/4P3/8/PPP2PPP/RN1QK2R b KQ - 0 9,No. No it will not. Black loses the queen. I resigned.
