Black has an extra pawn, but since it is the backward pawn on h7, it does not look all that valuable, as it seems unlikely to produce a passed pawn. Meanwhile, the white king is quite active in the centre, and he has a Pawn Endings passed pawn on d5 to set against Black's passed c5-pawn. However, despite these first impressions, the h­pawn in fact turns out to be vital after all. There are two reasons. One is that it provides a reserve tempo with ... h7-h6, which can play a vital role in a king dance for the opposition. Secondly, there is also the potential tactical breakthrough ... h5, should the black king be located within the square of the resulting white passed pawn after the reply gxh5.
These factors prove sufficient to win the game for black, but only thanks to some extremely nifty footwork by his king."
