1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"I'm looking to play defensively.  This allows some threat to be made on the centre (at e5), but without exposing the king."
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,"A cautious, defensive reply"
3,g3,g2g3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/8/5NP1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,"Preparation for Bg2 followed by king-side castling, continuing the defensive theme."
4,Nh6,g8h6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4p2n/8/8/5NP1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 3,The database lists no other games following this line.  The move looks to be bringing the fight on to the kingside while avoiding pressing the centre.
5,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4p2n/8/8/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 3,"Allows black to castle, but it's not a great square for the bishop.  c5 might have been better, threatening Ng4 then Nf2!, forking queen and rook (assuming white remained uncastled).  Either way, black's dark bishop can do little from d6"
6,Bd6,f8d6,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/3bp2n/8/8/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 3 4,"Allows black to castle, but it's not a great square for the bishop.  c5 might have been better, threatening Ng4 then Nf2!, forking queen and rook (assuming white remained uncastled).  Either way, black's dark bishop can do little from d6"
7,O-O,e1g1,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/3bp2n/8/8/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 4 4,?  I don't see what this acheives.  It only seems to be a waste of tempo
8,Na6,b8a6,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/n2bp2n/8/8/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 5 5,?  I don't see what this acheives.  It only seems to be a waste of tempo
9,d4,d2d4,r1bqk2r/pppp1ppp/n2bp2n/8/3P4/5NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 5,"With the king safely tucked away in his fortress, white begins to develop the centre"
10,Qf6,d8f6,r1b1k2r/pppp1ppp/n2bpq1n/8/3P4/5NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 6,Frees the queen onto the light squares without moving the e2 pawn.  Also threatens the d6 bishop
11,c4,c2c4,r1b1k2r/pppp1ppp/n2bpq1n/8/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 6,Frees the queen onto the light squares without moving the e2 pawn.  Also threatens the d6 bishop
12,Nf5,h6f5,r1b1k2r/pppp1ppp/n2bpq2/5n2/2PP4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 7,Both sides now have force coming together around d4
13,Ng5,f3g5,r1b1k2r/pppp1ppp/n2bpq2/5nN1/2PP4/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 2 7,Holds the bishop on c8 in place since moving the b7 pawn would cost black the rook.
14,c6,c7c6,r1b1k2r/pp1p1ppp/n1pbpq2/5nN1/2PP4/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,"Counters the threat, and would allow the d6 bishop to maintain its diagonal even if attacked from c5"
15,Ne4,g5e4,r1b1k2r/pp1p1ppp/n1pbpq2/5n2/2PPN3/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 8,"Forks queen and bishop, although the bishop is already defended by the knight on e5"
16,Qe7,f6e7,r1b1k2r/pp1pqppp/n1pbp3/5n2/2PPN3/6P1/PP2PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 9,Harassing the queen
17,Bg5,c1g5,r1b1k2r/pp1pqppp/n1pbp3/5nB1/2PPN3/6P1/PP2PPBP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 3 9,Harassing the queen
18,f6,f7f6,r1b1k2r/pp1pq1pp/n1pbpp2/5nB1/2PPN3/6P1/PP2PPBP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 0 10,"Although this seals the queen in, so would Qf8.  Qf8 would also prevent castling and therefore the easy introduction of a rook"
19,c5,c4c5,r1b1k2r/pp1pq1pp/n1pbpp2/2P2nB1/3PN3/6P1/PP2PPBP/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 0 10,"More or less forced by white's previous move.  Bb8 was also available, but would have completely trapped the bishop"
20,Bc7,d6c7,r1b1k2r/ppbpq1pp/n1p1pp2/2P2nB1/3PN3/6P1/PP2PPBP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 1 11,"More or less forced by white's previous move.  Bb8 was also available, but would have completely trapped the bishop"

22,Ba5,c7a5,r1b1k2r/pp1pq1pp/n1p1pp2/b1P2n2/3PNB2/6P1/PP2PPBP/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 3 12,"Had black taken the exchange (Bxf4, gxf4), white would have doubled pawns and a weakened kingside defence.  The text move, although attacking some of white's space, doesn't offer much else"
23,Bh3,g2h3,r1b1k2r/pp1pq1pp/n1p1pp2/b1P2n2/3PNB2/6PB/PP2PP1P/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 4 12,Brings the bishop back into play.  Its previous role of threatening the rook has long been defunct thanks to black's pawn structure
24,g6,g7g6,r1b1k2r/pp1pq2p/n1p1ppp1/b1P2n2/3PNB2/6PB/PP2PP1P/RN1Q1RK1 w kq - 0 13,Black seems to be preparing an advance with pawns
25,Nd6+,e4d6,r1b1k2r/pp1pq2p/n1pNppp1/b1P2n2/3P1B2/6PB/PP2PP1P/RN1Q1RK1 b kq - 1 13,Black had the option of a knight exchange ending in doubled d pawns for white but opted to move the king instead.  Kf8 would have resulted only in Bh6
26,Kd8,e8d8,r1bk3r/pp1pq2p/n1pNppp1/b1P2n2/3P1B2/6PB/PP2PP1P/RN1Q1RK1 w - - 2 14,Black had the option of a knight exchange ending in doubled d pawns for white but opted to move the king instead.  Kf8 would have resulted only in Bh6
