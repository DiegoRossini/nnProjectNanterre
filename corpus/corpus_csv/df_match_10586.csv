1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"I am White in this game, and I start with a safe, solid, non-committal opening, which waits to see how Black will continue."
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,"Black's move is more committal since pawns cannot move backward, and now Black has committed a pawn to the centre."
3,g3,g2g3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5NP1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,"I like to develop my kingside quickly and castle safely. My knight and fianchettoed bishop will be good defenders of my king, and also good attackers if Black messes up."
4,d4,d5d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/3p4/5NP1/PPPPPP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"This move surprised me a lot, and I have never even considered anyone playing this kind of move against me. Black has overextended his pawn, which slightly weakens his position."
5,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/3p4/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 3,Now my fianchettoed bishop will be stronger since Black can no longer block it with d5.
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/8/3p4/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 4,"If Black was going to overextend his center early, then he should've at least followed up with c5 to support the weakened d-pawn, and then try for Nc6 e5."
7,c3,c2c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/8/3p4/2P2NP1/PP1PPPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 4,"Maybe this move wasn't quite necessary, but I was impatient to try and take advantage of Black's questionable d4. I challenge the pawn with a less valuable pawn, so if Black trades, I'll have an extra centre pawn, plus an open c-file and big lead in development."
8,d3,d4d3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/8/8/2Pp1NP1/PP1PPPBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,This was the best move since c5 loses a pawn. 4...c5? then 5.cxd4 cxd4 6.Qa4  Nc6 7.Nxd4!! and I have an overwhelming attack on the c6-knight.
9,exd3,e2d3,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/8/8/2PP1NP1/PP1P1PBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 5,"Now Black is forced to bring out his queen early, allowing me to gain development tempo."
10,Qxd3,d8d3,rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/8/8/2Pq1NP1/PP1P1PBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,"Now Black is forced to bring out his queen early, allowing me to gain development tempo."
11,Ne5,f3e5,rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/4N3/8/2Pq2P1/PP1P1PBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,I can get my knight to a better square while gaining tempo.
12,Qb5,d3b5,rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/1q2N3/8/2P3P1/PP1P1PBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 2 7,"I think it was better to undevelop the queen and then try to recover the tempo loss, because now Black's queen is subject to harassment."
13,d4,d2d4,rnb1kb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/1q2N3/3P4/2P3P1/PP3PBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 7,I think it was better to develop the kingside and castle quickly
14,Nbd7,b8d7,r1b1kb1r/pppnpppp/5n2/1q2N3/3P4/2P3P1/PP3PBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 8,I think it was better to develop the kingside and castle quickly
15,Nd3,e5d3,r1b1kb1r/pppnpppp/5n2/1q6/3P4/2PN2P1/PP3PBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 8,"My knight has moved 3 times, but it is very strong on d3, and now I have a nice grip on the center squares."
16,Nb6,d7b6,r1b1kb1r/ppp1pppp/1n3n2/1q6/3P4/2PN2P1/PP3PBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 3 9,"This is a terrible move, and leaves Black very behind in development, and I can gain tempo chasing the oddly placed pieces."
17,a4,a2a4,r1b1kb1r/ppp1pppp/1n3n2/1q6/P2P4/2PN2P1/1P3PBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 9,"My a-pawn can reach a6 with tempo, for an early attack on the undeveloped queenside, so now Black has no counterplay and must defend."
18,Qf5,b5f5,r1b1kb1r/ppp1pppp/1n3n2/5q2/P2P4/2PN2P1/1P3PBP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 10,"I think it's good to trade queens and go into an endgame, where my king is already placed toward the centre, and my advantage is easier to exploit."
19,a5,a4a5,r1b1kb1r/ppp1pppp/1n3n2/P4q2/3P4/2PN2P1/1P3PBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 10,"I think it's good to trade queens and go into an endgame, where my king is already placed toward the centre, and my advantage is easier to exploit."

25,a6,a5a6,r1b1kb1r/pppnpppp/P4n2/8/3P4/2PN2P1/1P2KPBP/RNB4R b kq - 0 13,"Rb8 was another idea, but Black wanted the knight to go back to b8 to defend c6."

28,Nb8,d7b8,rnb1kb1r/pp2pppp/P1p2n2/8/1N1P4/2P3P1/1P2KPBP/RNB4R w kq - 2 15,"Black's knight has moved 4 times, and ended up exactly where it started. Black's faulty opening play has left him with a defensive underdeveloped position, while all my pieces will find good squares."
