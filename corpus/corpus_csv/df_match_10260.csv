Here I actually considered Nxg5, but realized that while sort of sacrifice might work in blitz chess (and is very fun), it is not the wisest as the attack would probably not be strong enough..."

It's not just pawn structure, but which pawns. The king's perilous position will eventually be exposed. I was quite confident at this point."
20,Bd6,b4d6,r1bq1rk1/1pp2p2/p1nbpn1p/3p2p1/2PP4/P1N1PNB1/1PQ2PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 2 11,"Trying to lock up the queen's side so I could enjoy attacking the weakened black king...and also hoping for black's next move. Trading black bishops really helps because my white bishop has so much more power at the time, since my pawns are on black and his on white."

I'm liking this more again. Just wish I hadn't had to move the Nf3 away. Plus, his knights have all the important light squares covered. Maybe this isn't so good after all."

Using the knight is awkward and the queen is going to have more important things to do. Most of these moves are not complex, nor do they have many tactical surprises (well, not yet anyway). They are simply sound, positional moves that keep building a stronger position. When you have a good positional stand, tactics somehow seem to pop up."

38,Qe7,d8e7,r1b2r2/1ppnqpk1/5n1p/p1Pp4/1P6/P1N1PPP1/2QNBK2/R6R w - - 2 20,"Sound, recentralizing the queen. But now the tactics begin to kick in..."
39,Nb5,c3b5,r1b2r2/1ppnqpk1/5n1p/pNPp4/1P6/P3PPP1/2QNBK2/R6R b - - 3 20,"I wasn't sure about this when I played it. I simply couldn't think of anything better. After I played it, I realized it was pretty good and there wasn't a lot black could do. I was expecting c6 with the reply of Nd6, making use of an excellent outpost from whence the Knight could wreak havoc. Once again, I missed black's reply. He was making what I thought was a winning position into a real battle."

Plus the afore mentioned move could lead to nasty tactics involving black queen and knights. Those pieces work very well together.
41,Nxc7,b5c7,r1b2r2/1pNnqpk1/5n1p/2Pp4/1p6/P3PPP1/2QNBK2/R6R b - - 0 21,21. axb4 Rxa1 22. Rxa1 is not really what I wanted. I still wanted to attack that black king on the h-file.
