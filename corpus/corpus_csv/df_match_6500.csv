17,Nc3,b1c3,r1b1k2r/1p1p1ppp/p1n2q1n/4p3/4P3/2NQ4/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R b KQkq - 4 9,"Since Black has decided not to defend d5, White will control it."
18,Rb8,a8b8,1rb1k2r/1p1p1ppp/p1n2q1n/4p3/4P3/2NQ4/PPP2PPP/R1B1KB1R w KQk - 5 10,"Preparing for a push down the b file and protecting the rook from Nc7+, but White gets a dangerous initiative here and Black's developmental advantage is suffering. Black was probably concerned that after the more natural ...0-0, 10 Nd5 Qd8 that Bxh6 would leave his K exposed."

21,Bg5,c1g5,1rb1k2r/1p1p1ppp/p1nq3n/3Np1B1/4P3/3Q4/PPP2PPP/R3KB1R b KQk - 8 11,"!! I rarely give this rating to my own moves but this is a very subtle but diabolical move with a hidden sting made possible by Black's inaccurate Q move, which is also very difficult to meet effectively. The immediate threat is the somewhat subtle 12 Nf6+! Ke7 (otherwise the Q is lost) 13 Ng4+ f6 14 QxQ+ KxQ  15 NxN PxN 16 BxP with an easily won game. And the natural looking 11 ...0-0? is now met by Ne7+! winning the Q."
22,f6,f7f6,1rb1k2r/1p1p2pp/p1nq1p1n/3Np1B1/4P3/3Q4/PPP2PPP/R3KB1R w KQk - 0 12,"?? Wants to drive off the Bishop and probably play 0-0 next move, and is willing to accept Bxh6 doubling and weakening the K side pawns, but misses the primary threat and so loses even more quickly. Black's best move was probably the defensive retreat ...Ng8! and patient defense, although White retains a clear edge."
23,Nxf6+,d5f6,1rb1k2r/1p1p2pp/p1nq1N1n/4p1B1/4P3/3Q4/PPP2PPP/R3KB1R b KQk - 0 12,! Fairly obvious now but exposing the hidden threat.
24,Ke7,e8e7,1rb4r/1p1pk1pp/p1nq1N1n/4p1B1/4P3/3Q4/PPP2PPP/R3KB1R w KQ - 1 13,Otherwise the Q is lost.
