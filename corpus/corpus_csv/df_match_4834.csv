Black can even have some fun counter attacking if white goes all in for an attack and gets over ambitious. When I first started playing 1.e4 I used to hate playing against the French Defence as I always felt out gunned and unfamiliar with the thematic ideas."

All in all I have to say that it hasn't let me down. In particular the long forcing line that you are about to see has served me very well indeed both over the board and in correspondence games."
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/3PP3/8/PPPN1PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,This is the Closed System of the Tarrasch which seems to be the most popular at club level. 3.... c5 is the other main line.

Now that the c-pawns have been exchanged off the white d-pawn can start to look very weak in some lines. Unfortunately, by playing 8....f6 right now, black gives white the chance to initiate some tactics that are very double -edged. Many players of the black pieces believe they will be better off playing 8....Qb6 in order to force 9.Nf3 before committing to 9...f6."

He has a rook for knight and pawn, he has displaced the black king and created structural weaknesses in the enemy position. On the negative side, black has mobile central pawns, one of which is passed and he will be able to develop more harmoniously in the short term.

Every time I've played this line over the board this position has been reached in about 10 minutes or so and at this point my opponent has stopped for a lenghty think. Before we look at the possible continuations it is worth assessing the situation. By exchanging the knights on f3 and the bishops on f5 black has managed to improve his pawn structure and weaken white's. The central pawn phalanx could be very threatening indeed in the end game and so black has every reason to be optimistic. White on the other hand must base his play around getting control of the c and or g files and infiltrating his queen into black's position. The game is on a knife edge.

Almost as important however, he denies white's queen the a4 square from where she may be able to infiltate the black camp. For the moment the white queen is fairly immobile.
Alternative variation: 18... Bc5 [ looks fairly logical but allows white to play] 19. O-O-O [ when white can get his king to safety on b1 and start marauding with his rooks. ]
Alternative variation: 18... Be7 19. O-O Qd6 20. Rac1 d4 21. Rfd1 [was played in one of my over the board games. White is well placed but I managed to go astry from here and was lucky to escape with a draw in the end.]

Alternative variation: 19... g6 [this practically forces the exchange of bishop for knight as otherwise the knight will go to h5 and then possibly to f4 from where it will be very well placed. So now] 20. Bxf6 Qa6+ $1 [an imporotant intermezzo this allowing black to capture on f6 with the queen and thereby retain control of the h8 square.] 21. Kg2 Qxf6 22.

41,Rac1,a1c1,2r5/pp2bkp1/5n2/q2pppB1/7Q/5P2/PP3PKP/2R4R b - - 7 21,I thought this move looked dangerous. Black avoids surrendering the c-file via and exchange of rooks and gives himself the option to play Qc7 doubling the heavy pieces. Now if white plays 22.Rxc6 bxc6 23.Rc1 then simply 23....c5 closes the file permanently and leaves white struggling. On this basis I decided that the best course would be to maintain the tension and try and get my queen back into the picture.
