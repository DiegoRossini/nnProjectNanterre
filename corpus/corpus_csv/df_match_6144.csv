1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,I start with Nf3: my idea was to get into a comfortable English opening without schemes with e5 and a reverse dragon to be reached. I wanted to get into a low-risk game but as the game turned out I went into complications.
2,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,Following my plan.
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/4p3/8/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,Following my plan.
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2P5/5N2/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,2...c5 was possible getting into Symmetrical English.
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,A quick change of feel and getting into a Catalan opening that is very popular at the recent years to chess community.
6,dxc4,d5c4,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/2pP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,My opponent tries to play the position as a Queens gambit accepted.
7,g3,g2g3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/8/2pP4/5NP1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,The modern variation of the Catalan: 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 d5 4.g3 dxc4 5.Bg2 c5 is relevant to the variation played above but the difference is that king's knight is not yet developed.
8,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2p5/2pP4/5NP1/PP2PP1P/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,The modern variation of the Catalan: 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 d5 4.g3 dxc4 5.Bg2 c5 is relevant to the variation played above but the difference is that king's knight is not yet developed.
9,Na3,b1a3,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/2p5/2pP4/N4NP1/PP2PP1P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,I play this position for the first time. The very first game that comes to mind is the second game of the World Chess Championship 2010 where Anand managed to win the game against Topalov where he sacrificed a central pawn for queenside activity and well-developed pieces. I tried to get some ideas from that game where I had it fresh in my mind as I saw it live in April.
10,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/8/2pp4/N4NP1/PP2PP1P/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"White sacrifices a pawn for queenside activity and well-developed pieces as mentioned above. Also, Nf3-Ne5-Nd3- the d4 pawn will be blockaded."
11,Nxc4,a3c4,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/4p3/8/2Np4/5NP1/PP2PP1P/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,"White sacrifices a pawn for queenside activity and well-developed pieces as mentioned above. Also, Nf3-Ne5-Nd3- the d4 pawn will be blockaded."
12,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/8/2Np4/5NP1/PP2PP1P/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,Bc5 was a more active square for the bishop.
13,Bg2,f1g2,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/8/2Np4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 2 7,Bc5 was a more active square for the bishop.

15,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/8/2Np4/5NP1/PP2PPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 4 8,Bc5 was a more active square for the bishop.

17,Bd2,c1d2,r1bqk2r/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/8/2Np4/5NP1/PP1BPPBP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 6 9,Trying to advance the b-pawn to b4 and b5 to kick the knight.
18,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/8/2Np4/5NP1/PP1BPPBP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 7 10,Trying to advance the b-pawn to b4 and b5 to kick the knight.

20,Qd5,d8d5,r1b2rk1/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/3q4/2Np4/5NP1/PP1BPPBP/1R1Q1RK1 w - - 9 11,A mistake that allows White to take a complete control of the position.
21,Nfe5,f3e5,r1b2rk1/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/3qN3/2Np4/6P1/PP1BPPBP/1R1Q1RK1 b - - 10 11,The most energetic move.

23,b4,b2b4,r1b2rk1/pp2bppp/2n1pn2/2q1N3/1PNp4/6P1/P2BPPBP/1R1Q1RK1 b - - 0 12,12.b4!

25,Bxb4,d2b4,r1b2rk1/pp2bppp/4pn2/2q1N3/1BNp4/6P1/P3PPBP/1R1Q1RK1 b - - 0 13,Regaining one pawn back. White rules out the position.

30,Rd8,f8d8,r1br2k1/pp2qppp/4pn2/4N3/2NQ4/6P1/P3PPBP/1R3RK1 w - - 1 16,The most energetic place for the queen as it pins the f6 knight to the queen and getting  it into an aggressive position.
31,Qh4,d4h4,r1br2k1/pp2qppp/4pn2/4N3/2N4Q/6P1/P3PPBP/1R3RK1 b - - 2 16,The most energetic place for the queen as it pins the f6 knight to the queen and getting  it into an aggressive position.
32,Rb8,a8b8,1rbr2k1/pp2qppp/4pn2/4N3/2N4Q/6P1/P3PPBP/1R3RK1 w - - 3 17,A mistake. Although the position was still lost with a piece down for Black for a pawn.
33,Nc6,e5c6,1rbr2k1/pp2qppp/2N1pn2/8/2N4Q/6P1/P3PPBP/1R3RK1 b - - 4 17,! I am winning the exchange by this move.
34,bxc6,b7c6,1rbr2k1/p3qppp/2p1pn2/8/2N4Q/6P1/P3PPBP/1R3RK1 w - - 0 18,Any move will do here. 19.Rbb1 or Rfb1 were also good moves. I think this move is more forcing as it forces Black to exchange Queens and go into a lost endgame with a piece down and weak and isolated pawns on a7 and c6.
35,Rxb8,b1b8,1Rbr2k1/p3qppp/2p1pn2/8/2N4Q/6P1/P3PPBP/5RK1 b - - 0 18,Any move will do here. 19.Rbb1 or Rfb1 were also good moves. I think this move is more forcing as it forces Black to exchange Queens and go into a lost endgame with a piece down and weak and isolated pawns on a7 and c6.
