1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This is a very instructional positional game played by a young Gary Kasparov, and a former world champion, Petrosian, who is reduced to a state of complete paralysis."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"A useful check, Black develops his second piece and is ready to castle."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"A useful check, Black develops his second piece and is ready to castle."
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"A useful check, Black develops his second piece and is ready to castle."
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"A useful check, Black develops his second piece and is ready to castle."
6,Bb4+,f8b4,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,"A useful check, Black develops his second piece and is ready to castle."
7,Bd2,c1d2,rnbqk2r/pppp1ppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/5N2/PP1BPPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 3 4,"Objectively speaking, not the most ambitious move in Bogo theory.  Here 4. Nbd2 is considered to be stronger these days, but Kasparov's reasoning is that Black is going to play ...d5 at some point and the exchange of dark-squared bishops will leave Black with weakness on the dark squares.  Also, the remaining Black light-squared bishop will be bad, as it is hemmed in by its own central pawns."
8,Qe7,d8e7,rnb1k2r/ppppqppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/5N2/PP1BPPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 4 5,"Black is in no hurry to exchange on d2, as after 4. Qxd2 d5 5. Nc3, White keeps a slight edge.  Alternatively, if White tries to act in the center now, Black is able to force off another set of pieces after 4...Bxc3 5. Bxc3 Ne4.  As a general rule, the side with less space will seek exchanges to make more room for his pieces."
9,g3,g2g3,rnb1k2r/ppppqppp/4pn2/8/1bPP4/5NP1/PP1BPP1P/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,White's pressure will be based around the influence of the g2 Bishop.
10,Bxd2+,b4d2,rnb1k2r/ppppqppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/5NP1/PP1bPP1P/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"The Bishop has served it's purpose of restraining White's expansion in the center, so Petrosian decides to exchange it off."
11,Qxd2,d1d2,rnb1k2r/ppppqppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/5NP1/PP1QPP1P/RN2KB1R b KQkq - 0 6,Black finally issues a challenge to the White center.
12,O-O,e8g8,rnb2rk1/ppppqppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/5NP1/PP1QPP1P/RN2KB1R w KQ - 1 7,Black finally issues a challenge to the White center.
13,Bg2,f1g2,rnb2rk1/ppppqppp/4pn2/8/2PP4/5NP1/PP1QPPBP/RN2K2R b KQ - 2 7,Black finally issues a challenge to the White center.
14,d5,d7d5,rnb2rk1/ppp1qppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/5NP1/PP1QPPBP/RN2K2R w KQ - 0 8,Black finally issues a challenge to the White center.
15,O-O,e1g1,rnb2rk1/ppp1qppp/4pn2/3p4/2PP4/5NP1/PP1QPPBP/RN3RK1 b - - 1 8,"This move gets a ?! dubious mark as Black is in too much of a hurry to simplify.  It is far better to keep a barrier to the g2 Bishop with 8...Rd8 9. Qc2 Nc6 10. cd ed 11. Nc3 Bg4 when Black would have active pieces to compensate for his slightly weak pawn structure on the Queenside.  The White Bishop, which becomes a terror in the game continuation would have been kept under better control."

17,Na3,b1a3,rnb2rk1/ppp1qppp/4pn2/8/2pP4/N4NP1/PP1QPPBP/R4RK1 b - - 1 9,"An excellent idea!!  White intends to recapture on c4 with his Queen's Knight rather than lose time with 9. Ne5 c5, when Black has a fighting chance as White still has two pieces sleeping on the Queenside."
18,c5,c7c5,rnb2rk1/pp2qppp/4pn2/2p5/2pP4/N4NP1/PP1QPPBP/R4RK1 w - - 0 10,The elimination of White's strong central pawn will open a highway into the Black position.
19,dxc5,d4c5,rnb2rk1/pp2qppp/4pn2/2P5/2p5/N4NP1/PP1QPPBP/R4RK1 b - - 0 10,The correct capture as it will lure the Black Queen to a square where it can be the subject of tempo gaining attacks by the White pieces.
20,Qxc5,e7c5,rnb2rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/2q5/2p5/N4NP1/PP1QPPBP/R4RK1 w - - 0 11,White has the initiative due to his more active pieces.
21,Rac1,a1c1,rnb2rk1/pp3ppp/4pn2/2q5/2p5/N4NP1/PP1QPPBP/2R2RK1 b - - 1 11,White has the initiative due to his more active pieces.
22,Nc6,b8c6,r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2q5/2p5/N4NP1/PP1QPPBP/2R2RK1 w - - 2 12,Black can't defend the c4 pawn with b5 as ...Nd4 will win the pawn back and give White a better game.
23,Nxc4,a3c4,r1b2rk1/pp3ppp/2n1pn2/2q5/2N5/5NP1/PP1QPPBP/2R2RK1 b - - 0 12,"Removing the Queen from the line of fire, but the best move was 12...Rd8."
24,Qe7,c5e7,r1b2rk1/pp2qppp/2n1pn2/8/2N5/5NP1/PP1QPPBP/2R2RK1 w - - 1 13,"Removing the Queen from the line of fire, but the best move was 12...Rd8."
25,Nfe5,f3e5,r1b2rk1/pp2qppp/2n1pn2/4N3/2N5/6P1/PP1QPPBP/2R2RK1 b - - 2 13,Now Black is unable to solve the fundamental problem of developing the c8 Bishop without giving White strong pressure on the b7 pawn.
26,Nxe5,c6e5,r1b2rk1/pp2qppp/4pn2/4n3/2N5/6P1/PP1QPPBP/2R2RK1 w - - 0 14,"White is in absolute control of the c-file.  Black now can't play 14...Be7 clearing a spot for the a-rook, as 15. Rc7 is crushing."

28,Nd5,f6d5,r1b2rk1/pp2qppp/4p3/3nN3/8/6P1/PP1QPPBP/2R2RK1 w - - 1 15,"Petrosian offers a pawn to accelerate his development.  After 15. Bxd5? exd5 16. Qxd5 Bh3 17. Rd1 Rfd8 all of Black's pieces come to life, and the c8 bishop is the best piece on the board and Black's rooks enjoy open lines."
29,Rfd1,f1d1,r1b2rk1/pp2qppp/4p3/3nN3/8/6P1/PP1QPPBP/2RR2K1 b - - 2 15,White's pieces are taking up premium squares.
30,Nb6,d5b6,r1b2rk1/pp2qppp/1n2p3/4N3/8/6P1/PP1QPPBP/2RR2K1 w - - 3 16,"Exclam.  The sublety behind this move is that if now 16...f6 attempting to drive away the e5 Knight, then 17. Nc4 Nxc4 18. Rxc4 and Black cannot prevent a rook invasion of the 7th rank, as the White Queen is controlling c7."
31,Qa5,d2a5,r1b2rk1/pp2qppp/1n2p3/Q3N3/8/6P1/PP2PPBP/2RR2K1 b - - 4 16,"Exclam.  The sublety behind this move is that if now 16...f6 attempting to drive away the e5 Knight, then 17. Nc4 Nxc4 18. Rxc4 and Black cannot prevent a rook invasion of the 7th rank, as the White Queen is controlling c7."
