1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"A rather tricky way to reply to 1. d4. If I would have played c4 and tried to go for a KID setup, my opponent would have had the chance to delay the development of the Ng8 until he would have played f5 or f6, thus saving quite a few tempos in a normal position."

3,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Lucky for me, I love semi-open position and decided that the c-pawn could stay in its place for now."
4,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk1nr/ppppppbp/6p1/8/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 3,A rather strange plan. The early development of the Queen's Knight is rather rare because the pressure on d4 can be easily parried and Black is left with a lack of space and means to attack my pawn centre.

7,Be3,c1e3,r1bqk1nr/ppppppbp/2n3p1/8/3PP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 4 4,I wanted to keep the possibility of playing f4 and there is no danger on the long diagonal since Black's c-pawn isn't taking part in the struggle for the centre.
8,e6,e7e6,r1bqk1nr/pppp1pbp/2n1p1p1/8/3PP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"I recently read a post on a chess forum about the Universal Attack, which would be best summed-up by developing pieces behind pawns. I've played and crushed plenty of players that would try to develop on this way. But they were patzers and my opponent wasn't, so I needed to be careful and not overextend myself."
9,f4,f2f4,r1bqk1nr/pppp1pbp/2n1p1p1/8/3PPP2/2N1B3/PPP3PP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,I just love pushing the pawn to f5 in these kind of positions. It usually means your attack is on its way and your opponent is soon going to be in deep trouble.
10,a6,a7a6,r1bqk1nr/1ppp1pbp/p1n1p1p1/8/3PPP2/2N1B3/PPP3PP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 0 6,"Black sure is taking his time. The plan with a6 and b5 works better when there is pressure on e4. That isn't the case here, so playing like this seems a little artificial."
11,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqk1nr/1ppp1pbp/p1n1p1p1/8/3PPP2/2N1BN2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"Since b4 isn't a real threat, there is no need to weaken to Q-side with moves like a3, giving my opponent opportunities to open lines there. Especially since I planed to castle that way in a bit."
12,b5,b7b5,r1bqk1nr/2pp1pbp/p1n1p1p1/1p6/3PPP2/2N1BN2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"Since b4 isn't a real threat, there is no need to weaken to Q-side with moves like a3, giving my opponent opportunities to open lines there. Especially since I planed to castle that way in a bit."

I felt really good about my position because thanks to Black's first move I should have the upper-hand in opening lines first. On top of that, I am better developed, so any active operations would find me better placed to seize the advantage."

18,b4,b5b4,r1bq1rk1/2ppnpbp/p1n1p1p1/8/1p1PPP2/2NBBN2/PPPQ2PP/2KR3R w - - 0 10,No problem. Black doesn't have any pieces to attack with and I can start to push the K-side pawns soon. My Knight will be more useful there.

There is an old saying in chess that has been proven time and again. Don't make needless pawn moves on the flank where you are weaker. Because my pawns were on their starting squares, I can block the position and deflate Black's attack, while he can't do the same about my pawn-thrusting ideas."
