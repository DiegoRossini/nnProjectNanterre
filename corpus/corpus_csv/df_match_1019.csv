1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Bishop's opening.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Bishop's opening.
3,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,Bishop's opening.
4,Nh6,g8h6,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/7n/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 3,Unusual response.  Black actually does pretty well with Nf6 or Nc6.  Nh6--not so much.
5,Qh5,d1h5,rnbqkb1r/pppp1ppp/7n/4p2Q/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 3 3,Not in the database.  Pf7 is protected by the curious Nh6.  Black should defend against QxPe5+.
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n4n/4p2Q/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 4 4,Nc6 does the trick.
7,Nf3,g1f3,r1bqkb1r/pppp1ppp/2n4n/4p2Q/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 5 4,White's advantage.
8,d6,d7d6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np3n/4p2Q/2B1P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 5,Black counters.
9,Ng5,f3g5,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np3n/4p1NQ/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 1 5,"Ooh, white threatens Pf7 with a lot of power, though g6 will change that."
10,g6,g7g6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2p1p/2np2pn/4p1NQ/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 6,"Nope.  Qh4 would protect Ng5, at least for the short term.  White's knight, however, is probably lost."
11,Qf3,h5f3,r1bqkb1r/ppp2p1p/2np2pn/4p1N1/2B1P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 1 6,"Nope.  Qh4 would protect Ng5, at least for the short term.  White's knight, however, is probably lost."
12,Qxg5,d8g5,r1b1kb1r/ppp2p1p/2np2pn/4p1q1/2B1P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 7,"If white castled, she could follow with BxNh6.  BxB, QxP+.  It is not a lot of advantage, and besides, without protecting h3 black could play Bh3, costing white a rook, considering that the black queen sits on the g file."

Probably Bh3.  Qg3 would be an expensive answer, given that down 5 points fair trades favor black.  But otherwise white stands to drop two more points with the bishop/rook exchange."
