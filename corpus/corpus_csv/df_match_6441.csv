1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This is a very strong move. This frees the pieces off of the back rank and controls the center. This is also one of my favorite moves to play.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"This move is just as strong. This move does the same motives as my move, but also opposes my center control. Statistically, many games with these moves are drawn, but with my motive of ""play to win"", I went for an aggressive opening."
3,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,This is with the intention of the Vienna game. This attacks f7 and controls the center. The theory also calls for f4 to be played later to dominate the center.
4,Qf6,d8f6,rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/5q2/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 2 3,"I have seen this before, but I saw no apparent use of it. This also violates the strategical rule of ""Don't bring your queen out too early."""
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/5q2/4p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 3 3,"Since f4 will be hard to push at this rate, I decided to take advantage of my situation by controlling the center even more, with the intention of making my knights and pawns to occupy the center."
6,Qg6,f6g6,rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/6q1/4p3/2B1P3/2N5/PPPP1PPP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 4 4,This was probably played to fight the g2 pawn.
7,Qf3,d1f3,rnb1kbnr/pppp1ppp/6q1/4p3/2B1P3/2N2Q2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 5 4,"This is not something I usually play or see. In fact, I would have thought for 30 minutes in a tournament room trying to find the best move (which could be what I just played). I did not have much time on my hands here, so I just played this to protect the g2 pawn and protect the e4 pawn in case Nf6 was next."
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnb1kb1r/pppp1ppp/5nq1/4p3/2B1P3/2N2Q2/PPPP1PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 6 5,Fortunately that did happen next and I could continue developing.
9,d3,d2d3,rnb1kb1r/pppp1ppp/5nq1/4p3/2B1P3/2NP1Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR b KQkq - 0 5,Perhaps this was not the best course of action. I have now overprotected my pawn and my knight would go really nice where my queen is now.
10,Bb4,f8b4,rnb1k2r/pppp1ppp/5nq1/4p3/1bB1P3/2NP1Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQkq - 1 6,"In an attempt to pin the knight and king, my plan is ruined to do the futile Nb5 to win a rook or at least a pawn."
11,Bd2,c1d2,rnb1k2r/pppp1ppp/5nq1/4p3/1bB1P3/2NP1Q2/PPPB1PPP/R3K1NR b KQkq - 2 6,I still want to play Nb5. I do not care whether my king is exposed or not because the position was already closed by d3.
12,d6,d7d6,rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/3p1nq1/4p3/1bB1P3/2NP1Q2/PPPB1PPP/R3K1NR w KQkq - 0 7,"I was worried about Bg4 and later h5 and a king side attack. I could easily defend, but I felt like I could start my own instead of letting him start his."
13,h3,h2h3,rnb1k2r/ppp2ppp/3p1nq1/4p3/1bB1P3/2NP1Q1P/PPPB1PP1/R3K1NR b KQkq - 0 7,This also gears up for g4 if I can get any more protection.
14,O-O,e8g8,rnb2rk1/ppp2ppp/3p1nq1/4p3/1bB1P3/2NP1Q1P/PPPB1PP1/R3K1NR w KQ - 1 8,This castles into a bishop pin.
15,Nb5,c3b5,rnb2rk1/ppp2ppp/3p1nq1/1N2p3/1bB1P3/3P1Q1P/PPPB1PP1/R3K1NR b KQ - 2 8,"I try to go for my Nb5 now. I just wanted to trade my bad bishop off at this point and later go for Na3, c3, Nc2, d4."
16,a6,a7a6,rnb2rk1/1pp2ppp/p2p1nq1/1N2p3/1bB1P3/3P1Q1P/PPPB1PP1/R3K1NR w KQ - 0 9,"Attacking the knight, but I win a pawn."
17,Nxc7,b5c7,rnb2rk1/1pN2ppp/p2p1nq1/4p3/1bB1P3/3P1Q1P/PPPB1PP1/R3K1NR b KQ - 0 9,This also attacks the rook.
18,Ra7,a8a7,1nb2rk1/rpN2ppp/p2p1nq1/4p3/1bB1P3/3P1Q1P/PPPB1PP1/R3K1NR w KQ - 1 10,"The intermediate move of Bxd2+ could have been played, but now the opponent lost a bishop as well."
19,Bxb4,d2b4,1nb2rk1/rpN2ppp/p2p1nq1/4p3/1BB1P3/3P1Q1P/PPP2PP1/R3K1NR b KQ - 0 10,I win a bishop and I still have my bishop pair while opening the position.
20,Rd8,f8d8,1nbr2k1/rpN2ppp/p2p1nq1/4p3/1BB1P3/3P1Q1P/PPP2PP1/R3K1NR w KQ - 1 11,To protect the pawn.
