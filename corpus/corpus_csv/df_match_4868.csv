1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This game is one I thought I played fairly well. It is good to have luck on your side also. Kings Opening. I am especially weak playing as black. Partially because the guy that got me into playing chess always let me start the games as white. I played probably 300 games as white before I ever played a game as black. Feel free to comment or point out a move I missed or even how lucky I was this game.
