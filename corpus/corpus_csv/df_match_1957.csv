2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/1P6/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Black occupies the center immediately.
3,Bb2,c1b2,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/8/1P6/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,White attacks the pawn; Black defends it. Somewhat more common is 2...Nc6.

5,g3,g2g3,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4p3/8/1P4P1/PBPPPP1P/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"White fianchettoes his *other* Bishop, while Black develops both Knights. This is a typical hypermodern setup, with Black occupying the center directly and White attacking it from the wings."
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/8/1P4P1/PBPPPP1P/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"White fianchettoes his *other* Bishop, while Black develops both Knights. This is a typical hypermodern setup, with Black occupying the center directly and White attacking it from the wings."
7,Bg2,f1g2,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/3p1n2/4p3/8/1P4P1/PBPPPPBP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 2 4,"White fianchettoes his *other* Bishop, while Black develops both Knights. This is a typical hypermodern setup, with Black occupying the center directly and White attacking it from the wings."
8,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4p3/8/1P4P1/PBPPPPBP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 3 5,"White fianchettoes his *other* Bishop, while Black develops both Knights. This is a typical hypermodern setup, with Black occupying the center directly and White attacking it from the wings."
9,c4,c2c4,r1bqkb1r/ppp2ppp/2np1n2/4p3/2P5/1P4P1/PB1PPPBP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 0 5,"Giving more power to the Bg2, by controlling d5 and giving space for a White Knight on c3."
10,g6,g7g6,r1bqkb1r/ppp2p1p/2np1np1/4p3/2P5/1P4P1/PB1PPPBP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 0 6,"Black prepares to fianchetto his own KB. White, meanwhile, intends to play Ne2 and d2-d4, but he must be careful: his pawn moves have left many potential weaknesses."
11,e3,e2e3,r1bqkb1r/ppp2p1p/2np1np1/4p3/2P5/1P2P1P1/PB1P1PBP/RN1QK1NR b KQkq - 0 6,"Black prepares to fianchetto his own KB. White, meanwhile, intends to play Ne2 and d2-d4, but he must be careful: his pawn moves have left many potential weaknesses."
12,Bh6,f8h6,r1bqk2r/ppp2p1p/2np1npb/4p3/2P5/1P2P1P1/PB1P1PBP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 1 7,"This awkward-looking move actually puts pressure on e3 and makes d2-d4 more dangerous for White, as the e3 pawn may become quite vulnerable and Black may even look for a sacrifice there."
13,Ne2,g1e2,r1bqk2r/ppp2p1p/2np1npb/4p3/2P5/1P2P1P1/PB1PNPBP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 2 7,"? White would have been better off castling immediately. At the time, I wanted to prevent an e5-e4 intrusion, but the WQ will prove too easily harassed on c2."
14,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/ppp2p1p/2np1npb/4p3/2P5/1P2P1P1/PB1PNPBP/RN1QK2R w KQ - 3 8,"? White would have been better off castling immediately. At the time, I wanted to prevent an e5-e4 intrusion, but the WQ will prove too easily harassed on c2."
15,Qc2,d1c2,r1bq1rk1/ppp2p1p/2np1npb/4p3/2P5/1P2P1P1/PBQPNPBP/RN2K2R b KQ - 4 8,"? White would have been better off castling immediately. At the time, I wanted to prevent an e5-e4 intrusion, but the WQ will prove too easily harassed on c2."
16,Nb4,c6b4,r1bq1rk1/ppp2p1p/3p1npb/4p3/1nP5/1P2P1P1/PBQPNPBP/RN2K2R w KQ - 5 9,8...Bf5 works as well.
17,Qc3,c2c3,r1bq1rk1/ppp2p1p/3p1npb/4p3/1nP5/1PQ1P1P1/PB1PNPBP/RN2K2R b KQ - 6 9,Threatening the Knight and optimistically lining up with the Bishop against the Black kingside.
18,a5,a7a5,r1bq1rk1/1pp2p1p/3p1npb/p3p3/1nP5/1PQ1P1P1/PB1PNPBP/RN2K2R w KQ - 0 10,"Black defends his Knight rather than retreat it--looking for possibilities on c2 or d3, no doubt."
19,d4,d2d4,r1bq1rk1/1pp2p1p/3p1npb/p3p3/1nPP4/1PQ1P1P1/PB2NPBP/RN2K2R b KQ - 0 10,"? Once again, White should have simply castled. This move further weakens e4."
20,Bf5,c8f5,r2q1rk1/1pp2p1p/3p1npb/p3pb2/1nPP4/1PQ1P1P1/PB2NPBP/RN2K2R w KQ - 1 11,"Threatening ...Nc2+, of course. There was actually a subtler, nastier move here: 10...Bh3! This effectively trades off White's Bishop after 11.O-O Bxg2 12.Kxg2, leaving the light squares around the White King dangerously weak. The point is that White must not take: 11.Bxh3?? Ne4! and the White Queen is a goner (e.g. 12.Qc1 Nd3+)."
21,Na3,b1a3,r2q1rk1/1pp2p1p/3p1npb/p3pb2/1nPP4/NPQ1P1P1/PB2NPBP/R3K2R b KQ - 2 11,"? White defends c2 but overlooks d3, and must pay the price. Yet again, the correct choice was 11.O-O. Castle early; castle often!"
22,Nd3+,b4d3,r2q1rk1/1pp2p1p/3p1npb/p3pb2/2PP4/NPQnP1P1/PB2NPBP/R3K2R w KQ - 3 12,"?? Too overly aggressive, this move allows 12...Nxf2 and the threat of 13...Ne4+. The result is a horrid incursion into the White position and an absolutely lost game after 12...Nxf2 13.Ke1 (avoiding the fork) Nd3+ 14.Kf1 Ne4! Best was 12.Kf1."
23,Kd2,e1d2,r2q1rk1/1pp2p1p/3p1npb/p3pb2/2PP4/NPQnP1P1/PB1KNPBP/R6R b - - 4 12,"?? Too overly aggressive, this move allows 12...Nxf2 and the threat of 13...Ne4+. The result is a horrid incursion into the White position and an absolutely lost game after 12...Nxf2 13.Ke1 (avoiding the fork) Nd3+ 14.Kf1 Ne4! Best was 12.Kf1."
24,Ne4+,f6e4,r2q1rk1/1pp2p1p/3p2pb/p3pb2/2PPn3/NPQnP1P1/PB1KNPBP/R6R w - - 5 13,"? Too early; 12...Nxf2 was called for instead. Black is still better, but now White can diffuse the attack somewhat."
25,Bxe4,g2e4,r2q1rk1/1pp2p1p/3p2pb/p3pb2/2PPB3/NPQnP1P1/PB1KNP1P/R6R b - - 0 13,"White gets his Rook out of danger, defends f2, and prepares f2-f3. All the while, the weak e3 pawn is pinned to the White King, and White's only threat--the idea of a strike down the a1-h8 diagonal--can be put to the sword any time Black sees fit, as the White Bishop cannot escape from the Nd3."
26,Bxe4,f5e4,r2q1rk1/1pp2p1p/3p2pb/p3p3/2PPb3/NPQnP1P1/PB1KNP1P/R6R w - - 0 14,"White gets his Rook out of danger, defends f2, and prepares f2-f3. All the while, the weak e3 pawn is pinned to the White King, and White's only threat--the idea of a strike down the a1-h8 diagonal--can be put to the sword any time Black sees fit, as the White Bishop cannot escape from the Nd3."
27,Rhf1,h1f1,r2q1rk1/1pp2p1p/3p2pb/p3p3/2PPb3/NPQnP1P1/PB1KNP1P/R4R2 b - - 1 14,"White gets his Rook out of danger, defends f2, and prepares f2-f3. All the while, the weak e3 pawn is pinned to the White King, and White's only threat--the idea of a strike down the a1-h8 diagonal--can be put to the sword any time Black sees fit, as the White Bishop cannot escape from the Nd3."
28,c5,c7c5,r2q1rk1/1p3p1p/3p2pb/p1p1p3/2PPb3/NPQnP1P1/PB1KNP1P/R4R2 w - - 0 15,"Here I probably would have played 14...Nxb2, but the text is actually reasonably strong, although it gives Black weaknesses at b5 and b6. The point is that since the pawn on e3 is pinned, Black can force his way through on d4. If White takes on e5 or c5, the d-file opens up, with the Black Queen glaring down at the helpless White King."
29,d5,d4d5,r2q1rk1/1p3p1p/3p2pb/p1pPp3/2P1b3/NPQnP1P1/PB1KNP1P/R4R2 b - - 0 15,"Every line I saw seemed to end up with my two Knights against Black's two Bishops, so this move seemed natural. Knights are stronger than Bishops in closed positions, and besides, there was no way I was going to let Black open the d-file against my King. This move also establishes strongpoints on c6 and e6, and blockades the Black d-pawn: my Knights should have a field day."
30,Rb8,a8b8,1r1q1rk1/1p3p1p/3p2pb/p1pPp3/2P1b3/NPQnP1P1/PB1KNP1P/R4R2 w - - 1 16,"? This is not a tactical misstep, but rather a problem of timing: this move doesn't present any threats or eliminate any of White's options, so White has enough tempo to finally kick his counterplay into gear."
