5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/3PP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"this is almost automatic. Other tries are Nd2(hypermodern) e5(advanced) or exd5(exchange)

3. e5 has had a bit of a resurgance in the resent past. Against 3. e5 I recommend attacking white's centre right away with 3. ...c5. 

3. exd5 is very similar to the exchange varation in the french is of no real threat to black. Although he needs to watch out for possible attack along the light square weakness. white will often try moves like Nb5, Qa4 etc. These are paired with early ...Bd7 and ...a6"

...Nd7, ...Nf6.

...Nd7 is my favoraite and I believe black's strongest defence against e5 capture. But in this line black has to becareful of playing the early ...h6 because of the weakness on g6 and light sqaures."

9,Ng3,e4g3,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/5b2/3P4/6N1/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 5,most top players prefer this move over the sharp Ng5. Although ig white is going to play for a serious advantage then this is the only move. The Ng3 is more solid and positional in nature. It's tactical idea is to support the h2-h4-h5 push.
10,Bg6,f5g6,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p3b1/8/3P4/6N1/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 3 6,"one of whites main strategic ideas is to control e5 with knight. Thus the vast majority of games revolve around a battle for e5. Strategically speaking if white can gain control of the e5 square then black will almost always lose. 

So from black's point of view is critical to maintain the balance of power of e5. However, black is not without his resources since d5 can become a very strong point for a knight. Plus once white plays Ne5 black can most of the time undermine it by playing ...c5 or f6 under certain circumstances."
11,Nf3,g1f3,rn1qkbnr/pp2pppp/2p3b1/8/3P4/5NN1/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 4 6,"one of whites main strategic ideas is to control e5 with knight.

So from black's point of view is critical to maintain the balance of power of e5. However, black is not without his resources since d5 can become a very strong point for a knight. Plus once white plays Ne5 black can most of the time undermine it by playing ...c5 or f6 under certain circumstances."
12,Nf6,g8f6,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2nb1/8/3P4/5NN1/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 5 7,"...Nf6 is ok beacuse it gains a tempo, but basically hands over the e5 square for white. After this it's very hard to avoid being squeezed. I believe the main moves are ...Nd7 or ...e6 . The idea is that eventually black will be able to break free with either ...e5 or ...c5."
13,h4,h2h4,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2nb1/8/3P3P/5NN1/PPP2PP1/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"There is a threat to this move, quite simply to trap the bishop which is very often a target in the Caro-Kann. The main line continues 6. ... h6 7. Nf3 Nd7 8. h5 Bh7 9. Bd3 Bxd3 10. Qxd3 after which white gets a tidy position where black is still restricted. 

But from black's perspective the exchange for his weakest bishop for white's strongest bishop is a strategic victory. So in this away the caro-kann has a major advantage over the french in that the LSB is not a liablity."
14,h6,h7h6,rn1qkb1r/pp2ppp1/2p2nbp/8/3P3P/5NN1/PPP2PP1/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,providing a retreat square for the bishop
15,Ne5,f3e5,rn1qkb1r/pp2ppp1/2p2nbp/4N3/3P3P/6N1/PPP2PP1/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 8,"one of the ways that white tries to gain the advantage is to occupy e5 with the knight. For most players it is a matter of when. Some like to occupy early while others like to hold out for a clear break. I played 8. Ne5 to setup a trap for Ashleyanderson's learning benefit. 

The disadvantage of playing Ne5 early is that it can be easily undermined with ...c5, Nd7 ...or f6"
16,Nbd7,b8d7,r2qkb1r/pp1nppp1/2p2nbp/4N3/3P3P/6N1/PPP2PP1/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 9,"?
This natural looking move is serious mistake by Ashelyanderson. Because he misses the threat. The threat is Nxg6! which causes serious weaknesses in black defence.

The only correct move is ...Bh7.

If you play ...h6 early it is important to know the how and when...h6 is to be played. As there is a very familar trap in the caro-kann. 

1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 dxe4 4.Nxe4 and now instead of Bf5 black might play 4...Nd7 if so then this is the line 5.Ng5 now it is tempting to play h6 but it's a mistake because after h6 then 6.Ne6(if fxe6 then 7.Qh5+ g6 8.Qxg6#) 6...Qb6 7.Nxf8 Nxf8 8.Nf3 with the advantage getting back to the right line 5...Ngf6 6.Bd3 e6 (if 6...h6 then 7.Ne6 fxe6 and 8.Bg6#) 7.N1f3 Bd6 8.Qe2 h6 9.Ne4 Nxe4 10.Qxe4 Nf6 11.Qe2 b6 12.Bd2 Bb7 13.0-0-0 Qc7 if 13...o-o then g4! opening lines on the enemy king"

In truth it is one of black's most solid replies to 1. e4. However, it is an advanced defensive line for black because accurate play and a clear uderstanding of the strategic mofits are required to maintain the balance. It requires strong memorization and familarity of the many openning lines. 

The flip side is that if you like to play the french then many of the ideas employed by white and black will be familar to you. So the jump for you will not be as great. I am glad that Ashleyanderson played the way he did because I hoped he learned a valueable lesson in the most dangerous line attacking theme that white has which is the kingside attack on g6."
