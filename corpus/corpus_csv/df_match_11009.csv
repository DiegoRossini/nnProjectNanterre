On the other hand this move is not played frequently by white players so it shouldn't be a very strong move."

1) 16...exf4 -  this would leave me with doubled and isolated pawns on the f-file.
2) 16...b5 - defending c4 so my bishop could go there.
3) Move my queen - so my bishop could go on d7.
Naturally I didn't like any of these so I chose..."
