Premature, this tosses a pawn to weaken the dark squares in black's position, but it is unnecesary and losing some of the edge white holds in time. Nf3 was called for, in line with simple principles of development.  One of my greatest weaknesses psychologically as a chess player is that when I sense I have an advantage I overpress it recklessly.  This is a classic example. I feel I have enough knowledge and tactical strength to get to class A and beyond within a year if only I can get rid of these bad mental habits in otb games.  This should come with experience."
