11,f3,f2f3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p1np1/8/3NP3/2N2P2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,A standard move that prepares Be3 and a kingside pawnstorm.  I believe that the usual strategy is that White castles queenside and Black castles kingside.  Then they race to break open the enemy kings' positions.
12,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/3NP3/2N2P2/PPP3PP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 7,Not sure that this is standard but it seemed good at the time: it attacks the normally weak f7 pawn and prepares to defend the pawns in front of a queenside-castled king.  It also gives White the option of castling kingside.
13,Be3,c1e3,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 2 7,Not sure that this is standard but it seemed good at the time: it attacks the normally weak f7 pawn and prepares to defend the pawns in front of a queenside-castled king.  It also gives White the option of castling kingside.
14,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk2r/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 3 8,Not sure that this is standard but it seemed good at the time: it attacks the normally weak f7 pawn and prepares to defend the pawns in front of a queenside-castled king.  It also gives White the option of castling kingside.
15,Bc4,f1c4,r1bqk2r/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/2BNP3/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 4 8,Not sure that this is standard but it seemed good at the time: it attacks the normally weak f7 pawn and prepares to defend the pawns in front of a queenside-castled king.  It also gives White the option of castling kingside.
16,Bd7,c8d7,r2qk2r/pp1bppbp/2np1np1/8/2BNP3/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 5 9,I'd expected Black to castle immediately but he delayed that in favour of preparing to control the half-open c-file.
17,Qd2,d1d2,r2qk2r/pp1bppbp/2np1np1/8/2BNP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3K2R b KQkq - 6 9,"Preparing both queenside castling and attacking the fianchettoed bishop, but I have to be careful not to over-burden my queen with defending both Bh6 and Nd4."
18,Rc8,a8c8,2rqk2r/pp1bppbp/2np1np1/8/2BNP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3K2R w KQk - 7 10,"Black plays very actively, preparing to get his attack in first."
19,Bb3,c4b3,2rqk2r/pp1bppbp/2np1np1/8/3NP3/1BN1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3K2R b KQk - 8 10,"I didn't want this B exposed to a discovered attack, eg 10. ...Nxd4 11.Qxd4 Nh5 especially as I wanted to play Bh6 soon."
20,Ne5,c6e5,2rqk2r/pp1bppbp/3p1np1/4n3/3NP3/1BN1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3K2R w KQk - 9 11,Threatening ...Nc4 and meanwhile defending f7 but this second move with this N delays Black's completion of his development just too long.
21,Bh6,e3h6,2rqk2r/pp1bppbp/3p1npB/4n3/3NP3/1BN2P2/PPPQ2PP/R3K2R b KQk - 10 11,"! By attacking the fianchettoed B before Black has castled, I severely inhibit his completion of his development."
22,Bxh6,g7h6,2rqk2r/pp1bpp1p/3p1npb/4n3/3NP3/1BN2P2/PPPQ2PP/R3K2R w KQk - 0 12,"There is no safe way for Black to chase this Q away, so he just has to carry on attacking, but without his key black-squared B."
23,Qxh6,d2h6,2rqk2r/pp1bpp1p/3p1npQ/4n3/3NP3/1BN2P2/PPP3PP/R3K2R b KQk - 0 12,"There is no safe way for Black to chase this Q away, so he just has to carry on attacking, but without his key black-squared B."

25,Bxc4,b3c4,2rqk2r/pp1bpp1p/3p1npQ/8/2BNP3/2N2P2/PPP3PP/R3K2R b KQk - 0 13,"Preferable to retreating the other N as the Nd4 would have been vulnerable to attack by ...e5, diverting the N from defence of c2."

I thought 18. ...Bf5 would have won, because I didn't think I could defend c2 properly but in our brief chat after the game, Gary reckoned that I had a saving resource with Nd4 at the appropriate moment, but I can't see how that would have helped: eg not 18. ...Bf5 19.
