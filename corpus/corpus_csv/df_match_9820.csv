1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"French Defense, wing gambit [C02]
The combination in this game is reminiscent of the great Polish Immortal game Glucksberg vs. Najdorf (which I have also annotated here).
The Bxh7 ""Greek Gift"" sacrifice was first described by Greco in the 1600's (?), and the Bg8 sacrifice was inspired by Glucksberg-Najdorf.
If you become familiar with the standard sacrifices and checkmate themes, you can recognize the same patterns and apply them in your own games, as I did here."

Also possible are 4...b6 and 4...Nc6.
With 4...cxb4, Black obtains an outside passed a-pawn with the rook behind it: a powerful force in the endgame, but before the endgame, the gods have placed the middlegame! [Tarrasch]
At the cost of this pawn, White will enjoy a secure c3-d4-e5 pawn chain and prospects of a kingside attack."
