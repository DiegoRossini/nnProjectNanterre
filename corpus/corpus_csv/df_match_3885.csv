1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This is an unrated game with Jo having some fun with the Damiano Defense (ironically named after the early master who condemned it). We have both played it at various times. The GK computer game analysis is here: http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17800417&rnd=0.025789561332767663
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"?! This move is playable and can be considered more of a psychological approach, since white has to be careful not to assume the defense just loses without effort. Bobby Fisher actually only got a draw in a simultaneous game as White from this position once and experts have gotten good games against unprepared White opponents from this position."

5,Nxe5,f3e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,Safer is 3 Bc4 d6 4.d4 Nc6 5.c3... where Black has a difficult defense.
6,Qe7,d8e7,rnb1kbnr/ppppq1pp/5p2/4N3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 4,"! Best. The Chigorin Variation. Taking the Knight instead loses after 4.Qh5+ Ke7 (4...g6 loses to 5.Qxe5+, forking king and rook) 5.Qxe5+ Kf7 6.Bc4+ d5! (6...Kg6?? 7. Qf5+ leads to mate) 7.Bxd5+ Kg6 8.h4 (8.d4? Bd6!) h5 9.Bxb7! Bd6 (9...Bxb7 10.Qf5+ Kh6 11.d4+ g5 12.Qf7! mates quickly) 10.Qa5! Nc6 11.Bxc6 Rb8, and now 12. Bxd7 Qxd7 13.Qxa7 leaves White with five extra pawns."
7,Nf3,e5f3,rnb1kbnr/ppppq1pp/5p2/8/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 2 4,Consistent. The alternative 4...d5 5.d3 dxe4 6.dxe4 Qxe4+ 7 Be2 is playable but White retains an advantage.
8,Qxe4+,e7e4,rnb1kbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/8/4q3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,Consistent. The alternative 4...d5 5.d3 dxe4 6.dxe4 Qxe4+ 7 Be2 is playable but White retains an advantage.
9,Be2,f1e2,rnb1kbnr/pppp2pp/5p2/8/4q3/5N2/PPPPBPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,Developing and attacking the Q.

12,Qe6,e4e6,rnb1kbnr/ppp3pp/4qp2/3p4/8/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQK2R w KQkq - 2 7,Now White is clearly better.
13,O-O,e1g1,rnb1kbnr/ppp3pp/4qp2/3p4/8/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 3 7,Now White is clearly better.
14,g6,g7g6,rnb1kbnr/ppp4p/4qpp1/3p4/8/2N2N2/PPPPBPPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 8,"?? Black does not have time for this move. Instead Black should try ...Ne7! 8. Re1 Nbc6 9. Bd3 Qd7 10. Bb5 Kf7 11. Ba4 Qg4 12. h3 Qf4 13. Bxc6 bxc6 14. d3, when White's advantage is evident but not fatal."
15,Bc4,e2c4,rnb1kbnr/ppp4p/4qpp1/3p4/2B5/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 8,Exploiting the e file. The Bishop can't be taken without losing the Q after Re1.
16,Ne7,g8e7,rnb1kb1r/ppp1n2p/4qpp1/3p4/2B5/2N2N2/PPPP1PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 2 9,"Hits the Q again, indirectly pinning the N."

25,Nxd5,c3d5,rn3b1r/ppp1nk1p/5pp1/3N4/2pN4/8/PPPPQPPP/R1B3K1 b - - 0 13,Of course...
26,Nxd5,e7d5,rn3b1r/ppp2k1p/5pp1/3n4/2pN4/8/PPPPQPPP/R1B3K1 w - - 0 14,Otherwise the piece is lost.
