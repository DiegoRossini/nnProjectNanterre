1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"In 1975 I was an advocate of the English Opening, in large part because I did not see it being used all that much when I first started playing.  I did own any written resources at the time and I wanted an opening that my opponents were as unfamiliar with as I."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"I had read in a bookstore that the order of moves can be quite important in this opening.  ( Actually, I think that is true for all openings.)"
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 2,"I had read in a bookstore that the order of moves can be quite important in this opening.  ( Actually, I think that is true for all openings.)"
4,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2p5/4p3/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,Probably played to take the game away from book.  What he did not know was I did not have any at the time ( I have some now.)  I did my reading at the bookstore.  And I had managed to join the USCF so I did get the monthly magazine for a while.
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2p5/4p3/2P5/2N2N2/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,Black has taken a consevative approach this far - something I really did not like at the time.  I preferred a tactical game with a lot of hand to hand fighting.
6,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2pp4/4p3/2P5/2N2N2/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,Black has taken a consevative approach this far - something I really did not like at the time.  I preferred a tactical game with a lot of hand to hand fighting.
7,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp3ppp/2pp4/4p3/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"I made this Bishop thrust in part to provoke f6 which I believed weaken his Kingside.  True, it helps bolster his center and I lose a tempo but given the play thus far I felt I had a tempo to toss."
8,Nd7,b8d7,r1bqkbnr/pp1n1ppp/2pp4/4p3/2PP4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"I made this Bishop thrust in part to provoke f6 which I believed weaken his Kingside.  True, it helps bolster his center and I lose a tempo but given the play thus far I felt I had a tempo to toss."

11,Ne4,c3e4,r1bqk1nr/pp1nbppp/2pp4/4p1B1/2PPN3/5N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 4 6,This provides a second layer of support for the g5 Bishop and threatens the d6 pawn as well.
12,f6,f7f6,r1bqk1nr/pp1nb1pp/2pp1p2/4p1B1/2PPN3/5N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"Finally.  Black could have also gone in for d5 to which case I intended to take away his castling priviledge and to try and win a pawn with play along this line: 7. -----,  d5; 8. cd, cd; 9. Nd6 ch (taking away the castling priviledge or picking up the Black Queen - his choice), Kf8; 10. Bxe7 ch, Qxe7; 11. Nxc8, Rxc8; 12. de, Nxe5; 13. Qxd5."
