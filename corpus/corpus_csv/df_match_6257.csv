1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Bobby Fischer said 1.e4 was ""best by test"" but is it really? According to the GK world database 1. Na3 has a 54% winning percentage and Black has not won a game!

so I had this tournament begun with 1. Na3 instead,Black would never win. There's some food for thought ;)

ok back to the game..."
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Caro-Kann. The first tournament derived from a Grand Prix attack and the 2nd from a bird's opening.
3,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,White loves moving his pawn to f4 in these type of tournaments
4,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4PP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,getting the usual strike in the center
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/3p4/4PP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,just ignore his threat. who cares about the e4 pawn?
6,dxe4,d5e4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/8/4pP2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,attack the e4 pawn and target f7
7,Ng5,f3g5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/2p5/6N1/4pP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 4,attack the e4 pawn and target f7
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/6N1/4pP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 5,protecting the e4 pawn
9,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/6N1/2B1pP2/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 3 5,aiming at f7.
10,Bg4,c8g4,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/6N1/2B1pPb1/8/PPPP2PP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 4 6,"!? an interesting move. surely safer would be 5...e6 but Black cannot resist the opportunity to attack the Queen (please note,this is all thematic the first move made willingly is move 7"
11,Qxg4,d1g4,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p2n2/6N1/2B1pPQ1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 6,?!!? White spices it up. You dare to attack my Queen? I'll take it. Most of the time this logic does not work but here it certainly makes it interesting
12,Nxg4,f6g4,rn1qkb1r/pp2pppp/2p5/6N1/2B1pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 7,The first move I made but this might as well be included in it because there really isn't a reason to not take the f-pawn
13,Bxf7+,c4f7,rn1qkb1r/pp2pBpp/2p5/6N1/4pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 7,The first move I made but this might as well be included in it because there really isn't a reason to not take the f-pawn
14,Kd7,e8d7,rn1q1b1r/pp1kpBpp/2p5/6N1/4pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 1 8,only move
15,Be6+,f7e6,rn1q1b1r/pp1kp1pp/2p1B3/6N1/4pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 2 8,"This is where the pawn on c6 changes the identity of the game.

In the last 2 annotation projects,Black has had the luxury of playing 8...Kc6 which is considered to be the best move. However,Black is now unable to move his king to c6."
16,Ke8,d7e8,rn1qkb1r/pp2p1pp/2p1B3/6N1/4pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 3 9,a psychological trick of sorts. I would imagine Freddy panicked that I was just going for the perpetual.
17,Bf7+,e6f7,rn1qkb1r/pp2pBpp/2p5/6N1/4pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 4 9,a psychological trick of sorts. I would imagine Freddy panicked that I was just going for the perpetual.
18,Kd7,e8d7,rn1q1b1r/pp1kpBpp/2p5/6N1/4pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 5 10,all part of my plan
19,Be6+,f7e6,rn1q1b1r/pp1kp1pp/2p1B3/6N1/4pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 6 10,all part of my plan
20,Kc7,d7c7,rn1q1b1r/ppk1p1pp/2p1B3/6N1/4pPn1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 7 11,It works. I wanted Black to play this move all along. But why would I ask to be invited to a tournament with an attacking opening only to chicken out into a perpetual. Sure it would be my first master draw but why make it so hollow?
21,Bxg4,e6g4,rn1q1b1r/ppk1p1pp/2p5/6N1/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R b KQ - 0 11,I finally take the Knight
22,Kb6,c7b6,rn1q1b1r/pp2p1pp/1kp5/6N1/4pPB1/8/PPPP2PP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 1 12,to avoid the possible fork on e6.
23,Na3,b1a3,rn1q1b1r/pp2p1pp/1kp5/6N1/4pPB1/N7/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R b KQ - 2 12,I was very well considering playing 12. Nf7 here. the comp gives 12. a4 here but I like the plan 12...a6 13...Ka7 here
24,e5,e7e5,rn1q1b1r/pp4pp/1kp5/4p1N1/4pPB1/N7/PPPP2PP/R1B1K2R w KQ - 0 13,striking back in the center and hoping to remove the defender of the knight on g5
