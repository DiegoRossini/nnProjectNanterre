3,e5,e4e5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/4P3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"Usually White's second move is d4, I don't know why he chose to move this pawn again."

10,Qb6,d8b6,rn2kbnr/pp3ppp/1qp1p3/3pPb2/3P4/8/PPPBBPPP/RN1QK1NR w KQkq - 2 6,A blunder. White only focuses on the d4 pawn and doesn't notice the b2 pawn (which was my goal). Bc3 was the best move here.
