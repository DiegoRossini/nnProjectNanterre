1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"In this mini-tournament Black has been experimenting with obscure flank openings. He pays for it dearly when his attack quickly falls apart.

White opens with a Queen's Pawn which he has been using exclusively in this tournament so far."
2,b5,b7b5,rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/8/1p6/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"Black opens with an obscure Polish Defense. Most usual responses for White include e4 and Nf3. 

e4 normally being most problematic for Black which can be avoided by opening instead 1...Nf6 2. Nf3 b5."
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/p1pppppp/8/1p6/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,Nf6 is common with most Queen Pawn openings.
4,Bb7,c8b7,rn1qkbnr/pbpppppp/8/1p6/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,Black continues with the progression of the Polish Defense with a fianchetto of the Bishop.
5,Bf4,c1f4,rn1qkbnr/pbpppppp/8/1p6/3P1B2/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 3 3,"White has the option to fianchetto his Bishop with 3. g3 e6 4. Bg2
Black could disrupt things by trading his Bishop for the Knight but could have problems after White's Castle with the open e-file.

White instead decides to immediately strengthen his control of the center."
6,f6,f7f6,rn1qkbnr/pbppp1pp/5p2/1p6/3P1B2/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,"This is very poor move for Black, which will become evident quickly. The plan for Black is to attack the Bishop with 4...g5 which in hindsight would have been better achieved with 3...h6 instead.  

The appropriate play for Black is, however, 3...e6 which would allow Black to better develop his pieces and maintain a strong defense."
7,e3,e2e3,rn1qkbnr/pbppp1pp/5p2/1p6/3P1B2/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"White's move to e3 opens up development for his Queen and Bishop. It is unclear whether this move was in direct response to Black's f6 or if it was part of White's development plan already. Regardless, it certainly exploited Black's new vulnerability."
8,g5,g7g5,rn1qkbnr/pbppp2p/5p2/1p4p1/3P1B2/4PN2/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,"Black threatens the Bishop and no doubt expects 5. Bg3

I'm not sure what Black's plan is after that, but it's likely to challenge for the center."
9,Nxg5,f3g5,rn1qkbnr/pbppp2p/5p2/1p4N1/3P1B2/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,"Nxg5!

Obviously Black felt he had it covered but 5...fxg5 6. Qh5#"
10,h5,h7h5,rn1qkbnr/pbppp3/5p2/1p4Np/3P1B2/4P3/PPP2PPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,This is precisely what Black needs to do to prevent mate. He still has the Knight threatened and probably expects 6. Nf3 and to be down a Pawn.
11,Be2,f1e2,rn1qkbnr/pbppp3/5p2/1p4Np/3P1B2/4P3/PPP1BPPP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"Be2!

Obviously a continuation of the Qxh5# theme. Black saw it only a move before but has been so distracted by his plan to attack White's King side he misses it.

Black can avoid mate but not without losing quite a bit of material and opening up his King to continued attack. 

For example 6...d6 7. Ne6. Black must lose the Queen to avoid mate.
e6 or e5 seems better for Black but is still clearly a compromised position for Black."
12,Bxg2,b7g2,rn1qkbnr/p1ppp3/5p2/1p4Np/3P1B2/4P3/PPP1BPbP/RN1QK2R w KQkq - 0 7,Black moves into a forced checkmate. Disrupting a Castle must have been the primary motive because it would have been easy to defend the Rook.
13,Bxh5+,e2h5,rn1qkbnr/p1ppp3/5p2/1p4NB/3P1B2/4P3/PPP2PbP/RN1QK2R b KQkq - 0 7,Black recognizes the forced checkmate and resigns only after 7 moves.
