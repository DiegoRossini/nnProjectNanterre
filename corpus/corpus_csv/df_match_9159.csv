However, I look at the square f6 and my gut instinct tells me to analyse the board.  I therefore decide to exchange bishop for knight at e5.  This protects the c3 pawn for just one move.  I could have rounded up the pawn immediately but I think this is an improvement.  When playing through the analysis I noticed something else - the bishop taking on e5 also frees up the f6 square for my knight and bang we get a knight fork winning the g8 rook.  That is what will happen if black takes the f5 knight.  However, I also noticed that when I played out dxe5, Nf6 - the checkmate detector came on!  Wow, I thought.  I then set up conditional moves for both possible captures.  You can guess what black chose here, can't you?"
