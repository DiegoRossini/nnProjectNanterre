1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hey everyone! This is a tournament game I played recently. The opponent resigned prematurely, but I was wondering if the experts could comment on my mistakes."
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,He he plays the bc4. I looked at the opponents history and he seems to favor the 4 move checkmate.

4,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2p5/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 3,"In preparation for this, I start to develop my pieces slowly."
5,Qf3,d1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2p5/4p3/2B1P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 1 3,"As I said, he pulled out his Queen, and i have to block the 4 move checkmate."
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2p2n2/4p3/2B1P3/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 2 4,"This is the usual preventative measure against the 4 move. If anyone uses a different method, just let me know. I like this method because it also develops pieces, but I'm open to suggestion."
7,d3,d2d3,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2p2n2/4p3/2B1P3/3P1Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 0 4,"I think he intends to challenge my knight with the bishop, but I don't see what damage that could do."
8,h6,h7h6,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1pp1/2p2n1p/4p3/2B1P3/3P1Q2/PPP2PPP/RNB1K1NR w KQkq - 0 5,"But since it was a tournament game, I decided to take preventative measures. I played h6 to block that attack."

10,Bc5,f8c5,rnbqk2r/pp1p1pp1/2p2n1p/2b1p3/2B1P3/3P1Q2/PPP1NPPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 2 6,"This is not intended to be an amateur move, but I like the position of Bc5. It takes control of the middle of the board, and also attacks a weak position in white's line of pawns."
11,h3,h2h3,rnbqk2r/pp1p1pp1/2p2n1p/2b1p3/2B1P3/3P1Q1P/PPP1NPP1/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 6,"I assume this move has a duel purpose: It blocks the advance of the knight, while also preventing the checkmate of the King behind three pawns later in the game."
12,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/pp1p1pp1/2p2n1p/2b1p3/2B1P3/3P1Q1P/PPP1NPP1/RNB1K2R w KQ - 1 7,"Now that I am certain he will castle on this side, I decide to focus my attack on the Kingside pawns."
13,Qg3,f3g3,rnbq1rk1/pp1p1pp1/2p2n1p/2b1p3/2B1P3/3P2QP/PPP1NPP1/RNB1K2R b KQ - 2 7,"I looked at his profile, and he also favors playing Bh6. This movement of the Queen prepares that move, because the pawn is now pinned."
