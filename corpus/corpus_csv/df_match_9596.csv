1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"My favorite move of all time. Most likely when people play against me, you'll see me play this move at all times. I don't like playing e4 because I don't like seeing main openings that usually involve way too much theory such as Sicilian Defence or Ruy Lopez, and much more."
2,c6,c7c6,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/2p5/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"When my opponent played this move, I thought about two openings that I could play against. If I play e4, we could go into a Caro Kann, which is a very boring opening to play against to me or we could play against the Slav Defence, which is something I'm more prepare of playing against since I know mostly all moves after d4"

I really don't have to worry about the pin anymore because of Nge2 and I'm pretty much ready to castle. For my opponent, things are not looking so good. The fact that his knight and bishop have no places to go that are on b8 and c8, it slows down his development.
