1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"This my first annotation, so let me know if I use the wrong name or terminology somewhere. I have been playing this opening for a year now and am getting comfortable with it"
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I prefer Bc4 over Bd5 because black will want to play c6 sometime anyways. It does keep him from play Nc6 but it gives him opportunity to quickly put pressure on my king with Qa5
3,Bc4,f1c4,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 1 2,I prefer Bc4 over Bd5 because black will want to play c6 sometime anyways. It does keep him from play Nc6 but it gives him opportunity to quickly put pressure on my king with Qa5
4,f5,f7f5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pp2/2B1P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 0 3,"I think this is called a gambit of some kind. I could take blacks chance of castling by playing Bxg8 but after Rxg8 I either play exf5 and black get first jump at occupying center or I could play a knight forward, probably Nc3, and then have 2 pawns to contend with. I think white could take center but it wouldn't be as easy as it looks.
 I could play Nc3 but if black would play f4 I'll be fighting these pawns for awhile. 
 Nf3 might not be a bad move. 3.Nf3 fxe4 4.Nxe5 would leave white looking pretty good right now.
 Qh5+ would be an OK move also I think. Black kings side would be very open."
5,exf5,e4f5,rnbqkbnr/pppp2pp/8/4pP2/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR b KQkq - 0 3,But what stick out gets taken. I think this is called gambit accepted.
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppp2pp/5n2/4pP2/2B5/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK1NR w KQkq - 1 4,black is taking control of center
7,Ne2,g1e2,rnbqkb1r/pppp2pp/5n2/4pP2/2B5/8/PPPPNPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 4,I think Nc3 would have been a better move. Ne2 is looking at d4 and f4 but it cuts off my bishops retreat.
8,d5,d7d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp3pp/5n2/3ppP2/2B5/8/PPPPNPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 5,"I thinks this is a good move for black, it puts pressure on my bishop and the pawn is solidly backed up by the knight and queen"
9,Bd3,c4d3,rnbqkb1r/ppp3pp/5n2/3ppP2/8/3B4/PPPPNPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 5,"I pulled back to defend f5 but I think Bb3 would have been a better move, keeping an eyeball on blacks back rank."
10,e4,e5e4,rnbqkb1r/ppp3pp/5n2/3p1P2/4p3/3B4/PPPPNPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6,why not? he's reinforced by d5 and Nf6
11,Bb5+,d3b5,rnbqkb1r/ppp3pp/5n2/1B1p1P2/4p3/8/PPPPNPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 6,"what else could I do? If I had played 4.Nc3 instead of 4.N32 I'd have a few more options then I do now but nothing great even then. I could play Ba6 and black would have either double pawns or a knight on the A file. But blacks center pawns are on white, I want to keep my white bishop."
12,c6,c7c6,rnbqkb1r/pp4pp/2p2n2/1B1p1P2/4p3/8/PPPPNPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,and the chase is on
13,Ba4,b5a4,rnbqkb1r/pp4pp/2p2n2/3p1P2/B3p3/8/PPPPNPPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 1 7,"here we sitblack dominating the board, although he has opened his pawns up a bit. And white has a closed rank, with a lonley bishop out there (is this called a hung bishop?)"
14,Bxf5,c8f5,rn1qkb1r/pp4pp/2p2n2/3p1b2/B3p3/8/PPPPNPPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 8,"here we sitblack dominating the board, although he has opened his pawns up a bit. And white has a closed rank, with a lonley bishop out there (is this called a hung bishop?)"
15,h3,h2h3,rn1qkb1r/pp4pp/2p2n2/3p1b2/B3p3/7P/PPPPNPP1/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 8,this seems like a week move but I played it to put pressure on g4. I considered 8.Nf4 but didn't like the looks of 8...Bd6 9.d3 exd3 10. Nxd3. And I didn't like 8.Nd4 because of 8...Bg4. I think Nbc3 or 0-0 would have been better a better move. I would probably go with Nbc3 if I were to this position.
16,Bd6,f8d6,rn1qk2r/pp4pp/2pb1n2/3p1b2/B3p3/7P/PPPPNPP1/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 1 9,black is controlling more of center. Would Bc5 have been a better move?
17,Nd4,e2d4,rn1qk2r/pp4pp/2pb1n2/3p1b2/B2Np3/7P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 9,"OK, i'm stepping into center. Threatening bishop on f5 and c6 is pinned."
18,Bd7,f5d7,rn1qk2r/pp1b2pp/2pb1n2/3p4/B2Np3/7P/PPPP1PP1/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 3 10,c6 is no longer pinned. If black moves c5 I'm in trouble.
19,Nc3,b1c3,rn1qk2r/pp1b2pp/2pb1n2/3p4/B2Np3/2N4P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQK2R b KQkq - 4 10,a4 is supported and I'm putting pressure on center.
20,O-O,e8g8,rn1q1rk1/pp1b2pp/2pb1n2/3p4/B2Np3/2N4P/PPPP1PP1/R1BQK2R w KQ - 5 11,Black castles while he has the chance. Something I should have done also.
21,d3,d2d3,rn1q1rk1/pp1b2pp/2pb1n2/3p4/B2Np3/2NP3P/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R b KQ - 0 11,"I should have castled here but I didn't. This gives me a chance to see what kind of player I'm against. I know that he doesn't take a piece as soon as it's available, and if he plays e3, a very bad move in my opinion, I would try to exploit his weakness for passing pieces or always advancing."
22,exd3,e4d3,rn1q1rk1/pp1b2pp/2pb1n2/3p4/B2N4/2Np3P/PPP2PP1/R1BQK2R w KQ - 0 12,"that played as i figured it would, with my queen now adding support to center and my queen and dark bishop cutting a nice diagonal. But now I have a glaring problem with my e file."
23,Qxd3,d1d3,rn1q1rk1/pp1b2pp/2pb1n2/3p4/B2N4/2NQ3P/PPP2PP1/R1B1K2R b KQ - 0 12,"that played as i figured it would, with my queen now adding support to center and my queen and dark bishop cutting a nice diagonal. But now I have a glaring problem with my e file."
