1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"Hi everyone!

This game was another nailbiter.  I looked destined for a 15-16 point loss when I found a match-winning trump card.  My a pawn.  I had the black pieces and I went for a kingside attack in the late middlegame which failed leaving dmaestro with a dangerous passed h pawn.  This gave Glenda a new role - a blocker!  She did that really well but before she was reduced to this ultra-mundane assignment she managed to remove white's a2 pawn leaving my a pawn passed.  It was a real worry that white's dsb controlled the a1-h8 diagonal, protecting his own passer and preventing mine from queening.  But somehow the game turned suddenly in my favour.  Anyway, we pick up the action on move 9 where I choose to move Glenda to e8 (recommended by Master Freddy), white replies with 10. Ne6."
