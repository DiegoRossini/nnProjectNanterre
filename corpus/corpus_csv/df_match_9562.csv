1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,This is an attacking game with an interesting pawn sacrifice at move 18. Black made several mistakes after which he gets mated.
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,By transposition an ordinary Scandinavian has become a Blackmar-Diemer Gambit. Ordinarily this position arises after the moves: 1. d4 d5 2. e4.
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,By transposition an ordinary Scandinavian has become a Blackmar-Diemer Gambit. Ordinarily this position arises after the moves: 1. d4 d5 2. e4.
4,dxe4,d5e4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/3Pp3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"This move is better than the immediate 3. f3, because then black can try 3. ... e5 and he gets a better position."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/3Pp3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"This move is better than the immediate 3. f3, because then black can try 3. ... e5 and he gets a better position."
6,Bf5,c8f5,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/5b2/3Pp3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"The normal move here is 3. ... Nf6 after 4. f3 exf3 5. Nxf3 white tries to use his lead in development, space advantage and half-open e- and f-lines to create an attack against the black king."
7,f3,f2f3,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/5b2/3Pp3/2N2P2/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,I still try sacrificing the pawn.
8,e3,e4e3,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/5b2/3P4/2N1pP2/PPP3PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,He doesn't accept the pawn. He probably didn't like to be in an opening of which didn't know much so he tries to lead the game in calmer lanes.
9,Bxe3,c1e3,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/5b2/3P4/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,I develop my knight with the intention to go to g3 and kick his bishop.
10,Nf6,g8f6,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/5b2/3P4/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,I develop my knight with the intention to go to g3 and kick his bishop.
11,Nge2,g1e2,rn1qkb1r/ppp1pppp/5n2/5b2/3P4/2N1BP2/PPP1N1PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 2 6,I develop my knight with the intention to go to g3 and kick his bishop.
12,h6,h7h6,rn1qkb1r/ppp1ppp1/5n1p/5b2/3P4/2N1BP2/PPP1N1PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,"He anticipates that his will be kicked away and makes a hole at h7. At the same time his pawn controls the g5-square. However, I don't think that this was necesarry: The bishop can go to g6 and black doesn't need to excert extra control over g5 since there isn't a knight on f3. A normal developing move like Nc6 or d6 would have been better."
13,Ng3,e2g3,rn1qkb1r/ppp1ppp1/5n1p/5b2/3P4/2N1BPN1/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 7,"Following my plan of development. I want to continue with Bc4, Qd2, 0-0-0 and Rhe1."
14,e6,e7e6,rn1qkb1r/ppp2pp1/4pn1p/5b2/3P4/2N1BPN1/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 8,"A bad move. Though he starts the development of his other bishop, he simply lets his bishop get captured and in doing so gets a double pawn. The retreat of his bishop to h7 would have been better. Furthermore, his sixth move seems useless now, as he doesn't use the h7-square."
15,Nxf5,g3f5,rn1qkb1r/ppp2pp1/4pn1p/5N2/3P4/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 8,"Now I have the bishopspair, a better pawn structure ,an extra central pawn and even a bit of a lead in development because he did the move h6."
16,exf5,e6f5,rn1qkb1r/ppp2pp1/5n1p/5p2/3P4/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 9,"Now I have the bishopspair, a better pawn structure ,an extra central pawn and even a bit of a lead in development because he did the move h6."
17,Bc4,f1c4,rn1qkb1r/ppp2pp1/5n1p/5p2/2BP4/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 1 9,"This move is of course a good developing move and there is nothing wrong with it, but there was a better and interesting alternative. Possible was the strange looking 9. Qe2. At first sight this move seems to just lock in the bishop on f1, but this move also threatens different things. There's the discovered check over the e-file with which white can win the h6 pawn. Also the queen threatens 10. Qb5  after which both the pawns at b7 and f5 are attacked."
18,Be7,f8e7,rn1qk2r/ppp1bpp1/5n1p/5p2/2BP4/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QK2R w KQkq - 2 10,He gets ready to castle but perhaps 10. ... Bd6 was a bit more active.
19,Qd3,d1d3,rn1qk2r/ppp1bpp1/5n1p/5p2/2BP4/2NQBP2/PPP3PP/R3K2R b KQkq - 3 10,"I get my queen out of the way so that I can castle long, while simultaneously attacking the pawn on f5."
20,Qd7,d8d7,rn2k2r/pppqbpp1/5n1p/5p2/2BP4/2NQBP2/PPP3PP/R3K2R w KQkq - 4 11,He needs a move to defend the pawn and gets a little further behind in development.
21,O-O-O,e1c1,rn2k2r/pppqbpp1/5n1p/5p2/2BP4/2NQBP2/PPP3PP/2KR3R b kq - 5 11,"Again a normal move, following my development plan, but again there was a better possibility. With the move 11. d5 I would have stopped his knight at b8 from developing to c6 and also gained space in the center."
22,a6,a7a6,rn2k2r/1ppqbpp1/p4n1p/5p2/2BP4/2NQBP2/PPP3PP/2KR3R w kq - 0 12,"Another non-developing move. His plan is to play b5 and b4 and start a queenside attack, but it's far to early for that. A better move would have been 11. ... 0-0 getting his king a bit safer."
23,h3,h2h3,rn2k2r/1ppqbpp1/p4n1p/5p2/2BP4/2NQBP1P/PPP3P1/2KR3R b kq - 0 12,"This move wasn't very good of me. The idea behind this move was to start a kingside attack with g4. Because there's a pawn on f5 I would surely be able to open lines on the kingside. However this move is slow and not really necesarry. I could've still done d5, hampering the development of his knight (which now also can't go to a6) or I could've played 12. Rhe1, completing my development scheme."
24,Nc6,b8c6,r3k2r/1ppqbpp1/p1n2n1p/5p2/2BP4/2NQBP1P/PPP3P1/2KR3R w kq - 1 13,Now his knight is allowed to develop.
25,d5,d4d5,r3k2r/1ppqbpp1/p1n2n1p/3P1p2/2B5/2NQBP1P/PPP3P1/2KR3R b kq - 0 13,"This move gains space in the center, but it's a lot less strong than the previous move because now black is able to trade his knight for my bishop."
