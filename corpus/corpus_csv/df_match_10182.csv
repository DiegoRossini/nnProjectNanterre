Now 5.0-0 look sensible to me. We could try, what happens after 5....e4."

10,Bc5,f8c5,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/2bpp3/8/3P1NP1/PPP1PPBP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 3 6,"(brulla) I have checked on chessbase: there are 1,475 games with the position after 5.0-0. 
Bc5 is a move that caused me trouble in some games (or better: my bad aswer caused the trouble). It covers the squares e3 and f2, that can be attacked once more by Ng4. 
Nbd2 is still critical in my opinion, there are still 112 games using this move, though. 47 games won by white. In the games won by black, e4 becomes frequent after Nbd2. It is then often played after black's kingside castling."

12,e4,e5e4,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/2bp4/4p3/3P1NP1/PPPNPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 0 7,"(brulla) OK, here we go. Maybe we can find a strong reply for white. 
My opinion is still that the squares e3 and f2 are weak in the white camp. Please note, that neither d4 nor Nb3 are possible here because white will stay one piece behind (for a pawn) after the exchanges."
13,Ng5,f3g5,r1bqk2r/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/2bp2N1/4p3/3P2P1/PPPNPPBP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 1 7,"(zombigar) I'm thinking of moving out the king's knight to safer ground, if you threaten him with your queen I will open the bishop diagonal to defend him.
(brulla) We have now reached a heavily tactical position. Characteristic for me is that 
your Ng5 is not protected, the Nd2 still blocks the view of Bc1 to e3 and my pawn on e4 is quite advanced, looking to e3. I am pondering now the following possibilities: 
A) 7...e3 8.fxe3 Bxe3  9.Kh1 Bxg5 -  
A1) 8.Ndf3 exf2  9.Kh1 h6 10.Nh3 Ng4 =  
B) 7...Bxf2  8.Rxf2 (8.Kxf2? Ng4  9.Kg1 Ne3 10.Qe1 and the knight looks to c2, can support the pawn advance to e3... =  at least 
C) 7...h6 8.Nh3 (protects f2, so this move is also valuable in one variation above...maybe) e3 9. Nb3 exf2  10. Nxf2 Bb6 ="
