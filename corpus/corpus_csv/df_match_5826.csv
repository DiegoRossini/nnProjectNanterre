2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,A common move for black.
3,a3,a2a3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/P7/1PPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,This is a waste of a move. It doesn't help develop any pieces or attack the center of the board. The only thing this move does is prevent the bishop from going to b4 later.
