Pawn breaks are one of the key ideas when you have a small amount of space, and exchanging pieces is another objective when in a tight area, as the less pieces you have the less space you need."

His lone bishop sits on its starting square, blocked in by the knight and with no real good squares or diagonals to aim for, as well as disconnecting the two rooks, while my pieces are on great squares, and each has its own job and ideas for future improvement. Next, black's position is very cramped, his only hope of gaining space is pawn breaks, and he lacks any good ones at the moment.
