1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"My opponent opens with the Queen's Pawn, which I consider to be inferior to the more popular King's Pawn openings.  This is because it is slower and tends to send the game down a route that leads to a tactical minefield."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"I respond with my standard response to the Queen's Pawn, attempting an Indian Defence."
3,c4,c2c4,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,"White sends his pawn to c4, the move I consider to be the perfect one in this situation.  Not only does this attempt to restrict Black's options in attacking the centre, but also allows White to develop the Queen-side Knight to it's powerful c3 square without blocking the c-pawn."
4,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/8/PP2PPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,"I've been told that this is a risky move at this point of the game unless you know the lines particularly well.  I don't, but I do think I have a good grasp of ""why"" certain moves should be made.  With this one, I commit myself to a ""hyper-modern"" opening, pressuring White's centre with my dark-side Bishop after the inevitable fianchetto.  According to Gameknot's DB, at this point in world games White wins 40% and Black 27%.  Strangely, (or not when you consider what I said at the start of this move), on Gameknot the statistics are much more even with White winning 41% and Black 40%."
5,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppp1p/5np1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 1 3,"White strengthens his centre, obviously intending to play e4 when possible.  Black continues with the strategy mentioned before, aiming to attack the White central position from the sides.  Another option for Black was to play 3...d5!, which is the Grunfeld Defence, the main line being 4.cxd5 Nxd5 5.e4 Nxc3 6.bxc3 Bg7.  I've always been a Kasparov fan though, studying his games has given me a great appreciation for the Indian's Defence and early fianchetto."
6,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PP4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 2 4,"White strengthens his centre, obviously intending to play e4 when possible.

7,e4,e2e4,rnbqk2r/ppppppbp/5np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"White now has control over the centre, and manages to stop me from playing the powerful d5."
8,d6,d7d6,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,Preparing for the eventual e5 and protecting my Knight.
9,h3,h2h3,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N4P/PP3PP1/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"A brilliant move, restricting the Black light-side Bishop and raising huge question marks over where I can develop it, due to the g6 pawn which blocks a retreat position for it.  It also successfully stops the advance of my Knight to g4."
10,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N4P/PP3PP1/R1BQKBNR w KQ - 1 6,"I decide to ignore it, getting in the early castle.  My pieces are looking fairly cramped right now, but 4...d6 I am ready to begin my counter attack on the centre."
11,Be3,c1e3,rnbq1rk1/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N1B2P/PP3PP1/R2QKBNR b KQ - 2 6,"White develops the Bishop, providing further protection for the d4 pawn.  Black finally moves the central e-Pawn in the long awaited e5 move."
