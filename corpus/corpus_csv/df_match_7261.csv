5,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/8/2pPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"At this point, white has an advantage in space.  Your d and e pawns control the center -- c5, d5, e5, and f5."
6,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/8/4p3/2pPP3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,"You should have played Nf3, but d5 is also ok. Generally speaking, the tension you had before d5 was working in your favor.  The player who breaks that tension usually suffers by doing so."

8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3Pp3/2p1P3/8/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"Why not Qc2?  You get your queen off the back rank and threaten the pawn on c4. Actually, f3 is a mistake (not a blunder). You hinder the development of your knight and your bishop. Ne2 closes you bishop in, unless of course you take the pawn on c4."

19,Qb3,d1b3,r1bq1rk1/pp1n1ppp/5n2/3Bp1B1/1b2P3/1QN2P2/PP4PP/R3K1NR b KQ - 2 10,A better move would have been Nge2.  Now you are almost done developing.
