13.	exd6+	Be7 (Qe7 would lose a queen for a pawn)
14.	dxe7	Qc8 (Could also play Qb8 without any change in the position)
15.	Bxa8	Qxa8 (His king is paralyzed in the centre and can not move)
16.	Qxg7	         (The rook is indefensible and as no choice but to open up the back rank by playing f6 or f5 or move the Knight - this would loose the rook and queen)

You will also note that Nf8 only delays the inevitable - Qxh8, Kd7 - could lead to many variations Qxf8 - Qxf8 exf8=Q leaving me up a queen and knight for the exchange - or exf8=Q leaving me with 2 queens on the back rank.

White is totally dominating the board with this semi forced moves

Not accepting the Queen exchange would lead to e8+Q en possible mate if he moved of the back rank"

Qa7 would lead to Rb8+ if Ke7 then Qxa7 wins a queen outright, if Qc8 the sacrifice of Rb8 forces the queen either to take and leave the defence of the mate square d7 or the king to move away which loses the queen.

Granted my opponent was weaker and made some weaker moves, but I wanted to illustrate the power of finding the correct order of taking pieces.

In the end the result was the same, but the extra moves and effort to calculate was more as the correct line of play would be semi forced....

Any comments, especially on what Black could have done different?"
