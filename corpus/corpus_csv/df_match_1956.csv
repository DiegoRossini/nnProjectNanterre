5,Bg2,f1g2,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/6b1/5NP1/PPPPPPBP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 3,"I found this strange. Maybe black wanted to dominate the black center squares, but usually exchaning a bishop for a knight like this is not effective in the beginning. If the position was closed, it woud make sense, but here the bishop should be waiting to pin my knight after an inevitable e4 in the King's Indian Attack."

11,d4,d2d4,r2qkbnr/ppp2ppp/2n1p3/3p4/3P4/5BP1/PPP1PP1P/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 6,I divereged from a King's Indian Attack to get into a Catalan type position. I played d4 as it the logical move when black allows me space.
12,Nf6,g8f6,r2qkb1r/ppp2ppp/2n1pn2/3p4/3P4/5BP1/PPP1PP1P/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 7,"I don't see the point of the bishop here - it's not pinning anything and only threatening to take the knight on c3, which would limit my force on e4. But black exchanging another bishop for a knight would be a significant positional mistake, as two bishops versus two knights in a relatively open position is deadly."

I didn't see that 11.Rb1 e5 12.Bxe5 Nxe5 13.dxe5 Rxe5 14. Rxb7. Instead, I thought of countering with 11.c4, with the idea of ...e5 and 12.cxd5, with a really complicated game. But, I got blinded by thinking about e5 and forgot that playing c4 only loses a pawn and puts me in a bad position."

Though this blunder makes the game much easier for me, the attack following this blunder is what really makes the game interesting."
35,Rxd4,d1d4,r3r1k1/ppp2pp1/q3p2p/3n4/3R1B1Q/5BP1/P1P1PP1P/1R4K1 b - - 0 18,"With an attack with check on e2 and an attack on my rook, black does not seem to be so bad. For a while, I was considering the complications after Bxb7, which was interesting. But I concluded that I wanted to get checkmate if possible, as I had a decent plan on the kingside with all those pieces more or less hanging out there. Therefore, I chose to focus on the kingside and see what black would do about it."
