1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Possibly the most aggressive first move.
2,e5,e7e5,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I do not like the Sicilian as White or Black and so chose to play the Open Game.
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Simple, it attacks the e-pawn and gets things going."
4,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 3,"Defends the e-pawn, a normal move."
5,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/4p3/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"This is the Scotch Game, which will clear out the center quickly."
6,exd4,e5d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,Basically forced.
7,Nxd4,f3d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,This move logically follows.
8,Nxd4,c6d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3nP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,As does this; there's no reason to let the knight go.
9,Qxd4,d1d4,r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 5,And now White has the center of the board under control.
10,Qe7,d8e7,r1b1kbnr/ppppqppp/8/8/3QP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 1 6,Black looks to be trying to trade queens soon.
11,e5,e4e5,r1b1kbnr/ppppqppp/8/4P3/3Q4/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 6,Meant to keep the pressure on.
12,Qb4+,e7b4,r1b1kbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/1q1Q4/8/PPP2PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 1 7,Designed to force a queen trade.
13,c3,c2c3,r1b1kbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/1q1Q4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 7,And it will be on White's terms.
14,Qxd4,b4d4,r1b1kbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/3q4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 8,No choice now.
15,cxd4,c3d4,r1b1kbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4P3/3P4/8/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 8,"Of course, the only move.  Though White has the two pawns advanced, note how nothing else is going on for either player."
16,d6,d7d6,r1b1kbnr/ppp2ppp/3p4/4P3/3P4/8/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 9,Trying to get White's pawns out of the middle of the board.
17,exd6,e5d6,r1b1kbnr/ppp2ppp/3P4/8/3P4/8/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 0 9,"White is happy to oblige, given that the pawn would be lost anyway."
18,Bxd6,f8d6,r1b1k1nr/ppp2ppp/3b4/8/3P4/8/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 10,A good move to get a piece developed.
19,Bb5+,f1b5,r1b1k1nr/ppp2ppp/3b4/1B6/3P4/8/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 1 10,"Rather weak, but it is a development and a check."
20,c6,c7c6,r1b1k1nr/pp3ppp/2pb4/1B6/3P4/8/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 11,Deftly blocked by the pawn.
