I'm a bit unsure about this move now what do u guys think? am i weakening my position through this move?

Blacks only try is to play 16..Kh8 tempting white to play 17. Nf3 and taking the queen, however, as ""yttrio"" points out white has the threat of a smothered mate which you can see below in the comments. It was att this point that my opponent resigned. This game teaches an important lesson that every pawn your opponent makes has the potential to leave a gaping hole in their defence allowing you to slip right past their defenders. With the cloak removed you reveal the dagger!"
