1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,"Here is my best game from the recent Brandon (MS) Open 2007. My real rating dipped a bit at this tourney, but I did have a plus score of 2.5/4. Jack S. provided me the opportunity to get the old creative juices flowing, and I was fortunate enough to crank out this beauty. My mojo was working during this round.....I hope you enjoy:)"
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,"QGD.  For those who know me, I assure you I have not lost my mind with 1. Nf3. I'm still the boring Queen's Gambit player that I have always been. I merely have been flirting with the Reti lately, and it is easily steerable into QG territory if desired."

8,exd5,e6d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/5N2/PP2PPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,Absolutely true to form. Seen this a miilion times. I have always preferred to open the c file and play a quick Rc1. That means Nc3 and Bg5 come first.
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/3P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 1 5,Absolutely true to form. Seen this a miilion times. I have always preferred to open the c file and play a quick Rc1. That means Nc3 and Bg5 come first.
10,Bb4,f8b4,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p4/1b1P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 2 6,Pinning the knight and allowing Ne4.
11,Bg5,c1g5,rnbqk2r/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p2B1/1b1P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 3 6,"Deeming his pin easibly defended, I establish one of my own."
12,O-O,e8g8,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p2B1/1b1P4/2N2N2/PP2PPPP/R2QKB1R w KQ - 4 7,I questioned this move somewhat. I feel that 7...Bg4 and an eventual Nbd7 was stronger.
13,e3,e2e3,rnbq1rk1/ppp2ppp/5n2/3p2B1/1b1P4/2N1PN2/PP3PPP/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 7,I questioned this move somewhat. I feel that 7...Bg4 and an eventual Nbd7 was stronger.

15,Bd3,f1d3,r1bq1rk1/ppp2ppp/2n2n2/3p2B1/1b1P4/2NBPN2/PP3PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 2 8,"Another move that just doesn't feel right. Black's light squared bishop needs to get it in gear. In post mortem, my opponent expressed his desire to control the dark squares. Maybe he saw something I didn't. What I see is four actively developed white pieces dancing around the awkwardly placed enemy queen. Perhaps she can be harrassed......"

17,a3,a2a3,r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/2nq1n2/3p2B1/1b1P4/P1NBPN2/1P3PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 9,First things first - 86 the Bb4. If 9...Ba5 then 10. b4 and I'll push the queenside with tempo. He's likely going to play BxN.
18,Bxc3+,b4c3,r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/2nq1n2/3p2B1/3P4/P1bBPN2/1P3PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 10,Mission accomplished.

20,Ne4,f6e4,r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/2nq4/3p2B1/3Pn3/P1PBPN2/5PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 1 11,"Hitting my bishop and my c pawn. As I really want to keep my dark squared bishop, I can't allow this knight to have such a cushy post. He's gotta go."
21,Bxe4,d3e4,r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/2nq4/3p2B1/3PB3/P1P1PN2/5PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 0 11,No need to panic about my knights safety just yet. How about a little tempo first?
22,dxe4,d5e4,r1b2rk1/ppp2ppp/2nq4/6B1/3Pp3/P1P1PN2/5PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 0 12,No need to panic about my knights safety just yet. How about a little tempo first?

24,Qd7,d6d7,r1b2rk1/pppq1ppp/2n5/8/3PpB2/P1P1PN2/5PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 2 13,"? Ugly move. Black's light squared bishop is not only undeveloped but retarded as well. If black is so concerned about saving his c pawn then Qe7 is much, much better."
25,Ng5,f3g5,r1b2rk1/pppq1ppp/2n5/6N1/3PpB2/P1P1P3/5PPP/R2QK2R b KQ - 3 13,!? I felt that my opponent had just erred seriously enough to deserve a little punishment. I now threaten to win a pawn or even launch a volley at the enemy monarch.
26,Ne7,c6e7,r1b2rk1/pppqnppp/8/6N1/3PpB2/P1P1P3/5PPP/R2QK2R w KQ - 4 14,Black must sense that I'm about to start knocking on his front door so he shifts resources to defend. This move doesn't accomplish near as much as he hopes for however. I start to develop attacking ideas to exploit his underdeveloped queenside.
27,Qh5,d1h5,r1b2rk1/pppqnppp/8/6NQ/3PpB2/P1P1P3/5PPP/R3K2R b KQ - 5 14,! I really liked this move. I am in no hurry to snag the e pawn. Better to start loosening up the enemy defenses first.
28,h6,h7h6,r1b2rk1/pppqnpp1/7p/6NQ/3PpB2/P1P1P3/5PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 0 15,Forced.
29,Nxe4,g5e4,r1b2rk1/pppqnpp1/7p/7Q/3PNB2/P1P1P3/5PPP/R3K2R b KQ - 0 15,"Now I pick up the pawn, and it hits me! f6 is brutally weak. Wouldn't my knight look pretty sitting there?"
30,Ng6,e7g6,r1b2rk1/pppq1pp1/6np/7Q/3PNB2/P1P1P3/5PPP/R3K2R w KQ - 1 16,"Still not developed, my opponent finishes what he started two moves ago, and gets a defender over."
31,Bxh6,f4h6,r1b2rk1/pppq1pp1/6nB/7Q/3PN3/P1P1P3/5PPP/R3K2R b KQ - 0 16,! I double dog dare black to accept this sac. (16...gxB 17. Nf6  with a Royal Fork.)
