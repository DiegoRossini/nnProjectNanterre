1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,My favorite defense against 1.d4. It's one of the most elastic openings in chess with a lot of theory to learn and in which White has a plethora of plans to chose from. I like it more than the KID because it's more dynamic and more fun to play.

8,Nxd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/6p1/3n4/3P4/2N5/PP2PPPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,"A strong prophylactic move, removing the Rook from a sensitive diagonal and pressuring b7, hampering the development of the Bc8."
