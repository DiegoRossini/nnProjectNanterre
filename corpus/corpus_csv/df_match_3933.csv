1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,So he starts conventionally
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,I play my usual
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/3PP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,He opts for open variations.
4,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3pP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,I take
5,c3,c2c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/8/3pP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,"And he plays the Morra Gambit, offering a pawn for speedy development."
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/8/3pP3/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,"Following a suggestion by Leonard Barden and Tim Harding. Also partly as a result of being beaten too many times on the black side of this at Sheffield University by Peter Large. It is quite acceptable to take to pawn however, if black follows it up correctly."
7,e5,e4e5,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/5n2/4P3/3p4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,This is about the only sensible move here.
8,Nd5,f6d5,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/8/3nP3/3p4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,And so too for black
9,Qxd4,d1d4,rnbqkb1r/pp1ppppp/8/3nP3/3Q4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"This is a bit unusual, more normal is cxd4"
10,e6,e7e6,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4p3/3nP3/3Q4/2P5/PP3PPP/RNB1KBNR w KQkq - 0 6,So I have to protect my knight of course.
11,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/4p3/3nP3/3Q4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 1 6,He develops his knight
12,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/3nP3/3Q4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 2 7,"So do I, hitting his queen"
13,Qe4,d4e4,r1bqkb1r/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/3nP3/4Q3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R b KQkq - 3 7,"The queen takes up a central location. For the first time in the game I had a good think. I remembered a game from my university days where I continued with f5, but it seemed to me that f5 left my d pawn backwards, and if I later played d6 or d5 to stop it bein backward, he could just play e5xd6 and my e pawn was backward. I didn't want to leave his e5 pawn unmolested, it could form the basis of a king side attack. Why not play d6 now? Yes that's what I'll play. Now according to Harding and Barden, ""Black can equalise with Taimanov's 7....f5"". I did find out later that f5 does score better for black, and is more popular, although d6 also scores well for black."
14,d6,d7d6,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2npp3/3nP3/4Q3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNB1KB1R w KQkq - 0 8,So d6 it was
15,Bb5,f1b5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2npp3/1B1nP3/4Q3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 1 8,Pinning my knight.
16,Bd7,c8d7,r2qkb1r/pp1b1ppp/2npp3/1B1nP3/4Q3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 2 9,"Breaking the pin. I am threatening Nxe5 here, so he finds another threat."
17,c4,c3c4,r2qkb1r/pp1b1ppp/2npp3/1B1nP3/2P1Q3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 9,Hitting my knight
18,Nc7,d5c7,r2qkb1r/ppnb1ppp/2npp3/1B2P3/2P1Q3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 1 10,Introducing possibilities of taking on b5
19,exd6,e5d6,r2qkb1r/ppnb1ppp/2nPp3/1B6/2P1Q3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R b KQkq - 0 10,He takes
20,Bxd6,f8d6,r2qk2r/ppnb1ppp/2nbp3/1B6/2P1Q3/5N2/PP3PPP/RNB1K2R w KQkq - 0 11,I take
