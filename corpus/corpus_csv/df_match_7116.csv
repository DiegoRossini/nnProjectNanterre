1,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/3P4/8/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,I fluctuate between 3. e3 and 3. Nf3 on occasion and decided on a more passive game in this instance.

6,Bb4+,f8b4,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/1bPP4/4P3/PP3PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 4,This apparently is associated with the Ragozin Variation but I'm not sure it is such a good idea with white's dark squared Bishop still on the queenside of the board.
7,Bd2,c1d2,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/1bPP4/4P3/PP1B1PPP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq - 2 4,I have to think this exchange favors white because the dark squared Bishop for black was a strong piece but white's was trapped behind a pawn wall for quite some time to come.
8,Bxd2+,b4d2,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/4P3/PP1b1PPP/RN1QKBNR w KQkq - 0 5,I have to think this exchange favors white because the dark squared Bishop for black was a strong piece but white's was trapped behind a pawn wall for quite some time to come.
9,Qxd2,d1d2,rnbqk1nr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/2PP4/4P3/PP1Q1PPP/RN2KBNR b KQkq - 0 5,I have to think this exchange favors white because the dark squared Bishop for black was a strong piece but white's was trapped behind a pawn wall for quite some time to come.
10,a6,a7a6,rnbqk1nr/1pp2ppp/p3p3/3p4/2PP4/4P3/PP1Q1PPP/RN2KBNR w KQkq - 0 6,I'm not sure the purpose of this move as I'm a couple of moves away from getting a piece towards the b5 square although perhaps the plan was 6. ... b5
11,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqk1nr/1pp2ppp/p3p3/3p4/2PP4/4PN2/PP1Q1PPP/RN2KB1R b KQkq - 1 6,Another move that didn't seem to accomplish a great deal to me unless Black is planning on a longside castle which does actually happen in the game continuation.
12,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk1nr/1pp2ppp/p1n1p3/3p4/2PP4/4PN2/PP1Q1PPP/RN2KB1R w KQkq - 2 7,Another move that didn't seem to accomplish a great deal to me unless Black is planning on a longside castle which does actually happen in the game continuation.
13,Bd3,f1d3,r1bqk1nr/1pp2ppp/p1n1p3/3p4/2PP4/3BPN2/PP1Q1PPP/RN2K2R b KQkq - 3 7,Another move that didn't seem to accomplish a great deal to me unless Black is planning on a longside castle which does actually happen in the game continuation.

15,O-O,e1g1,r2qk1nr/1ppb1ppp/p1n1p3/3p4/2PP4/3BPN2/PP1Q1PPP/RN3RK1 b kq - 5 8,The white knight might eventually make it onto the g5 square but if Black is going for a longside castle I don't think it is such a great outpost so I thought this was a further unnecessary delay of development.
16,h6,h7h6,r2qk1nr/1ppb1pp1/p1n1p2p/3p4/2PP4/3BPN2/PP1Q1PPP/RN3RK1 w kq - 0 9,The white knight might eventually make it onto the g5 square but if Black is going for a longside castle I don't think it is such a great outpost so I thought this was a further unnecessary delay of development.

18,Nf6,g8f6,r2qk2r/1ppb1pp1/p1n1pn1p/3p4/2PP4/1P1BPN2/P2Q1PPP/RN3RK1 w kq - 1 10,Now I suspected a longside castle is coming which I think might be a mistake as my queenside development is already fairly advanced
19,Nc3,b1c3,r2qk2r/1ppb1pp1/p1n1pn1p/3p4/2PP4/1PNBPN2/P2Q1PPP/R4RK1 b kq - 2 10,Now I suspected a longside castle is coming which I think might be a mistake as my queenside development is already fairly advanced

22,Nxe5,c6e5,r3k2r/1ppbqpp1/p3pn1p/3pn3/2PP4/1PNBP3/P2Q1PPP/R4RK1 w kq - 0 12,11. ... Bc8 12. Nxc6 bxc6 doesn't seem good for Black and anything else results in losing the light squared Bishop in an exchange.
23,dxe5,d4e5,r3k2r/1ppbqpp1/p3pn1p/3pP3/2P5/1PNBP3/P2Q1PPP/R4RK1 b kq - 0 12,12. ... Ng4 13. h3 traps the Knight but this is obviously not such a great square for the Knight.
24,Ng8,f6g8,r3k1nr/1ppbqpp1/p3p2p/3pP3/2P5/1PNBP3/P2Q1PPP/R4RK1 w kq - 1 13,12. ... Ng4 13. h3 traps the Knight but this is obviously not such a great square for the Knight.
25,cxd5,c4d5,r3k1nr/1ppbqpp1/p3p2p/3PP3/8/1PNBP3/P2Q1PPP/R4RK1 b kq - 0 13,While the game continuation leaves the even material I thought this kept up the pressure on Black and frees up my light squared Bishop a bit
26,exd5,e6d5,r3k1nr/1ppbqpp1/p6p/3pP3/8/1PNBP3/P2Q1PPP/R4RK1 w kq - 0 14,Anything else results in 14. d6 forcing an exchange and undoubling my pawns.

30,O-O-O,e8c8,2kr2nr/1ppb1pp1/p6p/Q2Nq3/8/1P1BP3/P4PPP/R4RK1 w - - 2 16,This is a mistake and overlooks the game continuation.  Clearly better is 15. ... b6 16. Qc3 Qxd5 17. Qxg7 Qxd3 18. Qxh8 which leads to a very interesting game. Also possible is 15. ... Rc8 and 15. ... Kd8 both of which also lead to fairly even games although White has a developmental advantage.
