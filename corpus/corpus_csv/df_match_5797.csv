1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,He played e4 and i responded with the Sicilian.
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,He played e4 and i responded with the Sicilian.
3,c3,c2c3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,Alapin variation. This leads to an equal position if black knows this variation which i did.
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/4P3/2P5/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,so i responded with e6.
5,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/4p3/2p5/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,further prepearing d4
6,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/4P3/2P2N2/PP1P1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,further controlling d4 square.
7,d4,d2d4,r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/3PP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,and now after d4
8,d5,d7d5,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2pp4/3PP3/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 5,i played d5. And we see what i have prepeared for Alapin variation. If you like sicilian but often run into 2.c3 this is a way of playing against it. there are of course other kind of setups black can play too.
9,e5,e4e5,r1bqkbnr/pp3ppp/2n1p3/2ppP3/3P4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 5,he decided to transpose this into some sort of a french defense. Fortunately i have experience playing the french as black.
10,Nge7,g8e7,r1bqkb1r/pp2nppp/2n1p3/2ppP3/3P4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 6,Qb6 works here too. But my idea is developing the minor pieces more quckly. The point of this move is that now the knight can go to g6 or f5 (rather f5 and have a nice outpost over there).
11,Bd3,f1d3,r1bqkb1r/pp2nppp/2n1p3/2ppP3/3P4/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 2 6,just prepearing to castle.
12,cxd4,c5d4,r1bqkb1r/pp2nppp/2n1p3/3pP3/3p4/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 7,I'd like to remind you that i was playing with only 2 minutes on the clock and i decided therefor to take the pawn right now. I should have perhaps delayed it a move or so.
13,O-O,e1g1,r1bqkb1r/pp2nppp/2n1p3/3pP3/3p4/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 1 7,0-0?! offering a gambit. In return he will develop his knight to c3 and there will be no d4 pawn to constantly defend.
14,Nf5,e7f5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1p3/3pPn2/3p4/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 2 8,my previous comment was what was running through my head at the moment. But perhaps i should have taken the pawn. His e-pawn isnt defended by an other pawn. A new target and i can play d4 at the right moment. But i had only 2 seconds to think and decided that he wants me to take on c3 so instead i played the knight to f5. f5 is a nice outpost for the knight because once he takes back on d4 the knight will give pressure on d4. This move also frees my BSB.
15,Bxf5,d3f5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1p3/3pPB2/3p4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 8,This looks very similar to a main line in the french defense Advanced variation.
16,exf5,e6f5,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n5/3pPp2/3p4/2P2N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 0 9,He finally decided to take back the pawn.
17,cxd4,c3d4,r1bqkb1r/pp3ppp/2n5/3pPp2/3P4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 b kq - 0 9,He finally decided to take back the pawn.
18,Be6,c8e6,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1b3/3pPp2/3P4/5N2/PP3PPP/RNBQ1RK1 w kq - 1 10,After Be6 this looks just like that main line in the advanced with white taking on f5 surrendering his bishop pair. This could be proven to be a long-termed weakness which i seek to exploit.
19,Nc3,b1c3,r2qkb1r/pp3ppp/2n1b3/3pPp2/3P4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 b kq - 2 10,Both players are developing. Im prepearing to castle.
20,Be7,f8e7,r2qk2r/pp2bppp/2n1b3/3pPp2/3P4/2N2N2/PP3PPP/R1BQ1RK1 w kq - 3 11,Both players are developing. Im prepearing to castle.
21,Be3,c1e3,r2qk2r/pp2bppp/2n1b3/3pPp2/3P4/2N1BN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 b kq - 4 11,I think the main line goes Bf4 instead. Im not sure though it was a while since i looked it up.
22,O-O,e8g8,r2q1rk1/pp2bppp/2n1b3/3pPp2/3P4/2N1BN2/PP3PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 5 12,I was not sure what the point of this move was. Sure he had only 2 seconds to think but then play Rc1 or something else instead. i think the knight was well posted on f3.
23,Nd2,f3d2,r2q1rk1/pp2bppp/2n1b3/3pPp2/3P4/2N1B3/PP1N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 b - - 6 12,I was not sure what the point of this move was. Sure he had only 2 seconds to think but then play Rc1 or something else instead. i think the knight was well posted on f3.
24,Bg5,e7g5,r2q1rk1/pp3ppp/2n1b3/3pPpb1/3P4/2N1B3/PP1N1PPP/R2Q1RK1 w - - 7 13,the point is that i wanted to exchange my passive bishop for his active.
