25,Nd3,e5d3,rn5r/ppp2pp1/4bk1p/8/4Pb2/2NN4/PPP3PP/1K1R1B1R b - - 1 13,"? Slightly uncertain.  The idea of countering an attack on the bishop with one on the rook is fine, but after 14. Nxf4 Bxd1 15.

Be5 was better, offering a trade, or Bd6, a less active but more secure post that retains the useful bishop pair."
