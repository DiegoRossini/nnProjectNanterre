This is just poor calculation. The game could have gone on for another 20 moves...white is still a pawn up, so if the material is traded down to nothing, I am theoretically on the losing side. 

Still, I am well placed, if I may say so - the bishop is using the outpost I created 28 moves ago- the rook owns the g file - the queen owns the h file - and even the poor little d7 bishop (who, only moved once in a 46 move game) is doing his part to block the mean lady from squeezing out some kind of draw."
