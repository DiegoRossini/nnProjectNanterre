1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,My first game here at GameKnot against a stranger that left me we the opinion that there are people out there who really can't work with their queen and king.He created an opening for me and left me execute a plan I never had thoughts about.I wanted all my games here to be a lesson for me.I guess this is the first one.Thank you for having me.For post game analysis see  http://gameknot.com/analyze-board.pl?bd=17962790&fb=1&rnd=0.4623998647473022
