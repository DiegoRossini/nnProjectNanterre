1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,I've analysed this game in two parts. The first my feelings and observations during and just after  the game and in the second part engine assisted annotations(EA).
2,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,The Wade variation an opening in which my opponent is expert in.
3,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/3P4/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,The Wade variation an opening in which my opponent is expert in.

5,e4,e2e4,rn1qkbnr/ppp1pppp/3p4/8/3PP1b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,3.c4 is a major alternative line which after3.... Bxf3 4. exf3 leads to an imbalance in the position. Though theory and the silicon monster give white a reasonable plus my opponent has too often clawed his way to an advantage in the middlegame/endgame where his q-side majority has the final say.
6,e6,e7e6,rn1qkbnr/ppp2ppp/3pp3/8/3PP1b1/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,book and I believe Svidler may have played it but I feel it just hands white the add.I prefer 3.....Nbd7 preparing either c4 or e4
