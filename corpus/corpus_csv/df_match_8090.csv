1,b4,b2b4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/1P6/8/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,Polish opening (did Mr. Topalov want to show off? ;-))
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/1P6/8/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,"(not Nf6 or e5 ?) I wonder if computers would understand this game, lol."
3,a4,a2a4,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/PP6/8/2PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 2,(not Nf3 or c3?). the whole game will go mad ;-)
4,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/PP6/8/2PPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 3,why not open the center (e5 or Nf6..). so far one would think this is an amateur game.
5,f4,f2f4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/8/2pp4/PP3P2/8/2PPP1PP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 3,and an other odd move. not bXc5 or b5?
6,b5,b7b5,rnbqkbnr/p3pppp/8/1ppp4/PP3P2/8/2PPP1PP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 4,here I think black could have played cxb4 or e6.
