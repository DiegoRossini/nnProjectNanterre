17,cxd4,c3d4,r1bq1rk1/pp1nppbp/3p1np1/8/3PPBP1/5N1P/PP1N1P2/R2QKB1R b KQ - 0 9,"At this point, the only play I analyzed was the apparently good 9. ..., Qb6, with a threat and a half over my pawns. I have many possible responses, here. 

10. Qb3 fails to QxQ. 
10. Qc2 seems normal, ok. 

Then, the nice ones: 
10. d5.
10. e5. 
10. Nc4. 

Now, this is what I like from chess: in 2 moves, we have transformed an apparently normal opening, in a highly tactical game. 
I have to consider all possible move from black, including knight f6's sacrifice, in order to be sure. 

10. d5, apparently, opens the way to the bishop. But if the bishop takes b2, Rb1 is strong, and if 10. ..., Qxb2, 11. Nc4 puts the black queen in troubles, that white can take advantage of with more developement (and to counterarrest the threat on the black diagonal). The queen's check Qb4 is good for me, since Bd2 closes the net, and if Qb5, Nxd6 must be considered... all very long variants. And, beside, I have to think about Nxd6!?, but I have to bet I'll never would have to take the bishop, of course (not to let his rooks to come into the game). I found it good in all variants, but still it is very dangerous. 

10. e5. The best response for black is Nd5. I analyzed dxe, dxe, and it doesn't seem to make a great difference. Not sure. Ok, let's say Nd5.
11. Nc4, and the black queen must retire. The lines from Qb4+ or Qb5 are very similar to the ones seen before, but again, they are a lot of variant and I cannot be sure all my analysis is correct. 
Then, the other possible moves are Qc7 (I would have played Rc1 inmediately), or Qd8. And this cannot be good for black. I analyzed so many variants here... but it's ok for me. 

Ok, but since Nc4 is played in both variants, why not to play it right now?
10. Nc4.
Now, themes are similar to the previous, but I don't have to cope with Nd5, with a bothering threat over my bishop. So, this is the move. 

But I can say it now, not at the moment I made the play. All this was just a jungle in my mind... :-)

I've set a conditional move, here, and I don't remember by now which it is, so I hope I have played the last one, Nc4."
