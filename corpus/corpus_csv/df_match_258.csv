I just have to be sure the exchange leaves an edge to me. And this is not QxQ (I'll have pressure on e6, but not all that definitive. I can get more from this). If Bxf5, after the Q's exchange he'll be able to play Bc5, getting strong pressure... but I sensed it was handable, with his K so weakly placed. I couldn't caculate, of course. I had to trust on my ""nose""."
