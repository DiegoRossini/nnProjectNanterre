1,c4,c2c4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"? c6 seems a stronger reply, followed with d5 and asserting some control of the centre. Continuing from the text move, Black might be considering c5 or e5 shortly."
2,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2P5/8/PP1PPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 1 2,"? c6 seems a stronger reply, followed with d5 and asserting some control of the centre. Continuing from the text move, Black might be considering c5 or e5 shortly."
3,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pppppppp/5n2/8/2P5/2N5/PP1PPPPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 2 2,"? c6 seems a stronger reply, followed with d5 and asserting some control of the centre. Continuing from the text move, Black might be considering c5 or e5 shortly."

7,e4,e2e4,rnbqkb1r/ppp1pp1p/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 4,"? This seems out of step with Black's defence some how, better might be to continue c5, or e5 to prevent White's e5."
8,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPP3/2N5/PP3PPP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 5,"? This seems out of step with Black's defence some how, better might be to continue c5, or e5 to prevent White's e5."
9,f4,f2f4,rnbqk2r/ppp1ppbp/3p1np1/8/2PPPP2/2N5/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 5,"Common is Knf3 instead, the text is playable but not favoured."
10,Na6,b8a6,r1bqk2r/ppp1ppbp/n2p1np1/8/2PPPP2/2N5/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 6,"Non-standard, but seen in H Rob Evan der Plas vs Valery Vladimirovich Pankratov 1996 ending in a draw.  More usual is ..0-0.  I find the text move too passive: it achieves some development, but apparently for its own sake."
11,e5,e4e5,r1bqk2r/ppp1ppbp/n2p1np1/4P3/2PP1P2/2N5/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 6,! Direct.
12,dxe5,d6e5,r1bqk2r/ppp1ppbp/n4np1/4p3/2PP1P2/2N5/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 0 7,"? Although it keeps Black's position open, this knight is hanging and will draw attention from White's pieces. White gains time in spades. Black might have considered instead Knh5 though best might be Knd7."
13,fxe5,f4e5,r1bqk2r/ppp1ppbp/n4np1/4P3/2PP4/2N5/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR b KQkq - 0 7,"? Although it keeps Black's position open, this knight is hanging and will draw attention from White's pieces. White gains time in spades. Black might have considered instead Knh5 though best might be Knd7."
14,Ng4,f6g4,r1bqk2r/ppp1ppbp/n5p1/4P3/2PP2n1/2N5/PP4PP/R1BQKBNR w KQkq - 1 8,"? Although it keeps Black's position open, this knight is hanging and will draw attention from White's pieces. White gains time in spades. Black might have considered instead Knh5 though best might be Knd7."
15,Be2,f1e2,r1bqk2r/ppp1ppbp/n5p1/4P3/2PP2n1/2N5/PP2B1PP/R1BQK1NR b KQkq - 2 8,"White is being allowed to dictate the shape of Black's defence, making him play some unwelcome moves. Even Knh6 instead would prove uncomfortable in a few moves."
16,h5,h7h5,r1bqk2r/ppp1ppb1/n5p1/4P2p/2PP2n1/2N5/PP2B1PP/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 0 9,"White is being allowed to dictate the shape of Black's defence, making him play some unwelcome moves. Even Knh6 instead would prove uncomfortable in a few moves."

18,Nh6,g4h6,r1bqk2r/ppp1ppb1/n5pn/4P2p/2PP4/2N4P/PP2B1P1/R1BQK1NR w KQkq - 1 10,"One of few options for the knight, but again unwelcome -- he'll have to move again once White develops his black square bishop and his Queen to d2.  Possibly worthy of consideration is the energetic ..Knxe5 instead."
19,Bf4,c1f4,r1bqk2r/ppp1ppb1/n5pn/4P2p/2PP1B2/2N4P/PP2B1P1/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 2 10,"Not a bad place for Black's knight, but it has come at some cost in time -- 3 of the last 4 moves by Black have involved this piece alone! In any case White would otherwise follow with Qd2, threatening to win a piece. Black's knight would have to move again or be supported, costing more time."
20,Nf5,h6f5,r1bqk2r/ppp1ppb1/n5p1/4Pn1p/2PP1B2/2N4P/PP2B1P1/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 3 11,"Not a bad place for Black's knight, but it has come at some cost in time -- 3 of the last 4 moves by Black have involved this piece alone!

21,d5,d4d5,r1bqk2r/ppp1ppb1/n5p1/3PPn1p/2P2B2/2N4P/PP2B1P1/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 0 11,"Largely forced -- White's centre would crumble on the loss of this pawn, advancing finds safety and pressure. Note if Black had considered say c6 earlier, this move would not hold nearly the same strength."
22,Nc5,a6c5,r1bqk2r/ppp1ppb1/6p1/2nPPn1p/2P2B2/2N4P/PP2B1P1/R2QK1NR w KQkq - 1 12,"? Again, this is a good square for a knight but it has come at some cost -- the text is fairly premature as it's not clear what this move achieves, Black could have done this later, and it does nothing about White's advance.  Black's development is on the slow side.  Better might be ..e6."
23,g4,g2g4,r1bqk2r/ppp1ppb1/6p1/2nPPn1p/2P2BP1/2N4P/PP2B3/R2QK1NR b KQkq - 0 12,! White continues to cramp Black without hesitation.

After sidestepping to d1 -- on the way to relative safety -- it remains a task for Black to find a way in, while still leaving enough time to protect his own King. This move was anticipated by White's 14. Qd2."
29,Kd1,e1d1,r1b1k2r/ppp2pb1/4p1p1/2nPPn2/2P2BBq/2N4P/PP1Q4/R2K2NR b kq - 3 15,"?! This came as a surprise to White. The only impression I can make is that Black, in making this sacrifice, is going straight for White's King.  However, I'm also of the opinion that this is a blunder by Black as the text will show -- he should note that, upon winning White's h-rook, the key square h2 is covered by White's black square bishop and his Queen. Moreover, when the White King moves again, to c2, White's knight is no longer vulnerable. There seems no way for Black to make good his loss (in this open position, his Queen counts for a lot). Further, Black has neglected his own development, giving up his active Queen while a bishop and rook are stuck at home. Last, even in this open position, I cannot see how Black will have the time to profit from the long h-file as the initiative stays with White."
30,Qxg4+,h4g4,r1b1k2r/ppp2pb1/4p1p1/2nPPn2/2P2Bq1/2N4P/PP1Q4/R2K2NR w kq - 0 16,"?! This came as a surprise to White.

Note, the key h2 square is very well protected, so White will retain the initiative unchecked, beginning with a fork on c7. That open h-file is not intimidating at all -- Black is not sufficiently developed to exploit it."
32,Rxh1,h8h1,r1b1k3/ppp2pb1/4p1p1/2nPPn2/2P2BP1/2N5/PP1Q4/R2K2Nr w q - 0 17,"! Protects the Knight, avails the rook, avoids a check, and finds safety.  A fine move.

35,Nb5,c3b5,r1b1k3/ppp1npb1/4p1p1/1NnPP3/2P2BP1/8/PPKQ4/R5Nr b q - 3 18,"! Aiming right at c7. Black's position is such that there is no satisfactory defence. It's at times like these, that one really needs that Queen.  What follows is just technique."
36,Na6,c5a6,r1b1k3/ppp1npb1/n3p1p1/1N1PP3/2P2BP1/8/PPKQ4/R5Nr w q - 4 19,"Somewhat forced, but still White is not prevented from playing Knxc7 immediately.  The alternatives don't look great either.  Placing the King on the d-file is not on, and Kf8 offers only temporary respite [White continues d5-d6, promising to place his Queen on d8 after any exchange]."
37,Nxc7+,b5c7,r1b1k3/ppN1npb1/n3p1p1/3PP3/2P2BP1/8/PPKQ4/R5Nr b q - 0 19,"! White will open up the d-file and prevent Black's king from finding safety, for a decisive endgame."
