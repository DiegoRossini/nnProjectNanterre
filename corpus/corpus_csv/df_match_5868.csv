1,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 1,The Nimzo Larsen starts like the Reti with Nf3
2,d5,d7d5,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/5N2/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 2,The reaction to occupy the center is the common response to it. Other options are Nf6 or even Nc6 :)
3,b3,b2b3,rnbqkbnr/ppp1pppp/8/3p4/8/1P3N2/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 2,And that's as far as the Gameknot Opening DB goes. However the next 3 moves are quite common in this opening and even played by higher rated players
4,e6,e7e6,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/8/1P3N2/P1PPPPPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"Everything until now is fine and quite common, that's where the fun begins."
5,Bb2,c1b2,rnbqkbnr/ppp2ppp/4p3/3p4/8/1P3N2/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 1 3,"Everything until now is fine and quite common, that's where the fun begins."
6,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/8/1P3N2/PBPPPPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 2 4,"Everything until now is fine and quite common, that's where the fun begins."
7,d3,d2d3,rnbqkb1r/ppp2ppp/4pn2/3p4/8/1P1P1N2/PBP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,"And this is the first ""mistake"" I did, because c4 is obviously stronger. Attacking the center, getting the pawns to point towards the kingside, actually I think I planned to do c4 as the next move, but apparently I didn't...

However, this move is still playable (as has been played by Certic, who did c4 as the next step and Fant, who went on with Nb1d2 before doing c4)."
8,Be7,f8e7,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/8/1P1P1N2/PBP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,"Now my position starts to get cramped, leaving the control over the board and the initative to black. A possible way to continue would be to fianchetto the second bishop ot build up bigger pressure on the center."
9,Nbd2,b1d2,rnbqk2r/ppp1bppp/4pn2/3p4/8/1P1P1N2/PBPNPPPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,"Now my position starts to get cramped, leaving the control over the board and the initative to black. A possible way to continue would be to fianchetto the second bishop ot build up bigger pressure on the center."
10,c5,c7c5,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/4pn2/2pp4/8/1P1P1N2/PBPNPPPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"Now my position starts to get cramped, leaving the control over the board and the initative to black. A possible way to continue would be to fianchetto the second bishop ot build up bigger pressure on the center."
11,e4,e2e4,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/4pn2/2pp4/4P3/1P1P1N2/PBPN1PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 6,White starts trying to break up the center to gain and advantage of it's development.
12,dxe4,d5e4,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/4pn2/2p5/4p3/1P1P1N2/PBPN1PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 0 7,Black actually takes the pawn and allows white to free its position. d4 would probably have been the most annoying reaction.
13,Nxe4,d2e4,rnbqk2r/pp2bppp/4pn2/2p5/4N3/1P1P1N2/PBP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"It would have probably been better to retake with the pawn, strenghening the center and of course setting the bishop free. this would have increased the development advantage of white even further."
14,Nbd7,b8d7,r1bqk2r/pp1nbppp/4pn2/2p5/4N3/1P1P1N2/PBP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,Preparing to castle and letting the rook on the half open d file such that the Queen can evantually be attacked.

After castling the pawn on c5 was easier to attack, since only the Bishop could have defended it. Now it's to late and still I try to attack."

Both knights are places in the center, I'm clearly ahead in development, black hasn't castled yet his bishops aren't well placed... But I had one big problem: I had no plan what I should be going to do..."
22,Bb7,c8b7,r2qk2r/pb1nbpp1/1p2pn1p/8/3NN3/1P6/PBP1QPPP/2KR1B1R w kq - 1 12,Black finally develops the light squared bishop and blocks Nc6 which could have gotten ugly...

26,Qe7,d8e7,r3k2r/pb1nqpp1/1p2pb1p/7Q/3N4/1P6/PBP2PPP/2KR1B1R w kq - 2 14,A nice chance given by black for white to get back into the game. 15. Bxf6 Nxf6 16. Qh4 ... and white can develop his bishop and start to get the second rook into play.
