It's also basically asymmetrical in nature, leading to dynamic, fluid positions with little chance of ending ending in a draw."

White's bishop on e5 is on the verge of being forced off e5, and when that happens Black would like nothing better than to post his bishop on d6. With his dsb on d6, Black will be in position to exert potentially fatal levels of pressure against White's underdeveloped kingside. But by forcing the bishop to move now, White prevents this. Black will either have to move his bishop off-line to a5, or waste a tempo in tucking it away on f8; if it moves to d6 immediately, White will simply exchange it."
