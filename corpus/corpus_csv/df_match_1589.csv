11,d4,d2d4,r1bqk1nr/ppppbppp/2n5/4p3/2BPP3/2P2N2/P4PPP/RNBQK2R b KQkq - 0 6,"I chose the most active continuation in what is now a rare, if not dead, opening. In a twisted way, White has surrendered a flank pawn (and isolated the a-pawn) in exchange for dominance in the centre of the board. This means that White must play positionally, or attempt to win materal back if this isn't possible. Common variations usually see a bishop on a3, a queen in b3, and the rooks firing ominously down the centre."
