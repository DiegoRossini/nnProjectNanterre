1,e4,e2e4,rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR b KQkq - 0 1,"1. e4 is considered best by test; but honestly, it is no better than 1. d4 or 1. c4.  Each of these moves lead to entirely different types of game.

The initial move of e4 usually leads to an open game that is generally highly tactical in nature.  If you are a good tactician, then this opening should be one of your favorite tools as white."
2,c5,c7c5,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 2,Sicilian
3,Nf3,g1f3,rnbqkbnr/pp1ppppp/8/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 2,"Normal response, but not the only one possible.  

An immediate 2. d4 stakes out the center and is already protected by the Queen.  Another good choice is 2. c3, but that can be a little tricky even though it is sound.  Some people like to try the bishop opening with 2. Bc4.  The bishop second move is a little less clear of a choice, but can be effective when used as a surprise weapon against an unprepared opponent."
4,d6,d7d6,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 3,"2. ... d6 is one of the most common responses by black.  It's primary purpose is to prevent e5 so that Black's knight can safely move to f6, not necessarily to support the pawn on c5.  

This is a traditional fight for control of the center.  Generally control of the square d5 is extremely important in the Sicilian.  Black must use incremental steps when contesting this square.  He must prepare before venturing."
5,d4,d2d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/2p5/3PP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 3,"This move opens lines for the Queen's bishop and immediately creates tension in the center.  The question is put to Black as to whether White retains the strong central pawns.

A strong central pawn duo is usually an immediate strategic goal for White in many openings.  Here White does not expect to keep it.  White is merely using it for transitional purposes."
6,cxd4,c5d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3pP3/5N2/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 0 4,3. ... cxd4 is the smart exchange.
7,Nxd4,f3d4,rnbqkbnr/pp2pppp/3p4/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 0 4,4. Nxd4 maintains material equilibrium while advancing the knight for possible further attack later in the game.
8,Nf6,g8f6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/8/PPP2PPP/RNBQKB1R w KQkq - 1 5,This was prepared for earlier by 2. ... d6.
9,Nc3,b1c3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pppp/3p1n2/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 2 5,5. Nc3 is necessary to protect the pawn on e4.
10,g6,g7g6,rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p1np1/8/3NP3/2N5/PPP2PPP/R1BQKB1R w KQkq - 0 6,"This is the signature move for the Dragon variation.  9 times out of 10, Black's next move will be Bg7 to complete the fianchetto.

White's next move is an important decision that will determine the flow the game."
11,Be3,c1e3,rnbqkb1r/pp2pp1p/3p1np1/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 1 6,"This helps clear the first rank for a possible queen-side castle, O-O-O.  Its draw back is the potential Ng4 by Black, attacking the bishop immediately.  The bishop is currently safe until the presumptive 6. ... Bg7.

If 6. ... Ng4, then 7. Bb5  and Black is in deep serious trouble.   Black has only four possible moves:  Nc6, Bd7, Nd7, and Qd7.  With Qd7, the bishop simply takes.  With Nc6, 8. Nxc6 bxc6 9. Bxc6  forking the King and Rook.  With either Bd7 or Nd7, White's Queen takes the knight on g4."
12,Bg7,f8g7,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/3NP3/2N1B3/PPP2PPP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 2 7,This move is almost routine.
13,f3,f2f3,rnbqk2r/pp2ppbp/3p1np1/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R b KQkq - 0 7,"This is the signature move for the Yugoslav Attack against the Dragon Variation. 

It prevents Black from moving his knight to g4, which would cause some minor problems for White.  It also frees the white knight on c3 from mandatory guard duty.  

Although it is not the only viable strategy, the Yugoslav Attack is considered White's best answer against the Dragon.  The 'motis operandi' is clear.  White will castle queen-side and push either the f, g, or h pawn - depending upon what Black does.  The h pawn sortie is a natural attack upon the King's fianchetto position.  Such an attack is usually effective with the proper timing."
14,Nc6,b8c6,r1bqk2r/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPP3PP/R2QKB1R w KQkq - 1 8,"This and the next few moves are normal, but their order can be slightly altered."
15,Qd2,d1d2,r1bqk2r/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3KB1R b KQkq - 2 8,"This Queen move is another attack upon the fianchetto position.  If Black wants to castle, he should do it now."
16,O-O,e8g8,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/R3KB1R w KQ - 3 9,The position is nearly ripe for an h pawn attack.  White should prepare further first.
17,O-O-O,e1c1,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2np1np1/8/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR1B1R b - - 4 9,"This was routine for me but was not main line.  The sharpest continuation would have been Bc4 before the castle.  Frankly, I've always gotten away with this move in the past.   It is very playable.  In hind sight, this move is probably not the best.  Yet, there is nothing particularly wrong with it either.

I was looking for a win instead of a draw.  This move carries the game in directions other than normal.

Normally, the sparks fly in this opening with opposite end attacks upon each others Kings.  The hunt for each others King becomes a race.  Timing is important.  The tactics can be mind bending!"
18,d5,d6d5,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2n2np1/3p4/3NP3/2N1BP2/PPPQ2PP/2KR1B1R w - - 0 10,"9. ... d5 is somewhat more common these days, but would have been considered unusual in the past.  Instead of developing other pieces, Black moves the pawn a second time during the opening.  Granted the opening is almost finished, but the thrust does not appear to be natural at first glance.  Appearances can be deceptive.

The move prevents the sharpest Yugoslav continuation of 10. Bc4 (with a slight move order change).  The most significant aspect of this move is that the natural response of 10. exd5 leads to a series of exchanges that White (wanting to win at all costs) would prefer not to occur.

I am one of those that used to think the Dragon Variation was fatally flawed.  Not anymore.   This  9. ... d5 variation is one reason why."
19,h4,h2h4,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2n2np1/3p4/3NP2P/2N1BP2/PPPQ2P1/2KR1B1R b - - 0 10,"I thought about 10. Kb1, but quickly dismissed it.  I thought about g4, but was uncomfortable with it.  I considered playing 10. exd5 again, but could not dismiss my dislike for settling for a draw against the Dragon after all the resulting exchanges (I guess it was a pride thing).

I decided to play thematic.  I'm used to applying my intuition in a given situation.  Unfortunately, I was wrong this time.  Since h4 against the Dragon usually works,  that's what I played.   

Perhaps h4 in of itself was not too bad...but I started the theme and continued it until I realized it was wrong.  

I should have known better.  The safe push of the pawn to d5 is often a significant strategic goal for Black in a number of Sicilian variations.  By playing h4 at this particular moment, I gave the pawn safe passage.  I should have played 10. exd5."
20,dxe4,d5e4,r1bq1rk1/pp2ppbp/2n2np1/8/3Np2P/2N1BP2/PPPQ2P1/2KR1B1R w - - 0 11,I kind of suspected this would happen and was hoping it would not.  Most people who played me in the past would likely initiate the thematic 10. ... h5 in response - which would have given me wiggle room to win the game.
